Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2015 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation.U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion or $3.1",701,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2015 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion or $3.16 per diluted common share. We achieved industry-leading profitability with a return on average assets of 1.44%, a return on average common equity of 14% and an efficiency ratio of 53.8% for the year.
Total average loans grew by 4.1% adjusted for student loans, and average deposits grew a strong 7.7% year-over-year. Credit quality continued to improve with a 12.1% decline in net charge-offs and a 15.8% decrease in nonperforming assets.
Our capital position remains strong and we returned $4 billion or 72% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during 2015.
Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights. U.S. Bank reported record revenue of $5.2 billion and net income of $1.5 billion or $0.80 per diluted common share, an increase of 1.3% year-over-year. The fourth quarter of 2015 included a gain from the sale of an HSA account deposit portfolio, which is partially offset by accruals related to legal and compliance matters, that combined, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.01. 
I'm very pleased this quarter with the momentum in our linked quarter loan growth, the continued strength of our payments business and the improvement in our operating leverage. Total average loans grew 1.7% linked quarter, adjusted for student loans, which exceeded the high end of our 1% to 1.5% range.
In addition, we continued to see strong growth in average deposits, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. Credit quality continued to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined on a year-over-year basis, and nonperforming assets declined on an linked-quarter basis as well.
Slide 5 provides you with the 5-quarter history of our performance metrics and we remain among the best in the industry.
Moving to the graph on the right. You can see that this quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was relatively stable, as expected, improving 2 basis points from the third quarter. This is primarily driven by higher loan growth, which reduced the amount of cash balances.
Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 53.9%, which was unchanged from quarter 3 and down from 54.3% a year ago. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to see the results of our expanded efficiency effort that we introduced last year, which includes prudent FTE management and a renewed interest in other discretionary spending. As I said earlier, I'm particularly please we were able to achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter, which reverses the trend of negative quarters over the past several quarters. I believe this positions us well as we move into 2016.
While prudent expense management remains a priority for our company, we also continued to focus on revenue growth and innovation, which means investing in those businesses and products that will provide strong returns.
During the quarter, we announced a new agreement with Fidelity Investments. U.S. Bank is now the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments Rewards Card program. As part of this arrangement, which closed at the end of 2015, we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion. This follows the announcement from last October about our card issuing partnership with the Auto Club Trust and the purchase of an existing $500 million portfolio. These agreements exemplify the strength of our payments business model and a continued commitment to strategic growth for our company.
Turning to Slide 6. The company reported record net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 0.8% increase from the prior year, which included core revenue growth and a gain on the sale of the HSA deposit portfolio, partially offset by the new gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily due to our growing balance sheet and growth in a number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments and trust businesses.
Kathy will now give you a few more detail about our fourth quarter results."
305304,318467799,918952,"U.S. Bancorp, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2016",2016-01-15,"Earnings Calls","U.S. Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Average loan growth and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion or 4.2% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter, adjusted for student loans. As you may recall, we renewed our",1308,"Thanks, Richard. 
Average loan growth and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion or 4.2% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter, adjusted for student loans. As you may recall, we renewed our student loans portfolio to held for sale in the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently returned it to held for investment during the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9% and 2.5% linked quarter, the strongest linked quarter growth as seen in 2015. Line utilization however, remains relatively consistent with the previous quarter and flat year-over-year.
Consumer loans again showed positive momentum led by credit card and auto loans. Average credit cards increased 4.7% year-over-year and 5% on a linked-quarter basis, which included the acquisition of approximately $500 million auto loan portfolio at the end of quarter 3. Auto loan growth remained strong, up 13% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. 
Residential mortgages grew 2.1% year-over-year, reversing a declining trend over the last several quarters, and rose 2.2% on an linked-quarter basis. We currently expect total average linked quarter loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range in quarter 1. 
Total average deposits increased $19 billion or 6.9% over the same quarter of last year and 1.7% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in noninterest bearing and low interest checking, money market and savings deposits to remain strong on a year-over-year basis and continued to more than offset the runoff of maturing larger dollar time deposit.
Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 1% on a year-over-year basis and increased 4.5% on an linked-quarter basis primarily due to lower recovery. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the third quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased by 2.8% on a linked-quarter basis and 15.8% over the fourth quarter of 2014.
The fourth quarter provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs, which compares to a release of reserves of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2015. As we move into 2016, we would expect that reserves will begin to build the support loan growth.
Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2016.
Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results versus comparable time periods. As I mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.80 includes $0.01 related to net impact of a sale of our HSA deposit portfolio, partially offset by accruals related to the legal and compliance matters.
Fourth quarter net income decreased $12 million or 0.8% year-over-year. This is principally due to a higher provision for credit losses, increase in net interest income, primarily driven by growth in earning assets, lower noninterest income impacted by the 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by increases in payments related revenue, trust and investment management fees and the HSA deposit sale gain.
On a linked-quarter basis, net income was lower by $13 million or 0.9% mainly due to predicted seasonal increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net revenue primarily due to loan growth.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $72 million or 2.6%. The increase was the result of growth in average earning asset of 5.1%, partially offset by lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 8 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to a change in loan portfolio mix as well as the growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates and lower reinvestment rates.
Net interest income increased $50 million on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loan. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 2 basis points higher than the third quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was principally due to higher loan growth, which resulted in lower cash balances. We currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the first quarter.
Slide 11 highlights noninterest income, which decreased $30 million or 1.3% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the impact of a 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by fee revenue growth and the HSA deposit sale gain. Higher credit and debit card revenue, trust and investment management fees and merchant processing services were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activity.
Momentum on our payments business as reflected in our fourth quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 8.1% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volumes, which were up 6% compared to 5.2% in quarter 3. Merchant processing revenue increased 2.3% year-over-year and approximately 6.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth and equates sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirements. These equipment sales were modestly lower than the recognized in quarter 3 as expected.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $14 million or 0.6%, principally due to seasonally higher credit card and debit card revenue and the HSA deposit sale gain, partially offset by lower corporate payment product revenue reflecting the seasonally higher quarter 3 government related transaction volumes. Mortgage banking revenue was also lower as expected, primarily due to seasonally lower origination revenue. We would expect that fee revenue in quarter 1 will be seasonally lower on a quarter-on-quarter basis -- linked-quarter basis.
Moving to slide 12. Non-interest expense was essentially flat year-over-year. Higher compensation expense which reflected impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities, along with higher employee benefit expense driven by pension costs, was slightly offset by lower marketing and business development expenses principally due to charitable contributions recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower other expense reflecting the net year-over-year impact of legal accruals.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $34 million or 1.2% as predicted, reflecting seasonally higher costs related to investments and tax advantaged projects and accruals related to legal and compliance matters, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced mortgage related compliance and talent upgrade costs, which were elevated in quarter 3 and declined as expected in quarter 4.
Compensation expense declined reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives and declines in variable compensation. Employee benefits expense also declined driven by lower payroll tax expense and health care costs.
We would expect expenses to be relatively stable in quarter 1 compared to quarter 4. Seasonally higher benefits expense will be offset by the seasonally lower tax credit amortization and the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition.
Turning to Slide 13. As Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong. We returned 61% of our earnings to shareholders during the quarter. Dividends accounted for 32%, while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining 29%.
For the full year, we returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders and we expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward. 
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, is fully implemented as December 31 was 9.1%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement.
Our tangible book value per share rose to 17 44 at December 31, representing a 9.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.4% increase over the prior quarter.
I Will now turn the call back to Richard."

First of all, [indiscernible] that question, I was thinking this morning, we are a classic American bank. We do primarily business in the domestic United States, and we're very much a consumer small business payments kind of a company. So despite what's going on in the backdrop around the world with the China reevaluation and what's happening in oil and some of those areas, which we're not immune to, [indiscernible] purposes we're not seeing the majority of that on our books or by our customers. So we're actually seeing a continued steady, I'll say, slow but steady improvement every quarter, and our customers reflecting that across the board from the large corporate customers, who are still doing robust M&A transactions to restructuring their portfolio, all the way down to the small businesses, which continue to grow, for us double digits, based on their interest and setting themselves up for better consumer rate of recovery and just in general, people who are using banks for their retail services. So I'm quite optimistic and I guess, the negative backdrop, and I know we won't be immune to all of that. But based on our geography, based on our mix of our business, based on our history and based on our appetite, the risk, I think, we're actually fairly immune for most of those issues at this stage, and we'll stress test for the worst case scenarios that will, of course, affect us. So I would say, across the board from a lending perspective that same range you've seen the 1% and 1.5% we're predicting again for this quarter already off to a really nice start. And we're not seeing any disruption, neither from the 25 basis point increase, which we knew will be more symbolic and actually not yet from the impacts of the stock market or the China reevaluation. So at this point, we're remaining optimistic in a cautious and careful way."

You're talking about what kind of assumptions we'd have in our plan and we actually expected to have 2 rate increases from the last time I talked to you. We hoped for 1 in December, we expect 1 in June. And that's really the amount of the risk we're placing to our plan this year. So we're halfway with 1 of them, at least at this point if it sticks. So that alone does actually help us, but we're not relying on that to the very point you made. But most importantly, it happened to us, it's just a continue improved recovering economy where people feel they can consume. Our people feel they don't have to save quite as much and that they've got a higher backstop even in their own savings account or in their home equity or in their own debt positions where they can start spending money and feel more comfortable about it, that's going to be huge for us. That's way more important than net interest rate because as I said earlier, we're a consumer middle market, wholesale bank and those are the things that matter the most. But I wanted to say the things that we'll put our shoulder against to watch for improvement this year, one will be the continued success we're having in relationship management with our customers. I think I've said this before, but we're developing a much smarter technology around who our customers are, what they expect, what their likely next needs are, particularly around the mobile banking aspect. So we're investing a great deal of money in time. And in this whole efficiency program, you never heard me take anything away from our investment and innovation and entrepreneurship, and we're not because I do believe that's going to be the next big idea. So having a payments business and a bank connected together, we have the best of both worlds because we test virtually any paradigm, buyer, seller and moving money back and forth. So that's our number  1, we're going to lean on the bank and the payments businesses that's coming together. Number 2, the corporate trust business has been remarkably good for us. It doesn't get a lot of visibility, its confusing for a lot of people but we're not only domestically quite large and capable. But when you start thinking about our that's editable across the pond over in Europe, but both our funds administration and our classic corporate trust, we're going to expect a lot from those 2 businesses as well in 2016. And finally, I'll say, the next chapter in our wholesale bank becoming -- we've moved out the audition stage and we're now bona fide one of the most important banks to deal with the large Fortune 100 companies, anything from an M&A deal to first lead on a deal, to just moving money on a very sophisticated way. We are continuously moving in there. I'm quite proud of what the wholesale commercial banks done. We are celebrating Dick Reiten's retirement this quarter, and we're also celebrating the addition of 2 new leaders coming up from within the company to run the wholesale bank and the capital markets, and I expect a lot from the 2 of them and they've got the capability, energy to pick up where Dick has left, which is really a good starting point. So I would say those 3 thanks, Erika, answers your question."

So the answer I'll give you, Matt, first and foremost is what you see we've got done is we wanted to do more up. So you saw these 2 fairly large portfolios in the card business that we continue to be attracted toward. These are picking portfolios that are already have momentum, they're picking up a high-quality portfolio that's at least as good if not better than one we have at the prime level, and we're finding more and more people interested in allowing us to take a look at that. So I hope there will be more of those. We've talked before our merchant acquiring business and we couple that together with over last now 15 years is to find a partner, work with them on a JV kind of a basis with the rent-to-own sense and there's more of that  in Europe that we're continuing to look at and hopefully, opportunities in that regard as well. And then finally, the more classic kind of opportunities I talked about innovation, and there maybe some small businesses, some small companies, some small garage deals that we might find where we want to bring capability in house and not outsource it. And if those come along at the right price at the right moment, we'll also not hesitate there. As it relates to full bank acquisitions and interests, our interest remains exactly what it was, we don't have a high interest and there's no one knocking on our door. And yet, at the same time, it's a good thing because given the consent order that we entered into in October, we wouldn't be allowed to do a full bank acquisition and selling through and pass that [indiscernible], which we're moving swiftly along and actually have been predicting that we can move that as swiftly as anyone ever has. So we are well aware that at that point in time, we want to advise them where we want to be past that point and our goal is to be there.

That, at least, elegantly is wind up with our current moment where we can't do it anyway but we don't want to anyway, and I wouldn't be interested -- if pricing doesn't change, you can't get a good enough deal if you don't know what you're getting.

I mean, much of this is attractive to have the wallpaper behind me and somebody else shaking hands, it's really not necessary for this company. We are in every business line that we're in that we want, we're not in everything we don't want to be in. If we do, we sell it like the HSA deposit business. And we don't covet anything we don't have.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2015 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation.U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion or $3.1",702,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2015 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion or $3.16 per diluted common share. We achieved industry-leading profitability with a return on average assets of 1.44%, a return on average common equity of 14% and an efficiency ratio of 53.8% for the year.
Total average loans grew by 4.1% adjusted for student loans, and average deposits grew a strong 7.7% year-over-year. Credit quality continued to improve with a 12.1% decline in net charge-offs and a 15.8% decrease in nonperforming assets.
Our capital position remains strong and we returned $4 billion or 72% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during 2015.
Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights. U.S. Bank reported record revenue of $5.2 billion and net income of $1.5 billion or $0.80 per diluted common share, an increase of 1.3% year-over-year. The fourth quarter of 2015 included a gain from the sale of an HSA account deposit portfolio, which is partially offset by accruals related to legal and compliance matters that combined, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.01. 
I'm very pleased this quarter with the momentum in our linked quarter loan growth, the continued strength of our payments business and the improvement in our operating leverage. Total average loans grew 1.7% linked quarter, adjusted for student loans, which exceeded the high end of our 1% to 1.5% range.
In addition, we continue to see strong growth in average deposits, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. Credit quality continue to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined on a year-over-year basis, and nonperforming assets declined on a linked-quarter basis as well. Slide 5 provides you with the 5-quarter history of our performance metrics and we remain among the best in the industry.
Moving to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was relatively stable, as expected, improving 2 basis points from the third quarter. This is primarily driven by higher loan growth, which reduced the amount of cash balances.
Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 53.9%, which was unchanged from quarter 3 and down from 54.3% a year ago. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to see the results of our expanded efficiency effort that we introduced last year, which includes prudent FTE management and a renewed emphasis on other discretionary spending. As I said earlier, I'm particularly pleased that we were able to achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter, which reverses the trend of negative leverage over the past several quarters. I believe this positions us well as we move into 2016.
While prudent expense management remains a priority for our company, we also continue to focus on revenue growth and innovation, which means investing in those businesses and products that will provide strong returns.
During the quarter, we announced a new agreement with Fidelity Investments. U.S. Bank is now the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments Rewards card program. As part of this arrangement, which closed at the end of 2015, we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion. This follows the announcement from last October about our card issuing partnership with the Auto Club Trust and the purchase of an existing $500 million portfolio. These agreements exemplify the strength of our payments business model and a continued commitment to strategic growth for our company.
Turning to Slide 6. The company reported record net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 0.8% increase from the prior year, which included core revenue growth and a gain on the sale of the HSA deposit portfolio, partially offset by the Nuveen gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily due to our growing balance sheet and growth in a number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments and trust businesses.
Kathy will now give you a few more detail about our fourth quarter results."

Average loan growth and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion or 4.2% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter, adjusted for student loans. As you may recall, we renewed our student loans portfolio to held for sale in the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently returned it to held for investment during the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9% and 2.5% linked quarter, the strongest linked quarter growth as seen in 2015. Line utilization however, remains relatively consistent with the previous quarter and flat year-over-year.
Consumer loans again showed positive momentum led by credit card and auto loans. Average credit cards increased 4.7% year-over-year and 5% on a linked-quarter basis, which included the acquisition of approximately $500 million Auto Club portfolio at the end of quarter 3. Auto loan growth remain strong, up 13% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. 
Residential mortgages grew 2.1% year-over-year, reversing a declining trend over the last several quarters, and rose 2.2% on a linked-quarter basis. We currently expect total average linked quarter loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range in quarter 1. 
Total average deposits increased $19 billion or 6.9% over the same quarter of last year and 1.7% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in noninterest bearing and low interest checking, money market and savings deposits remain strong on a year-over-year basis and continue to more than offset the runoff of maturing larger dollar time deposits.
Turning to Slide 8 in credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 1% on a year-over-year basis and increased 4.5% on a linked-quarter basis primarily due to lower recovery. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the third quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased by 2.8% on a linked-quarter basis and 15.8% over the fourth quarter of 2014.
The fourth quarter provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs, which compares to a release of reserves of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2015. As we move into 2016, we would expect that reserves will begin to build to support loan growth.
Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2016.
Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results versus comparable time periods. As I mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.80 includes $0.01 related to net impact of a sale of our HSA deposit portfolio, partially offset by accruals related to the legal and compliance matters.
Fourth quarter net income decreased $12 million or 0.8% year-over-year. This is principally due to a higher provision for credit losses; increase in net interest income primarily driven by growth in earning assets; lower noninterest income impacted by the 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by increases in payments-related revenue; trust and investment management fees; and the HSA deposit sale gain.
On a linked-quarter basis, net income was lower by $13 million or 0.9% mainly due to predicted seasonal increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net revenue primarily due to loan growth.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $72 million or 2.6%. The increase was the result of growth in average earning asset of 5.1%, partially offset by lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 8 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to a change in loan portfolio mix as well as the growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates and lower reinvestment rates.
Net interest income increased $50 million on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loan. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 2 basis points higher than the third quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was principally due to higher loan growth, which resulted in lower cash balances. We currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the first quarter.
Slide 11 highlights noninterest income, which decreased $30 million or 1.3% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the impact of a 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by fee revenue growth and the HSA deposit sale gain. Higher credit and debit card revenue, trust and investment management fees and merchant processing services were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities.
Momentum on our payments business is what's reflected on our fourth quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 8.1% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volumes, which were up 6% compared to 5.2% in quarter 3. Merchant processing revenue increased 2.3% year-over-year and approximately 6.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirements. These equipment sales were modestly lower than the -- not recognized in quarter 3 as expected.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $14 million or 0.6%, principally due to seasonally higher credit and debit card revenue and the HSA deposit sale gain, partially offset by lower corporate payment product revenue reflecting the seasonally higher quarter 3 government-related transaction volumes. Mortgage banking revenue was also lower as expected, primarily due to seasonally lower origination revenue. We would expect that fee revenue in quarter 1 will be seasonally lower on a quarter-on-quarter basis -- linked-quarter basis.
Moving to slide 12. Non-interest expense was essentially flat year-over-year. Higher compensation expense which reflected the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities, along with higher employee benefit expense driven by pension costs, were largely offset by lower marketing and business development expenses principally due to charitable contributions recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower other expense reflecting the net year-over-year impact of legal accruals.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $34 million or 1.2% as predicted, reflecting seasonally higher costs related to investments and tax advantaged projects and accruals related to legal and compliance matters, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced mortgage-related compliance and talent upgrade costs, which were elevated in quarter 3 and declined as expected in quarter 4.
Compensation expense declined reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives and declines in variable compensation. Employee benefits expense also declined driven by lower payroll tax expense and health care costs.
We would expect expenses to be relatively stable in quarter 1 compared to quarter 4. Seasonally higher benefits expense will be offset by the seasonally lower tax credit amortization and the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition.
Turning to Slide 13. As Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong. We returned 61% of our earnings to shareholders during the quarter. Dividends accounted for 32%, while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining 29%.
For the full year, we returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders and we expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward. 
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, is fully implemented at December 31 was 9.1%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement.
Our tangible book value per share rose to 17.44 at December 31, representing a 9.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.4% increase over the prior quarter.
I will now turn the call back to Richard."

First of all, I predicted that question, I was thinking this morning we are a classic American bank. We do primarily business in the domestic United States, and we're very much a consumer small business payments kind of a company. So despite what's going on in the backdrop around the world with the China reevaluation and what's happening in oil in some of those areas, which we're not immune to, by all intents and purposes we're not seeing the majority of that on our books or by our customers. So we're actually seeing a continued steady, I'll say, slow but steady improvement every quarter, and our are customers reflecting that across the board from the large corporate customers, who are still doing robust M&A transactions to restructuring their portfolio, all the way down to the small businesses, which continue to grow, for us double digits, based on their interest and setting themselves up for better consumer rate of recovery and just in general, people who are using banks for their retail services. So I'm quite optimistic against the negative backdrop. And I know we won't be immune to all of that but based on our geography, based on our mix of business, based on our history and based on our appetite for risk, I think, we're actually fairly immune for most of those issues at this stage. And yet we stress test for the worst scenarios that would, of course, affect us. So I would say, across the board from a lending perspective that same range you've seen, the 1% and 1.5% we're predicting again for this quarter, already off to a really nice start. And we're not seeing any disruption, neither from the 25 basis point increase, which we knew will be more symbolic and actually not yet from the impacts of the stock market or the China reevaluation. So at this point, we're remaining optimistic in a cautious and careful way."

Actually I have to -- more than the question is I think I also mentioned where you now have the fireside chat, I might add, without the fireplace. You're talking about what kind of assumptions we'd have in our plan and we actually expected to have 2 rate increases from the last time I talked to you. We hoped for 1 in December, we expect 1 in June. And that's really the amount of the risk we place into our plan this year. So we're halfway with 1 of them, at least at this point if it sticks. So that alone does actually help us, but we're not relying on that to the very point you made. But most importantly it happened to us, it's just a continued improved recovering economy where people feel they can consume. People feel they don't have to save quite as much and that they've got a higher backstop in either in their own savings account or in their home equity or in their own debt positions where they can start spending money and feel more comfortable about it, that's going to be huge for us. That's way more important than any interest rate because as I said earlier, we're a consumer middle market, wholesale bank and those are the things that matter the most. But I wanted to say the things that we'll put our shoulder against to watch for improvement this year, one will be the continued success we're having in relationship management with our customers. I think I've said this before, but we're developing a much smarter technology around who our customers are, what they expect, what their likely next needs are, particularly around the mobile banking aspect. And so we're investing a great deal of money and time. And in this whole efficiency program you never heard me take anything away from our investment in innovation and entrepreneurship, and we're not, because I do believe that's going to be the next big idea. So having a payments business and a bank connected together, we have the best of both worlds because we test virtually any paradigm, buyer, seller and moving money back and forth. So that's our #1, we're going to lean on the bank and the payments business that's coming together. Number 2, the corporate trust business has been remarkably good for us. It doesn't get a lot of visibility, it's actually confusing to a lot of people but we're not only domestically quite large and capable but when you start looking at how that's starting to build over across the fund over in Europe, but both our funds administration and our classic corporate trust, we're going to expect a lot from those 2 businesses as well in 2016. And finally, I'll say, the next chapter in our wholesale bank becoming -- we've moved out the audition stage and we're now bona fide one of the most important banks to deal with the large Fortune 100 companies, anything from an M&A deal to a first or last [ph] lead on a deal, to just moving money on a very sophisticated way. We are continuously moving in there. I'm quite proud of what the wholesale commercial bank has done. We are celebrating Dick Payne's retirement this quarter and we're also celebrating the addition of 2 new leaders coming up from within the company to run the wholesale bank and the capital markets, and I expect a lot from the 2 of them. They've got the capability, energy to pick up where Dick has left us which is a really good starting point. So I would say those 3 things, Erika, to answer your question."

Let me talk about that, there's a couple of things that are going on with that because you're right, we normally would see a first quarter decline in expenses but I'll answer your first question and add more light. So yes, we would expect to see some onetime expenses related to the Fidelity card deal that will come through in the first quarter and then just the overall operating expenses related to that will increase as we move through the year starting in the first quarter. Additionally, if you think about our first quarter expense, we usually have a seasonally lower expense related to our tax credit amortization. But as you know and you see in our numbers, our tax credit expense in fourth quarter was lower than we normally would have seen and that's really due to a mix of where that's reported so you also saw that our tax rate was a bit higher. So that benefit that we get on a linked-quarter basis for tax credit is going to be lower than what you would have seen in the past but not coupled with the Fidelity [indiscernible] growth to a stable."

So the answer I'll give you, Matt, first and foremost is what you see we've done is what we want to do more of. So you saw these 2 fairly large portfolios in the card business that we continue to be attracted toward. These are picking up portfolios that are already have momentum. They're picking up a high-quality portfolio that's at least as good, if not better, than the one we have at the prime level, and we're finding more and more people interested in allowing us to take a look at that. So I hope there will be more of those. We've talked before about our merchant acquiring business and we -- the way we couple that together over the last now 15 years is to find a partner, work with them on a JV kind of a basis with the rent-to-own sense and there's more of that in Europe that we're continuing to look at and hopefully, opportunities in that regard as well. And then finally, the more classic kind of opportunities I talked about innovation and there may be some small businesses, some small companies, some small garage deals that we might find where we want to bring the capability in-house and not outsource it. And if those come along at the right price at the right moment, we'll also not hesitate there. As it relates to full bank acquisitions and interests, our interest remains exactly what it was, we don't have a high interest and there's no one knocking on our door. And yet at the same time, it's a good thing because given the consent order that we entered into in October, we wouldn't be allowed to do a full bank acquisition and sell it through and pass that to consumer [ph] which we're moving swiftly along and actually have been predicting that we can move that as swiftly as anyone ever has. So we are well aware that at that point in time we want to buy some, when we want to be past that point and our goal is to be there but now it's not inhibiting anything that we would otherwise want to do. And I think portfolios and merchant acquiring will be the 2 places you should watch the most."

We'll take the hit from you guys for not having that acquisition but we'll take the benefit years later or months later when we don't have a problem.

But the reason I said and I'm record for quite a while, John, saying that from our own experiences, the statute, I mean, call it the statute of limitations is not legal by any means, was that you can still pick up a company and you can still be placed in harm's way for dealing with any of their potential problems right on your own. And I think it's all the way back to 2007. When you take a 7- to 10-year window on when things start to roll off in terms of statute, the way we're seeing things continue to come through and people try to get into the wire. I've always said, 2017 will be the first time we'd want to look at the -- our appetite for bringing on a risk into our company we simply couldn't do diligence for and couldn't possibly imagine. That, at least, elegantly is lined up with our current moment where we can't do it anyway but we don't want to anyway. And I wouldn't be interested -- if pricing doesn't change, you can't get a good enough deal if you don't know what you're getting. And I could be wrong, but I feel very strongly about that and have for a long time. And I would say that as the moments clear, let's say a year or more from now, our ability is there, our appetite will be higher, the moment in time I think will be safer, and all those things will line up and then we could be very much involved and engaged in that. But the reason we're -- most importantly less interested is we don't really need it. I mean, much of this is attractive to have the wallpaper behind me and somebody else shaking hands, it's really not necessary for this company. We are in every business line that we're in that we want. We're not in anything we don't want to be in. If we do, we sell it like the HSA deposit business. And we don't covet anything we don't have. We just want to be better at what we're doing and do it better, deeper wherever we are. That would be attractive to me, but it's not going to be a headlining kind of a deal, at least as long as I'm around. It's just never has been.

In fact, when I talked to you guys -- all of it were to go down to $10 to $15, and it shuddered the thought. But if I had to talk to you about what's the tangent risk would be, we would be talking about the unemployment issues in those areas affected mostly by oil and energy. And our very own customers, you may be surprised, I have a lot of people in parts that we don't have branches that have that credit card and like it a lot. So it'll be our own -- a victim of success here, but it's been quite national for 5, 6 years.

And those that are most willing are the ones that are too eager, and we don't want them. So that's in part why you're going to see our loan growth, I think, be steady but not robust, because we're going to reflect whatever the economy says. I also do think our market share has grown a lot, and we have all the data to prove it. So we are getting first look from a lot of customers that may be in a decade before didn't think of us as much. On the Capital Markets side, I think you'll also find the answers, yes, we can step in and now be a lender of support for those who have other alternatives and want to use it in a more traditional balance sheet approach to growing their business. And as I said earlier, we're no longer auditioning. We're well -- and Wisconsin now is one of the top 2 or 3 banks in most large companies portfolio or the place they will call for the opportunity.

I mean, if you're a C-Suite person and a Fortune anything or one of the largest private companies, you really do value ratings and you value the top-notch level that we have.

That's been in the run rate for, Eric, for as many years as I can remember. So there's no new increased cost. And then as I said earlier, things like our large brand reputation campaign we're going to launch this year, it will cost money. We haven't had the run rate that's going to come in part from the efficiency program. Some we'll give back to the shareholders, some we'll keep for ourselves. And these are some things we'd want and wanted to do. So that's kind of the way to think about it."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2015 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation.U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion or $3.1",702,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2015 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion or $3.16 per diluted common share. We achieved industry-leading profitability with a return on average assets of 1.44%, a return on average common equity of 14% and an efficiency ratio of 53.8% for the year.
Total average loans grew by 4.1% adjusted for student loans, and average deposits grew a strong 7.7% year-over-year. Credit quality continued to improve with a 12.1% decline in net charge-offs and a 15.8% decrease in nonperforming assets.
Our capital position remains strong and we returned $4 billion or 72% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during 2015.
Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights. U.S. Bank reported record revenue of $5.2 billion and net income of $1.5 billion or $0.80 per diluted common share, an increase of 1.3% year-over-year. The fourth quarter of 2015 included a gain from the sale of an HSA account deposit portfolio, which was partially offset by accruals related to legal and compliance matters that combined, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.01. 
I'm very pleased this quarter with the momentum in our linked quarter loan growth, the continued strength of our payments business and the improvement in our operating leverage. Total average loans grew 1.7% linked quarter, adjusted for student loans, which exceeded the high end of our 1% to 1.5% range.
In addition, we continue to see strong growth in average deposits, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. Credit quality continue to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined on a year-over-year basis, and nonperforming assets declined on a linked-quarter basis as well. Slide 5 provides you with the 5-quarter history of our performance metrics and we remain among the best in the industry.
Moving to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was relatively stable, as expected, improving 2 basis points from the third quarter. This is primarily driven by higher loan growth, which reduced the amount of cash balances.
Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 53.9%, which was unchanged from quarter 3 and down from 54.3% a year ago. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to see the results of our expanded efficiency effort that we introduced last year, which includes prudent FTE management and a renewed emphasis on other discretionary spending. As I said earlier, I'm particularly pleased that we were able to achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter, which reverses the trend of negative leverage over the past several quarters. I believe this positions us well as we move into 2016.
While prudent expense management remains a priority for our company, we also continue to focus on revenue growth and innovation, which means investing in those businesses and products that will provide strong returns.
During the quarter, we announced a new agreement with Fidelity Investments. U.S. Bank is now the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments Rewards card program. As part of this arrangement, which closed at the end of 2015, we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion. This follows the announcement from last October about our card issuing partnership with the Auto Club Trust and the purchase of an existing $500 million portfolio. These agreements exemplify the strength of our payments business model and a continued commitment to strategic growth for our company.
Turning to Slide 6. The company reported record net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 0.8% increase from the prior year, which included core revenue growth and a gain on the sale of the HSA deposit portfolio, partially offset by the Nuveen gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily due to our growing balance sheet and growth in the number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments and trust businesses.
Kathy will now give you a few more detail about our fourth quarter results."
305304,318467799,918998,"U.S. Bancorp, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2016",2016-01-15,"Earnings Calls","U.S. Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Average loan growth and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion or 4.2% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter, adjusted for student loans. As you may recall, we moved our stu",1305,"Thanks, Richard. Average loan growth and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion or 4.2% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter, adjusted for student loans. As you may recall, we moved our student loans portfolio to held for sale in the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently returned it to held for investment during the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9% and 2.5% linked quarter; the strongest linked quarter growth as seen in 2015. Line utilization however, remained relatively consistent with the previous quarter and flat year-over-year.
Consumer loans again showed positive momentum led by credit card and auto loans. Average credit cards increased 4.7% year-over-year and 5% on a linked-quarter basis, which included the acquisition of approximately $500 million Auto Club portfolio at the end of quarter 3. Auto loan growth remained strong, up 13% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. 
Residential mortgages grew 2.1% year-over-year, reversing a declining trend over the last several quarters, and rose 2.2% on a linked-quarter basis. We currently expect total average linked quarter loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range in quarter one. 
Total average deposits increased $19 billion or 6.9% over the same quarter of last year and 1.7% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in noninterest bearing and low interest checking, money market and savings deposits remain strong on a year-over-year basis and continue to more than offset the runoff of maturing larger dollar time deposits.
Turning to Slide 8 in credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 1% on a year-over-year basis and increased 4.5% on a linked-quarter basis primarily due to lower recoveries. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the third quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased by 2.8% on a linked-quarter basis and 15.8% over the fourth quarter of 2014.
The fourth quarter provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs, which compares to a release of reserves of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2015. As we move into 2016, we would expect that reserves will begin to build to support loan growth.
Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2016.
Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results versus comparable time periods. As I mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.80 includes $0.01 related to net impact of a sale of our HSA deposit portfolio, partially offset by accruals related to the legal and compliance matters.
Fourth quarter net income decreased $12 million or 0.8% year-over-year. This is principally due to a higher provision for credit losses; increase in net interest income primarily driven by growth in earning assets; lower noninterest income impacted by the 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by increases in payments-related revenue; trust and investment management fees; and the HSA deposit sale gain.
On a linked-quarter basis, net income was lower by $13 million or 0.9% mainly due to predicted seasonal increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net revenue primarily due to loan growth.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $72 million or 2.6%. The increase was the result of growth in average earning assets of 5.1%, partially offset by lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 8 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to a change in loan portfolio mix as well as the growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates and lower reinvestment rates.
Net interest income increased $50 million on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loans. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 2 basis points higher than the third quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was principally due to higher loan growth, which resulted in lower cash balances. We currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the first quarter.
Slide 11 highlights noninterest income, which decreased $30 million or 1.3% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the impact of a 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by fee revenue growth and the HSA deposit sale gain. Higher credit and debit card revenue, trust and investment management fees and merchant processing services were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities.
Momentum on our payments businesses was reflected in our fourth quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 8.1% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volumes, which were up 6% compared to 5.2% in quarter three. Merchant processing revenue increased 2.3% year-over-year and approximately 6.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirements. These equipment sales were modestly lower than the amount recognized in quarter three as expected.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $14 million or 0.6%, principally due to seasonally higher credit and debit card revenue and the HSA deposit sale gain, partially offset by lower corporate payment product revenue reflecting the seasonally higher quarter three government-related transaction volumes. Mortgage banking revenue was also lower as expected, primarily due to seasonally lower origination revenue. We would expect that fee revenue in quarter one will be seasonally lower on a quarter-on-quarter basis -- linked-quarter basis.
Moving to slide 12. Non-interest expense was essentially flat year-over-year. Higher compensation expense which reflected the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities, along with higher employee benefit expense driven by pension costs, were largely offset by lower marketing and business development expenses principally due to charitable contributions recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower other expense reflecting the net year-over-year impact of legal accruals.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $34 million or 1.2% as predicted, reflecting seasonally higher costs related to investments and tax advantaged projects and accruals related to legal and compliance matters, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced mortgage-related compliance and talent upgrade costs, which were elevated in quarter three and declined as expected in quarter four.
Compensation expense declined reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives and declines in variable compensation. Employee benefits expense also declined driven by lower payroll tax expense and health care costs.
We would expect expenses to be relatively stable in quarter one compared to quarter four. Seasonally higher benefits expense will be offset by the seasonally lower tax credit amortization and the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition.
Turning to Slide 13. As Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong. We returned 61% of our earnings to shareholders during the quarter. Dividends accounted for 32%, while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining 29%.
For the full year, we returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders and we expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward. 
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, as is fully implemented at December 31 was 9.1%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement.
Our tangible book value per share rose to 17.44 at December 31, representing a 9.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.4% increase over the prior quarter.
I will now turn the call back to Richard."

We do primarily business in the domestic United States, and we're very much a consumer, small business payments kind of a company. So despite what's going on in the backdrop around the world with the China reevaluation and what's happening in oil, and some of those areas, which we're not immune to, by all intents and purposes we're not seeing the majority of that on our books or by our customers. So we're actually seeing a continued steady, I'll say, slow but steady improvement every quarter, and our customers are reflecting that across the board; from the large corporate customers, who are still doing robust M&A transactions, to restructuring their portfolio, all the way down to the small businesses, which continue to grow, for us, double digits, based on their interest and setting themselves up for better consumer-led recovery and just in general, people who are using banks for their retail services. So I'm quite optimistic against the negative backdrop. And I know we won't be immune to all of that but based on our geography, based on our mix of business, based on our history and based on our appetite for risk, I think, we're actually fairly immune for most of those issues at this stage. And yet we stress test for the worst scenarios that would, of course, affect us. So I would say, across the board from a lending perspective that same range you've seen, the 1% and 1.5% we're predicting again for this quarter, already off to a really nice start. And we're not seeing any disruption, neither from the 25 basis point increase, which we knew would be more symbolic and actually not yet from the impacts of the stock market or the China reevaluation. So at this point, we're remaining optimistic in a cautious and careful way."

So obviously, we have seen some downgrades there, and we've been building our allocated reserves for that all year long. We've built that at low 30s price of oil, so we feel like we're good for now, though we'll see where oil settles down.

Actually I have to -- more than the question is I think I also mentioned when you now have the fireside chat, I might add, without the fireplace. You're talking about what kind of assumptions we'd have in our plan and we actually expected to have two rate increases from the last time I talked to you. We hoped for one in December, we expect 1 in June. And that's really the amount of the risk we place into our plan this year. So we're halfway with one of them, at least at this point if it sticks. So that alone does actually help us, but we're not relying on that to the very point you made. The most important thing that happened to us is just a continued improved recovering economy; where people feel they can consume. People feel they don't have to save quite as much and that they've got a higher backstop in either in their own savings account or in their home equity or in their own debt positions where they can start spending money and feel more comfortable about it. That's going to be huge for us. That's way more important than any interest rate because as I said earlier, we're a consumer middle market wholesale bank, and those are the things that matter the most. But I wanted to say the things that we'll put our shoulder against to watch for improvement this year, one will be the continued success we're having in relationship management with our customers. I think I've said this before, but we're developing a much smarter technology around who our customers are, what they expect, what their likely next needs are, particularly around the mobile banking aspect. And so we're investing a great deal of money and time. In this whole efficiency program you never heard me take anything away from our investment in innovation and entrepreneurship, and we're not, because I do believe that's going to be the next big idea. So having a payments business and a bank connected together, we have the best of both worlds because we can test virtually any paradigm, buyer, seller and moving money back and forth. So that's our #1, we're going to lean on the bank and the payments businesses coming together. Number 2, the corporate trust business has been remarkably good for us. It doesn't get a lot of visibility, it's actually confusing to a lot of people. But we're not only domestically quite large and capable but when you start looking at how that's starting to build over across the fund over in Europe, with both our funds administration and our classic corporate trust, we're going to expect a lot from those two businesses as well in 2016. And finally, I'll say, the next chapter in our wholesale bank becoming -- we've moved out the audition stage and we're now bona fide one of the most important banks to deal with the large Fortune 100 companies, anything from an M&A deal, to a first or last [ph] lead on a deal, to just moving money on a very sophisticated way. We are continuing to see momentum there. I'm quite proud of what the wholesale commercial bank has done. We are celebrating Dick Payne's retirement this quarter and we're also celebrating the addition of two new leaders coming up from within the company to run the wholesale bank and the capital markets, and I expect a lot from the two of them. They've got the capability, energy to pick up where Dick has left us which is a really good starting point. So I would say those three things, Erika, to answer your question."

But as you know and you see in our numbers, our tax credit expense in fourth quarter was lower than we normally would have seen and that's really due to a mix of where that's reported; so you also saw that our tax rate was a bit higher.

So the answer I'll give you, Matt, first and foremost is what you see we've done is what we want to do more of. So you saw these two fairly large portfolios in the card business that we continue to be attracted toward. These are picking up portfolios that are already have momentum. They're picking up a high-quality portfolio that's at least as good, if not better, than the one we have at the prime level, and we're finding more and more people interested in allowing us to take a look at that. So I hope there will be more of those. We've talked before about our merchant acquiring business and we -- the way we've cobbled that together over the last now 15 years is to find a partner, work with them on a JV kind of a basis with a rent-to-own sense. And there's more of that in Europe that we're continuing to look at and hopefully, opportunities in that regard as well. And then finally, the more classic kind of opportunities I talk about innovation and there may be some small businesses, some small companies, some small garage deals that we might find where we want to bring the capability in-house and not outsource it. And if those come along at the right price at the right moment, we'll also not hesitate there. As it relates to full bank acquisitions and interests, our interests remain exactly what it was, we don't have a high interest and there's no one knocking on our door. And yet at the same time, it's a good thing because given the consent order that we entered into in October, we wouldn't be allowed to do a full bank acquisition and sell it through and pass that to consent order which we're moving swiftly along and actually have been predicting that we can move that as swiftly as anyone ever has. So we are well aware that at the point in time we want to buy someone we want to be past that point, and our goal is to be there.

Many of them though will come to us at a slightly disadvantaged risk perspective and we don't convince ourselves to make it up in volume or to buy it now and change our original mantra. We'll take the hit from you guys for not having that acquisition but we'll take the benefit years later or months later when we don't have a problem.

But the reason I said and I'm record for quite a while, John, saying that from our own experiences, the statute, I mean, call it the statute of limitations is not legal by any means, was that you can still pick up a company and you can still be placed in harm's way for dealing with any of their potential problems, let alone your own. And I think it's all the way back to 2007. When you take a 7- to 10-year window on when things start to roll off in terms of statute, obviously things continue to come through and people try to get into the wire. I've always said, 2017 will be the first time we'd want to look at the -- our appetite for bringing on a risk into our company that we simply couldn't do due diligence for and couldn't possibly imagine. That, at least, elegantly is lined up with our current moment where we can't do it anyway but we don't want to anyway. And I wouldn't be interested -- if pricing doesn't change, you can't get a good enough deal if you don't know what you're getting. And I could be wrong, but I feel very strongly about that and have for a long time. And I would say that as the moments clear, let's say a year or more from now, our ability is there, our appetite will be higher. The moment in time I think will be safer, and all those things will line up and then we could be very much involved and engaged in that. But the reason we're -- most importantly less interested is we don't really need it. I mean, much as it's attractive to have the wallpaper behind me and somebody else shaking hands, it's really not necessary for this company. We are in every business line that we're in that we want. We're not in anything we don't want to be in. If we do, we sell it, like the HSA deposit business. And we don't covet anything we don't have. We just want to be better at what we're doing and do it better, deeper wherever we are. That would be attractive to me, but it's just not going to be a headliner kind of a deal, at least as long as I'm around. It just never has been.

And here you are talking about faster loan growth, which seems to be that you should be winning over the 10-year as far as what the 10 year is saying about growth. On the other hand, you're seeing what's going on in the market. So my question is, is the economy getting better or worse? What's your conviction level and confidence? And also as the Capital Markets, at least in certain areas in the Capital Markets, liquidity is less plentiful, is that an opportunity for you to step in and lend even more? Because you said the expansion in loan growth is on the consumer side and on the wholesale side, it's the same. But is this an opportunity for you to step in and borrow where some of the nonbanks might be retreating -- I'm sorry, chance for you to lend more versus the nonbanks who are retreating?"

As a junior lender years ago, there's still a steady-state paradigm that you only make a loan based on ability, stability and willingness. And the willingness is a low part. People are able to take loans, they're more stable than they've been in 8 years, but they're just not willing. So we can't create willing, and we're not going to create willing. And those that are most willing are the ones that are too eager, and we don't want them. So that's in part why you're going to see our loan growth, I think, be steady but not robust, because we're going to reflect whatever the economy says. I also do think our market share has grown a lot, and you have all the data to prove it. So we are getting first look from a lot of customers that maybe a decade before didn't think of us as much. On the Capital Markets side, I think you'll also find the answers, yes, we can step in and now be a lender of support for those who have other alternatives and want to use it in a more traditional balance sheet approach to growing their business. And as I said earlier, we're no longer auditioning. We're well ensconsed now as one of the top 2 or 3 banks in most large companies' portfolio or the place they will call for the opportunity. And that comes from our debt ratings, Mike. I mean, if you're a C-Suite person at a Fortune anything or one of the largest private companies, you really do value ratings and you value the top-notch level that we have. And that means more to you than sometimes pricing, which we also offer. So I think in many cases, we'll get our -- more than our fair share of the Capital Markets where there's an interest in using that as an alternative to traditional financing.

So we're focused very closely on watching the economies around kind of the energy areas in the United States. We do have, as Richard said earlier, we're national in our commercial real estate, national auto lending, cards. So we have been watching it carefully, we have not seen any impact yet, even though we -- there's -- we did see that 50,000 oil workers have lost their job within the last year or so.

I'll begin a review of U.S. Bancorp's results for the summary of the quarter's highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $0.76 per diluted common share. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we announced that U.S. Bank became the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity investments rewards card program. And as part of that arrangement, we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 million, which is reflected in the company's average laon growth [indiscernible].
I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. Once again, we delivered industry-leading profitability. Our average loan growth exceeded the high end of our 1% to 1.5% range and the payments business remains strong. Total average loans grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and 5.2% year-over-year adjusted for the retail card acquisition.
Total average deposit growth remained strong, growing 6.3% over the previous year, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. 
We were affected by a broader market condition, most notably related to the energy sector. While our energy portfolio is a relatively small portion of our company's overall loan portfolio at just 1.3% of total loans. The deterioration in this sector has impacted certain credit metrics. This has resulted in the recognition of additional reserves of $15 million had charge-offs in the first quarter. I'd like to highlight that excluding the energy portfolio, the credit quality for the company remains strong, which is reflected by a stable charge-off rates; net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans for 48 basis points, up 1 basis point from the prior quarter. Additionally, the company found improvement in nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio. 
Although the company's total nonperforming assets increased 12.9% over the prior quarter, nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio, improved 4.1%, reflecting the improvements, particularly in our Retail portfolio. For instance, residential mortgages continue to benefit from improving real estate values, which has helped to partially offset the increase in the energy loan reserve.
Slide 4 provides you with a slight quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry.
Moving to the graph on the right, this quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was unchanged from the prior quarter as expected. The benefit we recognize from the increase in short-term rates was offset by the continued shift in our loan portfolio mix. 
Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 54.6%, relatively stable from a year ago, and have from the fourth quarter as expected due to the seasonality of our businesses. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to balance decisions about operating cost with investments in our franchise.
We remain focused in our efficiency efforts as they provide opportunity to invest in our businesses and in technology to meet our customers' needs. For example, during the first quarter, we launched realtime person-to-person payments on the clearance change network, and we continue to invest in enhancements in our mobile banking application. We were pleased to be named as Mobile Leader by corporate insights in March, which acknowledges our commitment to be a leader in the rapidly changing landscape of banking technology.
Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total revenue of $5 billion in the first quarter, $131 million or 2.7% increase from the prior year.
The revenue growth that you're seeing is primarily being driven by core loan growth as well as strength in the number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments business. 
Kathy will  now provide you with more details about the first quarter results."

Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion or 5.2% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis, both adjusted for the retail card acquisition. 
In the first quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-to-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.2%. Consumer loans again showed positive momentum led by credit card growth of 13.6% year-over-year, which included the retail card acquisition. 
Residential mortgage loan growth was also strong, increasing $2.8 billion or 5.4% year-over-year and finally, the momentum in our home equity portfolio continued resulting in a year-over-year increase of $471 million or 3%. 
On a linked-quarter basis, our core loan growth of 1.6%, excluding the card acquisition, was again driven by total commercial loan growth of $3 billion or 3.5%, the strongest linked-quarter growth for 5 -- for the previous 5 quarters and growth in residential mortgages of $1.2 billion or 2.3%.
We currently expect linked-quarter average loan growth to approximate 1.5% in the second quarter.
Total average deposits increased $17 billion or 6.3% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and were up modestly on a linked-quarter basis.
The linked-quarter growth in the first quarter of every year is affected by seasonal factors, notably in our corporate trust business line. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to show strong growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and low-cost interest checking. Money market and savings deposits also remained strong year-over-year, more than offsetting the run-up in higher cost time deposits. 
Let me now turn to Slide 7. As Richard mentioned, challenges in the energy sector affected some of our credit metrics in the first quarter, however, credit quality in the core portfolio, excluding energy, remains stable. 
First quarter net charge-offs increased $36 million or 12.9% compared with the prior year. Net charge-offs were $10 million or 3.3% higher than the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the first quarter, up 1 basis point compared with the fourth quarter.
Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased 1.4% on a linked-quarter basis, nonperforming assets increased by 12.9%. The increases were entirely due to the downgrade of energy-related credit. Excluding energy-related loans, nonperforming assets decreased 4.1% on a linked-quarter basis.
Turning to Slide 8, let me now provide some additional color around our energy exposure. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $3.4 billion of our commercial loans were to customers and energy-related businesses. Energy-related loans are 1.3% of our total loans. Our energy loan commitment for $11.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016, down slightly on a both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. 
During the quarter, we recognized the $138 million of reserves related to the energy portfolio and the reserve for energy loan now stands at 9.1% of outstanding balances at the end of the first quarter of 2016. This compares with the 5.4% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Finally, approximately 43% of our energy commitment and 17% of our outstanding energy loans are 2 investment-grade companies. 
Given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we currently expect linked-quarter net charge-off and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the second quarter of 2016.
Slide 9 gives you a view of our first quarter results versus comparable periods.
First quarter net income decreased by $45 million or 3.1% on a year-over-year basis. Improvement in operating income was offset by higher loan-loss provision and higher income taxes. The higher tax rate was primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters that benefited tax expense in the first quarter of 2015.
On a linked-quarter basis, net income declined by $90 million or 6.1%, primarily -- mainly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, an increase in the provision for credit loss due to energy and the impact of the previously reported fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of the health savings account deposit portfolio.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased by $136 million or 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning assets growth was offset by the impact of a 2-basis-point decline in net interest margin to 3.0%. 
The modest year-over-year decline in margin percentage primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rates, offset by loan mix shift and lower reinvestment rates in the portfolio. 
Net interest income increased by $17 million or 0.6% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in average earning assets and the impact of higher short-term rates were partially offset by the impact of fewer days in the quarter. We currently expect linked net interest margin in the second quarter to be relatively stable and linked-quarter net interest income to increase modestly. 
Slide 11 highlights noninterest income, which decreased $5 million or 0.2% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher payments revenue and higher trust in investment management fees. 
Continued strength in the payment business, which reflected in our results. Credit and debit card revenue grew by $25 million or 10.4%, reflecting higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolio. Sales volumes, excluding the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition, were up 6.4% year-over-year, an improvement from the 6% year-over-year growth delivered in the fourth quarter.
Merchant processing services revenue increased by $14 million or 3.9%. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency rate changes, year-over-year merchant profits and services revenue growth would have been approximately 6.4%.
The growth was driven by higher transaction volume, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip and card technology requirement. Equipment sales related to chip card technology continued the trend modestly lower versus growth reported in prior periods.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $191 million or 8.2%, principally due to seasonality lower fee-based revenues, along with the impact of the fourth quarter HSA deposit sale.
As expected, our premises and deposit services charges declined due to seasonality in those businesses. 
Mortgage banking revenues also declined as expected, principally due to lower rates impacting the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights. 
We expect linked-quarter mortgage fees to increase 10% to 20% based on seasonally higher application volume.
Moving to Slide 12, noninterest expense was $84 million or 3.2% higher on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense will be driven by merit increases and higher compliance and the acquisition cost were partially offset by lower pension expense and insurance recovery recognized during the quarter.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense decreased by $60 million or 2.1%. Seasonally lower cost related to investments and tax-advantaged projects and lower professional services expenses, along with the insurance recovery, were partially offset by seasonally higher benefit expense and higher variable compensation. The variable compensation expense includes cost related to an all employee grant that was issued in the first quarter.
We expect linked-quarter expenses to increase in quarter 2, driven by expected seasonality and higher expenses related to our brand positioning that was launched in the first quarter. Additionally, we expect professional services related to compliance to peak in the second quarter and then modestly decline as cost related to our residential mortgage default consent order conclude.
Our efficiency ratio is expected to decline slightly in the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 13, as Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong. And in the first quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. We expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach that we fully implemented as of March 31 was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to 17.94 at March 31, representing an 8.7% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.9% increase over the prior quarter.
I will turn the call back to Richard."

So we're making progress, and I think as an industry, you'd be proud that we haven't lost our position, and we haven't given it up and we're not going to sit idly by, while nonbanks come in and take over the position. So the first couple of products you saw, some from us, are just a peek into the future. I will tell you that the appetite for the consumers is higher than for business on some of these higher value products because they are eager to change in trying new things and businesses are more cautious a more careful. I think black chain moving from ledger to eventually payment and things like that. So we're pleased with what we see. We bring it before you though and our investors is when you get paid for this. And there's already a bit of a discord between us and the other bank that came out with one of the paid realtime payments, PDP, where we're charging 4 and they're not. And so the issue we have to ask ourselves is 1 consumers and eventually business pay for a circumstance that they don't have value for the day, while they pay for a time. That [indiscernible] a number, and you will pay for prime to have certain privileges and speed. They'll do it there, so we're hoping they'll do it there in the payments world. We have to make sure that the business of banking doesn't become a utility in the minds of the consumer where they expect everything to come without a value price to it, and we're hoping that we'll be able to help set the standard for that. But that's my hope and then they'll be plenty more opportunities to hear what consumers in the business want delivered to them. And frankly, I think we'll surprise them because it's been so long, this whole paradigm of overnight settlement closed on, weekends and all of that. I think they'll be quite pleased to see some of the progress we are making. I'd like to ask Andy to give a little bit more color on it since he's overseeing all of our performance in realtime payments and helping coordinate our own bank's position on that."

They're higher than used to be because we need to stay at that level. We also never cheated innovation and technology piece in any of those years to have to either catch up or to either ramp down.
So our expenses are going to move more likely on the cost of personnel attached with compliance-related activities, which we said will peak in this quarter that we're in. And it to rely on just the fact that we're going to continue to have to pay up for making sure that employees have the proper level of compensation to think of all the minimum wages out there in dishes like that, so that's going to drive a big part of our expenses. Technology will be at the run rate it is now and it's going to be very thoughtful, but we're going to continue to apply the efficiency we get in one side of it to the opportunity for innovation cost on the other.

That's good. So when revenue does move, it's kind of 2 on expenses. We only expect one more interest rate increase in the second half of the year in order for us to accomplish what we pretty much telegraphed to all of you. And if it doesn't, it will be Armageddon, but it will be something we hope to get. In response to that, expenses. The compliance cost are something that we don't like because they're related to expectations that we didn't have for ourselves. So there's a consent order, it means you been deficit in some way one of the ways to fix that is to bring in both the third parties and the bulk of your staffing and then you'll come back down to a more normalized levels. I will say, our compliance cost and FTE have really nearly tripled in the last 5 years. We did that review for our boards just yesterday. And I would say probably 2/3 of that would have been present anyway, consent orders or not. So it's not like just in order peaks you out and you never come back down, but there is a run rate impact. So as we finish the mortgage consent order this quarter, that wraps up in completion and then we move into a now in the AML BSA consider that we're moving through. That's why I think we're peaking out, this will be overlap quarter. But coming down, Matt, we're talking tens of millions of dollars. We're not talking hundreds of millions of dollars. We're talking hundreds of FTEs and thousands of FTEs, it's really more a settling kind of a moment. Probably more what to remain to that is as long as we can grow our loans, and it is a kind of level we have high quality loans, I can say that twice, high-quality loans because that's an issue now, and we can outrun that even if margins stays flat, it was that 2:1 on expenses. We can grow expenses and grow revenue and still have positive operating leverage and we're still shooting a fourth for 2016 then we can still make money. The challenge I have is whether we wanted to dispense any of those efficiency space back into the bank of whether I want to steal them away and put them to the bottom line. And we're doing both. And so you'll hear in Kathy's comment that we're going to continue to move forward with our reputation in brand strategy and advertising plan, which will cost us probably another $20 million to $25 million in the next quarter. And we're going to stick with it and we're going to get this thing done and get our story out there as we think it deserves to be told. And that's just a small fraction of the money we save on our efficiency program. And we're not give going to give you a final number. 2 years ago in February, so was that 26 months ago, we put on the FTE freeze on things were less important and required. A year ago, we put on the all other -- watchful eye on other expenses and assets saved tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars on our annual run rate, most of which we're putting back to you to keep our efficiency where it is, but some of which we're back into the company. But as to your original question, we can grow both and we're thoughtful about it, but we expect that the cost of expenses will be measured more by FTE and the necessary jobs to have to be complicated -- accomplished than we will anything else and still be going to be technology."

And same-store sales was down a little bit in North America versus Europe for sure, maybe about 2% versus 2.5% or so the last few quarters. So the consumer was a little bit more caution in the first quarter, spend was a little bit dumb. But I would expect to continue to have even at that level of growth in the range adjusted again for FX in that 5% to 6% range on a go-forward basis per merchant. On the card side of the equation, that was a little higher because of the purchase of the Fidelity acquisition that we talked about. If you adjust that out, we're talking to about 6.5%, and I would expect growth again in that range. That's also going to be driven by same-store sales and then what's happening, so to speak, with what our customers are doing. We're seeing a modest growth there, but nothing substantial, neither up nor down in that category. And then finally, you didn't ask, but I'll just give you the corporate payment side of the equation. 2 big moving pieces there. The first is on the government side of the equation, which is actually down almost 6%, 5.7% on a year-over-year basis. That's principally due to the feds spending going down. And on the flip side of the equation, corporate spend was actually up a bit, almost the exact same amount, 5.7%. And interestingly, we're seeing there, while companies continue to be very conservatives the spend, payable spend is actually starting to increase, which is a positive side."

You're right, a 54% is higher than we have been in a long time I know you know this, but I'll say that again, we don't set a target. It's a result because we keep our revenue and expenses and always try to go revenue over expenses when possible. The 300 basis points in the last few years is not only -- are not surprising, but I think it's actually much better than it could have been, given the fact that it was a 0 interest rate increase up until last quarter. And with a very slow steady almost not recovering economy, we have obviously been taking market share and high-quality customers and been able to offset that margin compression. So I'm naturally pretty pleased with it, but I do think we said it's going to be coming down slightly next quarter, so we're telegraphing to you all that this will be a high watermark for the year, it also was the high watermark last year. I think it's always the high water mark because quarter 1 is, by far, our weakest quarter. It will come down on that basis. But Mike, when 2 things have to happen, I don't know which one is more valuable. One is that the economy just needs to get stronger, and we got to be doing all fashion for people want to grow and acquire and organic anything that we haven't done in a long time in this industry. That will be huge. The second thing will be that we enjoy interest rate increases or a steeper yield curve. They are also both quite important, right, because interest rates not moving up will harm some of the projections for the industry. But make sure you guys are watching the slope of the curve too, right? As the high end came up -- the low end -- the short and came up, the long end came done, and that has the same kind of impact on interest income that you would see on lack of rate movement. So nothing is gone in our industry's favor in the last 5 years to improve an efficiency ratio. So we're holding on with dear life with this effort, but we think we can outrun expense growth by revenue. But I do think that the 54.6% is a high watermark for us. And we're not loving it, but we're also, by the same token, I'm not trying to patronize you, guys, give you guys a 52% by suffocating the company and not investing and then living later on to explain myself 2 years from now why we didn't invest and why we didn't make the decisions we should have. So I'd like the way you asked the question. There is a possibility more to give better. In terms of M&A, we're always interested, particularly in the payments in trust business. You are reminded that with the AML consent order, we're disallowed from looking at whole bank transactions. And again, it's okay right now because we haven't found what we wish you could have had, but there's nothing we've lost that we would have otherwise thought. But we want to move through that order as soon as we can so that we can get back to the provisions, which I think will be starting next year. And I've said this many times before, we're kind of a statute of any all these should be away and gone from any acquisition, such that when you buy something, you know what you're buying and you don't buy all problems that you can possibly detected in due diligence. So we're still hungry for that. It's not going to make or break this company because we're not going to change who we are with the mix of business, but we are always on the lookout for big opportunities, the fidelity, the portfolio, the auto club portfolio. You'll see more of those and, hopefully, more margin portfolios, particularly overseas."

And Neil is certainly fits that bill, but he comes in with a deal need to want to open the question again on too big to fail. I've met with him. I knew him in the TARP program. As you recall, we're the last big bank to take TARP and didn't want to. We are the first bank to payback it back. We did. I had a long conversation with him over that period of time. And as soon as he showed up, Dick, here in the first of the year, Andy and I went to meet with him to introduce ourselves in his new role and did a very good conversation. And I believe and I can say that the Fed here, and we have working relationship that couldn't be better than it is anywhere else. So that's a backdrop. I don't think he's coming with his gun sights on U.S. bank. In fact, I'm sure he's not. We have not -- he's not invited any banks in symposiums yet. He has not indicated yet when that will be, but I know we'll have that opportunity. My guess, I have private conversation with him routinely and his team, and so I'm not feeling left out to be able to offer my thoughts on some of his considerations. And at the end of the day, I'm going to take him to his word, but he's probably has been towards investigating too big to fail. He is going to collect a lot of good data, and I think he's going to be balanced in this final decision. He's committed publicly to have a recommendations to defend by years end on what he says could be done to improve the safety and soundness of banks. At these early stages, he's focused on capital, he's focused on size, but I think he'll have to spend the rest of the year bringing in all kinds of different parties to speak, including is coming on May 16th at his second symposium. So I'm not feeling that he set himself up yet to suggest that U.S. Bank is in his gun sights. I don't think any actions we take would be either harmful to him nor affected by his opinion. As you know, the local Fed has the large jurisdictions over its banks, but a great deal of things like the stress test and the incentive compensation bills and things are also managed at the Washington level, along with the local. So our relationship with Washington, which is quite good, and local, is important to me and I want to make sure that we're call operating in transparency. At this point, I appreciate the approach. I welcome people coming with ideas. I'm certainly showing my thoughts and when I have the opportunity, it would be an appropriate for me to take a position and argue the merits of going on in collecting more feedback and there are probably are some number of pundits that do believe the banks need to continue to be safer and more sound. I think we've accomplished the main thing level of success there, and I think the bank of our size is exactly the kind of size that most people that content our terms around. I can get my arms around this one, profit this is the perfect size thing, kind of the Goldilocks of banks. But I'm welcoming his new ideas and his energy, but I'm not sure on having the opportunity to share my thoughts with him just simply that in a public forum."

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.
I'll begin a review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $0.76 per diluted common share. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we announced that U.S. Bank became the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments rewards card program. And as part of that arrangement, we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 million, which is reflected in the company's average loan growth for this quarter.
I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. Once again, we delivered industry-leading profitability. Our average loan growth exceeded the high end of our 1% to 1.5% range, and the payments business remained strong. Total average loans grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and 5.2% year-over-year, adjusted for the retail card acquisition. Total average deposit growth remained strong, growing 6.3% over the previous year, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%.
We were affected by a broader market condition, most notably related to the energy sector. While our energy portfolio is a relatively small portion of our company's overall loan portfolio at just 1.3% of total loans, the deterioration in this sector has impacted certain credit metrics. This has resulted in the recognition of additional reserves of $15 million higher net charge-offs during the first quarter. I'd like to highlight that, excluding the energy portfolio, the credit quality for the company remains strong, which is reflected by our stable charge-off rates. Net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans were 48 basis points, up 1 basis point from the prior quarter. Additionally, the company has found improvement in nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio.
Although the company's total nonperforming assets increased 12.9% over the prior quarter, nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio, improved 4.1%, reflecting the improvements particularly in our retail portfolios. For instance, residential mortgages continue to benefit from improving real estate values, which has helped to partially offset the increase in the energy loan reserve.
Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. Moving to the graph on the right: This quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was unchanged from the prior quarter, as expected. The benefit we recognized from the increase in short-term rates was offset by the continued shift in our loan portfolio mix. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 54.6%, relatively stable from a year ago and up from the fourth quarter as expected due to the seasonality of our businesses. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to balance decisions about operating costs with investments in our franchise.
We remain focused on our efficiency efforts, as they provide opportunity to invest in our businesses and in technology to meet our customers' needs. For example, during the first quarter, we launched realtime person-to-person payments on the clearXchange network. And we continue to invest in enhancements in our mobile banking application. We were pleased to be named as mobile leader by Corporate Insight in March, which acknowledges our commitment to being a leader in the rapidly changing landscape of banking technology.
Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total revenue of $5 billion in the first quarter, a $131 million or a 2.7% increase from the prior year. The revenue growth we are seeing is primarily being driven by core loan growth as well as strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments business.
Kathy will now provide you with more details about the first quarter results."

Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion or 5.2% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis, both adjusted for the retail card acquisition. In the first quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.2%. Consumer loans again showed positive momentum, led by credit card growth of 13.6% year-over-year, which included the retail card acquisition.  Residential mortgage loan growth was also strong, increasing $2.8 billion or 5.4% year-over-year. And finally, the momentum in our home equity portfolio continued, resulting in a year-over-year increase of $471 million or 3%.
On a linked-quarter basis, our core loan growth of 1.6%, excluding the card acquisition, was again driven by total commercial loan growth of $3 billion or 3.5%, the strongest linked-quarter growth for 5 -- for the previous 5 quarters; and growth in residential mortgages of $1.2 billion or 2.3%. We currently expect linked-quarter average loan growth to approximate 1.5% in the second quarter.
Total average deposits increased $17 billion or 6.3% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and were up modestly on a linked-quarter basis. The linked-quarter growth in the first quarter of every year is affected by seasonal factors, notably in our corporate trust business line. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to show strong growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and low-cost interest checking. Money market and savings deposits also remained strong year-over-year, more than offsetting the run-off and higher-cost time deposits.
Let me now turn to Slide 7. As Richard mentioned, challenges in the energy sector affected some of our credit metrics in the first quarter. However, credit quality in the core portfolio, excluding energy, remained stable. First quarter net charge-offs increased $36 million or 12.9% compared with the prior year. Net charge-offs were $10 million or 3.3% higher than the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the first quarter, up 1 basis point compared with the fourth quarter.
Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased 1.4%. On a linked-quarter basis, nonperforming assets increased by 12.9%. The increases were entirely due to the downgrades of energy-related credits. Excluding energy-related loans, nonperforming assets decreased 4.1% on a linked-quarter basis.
Turning to Slide 8, let me now provide some additional color around our energy exposure. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $3.4 billion of our commercial loans were to customers in energy-related businesses. Energy-related loans are 1.3% of our total loans. Our energy loan commitments were $11.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016, down slightly on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. During the quarter, we recognized $138 million of reserves related to the energy portfolio, and the reserve for energy loan now stands at 9.1% of outstanding balances at the end of the first quarter of 2016. This compares with the 5.4% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015.
Finally, approximately 43% of our energy commitments and 17% of our outstanding energy loans are to investment-grade companies.
Given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we currently expect linked-quarter net charge-offs and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the second quarter of 2016.
Slide 9 gives you a view of our first quarter results versus comparable periods. First quarter net income decreased by $45 million or 3.1% on a year-over-year basis. Improvement in operating income was offset by higher loan-loss provision and higher income taxes. The higher tax rate was primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters that benefited tax expense in the first quarter of 2015. On a linked-quarter basis, net income declined by $90 million or 6.1%, mainly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, an increase in the provision for credit loss due to energy and the impacts of the previously reported fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of the Health Savings Account deposit portfolio.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased by $136 million or 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was offset by the impact of a 2 basis points decline in net interest margin to 3.06%. The modest year-over-year decline in margin percentage primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rates offset by loan mix shift and lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio.
Net interest income increased by $17 million or 0.6% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in average earning assets and the impact of higher short-term rates were partially offset by the impact of fewer days in the quarter. We currently expect linked -- net interest margin in the second quarter to be relatively stable and linked-quarter net interest income to increase modestly.
Slide 11 highlights noninterest income, which decreased $5 million or 0.2% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher payments revenue and higher trust and investment management fees.
Continued strength in the payment business is reflected in our results. Credit and debit card revenue grew by $25 million or 10.4%, reflecting higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolio. Sales volumes, excluding the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition, were up 6.4% year-over-year, an improvement from the 6% year-over-year growth delivered in the fourth quarter.
Merchant processing services revenue increased by $14 million or 3.9%. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency rate changes, year-over-year merchant processing services revenue growth would have been approximately 6.4%. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip and card technology requirements. Equipment sales related to chip card technology continued to trend modestly lower versus growth reported in prior periods.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $191 million or 8.2% principally due to seasonally lower fee-based revenues, along with the impact of the fourth quarter HSA deposit sale. As expected, our payment fees and deposit service charges declined due to seasonality in those businesses.  Mortgage banking revenues also declined as expected, principally due to lower rates impacting the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights. We expect linked-quarter mortgage fees to increase 10% to 20% based on seasonally higher application volume.
Moving to Slide 12. Noninterest expense was $84 million or 3.2% higher on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense, primarily driven by merit increases; and higher compliance and acquisition costs were partially offset by lower pension expense and an insurance recovery recognized during the quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense decreased by $60 million or 2.1%. Seasonally lower costs related to investments and tax-advantaged projects and lower professional services expenses, along with the insurance recovery, were partially offset by seasonally higher benefits expense and higher variable compensation. The variable compensation expense includes costs related to an all-employee grant that was issued in the first quarter. We expect linked-quarter expenses to increase in quarter 2, driven by expected seasonality and higher expenses related to our brand positioning that was launched in the first quarter. Additionally, we expect professional services related to compliance to peak in the second quarter and then modestly declining as costs related to our residential mortgage default consent order concludes.
Our efficiency ratio is expected to decline slightly in the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 13. As Richard mentioned, our capital position remained strong. And in the first quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach that's fully implemented March 31 was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to 17.94 at March 31, representing an 8.7% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.9% increase over the prior quarter.
I will now turn the call back to Richard."

Yes, the clearXchange and the EWS partnership that you've read about with some of the large banks has been an important step to get us into a combined effort so that we can all work on something that banks have controlled for years, which is the payments network and the ACH system. So we're making progress. And I think, as an industry, you'd be proud that we haven't lost our position. We haven't given it up, and we're not going to sit idly by while nonbanks come in and take over the position. So the first couple of products you saw, some from us, are just a peek into the future. I will tell you that the appetite for the consumers is higher than for business on some of these higher-value products because they're eager to change and try new things. And businesses are more cautious and more careful. Think blockchain, moving from ledger to eventually payments and things like that. So we're pleased with what we see. The issue and other thing [ph] before you, though, and our investors is when you get paid for this. And we -- there's already a bit of a discord between us and the other banks that came out with one of the paid -- realtime payments P2P, where we're charging for it and they're not. And so the issue we have to ask ourselves is, will consumers and eventually businesses pay for a circumstance that they don't have value for today? Will they pay 4 times [ph]? This is going to be an [indiscernible] number, and you will pay for primed to have certain privileges and speed. They'll do it there, so we're hoping they'll do it here in the payments world. We have to make sure that the business of banking doesn't become a utility in the minds of the consumers where they expect everything to come without a value price to it, and we're hoping that we'll be able to help set the standard for that. But that's my hope. And then there'll be plenty more opportunities to hear what consumers and the businesses want delivered to them, and frankly, I think we'll surprise them because it's been so long: this old paradigm of overnight settlement, closed on weekends and all of that. I think they'll be quite pleased to see some of the progress we're making. I'd like to ask Andy to give a little bit more color on it since he's overseeing all of our performance in realtime payments and helping coordinate our own bank's position on that."

If you take a 10-year view, my 10 years at least, the first 5 were higher than wealth as a run rate because we were trying to catch up, and you know that story, and we did that. And now we're back to a steady state. I'd say, in the next few years, there won't be a significant difference in appreciated costs, capital expenditures. They're higher than they used to be because we need to stay at that level, but we've also never cheated the innovation and technology piece in any of those years to have to either catch up or to either ramp down. So our expenses are going to move more likely on the cost of personnel attached with compliance-related activities, which we said will peak in this quarter that we're in. And they sort of rely on just the fact that we're going to continue to have to pay up for making sure that employees have the proper level of compensation. Think of all the minimum wage issues that have been out there and issues like that. So that's going to drive a big part of our expenses. Technology will be at the run rate it is now. And it's going to be very thoughtful, but we're going to continue to apply the efficience we get in one side of it to the opportunity for innovation cost on the other but I don't think we'll add it as to save in the future."

That's good. So when revenue does move, it's kind of 2 for on expenses. We only expect one more interest rate increase in the second half of the year in order for us to accomplish what we pretty much telegraphed to all of you. And if it doesn't, it won't be Armageddon. But it would be something we hope to get. In response to that, expenses, the compliance costs are something that we don't like because they're related to expectations that we didn't have for ourselves. So if there's a consent order, it means you've been deficit in some way. One of the ways to fix that is to bring in, well, third parties; and to bulk-up your staffing. And then you'll come back down to a more normalized level. I will say our compliance costs and FTE have really nearly tripled in the last 5 years. We did that review for our board just yesterday. And I will just say probably 2/3 of that would have been present, anyway, consent orders or not. So it's not like just an order peaks you out and you never come back down, but there is a run rate impact. So as we finish the mortgage consent order, this quarter wraps up in its completion. And then we move into now the AML/BSA consent order that we're moving through. That's where I think we're peaking out this with the overlap quarter, but coming down, Matt, we're talking tens of millions of dollars. We're not talking hundreds of millions of dollars. We're talking hundreds of FTE, not thousands of FTE. It's really more a settling kind of a moment. Probably more germane to that is, as long as we can grow our loans at I think the kind of level we have then, high-quality loans, I can say that twice, high-quality loans, because that's been an issue now, and we can outrun that even if margin stays flat, and with that 2:1 on expenses, we can grow expenses and grow revenue and still have positive operating leverage. And we're still shooting for it for 2016. And we can still make money. The challenge I have is whether I want to dispense any of those efficiency stage [ph] back into the bank or whether only I want to steal them away and put them to the bottom line. And we're doing both. And so you'll hear in Kathy's comments that we're going to continue to move forward with our reputation and brand strategy and advertising plan, which will cost us probably another $20 million to $25 million in the next quarter, and we're going to stick with it. And we're going to get this thing done and get our story out there, as we think it deserves to be told. And that's just a small fraction of the money we've saved on our efficiency program. And well, I'm not going to give you a final number. 2 years ago, in February, so what's that, 26 months ago, we put on the FTE freeze on things that were less important and required. A year ago, we put on the all-other -- watchful eye on other expenses. And that has saved tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars on our annual run rate, most of which we're putting back to you to keep our efficiency where it is but some of which we're putting back into the company. But as to your original question: We can grow both. And we're thoughtful about it, but we can expect that the cost of expenses will be measured more by FTE and the necessary jobs that have to be complicated -- accomplished than we will anything else, and so is going to be technology."

So the consumer was a little bit more cautious in the first quarter. Spending was a little bit down, but I would expect to continue to have even at that levels growth in the range -- adjusted again for FX, in that 5% to 6% range on a go-forward basis for merchant. On the card side of the equation, that was a little higher because of the purchase the -- of the Fidelity acquisition that we talked about. If you adjust that out, we're talking of about 6%, 6.5%. And I would expect growth again in that range. That's also going to be driven by same-store sales; and then what's happening, so to speak, with what customers are doing. And we're seeing modest growth there but nothing substantial, neither up nor down in that category. And then finally, you didn't ask, but I'll just give you the corporate payment side of the equation, 2 big moving pieces there. The first is on the government side of the equation, which is actually down almost 6%, 5.7%, on a year-over-year basis. That's principally due to defense spending going down. And on the flip side of the equation, corporate spend was actually up a bit almost the exact same amount, 5.7%. And interesting, we're seeing there, while companies continue to be very conservative as relates the P&E [ph] spend, payables spend is actually starting to increase, which is a positive sign."

I know you know this, but I'll say it again: We don't set a target. It's a result because we keep watching our revenue and our expenses and always try to grow revenue over expenses when possible. 300 basis points in the last few years is not only -- are not surprising, but I think it's actually much better than it could have been given the fact it was a 0 interest rate increase up until last quarter. And with a very slow, steady, almost not recovering economy, we have obviously been taking market share and high-quality customers and been able to offset some of that margin compression. So I'm actually pretty pleased with it, but I do think we said it's going to be coming down slightly next quarter, so we're telegraphing to you all that this will be a high watermark for the year. It also was the high watermark last year. I think it's always the high water mark because quarter 1 is by far our weakest quarter. It'll come down on that basis, but Mike, when -- 2 things have to happen, and I don't know which one is more valuable. One is that the economy just needs to get stronger. And we've got to be doing old-fashion lending for people who want to grow and acquire and organic kind of things that we haven't done in a long time in this industry. That'll be huge. The second thing will be that we enjoy interest rate increases or a steeper yield curve. They're also both quite important, right, because interest rates not moving up will harm some of the projections for the industry. But make sure you guys are watching the slope of the curve too, right? As the high end came up -- the low end -- the short end came up, the long end came down. And that has the same kind of impact on interest income that you would see on a lack of rate movement. So nothing's gone in our industry's favor in the last 5 years to improve an efficiency ratio, so we're holding on for dear life with this effort that we think we can outrun expense growth by revenue. But I do think that the 54.6% is a high watermark for us. And we're not loving it, but we're -- also by the same token, I'm not trying to patronize you guys and give you guys a 52% by suffocating the company and not investing and then living later on to explain myself 2 years from now why we didn't invest and why we didn't make the decisions we should have. So I like the way you asked the question. There is a possibility for it to get better. In terms of M&A, we're always interested, particularly in the payments and trust business. You are reminded that, with the AML consent order, we're disallowed from looking at whole bank transactions. And again, it's okay right now because we haven't found what we wish we could have had and there's nothing we've lost that we would have otherwise sought. But we want to move through that order as soon as we can so we can get back to the permissions, which I think will be starting next year. And I've said this many times before: We're kind of the statute of any -- all these limitations should be away and gone from any acquisition such that, when you buy somebody, you know what you're buying and you don't buy old problems that you can possibly have detected in due diligence. So we're still hungry for that. It's not going to make or break this company because we're not going to change who we are or the mix of business, but we are always on the lookout for big opportunities. The Fidelity, the portfolio; the Auto Club portfolio, you'll see more of those; and hopefully, more merchant portfolios, particularly overseas."

As you all probably know but I'll remind you, that the hiring of the President is left to a layman board, particularly local leaders who have parameters, of course, but they do bring in people that have -- in some cases, are not economists. And Neel Kashkari is -- certainly fits that bill, but he comes in with a zeal and a need to want to open the question again on too big to fail. I have met with him. I knew him in the TARP program. As you'll recall, we were the last big bank to take TARP. I didn't want to. We were the first bank to pay it back. I'm glad we did. I'd had long conversations with him over that period of time. And as soon as he showed uptick here in the 1st of the year, Andy and I went to meet with him to introduce ourselves in this new role, and we had a very good conversation. And I believe and I can say that's the Fed here, all right? And we have a working relationship that couldn't be better than it is anywhere else. So with that as a backdrop, I don't think he's coming in with his gunsights on U.S. Bank. And in fact, I'm sure he's not. We have not -- he's not invited any banks to his symposiums yet. He hasn't indicated yet when that will be, but I know we'll have that opportunity. My guess, I have private conversations with him routinely and with his team, so I'm not feeling left out of being able to offer my thoughts on some of his considerations. And at the end of the day, I'm going to take him to his word, but he's -- probably has a bent towards investigating too big to fail. He is going to collect a lot of good data. And I think he's going to be balanced in his final decision. He's committed publicly to have a recommendation to the Fed by year's end on what he thinks could be done to improve the safety and soundness of banks. At these early stages, he's focused on capital. He's focused on size, but I think he'll have to spend the rest of the year bringing in all kinds of different parties to speak, including Bernanke, who's coming on May 16 at his second symposium. So I'm not feeling that he set himself up yet to suggest that U.S. Bank is in his gunsights. I don't think any actions we take would be either harmful to him, nor I think affected by his opinion. As you know, the local Fed has a large jurisdiction over its banks, but a great deal of things like the stress tests and the [indiscernible] incentive compensation rules and things are also managed at the Washington level, along with the local. So our relationship with Washington, which is quite good, and local is important to me. And I want to make sure that we're all operating in transparency. So at this point, I appreciate his approach. I welcome people coming with ideas. I'm certainly sharing my thoughts when I have the opportunity. It would be inappropriate, I think, for me to take a problem [ph] position and argue the merits of going on and collecting more feedback. And there probably are some number of pundits that do believe that banks need to continue to be safer and more sound. I think we've accomplished an amazing level of success there, and I think a bank our size is exactly the kind of size it's most important to get their arms around. I can get my arms around this one, and I'm going to continue to profit. So this is the perfect-size bank, kind of the Goldilocks of banks. But I'm welcoming his new ideas and his energy, but I'm not sure on having the opportunity to share my thoughts with him, just simply not in a public forum."

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.
I'll begin a review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $0.76 per diluted common share. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we announced that U.S. Bank became the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments rewards card program. And as part of that arrangement, we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 million, which is reflected in the company's average loan growth for this quarter.
I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. Once again, we delivered industry-leading profitability. Our average loan growth exceeded the high end of our 1% to 1.5% range, and the payments business remained strong. Total average loans grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and 5.2% year-over-year, adjusted for the retail card acquisition. Total average deposit growth remained strong, growing 6.3% over the previous year, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%.
We were affected by a broader market condition, most notably related to the energy sector. While our energy portfolio is a relatively small portion of our company's overall loan portfolio at just 1.3% of total loans, the deterioration in this sector has impacted certain credit metrics. This has resulted in the recognition of additional reserves of $15 million higher net charge-offs during the first quarter. I'd like to highlight that, excluding the energy portfolio, the credit quality for the company remains strong, which is reflected by our stable charge-off rates. Net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans were 48 basis points, up 1 basis point from the prior quarter. Additionally, the company has found improvement in nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio.
Although the company's total nonperforming assets increased 12.9% over the prior quarter, nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio, improved 4.1%, reflecting the improvements particularly in our retail portfolios. For instance, residential mortgages continue to benefit from improving real estate values, which has helped to partially offset the increase in the energy loan reserve.
Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. Moving to the graph on the right, this quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was unchanged from the prior quarter, as expected. The benefit we recognized from the increase in short-term rates was offset by the continued shift in our loan portfolio mix. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 54.6%, relatively stable from a year ago and up from the fourth quarter as expected due to the seasonality of our businesses. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to balance decisions about operating costs with investments in our franchise.
We remain focused on our efficiency efforts, as they provide opportunity to invest in our businesses and in technology to meet our customers' needs. For example, during the first quarter, we launched realtime person-to-person payments on the clearXchange network. And we continue to invest in enhancements in our mobile banking application. We were pleased to be named as Mobile Leader by Corporate Insight in March, which acknowledges our commitment to being a leader in the rapidly changing landscape of banking technology.
Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total revenue of $5 billion in the first quarter, a $131 million or a 2.7% increase from the prior year. The revenue growth we are seeing is primarily being driven by core loan growth as well as strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments business.
Kathy will now provide you with more details about the first quarter results."

Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion or 5.2% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis, both adjusted for the retail card acquisition. In the first quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.2%. Consumer loans again showed positive momentum, led by credit card growth of 13.6% year-over-year, which included the retail card acquisition.  Residential mortgage loan growth was also strong, increasing $2.8 billion or 5.4% year-over-year. And finally, the momentum in our home equity portfolio continued, resulting in a year-over-year increase of $471 million or 3%.
On a linked-quarter basis, our core loan growth of 1.6%, excluding the card acquisition, was again driven by total commercial loan growth of $3 billion or 3.5%, the strongest linked-quarter growth for 5 -- for the previous 5 quarters; and growth in residential mortgages of $1.2 billion or 2.3%. We currently expect linked-quarter average loan growth to approximate 1.5% in the second quarter.
Total average deposits increased $17 billion, or 6.3%, compared with the first quarter of 2015 and were up modestly on a linked-quarter basis. The linked-quarter growth in the first quarter of every year is affected by seasonal factors, notably in our corporate trust business line. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to show strong growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and low-cost interest checking. Money market and savings deposits also remained strong year-over-year, more than offsetting the run-off and higher-cost time deposits.
Let me now turn to Slide 7. As Richard mentioned, challenges in the energy sector affected some of our credit metrics in the first quarter. However, credit quality in the core portfolio, excluding energy, remained stable. First quarter net charge-offs increased $36 million or 12.9% compared with the prior year. Net charge-offs were $10 million or 3.3% higher than the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the first quarter, up 1 basis point compared with the fourth quarter.
Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased 1.4%. On a linked-quarter basis, nonperforming assets increased by 12.9%. The increases were entirely due to the downgrades of energy-related credits. Excluding energy-related loans, nonperforming assets decreased 4.1% on a linked-quarter basis.
Turning to Slide 8, let me now provide some additional color around our energy exposure. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $3.4 billion of our commercial loans were to customers in energy-related businesses. Energy-related loans are 1.3% of our total loans. Our energy loan commitments were $11.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016, down slightly on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. During the quarter, we recognized $138 million of reserves related to the energy portfolio, and the reserve for energy loan now stands at 9.1% of outstanding balances at the end of the first quarter of 2016. This compares with the 5.4% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015.
Finally, approximately 43% of our energy commitments and 17% of our outstanding energy loans are to investment-grade companies.
Given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we currently expect linked-quarter net charge-offs and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the second quarter of 2016.
Slide 9 gives you a view of our first quarter results versus comparable periods. First quarter net income decreased by $45 million or 3.1% on a year-over-year basis. Improvement in operating income was offset by higher loan-loss provision and higher income taxes. The higher tax rate was primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters that benefited tax expense in the first quarter of 2015. On a linked-quarter basis, net income declined by $90 million or 6.1%, mainly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, an increase in the provision for credit loss due to energy and the impacts of the previously reported fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of the Health Savings Account deposit portfolio.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased by $136 million or 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was offset by the impact of a 2 basis points decline in net interest margin to 3.06%. The modest year-over-year decline in margin percentage primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rates offset by loan mix shift and lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio.
Net interest income increased by $17 million or 0.6% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in average earning assets and the impact of higher short-term rates were partially offset by the impact of fewer days in the quarter. We currently expect linked -- net interest margin in the second quarter to be relatively stable and linked-quarter net interest income to increase modestly.
Slide 11 highlights noninterest income, which decreased $5 million or 0.2% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher payments revenue and higher trust and investment management fees.
Continued strength in the payment business is reflected in our results. Credit and debit card revenue grew by $25 million or 10.4%, reflecting higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolio. Sales volumes, excluding the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition, were up 6.4% year-over-year, an improvement from the 6% year-over-year growth delivered in the fourth quarter.
Merchant processing services revenue increased by $14 million or 3.9%. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency rate changes, year-over-year merchant processing services revenue growth would have been approximately 6.4%. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip and card technology requirements. Equipment sales related to chip card technology continued to trend modestly lower versus growth reported in prior periods.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $191 million or 8.2% principally due to seasonally lower fee-based revenues, along with the impact of the fourth quarter HSA deposit sale. As expected, our payment fees and deposit service charges declined due to seasonality in those businesses.  Mortgage banking revenues also declined as expected, principally due to lower rates impacting the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights. We expect linked-quarter mortgage fees to increase 10% to 20% based on seasonally higher application volume.
Moving to Slide 12. Noninterest expense was $84 million or 3.2% higher on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense, primarily driven by merit increases; and higher compliance and acquisition costs were partially offset by lower pension expense and an insurance recovery recognized during the quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense decreased by $60 million or 2.1%. Seasonally lower costs related to investments and tax-advantaged projects and lower professional services expenses, along with the insurance recovery, were partially offset by seasonally higher benefits expense and higher variable compensation. The variable compensation expense includes costs related to an all-employee grant that was issued in the first quarter. We expect linked-quarter expenses to increase in Quarter 2, driven by expected seasonality and higher expenses related to our brand positioning that was launched in the first quarter. Additionally, we expect professional services related to compliance to peak in the second quarter and then modestly declining as costs related to our residential mortgage default consent order concludes.
Our efficiency ratio is expected to decline slightly in the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 13. As Richard mentioned, our capital position remained strong. And in the first quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach that's fully implemented March 31 was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to 17.94 at March 31, representing an 8.7% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.9% increase over the prior quarter.
I will now turn the call back to Richard."

Richard, we've been talking quite a bit over the past several conference calls around the efforts underway to drive realtime payments.

So we're making progress. And I think, as an industry, you'd be proud that we haven't lost our position. We haven't given it up, and we're not going to sit idly by while nonbanks come in and take over the position. So the first couple of products you saw, some from us, are just a peek into the future. I will tell you that the appetite for the consumers is higher than for business on some of these higher-value products because they're eager to change and try new things. And businesses are more cautious and more careful. Think block-chain, moving from ledger to eventually payments and things like that. So we're pleased with what we see. The issue I want to bring before you, though, and our investors is: When do you get paid for this? And we -- there's already a bit of a discord between us and the other banks that came out with one of the paid -- realtime payments P2P, where we're charging for it and they're not. And so the issue we have to ask ourselves is: Will consumers and eventually businesses pay for a circumstance that they don't have value for today? Will they pay for time? Will there be an amortization -- a member, and you will pay for prime to have certain privileges and speed. They'll do it there, so we're hoping they'll do it here in the payments world. We have to make sure that the business of banking doesn't become a utility in the minds of the consumers where they expect everything to come without a value price to it, and we're hoping that we'll be able to help set the standard for that. But that's my hope. And then there'll be plenty more opportunities to hear what consumers and the businesses want delivered to them, and frankly, I think we'll surprise them because it's been so long, this old paradigm of overnight settlement, closed on weekends and all of that. I think they'll be quite pleased to see some of the progress we're making. I'd like to ask Andy to give a little bit more color on it since he's overseeing all of our performance in realtime payments and helping coordinate our own bank's position on that."

And now we're back to a steady state. I'd say, in the next few years, there won't be a significant difference in appreciated costs, capital expenditures. They're higher than they used to be because we need to stay at that level, but we've also never cheated the innovation and technology piece in any of those years to have to either catch up or to either ramp down. So our expenses are going to move more likely on the cost of personnel attached with compliance-related activities, which we said will peak in this quarter that we're in. And they sort of rely on just the fact that we're going to continue to have to pay up for making sure that employees have the proper level of compensation. Think of all the minimum wage issues that have been out there and issues like that. So that's going to drive a big part of our expenses. Technology will be at the run rate it is now. And it's going to be very thoughtful, but we're going to continue to apply the efficience we get in one side of it to the opportunity for innovation cost on the other but I don't think we'll add it as to save in the future."

That's good. So when revenue does move, it's kind of 2 for on expenses. We only expect one more interest rate increase in the second half of the year in order for us to accomplish what we pretty much telegraphed to all of you. And if it doesn't, it won't be Armageddon. But it would be something we hope to get. In response to that, expenses, the compliance costs are something that we don't like because they're related to expectations that we didn't have for ourselves. So if there's a consent order, it means you've been deficit in some way. One of the ways to fix that is to bring in, well, third parties, then to bulk-up your staffing. And then you'll come back down to a more normalized level. I will say our compliance costs and FTE have really nearly tripled in the last 5 years. We did that review for our board just yesterday. And I will just say probably 2/3 of that would have been present, anyway, consent orders or not. So it's not like just an order peaks you out and you never come back down, but there is a run rate impact. So as we finish the mortgage consent order, this quarter wraps up in its completion. And then we move into now the AML/BSA consent order that we're moving through. That's where I think we're peaking out this with the overlap quarter, but coming down, Matt, we're talking tens of millions of dollars. We're not talking hundreds of millions of dollars. We're talking hundreds of FTE, not thousands of FTE. It's really more a settling kind of a moment. Probably more germane to that is, as long as we can grow our loans at I think the kind of level we have then, high-quality loans, I can say that twice, high-quality loans, because that's been an issue now, and we can outrun that even if margin stays flat, and with that 2:1 on expenses, we can grow expenses and grow revenue and still have positive operating leverage. And we're still shooting for it for 2016. And we can still make money. The challenge I have is whether I want to dispense any of those efficiency stays back into the bank, or whether only I want to steal them away and put them to the bottom line. And we're doing both. And so you'll hear in Kathy's comments that we're going to continue to move forward with our reputation and brand strategy and advertising plan, which will cost us probably another $20 million to $25 million in the next quarter, and we're going to stick with it. And we're going to get this thing done and get our story out there, as we think it deserves to be told. And that's just a small fraction of the money we've saved on our efficiency program. And well, I'm not going to give you a final number. 2 years ago, in February, so what's that, 26 months ago, we put on the FTE freeze on things that were less important and required. A year ago, we put on the all-other -- watchful eye on other expenses. And that has saved tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars on our annual run rate, most of which we're putting back to you to keep our efficiency where it is but some of which we're putting back into the company. But as to your original question: We can grow both. And we're thoughtful about it, but we can expect that the cost of expenses will be measured more by FTE and the necessary jobs that have to be complicated -- accomplished than we will anything else, and so is going to be technology."

So add that to your thinking. While loans will still grow, commercial real estate will be flattish, protecting the good customers we have."

So the consumer was a little bit more cautious in the first quarter. Spending was a little bit down, but I would expect to continue to have even at that levels growth in the range -- adjusted again for FX, in that 5% to 6% range on a go-forward basis for merchant. On the card side of the equation, that was a little higher because of the purchase the -- of the Fidelity acquisition that we talked about. If you adjust that out, we're talking of about 6%, 6.5%. And I would expect growth again in that range. That's also going to be driven by same-store sales; and then what's happening, so to speak, with what customers are doing. And we're seeing modest growth there but nothing substantial, neither up nor down in that category. And then finally, you didn't ask, but I'll just give you the corporate payment side of the equation, 2 big moving pieces there: the first is on the government side of the equation, which is actually down almost 6%, 5.7%, on a year-over-year basis. That's principally due to defense spending going down. And on the flip side of the equation, corporate spend was actually up a bit almost the exact same amount, 5.7%.

I know you know this, but I'll say it again: We don't set a target. It's a result because we keep watching our revenue and our expenses and always try to grow revenue over expenses when possible. 300 basis points in the last few years is not only -- are not surprising, but I think it's actually much better than it could have been given the fact it was a 0 interest rate increase up until last quarter. And with a very slow, steady, almost not recovering economy, we have obviously been taking market share and high-quality customers and been able to offset some of that margin compression. So I'm actually pretty pleased with it, but I do think we said it's going to be coming down slightly next quarter, so we're telegraphing to you all that this will be a high watermark for the year. It also was the high watermark last year. I think it's always the high water mark because Quarter 1 is by far our weakest quarter. It'll come down on that basis, but Mike, when -- 2 things have to happen, and I don't know which one is more valuable: one, is that the economy just needs to get stronger, and we've got to be doing old-fashion lending for people who want to grow and acquire and organic kind of things that we haven't done in a long time in this industry. That'll be huge; the second thing will be that we enjoy interest rate increases or a steeper yield curve. They're also both quite important, right, because interest rates not moving up will harm some of the projections for the industry. But make sure you guys are watching the slope of the curve too, right? As the high end came up -- the low end -- the short end came up, the long end came down. And that has the same kind of impact on interest income that you would see on a lack of rate movement. So nothing's gone in our industry's favor in the last 5 years to improve an efficiency ratio, so we're holding on for dear life with this effort that we think we can outrun expense growth by revenue. But I do think that the 54.6% is a high watermark for us. And we're not loving it, but we're -- also by the same token, I'm not trying to patronize you guys and give you guys a 52% by suffocating the company and not investing and then living later on to explain myself 2 years from now why we didn't invest and why we didn't make the decisions we should have. So I like the way you asked the question. There is a possibility for it to get better. In terms of M&A, we're always interested, particularly in the payments and trust business. You are reminded that, with the AML consent order, we're disallowed from looking at whole bank transactions. And again, it's okay right now because we haven't found what we wish we could have had and there's nothing we've lost that we would have otherwise sought. But we want to move through that order as soon as we can so we can get back to the permissions, which I think will be starting next year. And I've said this many times before: We're kind of the statute of any -- all these limitations should be away and gone from any acquisition such that, when you buy somebody, you know what you're buying and you don't buy old problems that you can possibly have detected in due diligence. So we're still hungry for that. It's not going to make or break this company because we're not going to change who we are or the mix of business, but we are always on the lookout for big opportunities. The Fidelity, the portfolio; the Auto Club portfolio, you'll see more of those; and hopefully, more merchant portfolios, particularly overseas."

My guess, I have private conversations with him routinely and with his team, so I'm not feeling left out of being able to offer my thoughts on some of his considerations. And at the end of the day, I'm going to take him to his word, but he probably has a bent towards investigating Too Big to Fail. He is going to collect a lot of good data. And I think he's going to be balanced in his final decision. He's committed publicly to have a recommendation to the Fed by year's end on what he thinks could be done to improve the safety and soundness of banks. At these early stages, he's focused on capital. He's focused on size, but I think he'll have to spend the rest of the year bringing in all kinds of different parties to speak, including Bernanke, who's coming on May 16 at his second symposium. So I'm not feeling that he set himself up yet to suggest that U.S. Bank is in his gunsights. I don't think any actions we take would be either harmful to him, nor I think affected by his opinion. As you know, the local Fed has a large jurisdiction over its banks, but a great deal of things like the stress tests and the [indiscernible] incentive compensation rules and things are also managed at the Washington level, along with the local. So our relationship with Washington, which is quite good, and local is important to me. And I want to make sure that we're all operating in transparency. So at this point, I appreciate his approach. I welcome people coming with ideas. I'm certainly sharing my thoughts when I have the opportunity. It would be inappropriate, I think, for me to take a public position and argue the merits of going on and collecting more feedback. And there probably are some number of pundits that do believe that banks need to continue to be safer and more sound. I think we've accomplished an amazing level of success there, and I think a bank our size is exactly the kind of size it's most important to get their arms around. I can get my arms around this one, and I'm going to continue to profit. So this is the perfect-size bank, kind of the Goldilocks of banks. But I'm welcoming his new ideas and his energy, but I'm not sure on having the opportunity to share my thoughts with him, just simply not in a public forum."

I'll a review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of this quarter's highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation.I'm pleased to report that U.S. Bank reported record net income",659,"Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll a review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of this quarter's highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation.
I'm pleased to report that U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $0.83 per diluted common share. The second quarter results include several notable items that together increased earnings per share by $0.01. These notable items include $180 million of equity investment income, primarily the result of our membership in Visa Europe, which has recently sold to Visa Incorporated. Additionally, we've recognized $110 million in accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and a $40 million charitable contribution.
I'm very pleased with our second quarter results where we once again delivered industry-leading profitability and posted record results for revenue, net income and earnings per share on both our reported as well as a quarter basis.
Record revenues were driven by growth in average liked-quarter loans of 1.6% as expected and continued strength in our fee businesses.
While we saw a reduction in our linked-quarter net interest margin as expected, we did report modest linked-quarter growth in net interest income and strong growth in net interest income on a year-over-year basis. 
Total average deposit growth also remained strong at 7.6% versus the previous year and included net income growth -- net new income account growth of 2.8%. 
Credit quality was stable for the second quarter as expected. The net charge-off ratio was unchanged at 48 basis points compared to the previous quarter and the previous year though we recognized a modest improvement in nonperforming assets, which is driven mainly by improvements in the energy credits.
Slide 5 provides you with a 5 quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. 
Moving to the graph on the right, you will see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.02%, 4 basis points lower than the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
The industry continues to face headwinds from well environment on the yield curve, which became more pronounced at the end of the second quarter and continues as we begin the third quarter. The lower long-term rates will have an impact on our second-half results if the rates remained at these low historic levels. We would expect that given the current yield curve, an expectations of the short-term rates will remain flat for the near term, but interest margin -- net interest margin will decline on a linked basis in a range of 3 to 4 basis points. However, we also expect net interest income to increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by increase in earning assets. 
Expenses, excluding the notable items, increased 3.4% at the bottom end of our expected range, and our efficiency ratio improved to 54% versus 54.6% in the period [ph] of this [ph] quarter. 
As projected, quarter 2 expenses included a linked-quarter increase in market expense related to the investment our brand advertising and also reflect the expected peak in our compliance-related costs. 
As we look out to the second half of the year, we expect expenses to grow, however, the rate of growth will be lower than the 3.4% linked-quarter growth reported in the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. The corporate reported record net revenue of $5.4 million in the second quarter. Excluding the VC Europe sales, revenue increased $226 million or 4.5% from the prior year. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by core loan growth as well as strength in the number of our fee-based businesses including our payments, mortgage and wealth management businesses. 
We also saw strong results from our capital markets business as we were well positioned to provide product and services to our customers as they navigated through the recent market volatility. 
Kathy will now provide you with more details about our second quarter results."

Average loan and deposit growth are summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the recent retail",1462,"Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth are summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the recent retail card portfolio acquisition and student loans that were carried in the house for sale in the second quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.5% compared to prior year. 
And in second quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.7% and improved residential mortgage loan growth of 8.6%. Other consumer loans continue to show positive momentum led by credit card growth of 14.3%, which included the retail card acquisition. 
Finally, home equity loan growth continued, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.7%.
On a linked-quarter basis, our loan growth was 1.6%, meeting our expectation and was driven by total commercial loan growth of $2.3 billion or 2.6% and growth in residential mortgage of $1.3 billion or 2.4%. 
We currently project linked-quarter average loan growth in quarter 3 to be similar to the growth reported in prior quarters. 
Total average deposits increased $22 billion or 7.6% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and were up 3.9% on a linked-quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to reflect strong growth of 9.5% in our low-cost deposit, which includes our non-interest-bearing and low-cost interest checking deposits and more than offset the run-off in higher cost time deposit. 
Turning to Slide 8. As Richard mentioned, credit quality remained relatively stable in the second quarter. Second quarter net charge-offs increased $21 million or 7.1% compared with the prior year and reflected a modest increase of $2 million or 0.6% on a linked-quarter basis. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year. 
Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $95 million or 6%, mostly due to downgrades that occurred in prior quarter through the energy credits. 
Linked-quarter nonperforming assets improved 3% or $47 million, driven mainly from improvements on our energy credit.
Slide 9 provides an update of our energy exposure. At the end of the second quarter, $3 billion of our commercial loans and $11.3 billion of our commitments to customers in the energy portfolio, which was down from the previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the condition of our spring borrowing Basel III redetermination under based loans within our energy portfolio. 
During the second quarter, criticized commitments within this portfolio decreased $509 million, while nonperforming loans decreased $54 million, principally driven by paydowns. 
Finally, credit reserves associated with the energy portfolio declined by $45 million, reflective of reduced loans, which resulted in an 8.8% credit reserve for energy portfolio compared to 9.1% in the previous quarter.
Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio, we expect linked, net charge-off and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the third quarter of 2016. 
Slide 10 gives you a view of our second quarter results versus comparable periods. Second quarter net income, excluding notable items, increased by $17 million or 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. Higher operating income was partially offset by higher provision expense. 
On a linked-quarter basis, net income, excluding notable items, decreased by $114 million or 8.2%, mainly due to the seasonality and certain fee businesses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense related to expected increases in compliance cost and marketing expense. The marketing expense would represent our brand advertising.
Turning to Slide 11, net interest income increased by $126 million or 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was slightly offset by the impact of a 1-basis-point decline in net interest margin to 3.02%. 
The modest year-over-year decline in net interest margin primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rate, offset by a lower reinvestment rate in the securities portfolio.
Net interest income increased by $8 million or 0.3% on the linked-quarter basis. Strong growth in average loans were -- was offset by a 4-basis-point reduction in net interest margin. The decline in the margin was principally due to the loan portfolio mix as well as lower average rates on the investment securities portfolio, which is principally due to flatter yield curves.
Slide 12 highlights noninterest income, which increased to  [ph] $100 million or 4.4% year-over-year excluding the ABC Europe sales. The year-over-year increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increase to the payment revenues, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking fees and commercial product fees, which is mainly due to the increased Capital Markets fee -- which was mainly due to increase Capital Markets fees resulting from the recent market volatility.
Credit and debit card fees grew by $30 million or 11.3%, reflecting higher transaction volumes including the product portfolios. 
Corporate payment products revenue grew 1.7%, reversing a negative growth trend recognized during the previous year, and this was driven mostly by market share gains resulting from prior year investments made within our middle market, virtual payment and commercial grade platform. 
Merchant processing services increased 2.0% year-over-year or 3%, excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes.
Partial products revenue increased $24 million or 11.2%, driven by higher bond underwriting fees and other capital market activities as our customers responded to the recent market volatility. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income, excluding the VC Europe sales, increased $223 million or 10.4%, principally due to seasonally higher fees within our payment, mortgage banking and deposit service charge fee category. 
Credit and debit card fees increased $30 million or 11.3% and merchant processing fees increased $30 million or 8.0%, primarily due to seasonally higher transaction volume.
Commercial products fees increased $41 million or 21%. Mortgage banking fees increased $51 million or 27%, which was in line with our previous guidance of 20% to 30%. and mortgage banking revenues primarily reflected seasonally higher production volume. 
We currently expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 20% to 30% again in quarter 3.
Moving to Slide 13. Noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased to [ph] $160 million or 6% on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense, mostly due to impact of merit increases and variable compensation; higher professional service expense, principally related to compliance activity; and higher marketing and business development expense related to the investment on our brand advertising were partially offset by lower employee benefit expense. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased by $93 million or 3.4%. Linked quarter expense growth was driven by higher marketing and business development costs, again, reflective of the investment and brand advertising. Higher professional service fees, except what's principally due to compliance and an increase in compensation expense mostly due to merit increases. These increased costs were partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expense.
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the second half of the year, however, on a lower rate of growth versus the 3.4%, excluding notable items that we [indiscernible] quarter for the second quarter. 
Our current expectation is the linked expenses to increase 2.5% to 3% in the third quarter, but let me provide some additional detail. We anticipate that the FDIC surcharge assessment for larger banks will begin in the third quarter, which will increase our expenses by approximately $20 million. Additionally, expenses related to our tax credit business are seasonally higher to remove into the third quarter. These 2 items account for more than half of the expected quarterly expense growth. 
In the second quarter, preferred dividend totaled $80 million, which compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2016. The linked-quarter increase is reflective of a recent preferred stock issuance with the semi-annual dividend payment that will repeat again in quarter 4. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our capital position remains strong and in the second quarter, we returned 77% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. On June 29, we announced that federal reserve do not object to our capital plan. As a result, we announced the $2.6 billion buyback program that commenced on July 1 and announced that expected increase in our third quarter common dividend of 9.8%. We would expect to remain in our targeted payout range of 60% to 80% going forward.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at June 30 with 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirements. 
Our tangible book value per share rose to 18.4 6 [ph] to June 30, representing 10% increase over the same quarter of last year and 3% increase over the prior [ph] quarter. 
I will now turn the call back over to Richard."

So on the wholesale side, we're not still not seeing the kind of organic growth we'd like to see, but we are pleased, as we said in our comments, that we have a fully capable capital markets business in order to take the benefit of what would otherwise be some activities we didn't used to have in the company when customers moved outside of the lending market and into the Capital Markets.

So picture the bar still up there reminiscing like crazy. Knuckles are white, but we're hanging in there. A couple of thoughts, Jon, I want to start by saying I give you guys forward-looking view that we intend at this point, at least for the second half of the year, to stay on the 54% range, 54.0 to 54.9 kind of range in our efficiency ratio. And I'm giving you that because I don't know exactly what no interest rates, flat, very flat yield curve, and that can move either than can move at anytime and they seem to be very volatile. And we're not giving up on positive operating leverage, but it's getting a lot harder. And I'd rather just tell you, guys, that we're going to stay at the same current level, and we've been there for a couple of quarters now of efficiency. Because what I am saying is we already are under a pretty steady and measured expense control program. We've got an FTE hold in the company that bode for any growth items and areas for compliance. We haven't had the dose since February of last year and we continue to watch all the noncritical expenses, the discretionary expenses to a point that we think is right up to the line where we started to impair our new growth. And you guys investing that is not just for this quarter or next quarter, but for the long term. And we're going to be very careful not to overreact, and we have been careful so far not to do that. So our expenses will go up, as we said, less than the 3.4% linked-quarter. Next quarter, it will be 2.5% to 3%. And as Kathy mentioned, half of that will be in the FDIC premium cost and in the CDC, which took typically has higher expenses in the second half. The rest is just core part of the adding people for portfolios, adding to compliance. And as you said, professional services starts -- it did take this quarter starts to come. But I tell you, it comes down very slowly, so it's not a big measured improvement. But it is, at least, a point in fact that this will be our highest quarter, I hope, on our record. So that gives you a little more color. And I think at a 54% range, that gives us enough room to have some prices during the quarter, but also protect the knowledge for you that we're not going to do something to get to [ph] 52%. And I don't see this thing moving into 55% and to 56% [ph] ."

And we're on those processes now, so I have no idea what the exit time will be, but we're working closely with regulators to make sure that we have permissions, particularly to be released from any part of the consumer first if that's helpful to us to get back into traditional M&A business. However, I would remind you that our M&A in the area of merchant portfolios, credit card portfolios, markets business activities, trust activities, none of those are precluded under that order, and those have been exactly the things we have in the last 5 years consistently as part of our M&A. So we haven't been precluded from doing what we've wanted to do. And as I said before, there hasn't been a bank deal or a branch deal that we've wanted since the Citizen Chicago deal that we've precluded from. So our goal is to get out of it as well as possible, so we don't have any barriers on our options, but for now, it's not impairing any of our ability to run the company or find up other opportunities to acquire."

You're right. There are a few moving pieces in merchant I want to explain. So first, one of the principal drivers at merchant fee revenue is same-store sales, and same-store sales in North America were up just under 2%, 1.8%. And in Europe, they were up about 5%. So globally, up about 2.6%. And what you typically see from us is same-store sales plus 1% to 2% is total merchant revenue growth. What happened this quarter is while we were up 2% on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude up excess [ph] of 3%, that is also now flattening out revenue related to equipment sales. So we were up higher in prior quarters because equipment sales were going up. They are sort of leveled up. We've lapped that, so to speak. The only thing you'll see is our transaction volume is down, and that was intentional. We exited some low margin business, so we did not impact on transaction volume. But as you saw, not a tremendous impact on fee income. So as we look forward to the next few quarters, I would expect again same-store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of our fee growth in merchant volume. You asked about the other payments business, so let me comment on that. Credit card is very strong. Excluding Fidelity, we were up about 6%, and that's driven by card transaction volume growth of about 7%. And I would expect that to continue in the future quarters. And then finally, on corporate payment systems. A very good story there is that we're seeing growth in the corporate side of the equation. While government is continuing to be flat, our corporate fee income is growing. Transaction volume, sales volumes, up about 6%, and that's a function of the investments we've made in virtual pay and productivity, which is very positive. So continue to be weak or level or down a bit, but payables and virtual pay is up strong."

As we woke up this morning, you know that the call for interest rate increases is 21% for September and 36% for December, better than 0, worse than it was when we talked last time. So we're not going to bet on any of that, but to the extent that any if it comes back will be terrific. Also, the 10-years above 150 again, thank God, that is helpful to us as interest rate increases. And you know there's equal impact on the income statement based on that. So if we can manage through this very worst times, which is continued zero interest rate increases and very, very low 10-year,  we can manage through just about anything, which is how we're building the lower for longer kind of term around the company. So for one quarter, we can see that pressure. We can't predict beyond that.

Auto loans, we've never gotten out of it, so we're still in a big pleasing. We're now with a few players that are really quite capable at it, but then doubling down on credit cards. And you see some of our most recent portfolio and partnerships. So it's mostly a market share. There's not a market that's actually weaker than it was a year ago. But for all intents and purposes, they're not a market much stronger than it was either. And what I think really turns on the dial for banks is when corporate America is more confident. And I don't mean the original old unconfident. We're all even certain. But things with the presidential election in the offing, things like Brexit uncertainties, we don't need any of the things like that to continue to give corporate America reason to just wait. And -- but for M&A and for restructuring the balance sheet, corporate America is not organic doing big things, at least not needing banks in that process. So that's when the thing really starts to take off. But in the meantime, we're all getting it out in the trenches trying to keep more customers and do more with the ones we have.

But I'll tell you, the same answer I gave 3 years ago with Square when Square started coming out big with Starbucks. And at least for now, not for long term, but for now, most of these transactions are taking money out of this with cash out of the system. Not other cards, debit or credit transactions. There's still so much cash in our system, in our society. There's plenty of disintermediation of cash long before it starts to tap up against the other card businesses, and that's what we're all planning for in the near term and that could be a couple of years. But short beyond that period of time, we all have to be very thoughtful. And your question is right on the money as it relates to what's the evolving relationship between realtime, pay to pay, card, card in our present and the mobility of people moving money about in the different environment. We are still under a federal reserves circumstance that settles overnight and not over the weekend. So there's still a big disconnect, and we have those things to fix systemically before we get to a real realtime payments. But for now, the interest in is mostly seen on cash, and that's a net positive for us in the other banks because we have no benefit in cash moving about for the most part. We do when it starts to monetize itself in the form of a payment."

And I'm going to say 2 things. The Fed has a different lens on this. They look at different things and looking usually later than we are. But on a realtime basis, which we live in everyday, we're seeing a slow recovery. And it's a small nuance on the word, but recession said things are going backwards where people are starting to feel worse and not taking actions that they might otherwise have taken before. We are not seeing that. On the other hand, because we're balance sheet company and because we're highly levered and because half of what we do is on the wholesale business, we're all, I think, spending a lot of energy talking about how we're waiting for the wholesale side of the balance sheet to pick up on a real organic, old-fashioned way and we're also not seeing that. But they're not going backwards, so just taking this long, long, long period of time to restructure, evaluate their best options when things do pick up. And there's nothing wrong with that, but that's why we have all these unused commitments and continue to grow the balance sheet. From the business side, they've got reasons and they're informed and they're waiting. But on the consumer side, it's a little bit better every quarter and it's not a recession. And I would disagree if someone's saying that at that level. And in fact, I think you can see consumers are starting to spend again. They're savings as other level that they are comfortable.  They're using their credit cards and they're paying it back on time and getting rewards for it. But I would say it's actually make sense for me.

I'll begin a review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of this quarter's highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation.
I'm pleased to report that U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $0.83 per diluted common share. The second quarter results include several notable items that together increased earnings per share by $0.01. These notable items include $180 million of equity investment income, primarily the result of our membership in Visa Europe, which was recently sold to Visa Incorporated. Additionally, we've recognized $110 million in accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and a $40 million charitable contribution.
I'm very pleased with our second quarter results where we once again delivered industry-leading profitability and posted record results for revenue, net income and earnings per share on both reported as well as at quarter basis.
Record revenues were driven by growth in average linked-quarter loans of 1.6% as expected and continued strength in our fee businesses.
While we saw a reduction in our linked-quarter net interest margin as expected, we did report modest linked-quarter growth in net interest income and strong growth in net interest income on a year-over-year basis. 
Total average deposit growth also remained strong at 7.6% versus the previous year and included net income growth -- net new income account growth of 2.8%. 
Credit quality was stable for the second quarter, as expected. The net charge-off ratio was unchanged at 48 basis points compared to the previous quarter and the previous year, though we recognized a modest improvement in nonperforming assets, which is driven mainly by improvements in the energy credits.
Slide 5 provides you with a 5 quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. 
Moving to the graph on the right, you will see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.02%, 4 basis points lower than the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
The industry continues to face headwinds from volatile interest rate environment on the 5-year yield curve, which became more pronounced at the end of the second quarter and continues as we begin the third quarter. The lower long-term rates will have an impact on our second-half results if the rates remain at these low historic levels. We would expect that given the current yield curve, and expectations that the short-term rates will remain flat for the near term, but the interest margin -- net interest margin will decline on a linked basis in the range of 3 to 4 basis points. However, we also expect net interest income to increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by an increase in earning assets. 
Expenses, excluding the notable items, increased 3.4% at the bottom end of our expected range, and our efficiency ratio improved to 54% versus 54.6% in the prior fiscal quarter. 
As projected, quarter 2 expenses included a linked-quarter increase in marketing expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, and also reflect the expected peak in our compliance-related costs. 
As we look out to the second half of the year, we would expect expenses to grow, however, the rate of growth will be lower than the 3.4% linked-quarter growth reported in the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. The company reported record net revenue of $5.4 million in the second quarter. Excluding the Visa Europe sale, revenue increased $226 million or 4.5% from the prior year. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by core loan growth as well as strength in a number of our fee-based businesses including our payments, mortgage and wealth management businesses. 
We also saw strong results from our capital markets business as we were well positioned to provide product and services to our customers as they navigated through the recent market volatility. 
Kathy will now provide you with more details about our second quarter results."

Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the recent retail",1465,"Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the recent retail card portfolio acquisition and student loans that were carried in the house for sale in the second quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.5% compared to the prior year. 
And in the second quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.7% and improved residential mortgage loan growth of 8.6%. Other consumer loans continue to show positive momentum led by credit card growth of 14.3%, which included the retail card acquisition. 
Finally, home equity loan growth continued, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.7%.
On a linked-quarter basis, our loan growth was 1.6%, meeting our expectation, and was driven by total commercial loan growth of $2.3 billion or 2.6%, and growth in residential mortgage of $1.3 billion or 2.4%. 
We currently project linked-quarter average loan growth in quarter 3 to be similar to the growth reported in prior quarter. 
Total average deposits increased $22 billion or 7.6% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and were up 3.9% on a linked-quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to reflect strong growth of 9.5% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing and low-cost interest checking deposits, and more than offset the run-off in higher-cost time deposit. 
Turning to Slide 8, as Richard mentioned, credit quality remained relatively stable in the second quarter. Second quarter net charge-offs increased $21 million or 7.1% compared with the prior year and reflected a modest increase of $2 million or 0.6% on a linked-quarter basis. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year. 
Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $95 million or 6%, mostly due to the downgrades that occurred in prior quarters related to energy credits. 
Linked-quarter nonperforming assets improved 3% or $47 million, driven mainly from improvements on our energy credit.
Slide 9 provides an update of our energy exposure. At the end of the second quarter, $3 billion of our commercial loans and $11.3 billion of our commitments towards the customers in the energy portfolio, which was down from the previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the condition of our spring borrowing base redeterminations under base loans within our energy portfolio. 
During the second quarter, criticized commitments within this portfolio decreased $509 million, while nonperforming loans decreased $54 million, principally driven by pay down. 
Finally, credit reserves associated with the energy portfolio declined by $45 million, reflective of reduced loans, which resulted in an 8.8% credit reserve for energy portfolio compared to 9.1% in the previous quarter.
Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio, we expect linked, net charge-offs and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the third quarter of 2016. 
Slide 10 gives you a view of our second quarter results versus comparable period. Second quarter net income, excluding notable items, increased by $17 million or 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. Higher operating income was partially offset by higher provision expense. 
On a linked-quarter basis, net income, excluding notable items, decreased by $114 million or 8.2%, mainly due to the seasonality and certain fee businesses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense related to expected increases in compliance cost and marketing expense. The marketing expense would represent our brand advertising.
Turning to Slide 11, net interest income increased by $126 million or 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was slightly offset by the impact of a 1-basis-point decline in net interest margin to 3.02%. 
The modest year-over-year decline in net interest margin primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rate, offset by a lower reinvestment rate in the security portfolio.
Net interest income increased by $8 million or 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Strong growth in average loans were -- was offset by a 4-basis-point reduction in net interest margin. The decline in the margin was principally due to the loan portfolio mix as well as lower average rates on the investment securities portfolio, which is principally due to flatter yield curves.
Slide 12 highlights noninterest income, which increased a $100 million [ph] or 4.4% year-over-year excluding the Visa Europe sale. The year-over-year increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increase in the payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking fees and commercial product fees, which is mainly due to the increased Capital Market fee -- which was mainly due to increased Capital Market fees resulting from the recent market volatility.
Credit and debit card fees grew by $30 million or 11.3%, reflecting higher transaction volumes including the product portfolio. 
Corporate payment products revenue grew 1.7%, reversing a negative growth trend recognized during the previous year, and this was driven mostly by market share gains resulting from prior year investments made within our middle market, virtual payment and commercial grade platform. 
Merchant processing services increased 2.0% year-over-year or 3%, excluding the impact of current foreign currency rate changes.
Commercial products revenue increased $24 million or 11.2%, driven by higher bond underwriting fees and other capital market activities as our customers responded to the recent market volatility. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income, excluding the Visa Europe sale, increased $223 million or 10.4%, principally due to seasonally higher fees within our payment, mortgage banking and deposit service charge fee category. 
Credit and debit card fees increased $30 million or 11.3%, and merchant processing fees increased $30 million or 8.0%, primarily due to seasonally higher transaction volume.
Commercial products fees increased $41 million or 21%. Mortgage banking fees increased $51 million or 27%, which was in line with our previous guidance of 20% to 30%. Person mortgage banking revenues primarily reflected seasonally higher production volume. 
We currently expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 20% to 30% again in quarter 3.
Moving to Slide 13. Noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased $160 million [ph] or 6% on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense, mostly due to the impact of merit increases and variable compensation; higher professional service expense, principally related to compliance activity; and higher marketing and business development expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, were partially offset by lower employee benefit expense. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased by $93 million or 3.4%. Linked quarter expense growth was driven by higher marketing and business development cost, again reflective of the investment in brand advertising; higher professional service fees; expenses, principally due to compliance and an increase in compensation expense, mostly due to merit increases. These increased costs were partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expense.
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the second half of the year, however, at a lower rate of growth versus the 3.4% excluding notable items that we've reported for the second quarter. 
Our current expectation is for linked expenses to increase 2.5% to 3% in the third quarter, but let me provide some additional detail. We anticipate that the FDIC surcharge assessment for larger banks will begin in the third quarter, which will increase our expenses by approximately $20 million. Additionally, expenses related to our tax credit business are seasonally higher as we move into the third quarter. These 2 items account for more than half of the expected quarterly expense growth. 
In the second quarter, preferred dividend totaled $80 million, which compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2016. The linked-quarter increase is reflective of a recent preferred stock issuance with a semi-annual dividend payment that we'll repeat again in quarter 4. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our capital position remains strong and in the second quarter, we returned 77% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. On June 29, we announced that the Federal Reserve do not object to our capital plan. As a result, we announced a $2.6 billion stock buyback program that commenced on July 1, and announced an expected increase in our third quarter common dividend of 9.8%. We would expect to remain in our targeted payout range of 60% to 80% going forward.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at June 30, was 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. 
Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.46 at June 30, representing a 10% increase over the same quarter of last year, and a 3% increase over the prior quarter. 
I will now turn the call back to Richard."

And yes, we are expecting more of the same, pretty much what we've seen for the last 2 quarters. I'll have Andy give you a little color on the detail as he oversees all of those revenue businesses, but I will say, it continues to be a theme of repetitive quarter after quarter, where on the wholesale side, you're seeing increased Capital Markets activity that, in fact, move up and trigger loan repayments and lower line utilization and M&A-related activity. So on the wholesale side, we're not -- still not seeing the kind of organic growth we'd like to see, but we are pleased, as we said in our comments, that we have a fully capable capital markets business in order to take the benefit of what would otherwise be some activities we didn't use to have in the company when customers moved outside of the lending market and into the Capital Markets. On the consumer side, we're seeing all areas moving slowly but surely and nicely, favorably from autos to RVs to credit cards and home equity. And then we particularly have a good story to tell in the mortgage business as we continue to be a bigger player in that area. So it's a lot of the same John, but everything has got a generally positive -- slightly positive bias, but a lot of the opportunity at wholesale market is yet to be the kind of organic growth that we all want to see, that gives evidence in a more healthy and robust economic environment.

Hope the knuckles are white, but we're hanging in there. A couple of thoughts, Jon. I want to start by saying, I give you guys forward-looking view that we intend, at this point, at least for the second half of the year, to stay in the 54% range, 54.0% to 54.9% kind of a range in our efficiency ratio. And I'm giving you that because I don't know exactly with no interest rates, a flat -- very flat yield curve, and that can move either -- they can move at any time and they seem to be very volatile. And we're not giving up on positive operating leverage, but it's getting a lot harder. And I'd rather just tell you guys, that we're going to stay at the same current level, and we've been there for a couple of quarters now of efficiency. Because what I am saying is, we already are under a pretty steady and measured expense control program. We've got an FTE hold in the company that looks for any growth items and areas for compliance. We haven't had a dose now since February of last year, and we continue to watch all the noncritical expenses, the discretionary expenses to a point that we think is right up to the line where it we'd started to impair our new growth. And new guys investing, that's not just for this quarter or next quarter, but for the long term, and we're going to be very careful not to overreact, and we have been careful so far not to do that. So our expenses will go up, as we said, less than the 3.4% linked-quarter. Next quarter, it'd be 2.5% to 3%. And as Kathy mentioned, half of that will be in the FDIC premium costs and in the CDC, which both typically has higher expenses in the second half. The rest is just core part of the adding people for portfolios, adding to compliance. And as you said, professional services starts -- it did dip this quarter, starts to come down. But I'll tell you, it comes down very slowly, so it's not a big measured improvement. But it is, at least, a point in fact that this will be our highest quarter, I hope, on record. So that gives you a little more color. And I think at a 54% range that gives us enough room to have some prices during the quarter, but also protect the knowledge for you that we are not going to do something to get to 52%. And I don't see this thing moving into the 55s and 56s."

However, I'll remind you that our M&A in the area of merchant portfolios, credit card portfolios, mortgage business activities, trust activities, none of those are precluded under that order, and those have been exactly the things we have in the last 5 years consistently as part of our M&A. So we haven't been precluded from doing what we've wanted to do. And as I said before, there hasn't been a bank deal or a branch deal that we've wanted since the Citizen Chicago deal that we've precluded from. So our goal is to get out of it as soon as possible, so we don't have any barriers on our options, but for now, it's not impairing any of our ability to run the company or find opportunities to acquire."

Let me start with merchant, and you're right. There are a few moving pieces in merchant I want to explain.

There are a few moving pieces in merchant I want to explain. So first, one of the principal drivers of merchant fee revenue is same-store sales, and same-store sales in North America were up just under 2%, 1.8%. And in Europe, they were up about 5%. So globally, up about 2.6%. And what you typically see from us is same-store sales plus 1% to 2% is total merchant revenue growth. What happened this quarter is, while we were up 2% on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude up access of 3%, that is also now flattening out revenue related to equipment sales. So we were up higher in prior quarters because equipment sales were going up. They are sort of leveled up. We've lapped that, so to speak. The only thing that you'll see is our transaction volume is down, and that was intentional. We exited some low margin business, so it did had impact on transaction volume, but as you saw, not a tremendous impact on fee income. So as we look forward to the next few quarters, I would expect, again, same-store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of our fee growth in merchant volume. You asked about the other payments business, so let me comment on that. Credit card is very strong. Excluding Fidelity, we were up about 6%, and that's driven by card transaction volume growth of about 7%, and I would expect that to continue in the future quarters. And then finally, on corporate payment systems. A very good story there is that we're seeing growth in the corporate side of the equation. While government is continuing to be flat, our corporate fee income is growing. Transaction volume, sales volumes up about 6%, and that's a function of the investments we made in virtual pay and product activity, which is very positive. So T&E continues to be weak or level or down a bit, but payables and virtual pay is up strong."

For Brexit, first of all, it's not material and it's pretty neutral to the bank. But if it shows up anywhere, it shows up in our European businesses, which is merchant acquiring. You may recall, those of you who've followed us for a decade, we started our business -- merchant acquiring business, in the U.K. That's where it's actually headquartered, so a disproportionate amount of business is in the U.K. And actually, if there's a lot of prognosis, we believe it's going to be a lot more travel and visits and spending over in the U.K. which is net positive for us. And given our portfolio mix being heavy on hotels, retail -- hoteliers and airlines, that could be quite positive as well, offsetting any variances that may occur in the rest of the European market through this disruption. So we're seeing Brexit as fairly neutral to nonmaterial to maybe even a little bit more positive. As it relates to our employees, we have a few hundred employees that are working in the U.K. and/or in around Europe, that would either have to have passport in -- circumstances changed for them because they're either U.K. employees working in Europe or European employees working in the U.K. Now that's something that will dwell over the next couple of years.

I'll also remind you that commercial real estate has a CMBS market where there is a lot of activity and our guidance is telling us that the lack of buyers, coming particularly from the life insurers, has affected the refinance and purchase activity, which only serves to say that there is a reduced pace to payoffs. So part of the increase is actually good news. We're keeping the customers we have. But we're not striving to get new customers at any kind of risk of underwriting or pricing change. I think the portfolio will prove itself more over time. Andy and Bill can add a little color about where the growth is, and where we see pockets of strength.

As we woke up this morning, you know that the call for interest rate increases is 21% for September and 36% for December, better than 0, worse than it was when we talked last time. So we're not going to bet on any of that, but to the extent that any of it comes back would be terrific. Also, the 10-years above 150 again, thank God, that is helpful to us as interest rate increases. And you know there's equal impact on the income statement based on that. So if we can manage through these very worst times, which is continued zero interest rate increases and very, very low 10-year,  we can manage through just about anything, which is how we're building the lower for longer kind of term around the company. So for one quarter, we can see that pressure. We can't predict beyond that.

But I'll remind you that in this particular cycle, the negative interest rate scenario would add it, and that's hard for any of us to predict exactly how that fair for each bank, but I know that, that had an impact on what was likely the PPNR for every bank. As you know, we continue be at the top on the PPNR barely. In this case, we're slightly below breakeven, but in years past, we've always been above. And I think on a relative basis, we've even performed better. So I'm not concerned about trying to predict that, and I think that the test continues to be effective in helping us all understand whether or not. In a most stressed scenario, we would be okay. Acquirers had more limited capital distribution, and so we don't think that's a factor to us because it's not -- it's relevant to us as it will be to some others. But I think as you look at the stress test results and you applied across different kinds of companies, it's not unusual to see a different distribution level based on both what we're starting from, what the stress test would do to us and where we'd end."

We think our commitments have been growing faster than anybody's, well in addition to our loan growth. And I think it they take a model where all the commitments got 100% and they got to charge off, that could be it. We have a big government portfolio in our corporate business, which if they take a 90-day late pay and take the whole portfolio to charge-off, maybe that could be it. And simple as it sounds, we'll never get the answer even to those questions I just offered. So what we will do is continue to watch our own performance as you should measure the dictate on how well we've actually done in charge-offs and nonperforms over the course of time.

There's plenty of disintermediation of cash long before it starts to tap up against the other card businesses, and that's what we're all planning for in the near term and that could be a couple of years. But short beyond that period of time, we all have to be very thoughtful. And your question is right on the money as it relates to what's the evolving relationship between realtime, pay to pay, card, card not present and the mobility of people moving money about in a different environment. We are still under a federal reserve circumstance that settles overnight and not over the weekend. So there's still a big disconnect, and we have those things to fix systemically before we get to a real realtime payments.

We are not seeing that.

So 25 state footprint where you see us on the street and you drive by us everyday. In the other 25 states, for the most part, for commercial real estate, corporate trusts, middle market and large corporate, we're in all those states. We just really have never taken the time to show you that. So I'll make this a note to do that at the Investor Day in September 15 to make sure we show you where all of our loan production offices are outside of what would be the footprint. Because when I show you, you'll see wherever we want to be, and so the answer to the expansion is no because we're already there."

I'll begin a review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of this quarter's highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation.
I'm pleased to report that U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $0.83 per diluted common share. The second quarter results include several notable items that together increased earnings per share by $0.01. These notable items include $180 million of equity investment income, primarily the result of our membership in Visa Europe, which was recently sold to Visa Incorporated. Additionally, we've recognized $110 million in accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and a $40 million charitable contribution.
I'm very pleased with our second quarter results where we once again delivered industry-leading profitability and posted record results for revenue, net income and earnings per share on both a reported as well as at core basis.
Record revenues were driven by growth in average linked-quarter loans of 1.6% as expected and continued strength in our fee businesses.
While we saw a reduction in our linked-quarter net interest margin as expected, we did report modest linked-quarter growth in net interest income and strong growth in net interest income on a year-over-year basis. 
Total average deposit growth also remained strong at 7.6% versus the previous year and included net income growth -- net new income account growth of 2.8%. 
Credit quality was stable for the second quarter, as expected. The net charge-off ratio was unchanged at 48 basis points compared to the previous quarter and the previous year, though we recognized a modest improvement in nonperforming assets, which is driven mainly by improvements in the energy credits.
Slide 5 provides you with a 5 quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. 
Moving to the graph on the right, you will see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.02%, 4 basis points lower than the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
The industry continues to face headwinds from low interest rate environment on the flatter yield curve, which became more pronounced at the end of the second quarter and continues as we begin the third quarter. The lower long-term rates will have an impact on our second-half results if the rates remain at these low historic levels. We would expect that given the current yield curve, and expectations that the short-term rates will remain flat for the near term, but the interest margin -- net interest margin will decline on a linked basis in the range of 3 to 4 basis points. However, we also expect net interest income to increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by an increase in earning assets. 
Expenses, excluding the notable items, increased 3.4% at the bottom end of our expected range, and our efficiency ratio improved to 54% versus 54.6% in the prior fiscal quarter. 
As projected, quarter 2 expenses included a linked-quarter increase in marketing expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, and also reflect the expected peak in our compliance-related costs. 
As we look out to the second half of the year, we would expect expenses to grow, however, the rate of growth will be lower than the 3.4% linked-quarter growth reported in the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. The company reported record net revenue of $5.4 million in the second quarter. Excluding the Visa Europe sale, revenue increased $226 million or 4.5% from the prior year. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by core loan growth as well as strength in a number of our fee-based businesses including our payments, mortgage and wealth management businesses. 
We also saw strong results from our capital markets business as we were well positioned to provide product and services to our customers as they navigated through the recent market volatility. 
Kathy will now provide you with more details about our second quarter results."

Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the recent retail",1463,"Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the recent retail card portfolio acquisition and student loans that were carried and held for sale in the second quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.5% compared to the prior year. 
And in the second quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.7% and improved residential mortgage loan growth of 8.6%. Other consumer loans continue to show positive momentum led by credit card growth of 14.3%, which included the retail card acquisition. 
Finally, home equity loan growth continued, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.7%.
On a linked-quarter basis, our loan growth was 1.6%, meeting our expectation, and was driven by total commercial loan growth of $2.3 billion or 2.6%, and growth in residential mortgage of $1.3 billion or 2.4%. 
We currently project linked-quarter average loan growth in quarter 3 to be similar to the growth reported in prior quarter. 
Total average deposits increased $22 billion or 7.6% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and were up 3.9% on a linked-quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to reflect strong growth of 9.5% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing and low-cost interest checking deposits, and more than offset the run-off in higher-cost time deposit. 
Turning to Slide 8, as Richard mentioned, credit quality remained relatively stable in the second quarter. Second quarter net charge-offs increased $21 million or 7.1% compared with the prior year and reflected a modest increase of $2 million or 0.6% on a linked-quarter basis. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year. 
Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $95 million or 6%, mostly due to the downgrades that occurred in prior quarters related to energy credits. 
Linked-quarter nonperforming assets improved 3% or $47 million, driven mainly from improvements on our energy credit.
Slide 9 provides an update of our energy exposure. At the end of the second quarter, $3 billion of our commercial loans and $11.3 billion of our commitments towards the customers in the energy portfolio, which was down from the previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the condition of our spring borrowing base redeterminations under base loans within our energy portfolio. 
During the second quarter, criticized commitments within this portfolio decreased $509 million, while nonperforming loans decreased $54 million, principally driven by pay down. 
Finally, credit reserves associated with the energy portfolio declined by $45 million, reflective of reduced loans, which resulted in an 8.8% credit reserve for energy portfolio compared to 9.1% in the previous quarter.
Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio, we expect linked, net charge-offs and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the third quarter of 2016. 
Slide 10 gives you a view of our second quarter results versus comparable periods. Second quarter net income, excluding notable items, increased by $17 million or 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. Higher operating income was partially offset by higher provision expense. 
On a linked-quarter basis, net income, excluding notable items, decreased by $114 million or 8.2%, mainly due to the seasonality and certain fee businesses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense related to expected increases in compliance cost and marketing expense. The marketing expense would represent our brand advertising.
Turning to Slide 11, net interest income increased by $126 million or 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was slightly offset by the impact of a 1-basis-point decline in net interest margin to 3.02%. 
The modest year-over-year decline in net interest margin primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rate, offset by a lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio.
Net interest income increased by $8 million or 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Strong growth in average loans were -- was offset by a 4-basis-point reduction in net interest margin. The decline in the margin was principally due to the loan portfolio mix as well as lower average rates on the investment securities portfolio, which is principally due to flatter yield curves.
Slide 12 highlights noninterest income, which increased a $100 million [ph] or 4.4% year-over-year excluding the Visa Europe sale. The year-over-year increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increase in the payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking fees and commercial product fees, which is mainly due to the increased Capital Market fee -- which was mainly due to increased Capital Market fees resulting from the recent market volatility.
Credit and debit card fees grew by $30 million or 11.3%, reflecting higher transaction volumes including acquired portfolio. 
Corporate payment products revenue grew 1.7%, reversing a negative growth trend recognized during the previous year, and this was driven mostly by market share gains resulting from prior year investments made within our middle market, virtual payment and commercial grade platform. 
Merchant processing services increased 2.0% year-over-year or 3%, excluding the impact of current foreign currency rate changes.
Commercial products revenue increased $24 million or 11.2%, driven by higher bond underwriting fees and other capital market activities as our customers responded to the recent market volatility. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income, excluding the Visa Europe sale, increased $223 million or 10.4%, principally due to seasonally higher fees within our payment, mortgage banking and deposit service charge fee category. 
Credit and debit card fees increased $30 million or 11.3%, and merchant processing fees increased $30 million or 8.0%, primarily due to seasonally higher transaction volume.
Commercial products fees increased $41 million or 21%. Mortgage banking fees increased $51 million or 27%, which was in line with our previous guidance of 20% to 30%. Person mortgage banking revenues primarily reflected seasonally higher production volume. 
We currently expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 20% to 30% again in quarter 3.
Moving to Slide 13. Noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased $160 million [ph] or 6% on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense, mostly due to the impact of merit increases and variable compensation; higher professional service expense, principally related to compliance activity; and higher marketing and business development expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, were partially offset by lower employee benefit expense. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased by $93 million or 3.4%. Linked quarter expense growth was driven by higher marketing and business development cost, again reflected of the investment in brand advertising; higher professional service fees; expenses, principally due to compliance and an increase in compensation expense, mostly due to merit increases. These increased costs were partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expense.
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the second half of the year, however, at a lower rate of growth versus the 3.4% excluding notable items that we've reported for the second quarter. 
Our current expectation is for linked expenses to increase 2.5% to 3% in the third quarter, but let me provide some additional detail. We anticipate that the FDIC surcharge assessment for larger banks will begin in the third quarter, which will increase our expenses by approximately $20 million. Additionally, expenses related to our tax credit business are seasonally higher as we move into the third quarter. These 2 items account for more than half of the expected quarterly expense growth. 
In the second quarter, preferred dividend totaled $80 million, which compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2016. The linked-quarter increase is reflective of a recent preferred stock issuance with a semi-annual dividend payment that we'll repeat again in quarter 4. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our capital position remains strong and in the second quarter, we returned 77% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. On June 29, we announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan. As a result, we announced a $2.6 billion stock buyback program that commenced on July 1, and announced an expected increase in our third quarter common dividend of 9.8%. We would expect to remain in our targeted payout range of 60% to 80% going forward.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at June 30, was 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. 
Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.46 at June 30, representing a 10% increase over the same quarter of last year, and a 3% increase over the prior quarter. 
I will now turn the call back to Richard."

And yes, we are expecting more of the same, pretty much what we've seen for the last 2 quarters. I'll have Andy give you a little color on the detail as he oversees all of those revenue businesses, but I will say, it continues to be a theme of repetitive quarter after quarter, where on the wholesale side, you're seeing increased Capital Markets activity that, in fact, move up and trigger loan repayments and lower line utilization and M&A-related activity. So on the wholesale side, we're not -- still not seeing the kind of organic growth we'd like to see, but we are pleased, as we said in our comments, that we have a fully capable capital markets business in order to take the benefit of what would otherwise be some activities we didn't use to have in the company when customers moved outside of the lending market and into the Capital Markets. On the consumer side, we're seeing all areas moving slowly but surely and nicely, favorably from autos to RVs to credit cards and home equity. And then we particularly have a good story to tell in the mortgage business as we continue to be a bigger player in that area. So it's a lot of the same John, but everything has got a generally positive -- slightly positive bias, but a lot of the opportunity at wholesale market is yet to be the kind of organic growth that we all want to see, that gives evidence in a more healthy and robust economic environment. Andy, you want to add something more on that?"

Hope the knuckles are white, but we're hanging in there. A couple of thoughts, Jon. I want to start by saying, I'll give you guys forward-looking view that we intend, at this point, at least for the second half of the year, to stay in the 54% range, 54.0% to 54.9% kind of a range in our efficiency ratio. And I'm giving you that because I don't know exactly with no interest rates, a flat -- very flat yield curve, and that can move either -- they can move at any time and they seem to be very volatile. And we're not giving up on positive operating leverage, but it's getting a lot harder. And I'd rather just tell you guys, that we're going to stay at the same current level, and we've been there for a couple of quarters now of efficiency. Because what I am saying is, we already are under a pretty steady and measured expense control program. We've got an FTE hold in the company that before any growth items and areas for compliance. We haven't added those now since February of last year, and we continue to watch all the noncritical expenses, the discretionary expenses to a point that we think is right up to the line where it we'd started to impair our new growth. And new guys investing, that's not just for this quarter or next quarter, but for the long term, and we're going to be very careful not to overreact, and we have been careful so far not to do that. So our expenses will go up, as we said, less than the 3.4% linked-quarter. Next quarter, it'd be 2.5% to 3%. And as Kathy mentioned, half of that will be in the FDIC premium costs and in the CDC, which typically has higher expenses in the second half. The rest is just core part of the adding people for portfolios, adding to compliance. And as you said, professional services starts -- it did peak this quarter, starts to come down. But I'll tell you, it comes down very slowly, so it's not a big measured improvement. But it is, at least, a point in fact that this will be our highest quarter, I hope, on record. So that gives you a little more color. And I think at a 54% range that gives us enough room to have some prices during the quarter, but also protect the knowledge for you that we are not going to do something to get to 52%. And I don't see this thing moving into the 55s and 56s."

However, I'll remind you that our M&A in the area of merchant portfolios, credit card portfolios, mortgage business activities, trust activities, none of those are precluded under that order, and those have been exactly the things we have in the last 5 years consistently as part of our M&A. So we haven't been precluded from doing what we've wanted to do.

There are a few moving pieces in merchant I want to explain. So first, one of the principal drivers of merchant fee revenue is same-store sales, and same-store sales in North America were up just under 2%, 1.8%. And in Europe, they were up about 5%. So globally, up about 2.6%. And what you typically see from us is same-store sales plus 1% to 2% is total merchant revenue growth. What happened this quarter is, while we were up 2% on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude FX, that's up 3%, that is also now flattening out revenue related to equipment sales. So we were up higher in prior quarters because equipment sales were going up. They are sort of leveled off. We've lapped that, so to speak. The only thing that you'll see is our transaction volume is down, and that was intentional. We exited some low margin business, so it did had impact on transaction volume, but as you saw, not a tremendous impact on fee income. So as we look forward to the next few quarters, I would expect, again, same-store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of our fee growth in merchant volume. You asked about the other payments business, so let me comment on that. Credit card is very strong. Excluding Fidelity, we were up about 6%, and that's driven by card transaction volume growth of about 7%, and I would expect that to continue in the future quarters. And then finally, on corporate payment systems. A very good story there is that we're seeing growth in the corporate side of the equation. While government is continuing to be flat, our corporate fee income is growing. Transaction volume, sales volumes up about 6%, and that's a function of the investments we made in virtual pay and product activity, which is very positive. So T&E continues to be weak or level or down a bit, but payables and virtual pay is up strong."

For Brexit, first of all, it's not material and it's pretty neutral to the bank. But if it shows up anywhere, it shows up in our European businesses, which is merchant acquiring. You may recall, those of you who've followed us for a decade, we started our business -- merchant acquiring business, in the U.K. That's where it's actually headquartered, so a disproportionate amount of business is in the U.K. And actually, if there's a lot of prognosis, we believe it's going to be a lot more travel and visits and spending over in the U.K. which is net positive for us. And given our portfolio mix being heavy on hotels, retail -- hoteliers and airlines that could be quite positive as well, offsetting any variances that may occur in the rest of the European market through this disruption. So we're seeing Brexit as fairly neutral to nonmaterial to maybe even a little bit more positive.

So part of the increase is actually good news. We're keeping the customers we have. But we're not striving to get new customers at any kind of risk of underwriting or pricing change.

So we're not going to bet on any of that, but to the extent that any of it comes back would be terrific. Also, the 10-years above 150 again, thank God, that is helpful to us as interest rate increases. And you know there's equal impact on the income statement based on that. So if we can manage through these very worst times, which is continued zero interest rate increases and very, very low 10-year,  we can manage through just about anything, which is how we're building the lower for longer kind of term around the company.

Swear to god, honest engine, we are taking market share we have been for years. Think of our home equity portfolio, it's still growing, albeit slightly, but that's been shrinking across the industry. Auto loans, we've never gotten out of it, so we're still in a big leasing. We're now one of the few players that are really quite capable at it. We've been doubling down on credit cards and you're seeing some of our recent portfolio and partnerships. So it's mostly a market share. There's not a market that's actually weaker than it was a year ago. But for all intents and purposes, there is not a market much stronger than it was either. And what I think really turns on the dial for banks is when corporate America is more confident. And I don't mean the original old unconfident, we're always uncertain. But things with the presidential election in the offing, things like Brexit uncertainties, we don't need any of the things like that to continue to give corporate America reason to just wait. And -- but for M&A and for restructuring the balance sheet, corporate America is not organic doing big things, at least not needing banks in that process. So that's when the thing really starts to take off. But in the meantime, we're all getting it out in the trenches trying to keep more customers and do more with the ones we have. And I just think the right answer, as much as it's hard to prove, is that we're doing it in our case with market share growth."

As you know, we continue be at the top on the PPNR barely. In this case, we're slightly below breakeven, but in years past, we've always been above. And I think on a relative basis, we've even performed better. So I'm not concerned about trying to predict that, and I think that the test continues to be effective in helping us all understand whether or not. In a most stressed scenario, we would be okay. Acquirers had more limited capital distribution, and so we don't think that's a factor to us because it's not -- it's relevant to us as it will be to some others.

We think our commitments have been growing faster than anybody's, well in addition to our loan growth. And I think it they take a model where all the commitments go to 100% and they got to charge off, that could be it. We have a big government portfolio in our corporate business, which if they take a 90-day late pay and take the whole portfolio to charge-off, maybe that could be it. And simple as it sounds, we'll never get the answer even to those questions I just offered. So what we will do is continue to watch our own performance as you should measure the dictate on how well we've actually done in charge-offs and nonperforms over the course of time.

There's plenty of disintermediation of cash long before it starts to tap up against the other card businesses, and that's what we're all planning for in the near term and that could be a couple of years. But short beyond that period of time, we all have to be very thoughtful. And your question is right on the money as it relates to what's the evolving relationship between real-time, pay to pay, card, card not present and the mobility of people moving money about in a different environment. Remember, we are still under a Federal Reserve circumstance that settles overnight and not over the weekend. So there's still a big disconnect, and we have those things to fix systemically before we get to a real real-time payments.

They're looking at different things and they're looking usually later than we are. But on a real-time basis, which we live in everyday, we're seeing a slow recovery. And it's a small nuance on a word, but the recession said things are going backwards where people are starting to feel worse and not taking actions that they might otherwise have taken before. We are not seeing that. On the other hand, because we're balance sheet companies and because we're highly levered and because half of what we do is in the wholesale business, we're all, I think, spending a lot of energy talking about how we're waiting for the wholesale side of the balance sheet to pick up in a real organic, old-fashioned way and we're also not seeing that. But they're not going backwards, so just taking this long, long, long period of time to restructure, evaluate their best options when things do pick up. And there's nothing wrong with that, but that's why we have all these unused commitments and continue to grow the balance sheet. On the business side, they've got reasons and they're informed and they're waiting. But on the consumer side, it's a little bit better every quarter and it's not a recession. And I would disagree if someone's saying that at that level. And in fact, I think you can see consumers are starting to spend again. Their savings has hit a level that they are comfortable.  They're using their credit cards and they're paying it back on time and getting rewards for it. But I would say it actually make sense to me.

I'll begin a review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of this quarter's highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation.
I'm pleased to report that U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $0.83 per diluted common share. The second quarter results include several notable items that together increased earnings per share by $0.01. These notable items include $180 million of equity investment income, primarily the result of our membership in Visa Europe, which was recently sold to Visa Incorporated. Additionally, we've recognized $110 million in accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and a $40 million charitable contribution.
I'm very pleased with our second quarter results where we once again delivered industry-leading profitability and posted record results for revenue, net income and earnings per share on both a reported as well as at core basis.
Record revenues were driven by growth in average linked-quarter loans of 1.6% as expected and continued strength in our fee businesses.
While we saw a reduction in our linked-quarter net interest margin as expected, we did report modest linked-quarter growth in net interest income and strong growth in net interest income on a year-over-year basis. 
Total average deposit growth also remained strong at 7.6% versus the previous year and included net income growth -- net new income account growth of 2.8%. 
Credit quality was stable for the second quarter, as expected. The net charge-off ratio was unchanged at 48 basis points compared to the previous quarter and the previous year, though we recognized a modest improvement in nonperforming assets, which is driven mainly by improvements in the energy credits.
Slide 5 provides you with a 5 quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. 
Moving to the graph on the right, you will see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.02%, 4 basis points lower than the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
The industry continues to face headwinds from low interest rate environment on the flatter yield curve, which became more pronounced at the end of the second quarter and continues as we begin the third quarter. The lower long-term rates will have an impact on our second-half results if the rates remain at these low historic levels. We would expect that given the current yield curve, and expectations that the short-term rates will remain flat for the near term, but the interest margin -- net interest margin will decline on a linked basis in the range of 3 to 4 basis points. However, we also expect net interest income to increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by an increase in earning assets. 
Expenses, excluding the notable items, increased 3.4% at the bottom end of our expected range, and our efficiency ratio improved to 54% versus 54.6% in the prior fiscal quarter. 
As projected, quarter 2 expenses included a linked-quarter increase in marketing expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, and also reflect the expected peak in our compliance-related costs. 
As we look out to the second half of the year, we would expect expenses to grow, however, the rate of growth will be lower than the 3.4% linked-quarter growth reported in the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. The company reported record net revenue of $5.4 million in the second quarter. Excluding the Visa Europe sale, revenue increased $226 million or 4.5% from the prior year. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by core loan growth as well as strength in a number of our fee-based businesses including our payments, mortgage and wealth management businesses. 
We also saw strong results from our capital markets business as we were well positioned to provide product and services to our customers as they navigated through the recent market volatility. 
Kathy will now provide you with more details about our second quarter results."

Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the recent retail",1463,"Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the recent retail card portfolio acquisition and student loans that were carried and held for sale in the second quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.5% compared to the prior year. 
And in the second quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.7% and improved residential mortgage loan growth of 8.6%. Other consumer loans continue to show positive momentum led by credit card growth of 14.3%, which included the retail card acquisition. 
Finally, home equity loan growth continued, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.7%.
On a linked-quarter basis, our loan growth was 1.6%, meeting our expectation, and was driven by total commercial loan growth of $2.3 billion or 2.6%, and growth in residential mortgage of $1.3 billion or 2.4%. 
We currently project linked-quarter average loan growth in quarter 3 to be similar to the growth reported in prior quarter. 
Total average deposits increased $22 billion or 7.6% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and were up 3.9% on a linked-quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to reflect strong growth of 9.5% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing and low-cost interest checking deposits, and more than offset the run-off in higher-cost time deposit. 
Turning to Slide 8, as Richard mentioned, credit quality remained relatively stable in the second quarter. Second quarter net charge-offs increased $21 million or 7.1% compared with the prior year and reflected a modest increase of $2 million or 0.6% on a linked-quarter basis. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year. 
Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $95 million or 6%, mostly due to the downgrades that occurred in prior quarters related to energy credits. 
Linked-quarter nonperforming assets improved 3% or $47 million, driven mainly from improvements on our energy credit.
Slide 9 provides an update of our energy exposure. At the end of the second quarter, $3 billion of our commercial loans and $11.3 billion of our commitments towards the customers in the energy portfolio, which was down from the previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the condition of our spring borrowing base redeterminations under base loans within our energy portfolio. 
During the second quarter, criticized commitments within this portfolio decreased $509 million, while nonperforming loans decreased $54 million, principally driven by pay down. 
Finally, credit reserves associated with the energy portfolio declined by $45 million, reflective of reduced loans, which resulted in an 8.8% credit reserve for energy portfolio compared to 9.1% in the previous quarter.
Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio, we expect linked, net charge-offs and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the third quarter of 2016. 
Slide 10 gives you a view of our second quarter results versus comparable periods. Second quarter net income, excluding notable items, increased by $17 million or 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. Higher operating income was partially offset by higher provision expense. 
On a linked-quarter basis, net income, excluding notable items, decreased by $114 million or 8.2%, mainly due to the seasonality and certain fee businesses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense related to expected increases in compliance cost and marketing expense. The marketing expense would represent our brand advertising.
Turning to Slide 11, net interest income increased by $126 million or 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was slightly offset by the impact of a 1-basis-point decline in net interest margin to 3.02%. 
The modest year-over-year decline in net interest margin primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rate, offset by a lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio.
Net interest income increased by $8 million or 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Strong growth in average loans were -- was offset by a 4-basis-point reduction in net interest margin. The decline in the margin was principally due to the loan portfolio mix as well as lower average rates on the investment securities portfolio, which is principally due to flatter yield curves.
Slide 12 highlights noninterest income, which increased a $100 million [ph] or 4.4% year-over-year excluding the Visa Europe sale. The year-over-year increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increase in the payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking fees and commercial product fees, which is mainly due to the increased Capital Market fee -- which was mainly due to increased Capital Market fees resulting from the recent market volatility.
Credit and debit card fees grew by $30 million or 11.3%, reflecting higher transaction volumes including acquired portfolio. 
Corporate payment products revenue grew 1.7%, reversing a negative growth trend recognized during the previous year, and this was driven mostly by market share gains resulting from prior year investments made within our middle market, virtual payment and commercial grade platform. 
Merchant processing services increased 2.0% year-over-year or 3%, excluding the impact of current foreign currency rate changes.
Commercial products revenue increased $24 million or 11.2%, driven by higher bond underwriting fees and other capital market activities as our customers responded to the recent market volatility. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income, excluding the Visa Europe sale, increased $223 million or 10.4%, principally due to seasonally higher fees within our payment, mortgage banking and deposit service charge fee category. 
Credit and debit card fees increased $30 million or 11.3%, and merchant processing fees increased $30 million or 8.0%, primarily due to seasonally higher transaction volume.
Commercial products fees increased $41 million or 21%. Mortgage banking fees increased $51 million or 27%, which was in line with our previous guidance of 20% to 30%. Person mortgage banking revenues primarily reflected seasonally higher production volume. 
We currently expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 20% to 30% again in quarter 3.
Moving to Slide 13. Noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased $160 million [ph] or 6% on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense, mostly due to the impact of merit increases and variable compensation; higher professional service expense, principally related to compliance activity; and higher marketing and business development expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, were partially offset by lower employee benefit expense. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased by $93 million or 3.4%. Linked quarter expense growth was driven by higher marketing and business development cost, again reflected of the investment in brand advertising; higher professional service fees; expenses, principally due to compliance and an increase in compensation expense, mostly due to merit increases. These increased costs were partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expense.
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the second half of the year, however, at a lower rate of growth versus the 3.4% excluding notable items that we've reported for the second quarter. 
Our current expectation is for linked expenses to increase 2.5% to 3% in the third quarter, but let me provide some additional detail. We anticipate that the FDIC surcharge assessment for larger banks will begin in the third quarter, which will increase our expenses by approximately $20 million. Additionally, expenses related to our tax credit business are seasonally higher as we move into the third quarter. These 2 items account for more than half of the expected quarterly expense growth. 
In the second quarter, preferred dividend totaled $80 million, which compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2016. The linked-quarter increase is reflective of a recent preferred stock issuance with a semi-annual dividend payment that we'll repeat again in quarter 4. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our capital position remains strong and in the second quarter, we returned 77% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. On June 29, we announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan. As a result, we announced a $2.6 billion stock buyback program that commenced on July 1, and announced an expected increase in our third quarter common dividend of 9.8%. We would expect to remain in our targeted payout range of 60% to 80% going forward.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at June 30, was 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. 
Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.46 at June 30, representing a 10% increase over the same quarter of last year, and a 3% increase over the prior quarter. 
I will now turn the call back to Richard."

I'll have Andy give you a little color on the detail as he oversees all of those revenue businesses, but I will say, it continues to be a theme of repetitive quarter after quarter, where on the wholesale side, you're seeing increased Capital Markets activity that, in fact, move up and trigger loan repayments and lower line utilization and M&A-related activity. So on the wholesale side, we're not -- still not seeing the kind of organic growth we'd like to see, but we are pleased, as we said in our comments, that we have a fully capable capital markets business in order to take the benefit of what would otherwise be some activities we didn't use to have in the company when customers moved outside of the lending market and into the Capital Markets. On the consumer side, we're seeing all areas moving slowly but surely and nicely, favorably from autos to RVs to credit cards and home equity. And then we particularly have a good story to tell in the mortgage business as we continue to be a bigger player in that area. So it's a lot of the same John, but everything has got a generally positive -- slightly positive bias, but a lot of the opportunity at wholesale market is yet to be the kind of organic growth that we all want to see, that gives evidence in a more healthy and robust economic environment.

Hope the knuckles are white, but we're hanging in there. A couple of thoughts, Jon. I want to start by saying, I'll give you guys forward-looking view that we intend, at this point, at least for the second half of the year, to stay in the 54% range, 54.0% to 54.9% kind of a range in our efficiency ratio. And I'm giving you that because I don't know exactly with no interest rates, a flat -- very flat yield curve, and that can move either -- they can move at any time and they seem to be very volatile. And we're not giving up on positive operating leverage, but it's getting a lot harder. And I'd rather just tell you guys, that we're going to stay at the same current level, and we've been there for a couple of quarters now of efficiency. Because what I am saying is, we already are under a pretty steady and measured expense control program. We've got an FTE hold in the company that before any growth items and areas for compliance. We haven't added those now since February of last year, and we continue to watch all the noncritical expenses, the discretionary expenses to a point that we think is right up to the line where it we'd started to impair our new growth. And new guys investing, that's not just for this quarter or next quarter, but for the long term, and we're going to be very careful not to overreact, and we have been careful so far not to do that. So our expenses will go up, as we said, less than the 3.4% linked-quarter. Next quarter, it'd be 2.5% to 3%. And as Kathy mentioned, half of that will be in the FDIC premium costs and in the CDC, which typically has higher expenses in the second half. The rest is just core part of the adding people for portfolios, adding to compliance. And as you said, professional services starts -- it did peak this quarter, starts to come down. But I'll tell you, it comes down very slowly, so it's not a big measured improvement. But it is, at least, a point in fact that this will be our highest quarter, I hope, on record. So that gives you a little more color. And I think at a 54% range that gives us enough room to have some prices during the quarter, but also protect the knowledge for you that we are not going to do something to get to 52%. And I don't see this thing moving into the 55s and 56s."

However, I'll remind you that our M&A in the area of merchant portfolios, credit card portfolios, mortgage business activities, trust activities, none of those are precluded under that order, and those have been exactly the things we have in the last 5 years consistently as part of our M&A. So we haven't been precluded from doing what we've wanted to do. And as I said before, there hasn't been a bank deal or a branch deal that we've wanted since the Citizen Chicago deal that we've precluded from.

There are a few moving pieces in merchant I want to explain. So first, one of the principal drivers of merchant fee revenue is same-store sales, and same-store sales in North America were up just under 2%, 1.8%. And in Europe, they were up about 5%. So globally, up about 2.6%. And what you typically see from us is same-store sales plus 1% to 2% is total merchant revenue growth. What happened this quarter is, while we were up 2% on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude FX, that's up 3%, that is also now flattening out revenue related to equipment sales. So we were up higher in prior quarters because equipment sales were going up. They are sort of leveled off. We've lapped that, so to speak. The only thing that you'll see is our transaction volume is down, and that was intentional. We exited some low margin business, so it did had impact on transaction volume, but as you saw, not a tremendous impact on fee income. So as we look forward to the next few quarters, I would expect, again, same-store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of our fee growth in merchant volume. You asked about the other payments business, so let me comment on that. Credit card is very strong. Excluding Fidelity, we were up about 6%, and that's driven by card transaction volume growth of about 7%, and I would expect that to continue in the future quarters. And then finally, on corporate payment systems. A very good story there is that we're seeing growth in the corporate side of the equation. While government is continuing to be flat, our corporate fee income is growing. Transaction volume, sales volumes up about 6%, and that's a function of the investments we made in virtual pay and product activity, which is very positive. So T&E continues to be weak or level or down a bit, but payables and virtual pay is up strong."

You may recall, those of you who've followed us for a decade, we started our business -- merchant acquiring business, in the U.K. That's where it's actually headquartered, so a disproportionate amount of business is in the U.K. And actually, if there's a lot of prognosis, we believe it's going to be a lot more travel and visits and spending over in the U.K. which is net positive for us. And given our portfolio mix being heavy on hotels, retail -- hoteliers and airlines that could be quite positive as well, offsetting any variances that may occur in the rest of the European market through this disruption.

I'll also remind you that commercial real estate has a CMBS market where there is a lot of activity and our guidance is telling us that the lack of buyers, coming particularly from the life insurers, has affected the refinance and purchase activity, which only serves to say that there is a reduced pace to payoffs. So part of the increase is actually good news. We're keeping the customers we have. But we're not striving to get new customers at any kind of risk of underwriting or pricing change. I think the portfolio will prove itself more over time. Andy and Bill can add a little color about where the growth is, and where we see pockets of strength. But we love this business, we're very good at it, but I promise you we're just not going to get greedy at a time like this in the marketplace or on terms or underwriting because it's easy to do and it's not going to happen here. So Andy, you might go first."

What we said was in quarter 3, which is all we can see into, we have a 3 to 4 basis point prediction of NIM decrease. I have no idea what quarter 4 would be. As we woke up this morning, you know that the call for interest rate increases is 21% for September and 36% for December, better than 0, worse than it was when we talked last time. So we're not going to bet on any of that, but to the extent that any of it comes back would be terrific. Also, the 10-years above 150 again, thank God, that is helpful to us as interest rate increases. And you know there's equal impact on the income statement based on that. So if we can manage through these very worst times, which is continued zero interest rate increases and very, very low 10-year,  we can manage through just about anything, which is how we're building the lower for longer kind of term around the company. So for one quarter, we can see that pressure. We can't predict beyond that. I'll have Kathy talk a bit more about the sequencing and the importance of the refinancing that occurs in the securities and the fact that we're actually seeing stable performance in most margin areas for compression as it relates to competitors."

Swear to god, honest engine, we are taking market share we have been for years. Think of our home equity portfolio, it's still growing, albeit slightly, but that's been shrinking across the industry. Auto loans, we've never gotten out of it, so we're still in a big leasing. We're now one of the few players that are really quite capable at it. We've been doubling down on credit cards and you're seeing some of our recent portfolio and partnerships. So it's mostly a market share. There's not a market that's actually weaker than it was a year ago. But for all intents and purposes, there is not a market much stronger than it was either. And what I think really turns on the dial for banks is when corporate America is more confident. And I don't mean the original old unconfident, we're always uncertain. But things with the presidential election in the offing, things like Brexit uncertainties, we don't need any of the things like that to continue to give corporate America reason to just wait. And -- but for M&A and for restructuring the balance sheet, corporate America is not organic doing big things, at least not needing banks in that process. So that's when the thing really starts to take off. But in the meantime, we're all getting it out in the trenches trying to keep more customers and do more with the ones we have.

But I'll tell you, the same answer I gave 3 years ago with Square when Square started coming out big with Starbucks. And at least for now, not for long term, but for now, most of these transactions are taking money out of this with cash out of the system, not other card, debit or credit transactions. There's still so much cash in our system, in our society. There's plenty of disintermediation of cash long before it starts to tap up against the other card businesses, and that's what we're all planning for in the near term and that could be a couple of years. But short beyond that period of time, we all have to be very thoughtful. And your question is right on the money as it relates to what's the evolving relationship between real-time, pay to pay, card, card not present and the mobility of people moving money about in a different environment. Remember, we are still under a Federal Reserve circumstance that settles overnight and not over the weekend. So there's still a big disconnect, and we have those things to fix systemically before we get to a real real-time payments. But for now, just remediation is mostly seen on cash, and that's a net positive for us in the other banks because we have no benefit in cash moving about for the most part. We do when it starts to monetize itself in the form of a payment."

And it's a small nuance on a word, but the recession said things are going backwards where people are starting to feel worse and not taking actions that they might otherwise have taken before. We are not seeing that. On the other hand, because we're balance sheet companies and because we're highly levered and because half of what we do is in the wholesale business, we're all, I think, spending a lot of energy talking about how we're waiting for the wholesale side of the balance sheet to pick up in a real organic, old-fashioned way and we're also not seeing that. But they're not going backwards, so just taking this long, long, long period of time to restructure, evaluate their best options when things do pick up. And there's nothing wrong with that, but that's why we have all these unused commitments and continue to grow the balance sheet. On the business side, they've got reasons and they're informed and they're waiting. But on the consumer side, it's a little bit better every quarter and it's not a recession. And I would disagree if someone's saying that at that level. And in fact, I think you can see consumers are starting to spend again. Their savings has hit a level that they are comfortable.  They're using their credit cards and they're paying it back on time and getting rewards for it. But I would say it actually make sense to me.

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.

I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. 
U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or a record $0.84 per diluted common share. 
I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. Industry-leading profitability was supported by solid loan and deposit growth in broad-based core [indiscernible]. As a reminder, our prior quarter results included notable items, including a Visa gain of $180 million in noninterest income and $150 million related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution in noninterest expense. 
There were no notable items to report in the third quarter, so for the remainder of this call, we will discuss the results on a core basis, excluding the notable second quarter items I just described, as this is how we believe the investment community looks in our results. 
Slide 4 provides you with the 5-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. In the third quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.5% and our efficiency ratio was 54.5%. 
Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue of $5.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding notable items in the second quarter of 2016, this represents an increase of 2.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Our revenue growth is primarily driven by loan growth of 1.1% and strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including mortgage banking and payment services. 
The industry continues to face headwinds from the low rate environment and the flatter yield curve. This quarter, our net interest margin was also impacted by higher levels of cash balances due to the strong deposit inflows. However, despite a lower interest margin, which declined by 4 basis points to 2.98% in line with expectations, we reported net interest income growth both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality was stable in the third quarter as expected. Both nonperforming assets and net charge-offs decreased modestly compared with the prior linked quarter. 
Before turning to Terry, I'll provide you with an outlook for the fourth quarter. Currently, we expect average loans to continue to grow in the range of 1% to 1.5% sequentially. While mortgage loan growth is expected to slow in line with industry-wide tapering of refinancing activity and due to seasonality. We look for a rebound in commercial loan growth in the fourth quarter and expect strength in consumer loans to continue. 
Given the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin will decline a couple of basis points. However, we expect net interest income will increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by growth in earning assets. 
We look for somewhat lower mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter in line with an expectation of lower refinancing activity. We expect expenses to grow 2.5% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally higher expenses, including tax credit amortization cost related to our community development business. 
And finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable and we expect the provision to increase in line with loan growth. 
Terry will now provide you with more details about our third quarter results."

I'll start on Slide 6, which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acqui",1427,"Thanks, Richard. I'll start on Slide 6, which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acquisitions completed in the second half of last year and student loans that were reclassified to held for investment in the third quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.4% compared to the prior year. 
In the third quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.0% and strong growth in average total residential mortgage loans of 8.6%. Consumer loan growth was broad based, led by credit card loans and other retail loans. Specifically, credit card loans grew 5.9%, excluding the retail card acquisition; and other retail loans grew 5.2%, excluding the student loans. Home equity loans grew 2.4% on a year-over-year basis, with growth primarily sourced from our branch network. 
On a linked-quarter basis, our average loan growth was 1.1%, in line with our expectations. Credit card loans grew 2.4%, residential mortgage loans grew 1.4%, home equity loans were up 0.5% and other retail loans were up 2.7%. Total average deposits increased by more than $28 billion or 10% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and were up 3.6% on a linked-quarter basis. 
On a year-over-year basis, the trend reflected strong growth of 11.9% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing deposits and our interest-bearing savings deposits. This strong core deposit growth more than offset the run-off in higher-cost time deposits.
Turning to Slide 7. Credit quality remained relatively stable in the third quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs increased by $23 million or 7.9% compared with the prior year, a decrease by $2 million compared with the second quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 46 basis points in the third quarter, unchanged from the prior year and down from the 48 basis points reported in the linked quarter. Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $97 million or 6.2%, mostly due to downgrades that occurred in the prior quarters related to energy credit. 
Linked quarter, nonperforming assets decreased by $8 million or less than 1%, primarily driven mainly from improvements in residential mortgages and other real estate. We continue to add to the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter in line with loan growth.
Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results comparable -- versus comparable periods. Third quarter net income increased by $13 million or 0.9% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenue growth was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 
As Richard mentioned, results in the prior quarter were impacted by notable items, including a $180 million Visa gain in noninterest income and $150 million in noninterest expenses related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution. Excluding notable items from the second quarter, net income increased by $2 million or 0.1%, reflecting total net revenue growth of 2.3%, offset by noninterest expense growth of 3.1%. Our efficiency ratio of 54.5% was in line with our guidance of 54% to 54.9%.
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by $122 million or 4.3% compared with the prior year. Strong average earning asset growth was offset somewhat by the impact of a 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 2.98%. The year-over-year decline in the net interest margin primarily reflected increased funding cost, higher average cash balances and lower rates on securities purchases, partially offset by higher rates on new loans.
Compared with the second quarter of 2016, taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $47 million or 1.6%. Growth in average total loans was offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The linked quarter decline in the margin primarily reflects the impact of higher cash balances, which represented 3 out of the 4 basis point decline, as well as lower average rates on securities purchased, offset somewhat by the benefit of higher LIBOR rates on loans during the quarter. 
Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income, which increased $119 million or 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to growth in mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenue and merchant processing revenue. 
Mortgage banking revenue increased $90 million or 40.2%, supported by core growth and strong industry-wide refinancing activity which drove originations and sales volume. Trust and investment management fees increased $33 million or 10%, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, growth in assets under management and improved equity markets. A $30 million or 11.2% increase in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolios.
Merchant processing revenue increased $12 million or 3%. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, merchant processing revenue increased 5.3% from the prior year. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income increased $73 million or 3.1%. The increase was principally due to stronger mortgage banking revenue and growth in payment services revenue. 
Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million or 31.9%, which slightly exceeded our previous guidance range of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenue was driven by higher production volumes, reflecting stronger refinancing activity. Mortgage banking revenue was also supported by a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rates, net of hedging activities. 
Corporate payment products revenue increased by $9 million or 5.0%. And as a reminder, corporate payment products revenue is seasonally stronger in the third quarter of each year. 
Merchant processing revenue increased $9 million or 2.2% due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, merchant processing revenue would have increased by 3.5% sequentially. 
Commercial product revenue decreased by $19 million or 8.0%, primarily due to higher capital markets volume in the second quarter, which in turn reflected market volatility during that quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense increased $156 million or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation expense grew versus the prior year primarily due to hiring decisions to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as the impact of merit increases and variable compensation tied to production. 
Professional services increased $12 million or 10.4%, also reflecting costs associated with compliance programs. Technology and communication expense increased $21 million or 9.5%, including the impact of capital investments and costs related to the acquired credit card portfolios. 
We continue our investment in our brand, which is reflected in slightly higher marketing cost from a year ago. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $89 million or 3.1%. Compensation expense increased $52 million or 4.1% due to the impact of 1 additional day in the quarter and increased staffing. The $23 million increase or 5.1% in other noninterest expense primarily reflected seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and the impact of the FDIC surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016.
Marketing and business development cost decreased $7 million or 6.4% due to the timing of various marketing programs. 
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the fourth quarter, however, at a slower pace than the 3.1% growth that we reported in the third quarter. Our current expectation is for linked-quarter expenses to grow by 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to seasonal expenses, including tax credit amortization cost, which we expect will increase, on a linked-quarter basis, approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we realize the benefit of these tax credits in our tax rate. 
The linked-quarter decline in preferred dividends was reflective of our fourth quarter 2015 preferred stock issuance which has a semi-annual dividend payment. As a result of that issuance, we will have higher quarterly dividends in quarters 2 and 4 of every year compared with quarters 1 and 3. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our capital position remained strong. And in the third quarter, we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward. 
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, as if fully implemented at September 30, was 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.85 at September 30, representing a 9.6% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.1% increase over the prior quarter. 
I will now turn it back to Richard."

Meaning that we're strong in quarter 2 and we expect it to recover in quarter 4. In part based on what we believe is the vagaries of quarter 3, where we had some of the Brexit activities move things up into quarter 2, and some -- perhaps, some of the uncertainty around election and other things moving things into quarter 4. But we see that returning nonetheless. You'll see that we had a particularly kind of across-the-board performance in most of the corporate space as the slowdown reflected things like higher pay downs, reduction in deal activity. And a healthy capital market condition allowed some borrowers to use the debt markets, although we also captured some of that in our capital markets activity. The rest of the lending, though, on the consumer side remained strong, and in fact, got stronger as the year progresses, and we continue to see that progressing into quarter 4 as well. But for a little more color on commercial and CRE, maybe we'll have Andy give you that."

And finally, M&A activity, which was a driver of strong growth in prior quarters, took a little bit of a pause here in the third quarter, either delayed or deferred to future quarters. So those factors all come into play, and that's why we think it was more of a pause, and then we'll come back a little bit as we [indiscernible]."

So the best way to keep it low is to do more revenue, which is our #1 goal. Expense-wise, I think we've telegraphed to you all that we appreciate that the higher cost of compliance and actually some of the capital expenditures we've been making in innovation technology continue to bear down on expenses. So I will continue to let expenses grow only to the level that revenue is allowing it under these circumstances that we set forth at the Investor Day, which is that we think there'll be a couple of rate increases, nominal rate increase, in 2017. With those rate increases, we made a commitment to you all, based on what we can see today, to provide slightly positive operating leverage in this environment. We also said, however, if those rates still materialize, it will be much harder for us to do that. And to give you a sense of it, without the rates -- a couple of rate increases in the next year, that for us, is hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses that we would need to reduce further, and I think, would probably cut into some of the muscle of the company's long-term objectives for growth and innovation. So we're not going to make that commitment at this stage, but we'll watch every nickel and dime. I also find a need to pause and remind you guys. To be in the 54s isn't, like, easy. We don't sit there and don't -- we watch every nickel and dime, and we have efficiency programs all over the company. Now the ways we've kept it low is we continue to get better every day, and we take innovation and we let technology make it more efficient for our company and for our people, and therefore, better service. But it's not easy. So we do have expense programs all the time, every day and forever. And some of the companies I know that announced efficiency programs, they put names around them, they give you dollar amounts. We don't do that because it's not our style. We also don't need to, but we do watch it every single day. So we will let revenue be the dictate in most cases to how well that efficiency ratio performs. Our goal is to have it to continue to be in the mid-50s. And for a while at that point, we'll measure against a future that, I think, won't be starved for investment. The same token the minute things get better. And we have every opportunity to save a dollar, we will use it, do that very thing and give you a better return."

We anticipate that it's going to be transitory and that those cash balances will start to dissipate as people kind of get more comfortable with the money market reform.

We did in that range of 1% to 1.5% for a long, long time, and every quarter is different. And yet, we found a way to pretty much stay there. And I think you can count on that to be a forerunner for the future. When revenue is -- when growth is strong in retail, it might be stressed in commercial, but this is a really well-bifurcated model we have here. And we like C&I, we like CRE, we like all consumer categories, but we see actually a little slightly stronger 2017 than '16 based on nothing more than the fact that oil gets better a little bit, slowly but surely, and because we're taking market share. And I haven't talked about market share in a number of quarters because I know it's a hollow kind of a category when all banks are doing well, nobody talks about it. But we really are -- $28 billion in deposits in 1 year. The kind of loan growth we've had consistently, 10% commercial loan growth year-over-year, and we're taking market share. And part of that, John, is also a proxy for our next year because we believe that market share momentum not only continues, but it gets stronger. Now in anybody in our environment, just think of the foreign banks or think of other banks that go through any period of stress, we get the benefit of that. And as long as we continue to be -- if we're not their first customer, we're their first choice after that particular bank they're with, that's going to be a really good way for us to grow the business. So next year is, across the board, we expect to be strong in virtually every category. Look at our home equity. We continue to grow home equity. It's not with smoke and mirrors. We do it the old-fashioned way, with really good products and really good branch-based products coming out of the branch employees. And that's something that is really quite a difference for most of the companies that we compete with. So we can do across the board and we like all the categories. So I think quarter 4. we'll continue to be in that range. I think next year, we'll be in that range and maybe a slightly positive bias to that."

If I had it, I wouldn't tell you because, the regulators, I haven't made any agreements. So that will take a while. It will definitely be well into next year that we'll get a line of sight and when we can look for an exit of that. In the meantime, it's taken us to a compliance cost level that I hope to recover when we got out of the mortgage consent order, which we're now long out of. But as it turns out, when the AML consent order came in, it virtually replaced those same costs. So with our growth expectation of reducing expenses, we're unable to do that at this point. But it's also finding its way now into kind of the run rate of the company. It's also made us a better bank. I don't like consent orders, and we only have the one and it's frustrating to me. But the fact of the matter is, it's a proxy for the expectations of 0 tolerance for errors. And we've aligned that proxy with everything we do, that it takes a little bit of time to adjust to it, it takes a little bit more money to get your first, second and third lines to do amazing levels of oversight and quality assurance. But once and when you've done that and you put it into your run rate, both in cost and in the way you do business, we'll be a better bank for it. So I'd like you to think that the AML project has extended itself through the whole company to improve our compliance capability, and therefore, send off any other future areas of shortcomings. And I would say next year, we'll be able to give you a better line of sight. But at this stage, we're deep in the middle of it doing our very best job to satisfy the regulators and to over-perform even to our own expectations. And at this point, I'd be hesitant to give you any kind of an actual timetable."

So it is coming down, based upon what we're seeing. You are right that when you end up looking at kind of the mix of where a lot of that refinancing is coming from, it's coming from high-quality product, again, primarily sourced a lot, probably a higher mix through our retail banking system. And so when you end up looking at the gain on sale and that margin, we are seeing, in the third quarter, a better margin than what we had experienced in the past.

Trust fees will be a bit of a function of what the market is doing. We had a strong quarter this quarter with both strong market activity as well as good core growth. I would expect that to continue. And then Terry made reference to money market reform. We did see quite a shift in our balances also. Our prime funds went down in the neighborhood of $6 billion, given money market reform, but our government funds went up almost $9 billion.

Your merit increases alone, say, at a 3%, 3%-plus, and our total expenses are half compensation. That's 1.5% right there. Number two, I want to make it clear. We're spending a lot more in our CapEx in innovation and technology. Gosh, 5 years ago, this company was at a $400 million, $500 million max annual investment in CapEx. This year, it's going to be between $800 million and $1 billion. Now the run rate's probably going to be more like $750 million to $800 million. That's good because it's appropriate because we're now more of a technology company than we used to be. And given our payments leadership, we should be. So making those kinds of investments, which of course, will yield value down the line. So that's another piece of it. What's left then is the compensation cost and the overall just running the company better and spending money on things that we didn't use to spend time, money on, like quality issuance which isn't related to compliance, that's just doing the job better. And making our people are paid fairly, the compensation is entire, it's employee benefits and it's the way we treat the employees and making sure that the culture itself is strong across all the categories. And sometimes, you have to spend money to make sure that the brand is protected, that the employees feel safe, that the work environment is good. And we're investing in all of those things, too. So compliance is a piece of it, Erika. That 6% is a number I don't want to see to hold on a long course of time. I'd like if it comes down -- in more -- in over the course of time, more like a 3% to 5% because I do think you have to spend money on investments. But that's a little bit high and compliance is probably the delta on that, that 1% to 2% delta that I want to bring down over time in these most current periods. So it's probably 1/3 of it, but it's also a part that won't sustain over the course of a long period of time because once we get it right, we'll get the benefits back."

I just wanted to start off by saying we look at this whole topic at industry and individual bank. Many years ago, with a roundtable, we made an effort to consider a nationwide brand reputation rebuilding after the downturn and discovered very quickly that American population wasn't ready for that. The bank industry certainly doesn't speak yet as one voice. And even today, it still doesn't, but we did agree that each of us can do a much better job of satisfying our own customers and building our own bread. And eventually, the totality of that would be the way to rebuild. And I think we're not where we'd like to be, but that's the way to do it. So each bank needs to stand very strongly on its own and do what's right by the customers. And if one bank falls away from that, then it's just one bank, it's not an industry. So we'll figure it out we tell that story better. At our company, it starts with  it's where you start that matters the most in terms of sales culture. And it's not only sales culture. Just underline the word culture. Sales practices are part of that. The way you incentivize people the way you handle your customers. So answering your last question first, the guarantee is always stand behind what you promises, over perform if you made a mistake, atone and apologize, fix what's wrong and then figure out how that applies to the next possible action that could otherwise become a problem later. I want to talk about bankers going from baggage handlers to pilots in the same company. In fact, this morning, baggage handlers now has to be more like pilots if you all that at the White House. But we believe that same thing is. I think as an industry, we have to be much better at handling every individual transaction uniquely, and honestly and genuinely. And when we make mistake, get it right, fix it and apply to the next phase. You don't mean, like as anybody on this call, we've never been used the word cross sell. I don't even know if the cross sell as of this day. I think I have never ever looked at have that number. I would guess it's between 2 and 4 because nobody want any part of their life cycle needs more than probably 2 or 4 services at one time from a bank, but we don't measure that with all set quarters. What we do instead is ask our employees to make sure people know what we have so that their life cycle change needs and it were a trusted partner, the last was 4. So what that means is people buy our products, we don't sell them. And as long as they have something, we have something they want and it's for services rendered and fees benefited, well, we're happy to provide that. I want to make sure it's clear though, for this industry, selling is not bad. It's not bad anywhere. But as long as you're selling to people's needs and you're making it clear what advantages you have to provide them at the time that they want them. So yes, it's tough on the industry, but it's always goes back to people love their banker. That they like their bank, that they made those choices. They don't so much like the industry. Worse as years away from getting that right. But if every bank and every banker does a better job despite what happens on occasion in one location or another, they've got a fighting chance to bring these things back. And I'll close the soliloquy with the fact that this has all been accomplished under a very negative environment, like economic environment. One of the reasons banks were popular 10 years ago, notwithstanding the downturn, was when times are good, banks were doing more positive things. People are healthier, the economy's moving more quickly, people want us to do so we can say yes more often. When the world gets a little bit better, we can say yes more often, we're more popular, we're more effective. When times are tough, we actually move on defense, so we're there to protect people from things that could put them in harm's way. That's a lot attractive position. People would like to watch games because low scoring. At the end of the day,  at the very end. It really doesn't matter. So I just think it's a noble occupation. I'm very proud of what we do. I'm very proud with people to do it across this country. So one of the most important things that we have in America is what makes us unique. And, by the way, it's the only place we can leverage. $1 deposit, it's a good bank. It's worth $7 in loans, and that is an amazing way to grow the economy. So I just felt that we'll get there one day, but 1 day at a time, we can control it on that basis and we're doing our best to do that."

So it is a high-quality portfolio, and I'm very comfortable with the credit. It -- one phenomenon. It is occurring in the marketplace. Its residual values are coming down a bit and that's a function of dealer incentives going up, which makes the comparison of new versus used favor the new.

There's not a lot here new and there will be some adjustments to the election. But as you know, most of these positions are not tied directly to the election or directly to the President's term. They have different term timetables and think the FDIC and the OCC to name 2. So I think the philosophies and the general sense of what regulation looks like for banks is pretty well set. I think we understand most of those rules and what we're dealing with now is new ones that's why at speeches make so much attention because we're trying to read TVs and figure out the change in the systemic. I don't think there's anything major to change. I also think a new President, which is undoubtedly going to happen, has a slight variation one way or the other. I won't talk about which one, I think that's which, but one gets a little more uncertain and causes us to stand out back a little bit and wait to see how things settle. The other one is a lot more of the same. And probably, whether we like it or not, it's something we can manage because it's the devil we know. Either way, I don't think any circumferences where bank regulation gets easier or lightens. I don't see a significant [indiscernible] any tougher or get a lot stronger. I do think there's going to be a need for us to particularly respond as current issue on culture and doing the right thing and that makes sense to me, and that's the place that welcome that oversight. And in fact, maybe to the earlier question, we have banks are proven for the most part, doing really the right things the right way, that might be a very positive for the American people because now know that we're stronger, they know we're safer. They don't know that we intend to be good with that. And if we can improve that over the course of the next couple of years, specially as the economy might get better in time, I think we're in a pretty good place. But for this thing, there's not a lot  we don't spend a lot of energy trying to figure out what's going to happen next. We have relationships [indiscernible], both local and national, that we know and trust. And for us, it's part of doing business, and I think it's a normal course of running the bank.

I don't know how far it's going, but it's the first look at more things like incentive practices and there will be, I think, eventually culture. One thing is culture we have for the very beginning, but I think that, Nancy, that will find its way probably through more like to the OCC and the that they have as they oversee the banks and then assess for the said banks will find their own way to approach it. I don't necessarily see going into new this test environment at this early stage. I see them more of a pot practice for the ratings and the overall that valuation of management and board oversight. So for me, I think, it's just another new one. So we keep getting different things. There's a spotlight on stage, right. Everything's on the stage, but you can only see the spotlight on. It's just going to move across and now find something in the form of culture. I think we're all going to need to put better words around what we do. I think that we have to prove what we do. I think we have to sustainability to good practices, and that does require us to do a lot more record-keeping, a lot more auditing, a lot more quality assurance.

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the",560,"Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. 
I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or a record $0.84 per diluted common share. 
I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. Industry-leading profitability was supported by solid loan and deposit growth in broad-based core [indiscernible]. As a reminder, our prior quarter results included notable items, including a Visa gain of $180 million in noninterest income and $150 million related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution in noninterest expense. 
There were no notable items to report in the third quarter, so for the remainder of this call, we will discuss the results on a core basis, excluding the notable second quarter items I just described, as this is how we believe the investment community looks in our results. 
Slide 4 provides you with the 5-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. In the third quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.5% and our efficiency ratio was 54.5%. 
Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue of $5.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding notable items in the second quarter of 2016, this represents an increase of 2.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Our revenue growth is primarily driven by loan growth of 1.1% and strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including mortgage banking and payment services. 
The industry continues to face headwinds from the low rate environment and the flatter yield curve. This quarter, our net interest margin was also impacted by higher levels of cash balances due to the strong deposit inflows. However, despite a lower interest margin, which declined by 4 basis points to 2.98% in line with expectations, we reported net interest income growth both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality was stable in the third quarter as expected. Both nonperforming assets and net charge-offs decreased modestly compared with the prior linked quarter. 
Before turning to Terry, I'll provide you with an outlook for the fourth quarter. Currently, we expect average loans to continue to grow in the range of 1% to 1.5% sequentially. While mortgage loan growth is expected to slow in line with industry-wide tapering of refinancing activity and due to seasonality. We look for a rebound in commercial loan growth in the fourth quarter and expect strength in consumer loans to continue. 
Given the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin will decline a couple of basis points. However, we expect net interest income will increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by growth in earning assets. 
We look for somewhat lower mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter in line with an expectation of lower refinancing activity. We expect expenses to grow 2.5% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally higher expenses, including tax credit amortization cost related to our community development business. 
And finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable and we expect the provision to increase in line with loan growth. 
Terry will now provide you with more details about our third quarter results."

I'll start on Slide 6, which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acqui",1427,"Thanks, Richard. I'll start on Slide 6, which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acquisitions completed in the second half of last year and student loans that were reclassified to held for investment in the third quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.4% compared to the prior year. 
In the third quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.0% and strong growth in average total residential mortgage loans of 8.6%. Consumer loan growth was broad based, led by credit card loans and other retail loans. Specifically, credit card loans grew 5.9%, excluding the retail card acquisition; and other retail loans grew 5.2%, excluding the student loans. Home equity loans grew 2.4% on a year-over-year basis, with growth primarily sourced from our branch network. 
On a linked-quarter basis, our average loan growth was 1.1%, in line with our expectations. Credit card loans grew 2.4%, residential mortgage loans grew 1.4%, home equity loans were up 0.5% and other retail loans were up 2.7%. Total average deposits increased by more than $28 billion or 10% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and were up 3.6% on a linked-quarter basis. 
On a year-over-year basis, the trend reflected strong growth of 11.9% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing deposits and our interest-bearing savings deposits. This strong core deposit growth more than offset the run-off in higher-cost time deposits.
Turning to Slide 7. Credit quality remained relatively stable in the third quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs increased by $23 million or 7.9% compared with the prior year, a decrease by $2 million compared with the second quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 46 basis points in the third quarter, unchanged from the prior year and down from the 48 basis points reported in the linked quarter. Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $97 million or 6.2%, mostly due to downgrades that occurred in the prior quarters related to energy credit. 
Linked quarter, nonperforming assets decreased by $8 million or less than 1%, primarily driven mainly from improvements in residential mortgages and other real estate. We continue to add to the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter in line with loan growth.
Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results comparable -- versus comparable periods. Third quarter net income increased by $13 million or 0.9% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenue growth was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 
As Richard mentioned, results in the prior quarter were impacted by notable items, including a $180 million Visa gain in noninterest income and $150 million in noninterest expenses related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution. Excluding notable items from the second quarter, net income increased by $2 million or 0.1%, reflecting total net revenue growth of 2.3%, offset by noninterest expense growth of 3.1%. Our efficiency ratio of 54.5% was in line with our guidance of 54% to 54.9%.
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by $122 million or 4.3% compared with the prior year. Strong average earning asset growth was offset somewhat by the impact of a 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 2.98%. The year-over-year decline in the net interest margin primarily reflected increased funding cost, higher average cash balances and lower rates on securities purchases, partially offset by higher rates on new loans.
Compared with the second quarter of 2016, taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $47 million or 1.6%. Growth in average total loans was offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The linked quarter decline in the margin primarily reflects the impact of higher cash balances, which represented 3 out of the 4 basis point decline, as well as lower average rates on securities purchased, offset somewhat by the benefit of higher LIBOR rates on loans during the quarter. 
Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income, which increased $119 million or 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to growth in mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenue and merchant processing revenue. 
Mortgage banking revenue increased $90 million or 40.2%, supported by core growth and strong industry-wide refinancing activity which drove originations and sales volume. Trust and investment management fees increased $33 million or 10%, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, growth in assets under management and improved equity markets. A $30 million or 11.2% increase in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolios.
Merchant processing revenue increased $12 million or 3%. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, merchant processing revenue increased 5.3% from the prior year. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income increased $73 million or 3.1%. The increase was principally due to stronger mortgage banking revenue and growth in payment services revenue. 
Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million or 31.9%, which slightly exceeded our previous guidance range of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenue was driven by higher production volumes, reflecting stronger refinancing activity. Mortgage banking revenue was also supported by a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rates, net of hedging activities. 
Corporate payment products revenue increased by $9 million or 5.0%. And as a reminder, corporate payment products revenue is seasonally stronger in the third quarter of each year. 
Merchant processing revenue increased $9 million or 2.2% due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, merchant processing revenue would have increased by 3.5% sequentially. 
Commercial product revenue decreased by $19 million or 8.0%, primarily due to higher capital markets volume in the second quarter, which in turn reflected market volatility during that quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense increased $156 million or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation expense grew versus the prior year primarily due to hiring decisions to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as the impact of merit increases and variable compensation tied to production. 
Professional services increased $12 million or 10.4%, also reflecting costs associated with compliance programs. Technology and communication expense increased $21 million or 9.5%, including the impact of capital investments and costs related to the acquired credit card portfolios. 
We continue our investment in our brand, which is reflected in slightly higher marketing cost from a year ago. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $89 million or 3.1%. Compensation expense increased $52 million or 4.1% due to the impact of 1 additional day in the quarter and increased staffing. The $23 million increase or 5.1% in other noninterest expense primarily reflected seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and the impact of the FDIC surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016.
Marketing and business development cost decreased $7 million or 6.4% due to the timing of various marketing programs. 
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the fourth quarter, however, at a slower pace than the 3.1% growth that we reported in the third quarter. Our current expectation is for linked-quarter expenses to grow by 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to seasonal expenses, including tax credit amortization cost, which we expect will increase, on a linked-quarter basis, approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we realize the benefit of these tax credits in our tax rate. 
The linked-quarter decline in preferred dividends was reflective of our fourth quarter 2015 preferred stock issuance which has a semi-annual dividend payment. As a result of that issuance, we will have higher quarterly dividends in quarters 2 and 4 of every year compared with quarters 1 and 3. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our capital position remained strong. And in the third quarter, we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward. 
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, as if fully implemented at September 30, was 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.85 at September 30, representing a 9.6% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.1% increase over the prior quarter. 
I will now turn it back to Richard."

In part based on what we believe is the vagaries of quarter 3, where we had some of the Brexit activities move things up into quarter 2, and some -- perhaps, some of the uncertainty around election and other things moving things into quarter 4. But we see that returning nonetheless. You'll see that we had a particularly kind of across-the-board performance in most of the corporate space as the slowdown reflected things like higher pay downs, reduction in deal activity. And a healthy capital market condition allowed some borrowers to use the debt markets, although we also captured some of that in our capital markets activity. The rest of the lending, though, on the consumer side remained strong, and in fact, got stronger as the year progresses, and we continue to see that progressing into quarter 4 as well. But for a little more color on commercial and CRE, maybe we'll have Andy give you that."

So the best way to keep it low is to do more revenue, which is our #1 goal. Expense-wise, I think we've telegraphed to you all that we appreciate that the higher cost of compliance and actually some of the capital expenditures we've been making in innovation technology continue to bear down on expenses. So I will continue to let expenses grow only to the level that revenue is allowing it under these circumstances that we set forth at the Investor Day, which is that we think there'll be a couple of rate increases, nominal rate increase, in 2017. With those rate increases, we made a commitment to you all, based on what we can see today, to provide slightly positive operating leverage in this environment. We also said, however, if those rates still materialize, it will be much harder for us to do that. And to give you a sense of it, without the rates -- a couple of rate increases in the next year, that for us, is hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses that we would need to reduce further, and I think, would probably cut into some of the muscle of the company's long-term objectives for growth and innovation. So we're not going to make that commitment at this stage, but we'll watch every nickel and dime. I also find a need to pause and remind you guys. To be in the 54s isn't, like, easy. We don't sit there and don't -- we watch every nickel and dime, and we have efficiency programs all over the company. Now the ways we've kept it low is we continue to get better every day, and we take innovation and we let technology make it more efficient for our company and for our people, and therefore, better service. But it's not easy. So we do have expense programs all the time, every day and forever. And some of the companies I know that announced efficiency programs, they put names around them, they give you dollar amounts. We don't do that because it's not our style. We also don't need to, but we do watch it every single day. So we will let revenue be the dictate in most cases to how well that efficiency ratio performs. Our goal is to have it to continue to be in the mid-50s. And for a while at that point, we'll measure against a future that, I think, won't be starved for investment. The same token the minute things get better. And we have every opportunity to save a dollar, we will use it, do that very thing and give you a better return."

We anticipate that it's going to be transitory and that those cash balances will start to dissipate as people kind of get more comfortable with the money market reform.

We did in that range of 1% to 1.5% for a long, long time, and every quarter is different. And yet, we found a way to pretty much stay there. And I think you can count on that to be a forerunner for the future. When revenue is -- when growth is strong in retail, it might be stressed in commercial, but this is a really well-bifurcated model we have here. And we like C&I, we like CRE, we like all consumer categories, but we see actually a little slightly stronger 2017 than '16 based on nothing more than the fact that oil gets better a little bit, slowly but surely, and because we're taking market share. And I haven't talked about market share in a number of quarters because I know it's a hollow kind of a category when all banks are doing well, nobody talks about it. But we really are -- $28 billion in deposits in 1 year. The kind of loan growth we've had consistently, 10% commercial loan growth year-over-year, and we're taking market share. And part of that, John, is also a proxy for our next year because we believe that market share momentum not only continues, but it gets stronger. Now in anybody in our environment, just think of the foreign banks or think of other banks that go through any period of stress, we get the benefit of that. And as long as we continue to be -- if we're not their first customer, we're their first choice after that particular bank they're with, that's going to be a really good way for us to grow the business. So next year is, across the board, we expect to be strong in virtually every category. Look at our home equity. We continue to grow home equity. It's not with smoke and mirrors. We do it the old-fashioned way, with really good products and really good branch-based products coming out of the branch employees. And that's something that is really quite a difference for most of the companies that we compete with. So we can do across the board and we like all the categories. So I think quarter 4. we'll continue to be in that range. I think next year, we'll be in that range and maybe a slightly positive bias to that."

If I had it, I wouldn't tell you because, the regulators, I haven't made any agreements. So that will take a while. It will definitely be well into next year that we'll get a line of sight and when we can look for an exit of that. In the meantime, it's taken us to a compliance cost level that I hope to recover when we got out of the mortgage consent order, which we're now long out of. But as it turns out, when the AML consent order came in, it virtually replaced those same costs. So with our growth expectation of reducing expenses, we're unable to do that at this point. But it's also finding its way now into kind of the run rate of the company. It's also made us a better bank. I don't like consent orders, and we only have the one and it's frustrating to me. But the fact of the matter is, it's a proxy for the expectations of 0 tolerance for errors. And we've aligned that proxy with everything we do, that it takes a little bit of time to adjust to it, it takes a little bit more money to get your first, second and third lines to do amazing levels of oversight and quality assurance. But once and when you've done that and you put it into your run rate, both in cost and in the way you do business, we'll be a better bank for it. So I'd like you to think that the AML project has extended itself through the whole company to improve our compliance capability, and therefore, send off any other future areas of shortcomings. And I would say next year, we'll be able to give you a better line of sight. But at this stage, we're deep in the middle of it doing our very best job to satisfy the regulators and to over-perform even to our own expectations. And at this point, I'd be hesitant to give you any kind of an actual timetable."

So it is coming down, based upon what we're seeing. You are right that when you end up looking at kind of the mix of where a lot of that refinancing is coming from, it's coming from high-quality product, again, primarily sourced a lot, probably a higher mix through our retail banking system. And so when you end up looking at the gain on sale and that margin, we are seeing, in the third quarter, a better margin than what we had experienced in the past.

Trust fees will be a bit of a function of what the market is doing. We had a strong quarter this quarter with both strong market activity as well as good core growth. I would expect that to continue. And then Terry made reference to money market reform. We did see quite a shift in our balances also. Our prime funds went down in the neighborhood of $6 billion, given money market reform, but our government funds went up almost $9 billion.

Your merit increases alone, say, at a 3%, 3%-plus, and our total expenses are half compensation. That's 1.5% right there. Number two, I want to make it clear. We're spending a lot more in our CapEx in innovation and technology. Gosh, 5 years ago, this company was at a $400 million, $500 million max annual investment in CapEx. This year, it's going to be between $800 million and $1 billion. Now the run rate's probably going to be more like $750 million to $800 million. That's good because it's appropriate because we're now more of a technology company than we used to be. And given our payments leadership, we should be. So making those kinds of investments, which of course, will yield value down the line. So that's another piece of it. What's left then is the compensation cost and the overall just running the company better and spending money on things that we didn't use to spend time, money on, like quality issuance which isn't related to compliance, that's just doing the job better. And making our people are paid fairly, the compensation is entire, it's employee benefits and it's the way we treat the employees and making sure that the culture itself is strong across all the categories. And sometimes, you have to spend money to make sure that the brand is protected, that the employees feel safe, that the work environment is good. And we're investing in all of those things, too. So compliance is a piece of it, Erika. That 6% is a number I don't want to see to hold on a long course of time. I'd like if it comes down -- in more -- in over the course of time, more like a 3% to 5% because I do think you have to spend money on investments. But that's a little bit high and compliance is probably the delta on that, that 1% to 2% delta that I want to bring down over time in these most current periods. So it's probably 1/3 of it, but it's also a part that won't sustain over the course of a long period of time because once we get it right, we'll get the benefits back."

I just want to start off by saying we've long looked at this whole topic as industry and individual bank. Many years ago at the financial services roundtable, we made an effort to consider a nationwide brand reputation rebuilding after the downturn and discovered very quickly that American population wasn't ready for that. The bank industry, sadly, doesn't speak yet as one voice. And even today, still doesn't. But we did agree that each of us could do a much better job of satisfying our own customers and building our own brand, and eventually, the totality of that would be the way to rebuild. And I think, sadly, we're not where we'd like to be, but that's the way to do it. So each bank needs to stand very strongly on its own and do what's right by its customers. And if one bank falls away from that, then it's just one bank, it's not an industry. So we'll figure it out we tell that story better. At our company, it starts with -- it's where you start that matters the most, in terms of sales culture. And it's not only a sales culture, it's culture. Just underline the word culture. Sales practice is a part of that. The way you incentivize people is part of that, the way you handle your customers. So answering your last question first, the guarantee is always stand behind what you promised, over perform. If you made a mistake, atone and apologize, fix what's wrong and then figure out how that applies to the next possible action that could otherwise become a problem later. I've long talked about bankers going from baggage handlers to pilots in the same company. And in fact, as of this morning, baggage handlers now have to be more like pilots if you follow the news out of the White House. But we believe that same thing is the case. I think as an industry, we have to be much better at handling every individual transaction uniquely and honestly and genuinely. And when we make mistakes, get it right, fix it and apply to the next things. You know me, Mike, I've been with you as long as anybody on this call, and we've never even used the word cross-sell. We -- I don't even know what the cross-sell is with this bank. Honest to God, I've never, ever looked at that number. I would guess it's between 2 and 4 because nobody wants -- any part of their life cycle needs more than probably 2 or 4 services at one time from a bank. But we don't measure that. We don't set quotas. What we do instead do is ask our employees to make sure people know what we have so that as their life cycle change needs, and if we're the trusted partner, they'll ask us for it. So what that means is people buy our products, we don't sell them. And as long as they have something -- we have something they want and it's for services rendered and he's benefited, we'll be happy to provide that. I want to make sure it's clear though, for this industry, selling is not bad. It's not bad anywhere. But as long as you're selling to people's needs and you're making it clear what advantages you have to provide them at the time that they want them. So yes, it's tough on the industry, but it still always goes back to people love their banker, they like their bank because they made those choices. They don't so much like the industry. We're, sadly, years away from getting that right. But if every bank and every banker does a better job, despite what happens on occasion in one location or another, you've got a fighting chance to bring this thing back. And I'll close the soliloquy with the fact that this has all been accomplished under a very negative environment, economic environment. One of the reasons banks were popular 10 years ago, notwithstanding the downturn, was when times are good, banks were doing more positive things. People are healthier, the economy is moving more quickly, people want us, and we definitely can say yes more often. When the world gets a little bit better, we could say yes more often, we're more popular and we're more effective. When times are tough, actually move on defense, so we're there to protect people from things that could get them in harm's way. That's a less attractive position. People don't like to watch defensive games either because it's low scoring. At the end of the day, at the very end, it really doesn't matter. So I just think it's a noble occupation. I'm very proud of what we do. I'm very proud of the people that do it across this country. It's one of the most important things that we have in America, and it's what makes us unique. And by the way, it's the only place we you leverage. $1 of deposits at a good bank is worth $7 in loans, and that is an amazing way to grow the economy. So I'm going to still be in the camp that we'll get there one day, but one bank at a time, we can control it on that basis, and we're doing our best here to do that.

So it is a high-quality portfolio, and I'm very comfortable with the credit. It -- one phenomenon that is occurring in the marketplace is residual values are coming down a bit, and that's a function of dealer incentives going up, which makes the comparison of new versus used favor the new.

And there will be some adjustments to the election. But as you know, most of these positions are not tied directly to the election or directly to the President's term. They have different term timetables, and think the FDIC and the OCC to name 2. So I think the philosophies and the general sense of what regulation looks like for banks is pretty well set. I think we understand most of those rules, and what we're dealing with now is nuances. Why certain speeches make so much attention because we're trying to read tea leaves and figure out if they'll change anything systemic. I don't think there's anything major to change. I also think a new President, which is undoubtedly going to happen, has a slight variation one way or the other. I won't talk about which one I think does which, but one gets a little more uncertain and causes us to stand back a little bit and wait to see how things settle. The other one is a lot more of the same. And probably, whether we like it or not, it's something we can manage because it's the devil we know. Either way, I don't see any circumferences where bank regulation gets easier or lightens. I don't see a significant [indiscernible] any tougher or gets a lot stronger. I do think there's going to be a need for us to particularly respond to this current issue on culture and doing the right thing, and that makes sense to me, and that's a place that we'll welcome that oversight. And in fact, maybe to the earlier question, if have banks are proven, for the most part, to be doing really the right things the right way, that might be a very positive catalyst for the American people because they now know that we're stronger, they know we're safer. They don't know that we intend to be good with that. And if we can improve that over the course of the next couple of years, especially as the economy might get better at the same time, I think we're in a pretty good place. But for this bank, there's not a lot -- we don't spend a lot of energy trying to figure out what's going to happen next. We have relationships with regulators, both local and national, that we know and trust. And for us, it's part of doing business. And I think it's a normal course of running the bank. And I don't -- we don't fret about it, and we don't try to predict anything."

We're thinking of it as culture, and we always have from the very beginning. But I think that, Nancy, that will find its way probably through, more likely, the OCC and with the doctrine that they have as they oversee the banks, and then the Fed, for the Fed banks, will find their own way to approach it. I don't necessarily see it going into a CCAR stress test environment at this early stage. I see it being more of a pattern of practice for the camo [ph] ratings and the overall valuation of management and board oversight. So for me, I think it's just another nuances. And we keep getting different things. There's a spotlight on the stage, right? Everything's on the stage, but you can only see the stuff the spotlight's on. It's just going to move across, and they'll find something in the form of culture. I think we're all going to need to put better words around what we do.

If Dan were to change positions, I think that will have a meaningful impact on whether or not the position of the domestic banks in relation to the international banks remains the same or not. But I think there's a general sense across the world that everyone wants all the banks to be stronger. They're looking for a governing kind of a doctrine. Basel seems to be the one that allows everybody to think most banks across the world have generally the same minimum oversight and we're all getting there at different speeds. But I think it's probably still the best proxy and I don't think it changes greatly. And I think the verbiage of a speech or a general sentiment that things aren't going to adopted, things are going to be changed, it's just that. It's a small nuance.

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the",562,"Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. 
I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or a record $0.84 per diluted common share. 
I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. Industry-leading profitability was supported by solid loan and deposit growth and broad-based core revenue growth. As a reminder, our prior quarter results included notable items, including a Visa gain of $180 million in noninterest income and $150 million related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution in noninterest expense. 
There were no notable items to report in the third quarter, so for the remainder of this call, we will discuss the results on a core basis, excluding the notable second quarter items I just described, as this is how we believe the investment community looks at our results. 
Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. In the third quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.5% and our efficiency ratio was 54.5%. 
Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue of $5.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding notable items in the second quarter of 2016, this represents an increase of 2.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Our revenue growth is primarily driven by loan growth of 1.1% and strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including mortgage banking and payment services. 
The industry continues to face headwinds from the low rate environment and the flatter yield curve. This quarter, our net interest margin was also impacted by higher levels of cash balances due to the strong deposit inflows. However, despite a lower net interest margin, which declined by 4 basis points to 2.98% in line with expectations, we reported net interest income growth both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality was stable in the third quarter as expected. Both nonperforming assets and net charge-offs decreased modestly compared with the prior linked quarter. 
Before turning to Terry, I'll provide you with an outlook for the fourth quarter. Currently, we expect average loans to continue to grow in the range of 1% to 1.5% sequentially. While mortgage loan growth is expected to slow in line with industry-wide tapering of refinancing activity and due to seasonality, we look for a rebound in commercial loan growth in the fourth quarter and expect strength in consumer loans to continue. 
Given the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin will decline a couple of basis points. However, we expect net interest income will increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by growth in earning assets. 
We look for somewhat lower mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter in line with an expectation of lower refinancing activity. We expect expenses to grow 2.5% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally higher expenses, including tax credit amortization cost related to our community development business. 
And finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable and we expect the provision to increase in line with loan growth. 
Terry will now provide you with more details about our third quarter results."

I'll start on Slide 6, which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acqui",1427,"Thanks, Richard. I'll start on Slide 6, which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acquisitions completed in the second half of last year and student loans that were reclassified to held for investment in the third quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.4% compared to the prior year. 
In the third quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.0% and strong growth in average total residential mortgage loans of 8.6%. Consumer loan growth was broad based, led by credit card loans and other retail loans. Specifically, credit card loans grew 5.9%, excluding the retail card acquisition; and other retail loans grew 5.2%, excluding the student loans. Home equity loans grew 2.4% on a year-over-year basis, with growth primarily sourced from our branch network. 
On a linked-quarter basis, our average loan growth was 1.1%, in line with our expectations. Credit card loans grew 2.4%, residential mortgage loans grew 1.4%, home equity loans were up 0.5% and other retail loans were up 2.7%. Total average deposits increased by more than $28 billion or 10% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and were up 3.6% on a linked-quarter basis. 
On a year-over-year basis, the trend reflected strong growth of 11.9% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing deposits and our interest-bearing savings deposits. This strong core deposit growth more than offset the run-off in higher-cost time deposits.
Turning to Slide 7. Credit quality remained relatively stable in the third quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs increased by $23 million or 7.9% compared with the prior year, a decrease by $2 million compared with the second quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 46 basis points in the third quarter, unchanged from the prior year and down from the 48 basis points reported in the linked quarter. Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $97 million or 6.2%, mostly due to downgrades that occurred in the prior quarters related to energy credit. 
Linked quarter, nonperforming assets decreased by $8 million or less than 1%, primarily driven mainly from improvements in residential mortgages and other real estate. We continue to add to the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter in line with loan growth.
Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results comparable -- versus comparable periods. Third quarter net income increased by $13 million or 0.9% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenue growth was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 
As Richard mentioned, results in the prior quarter were impacted by notable items, including a $180 million Visa gain in noninterest income and $150 million in noninterest expenses related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution. Excluding notable items from the second quarter, net income increased by $2 million or 0.1%, reflecting total net revenue growth of 2.3%, offset by noninterest expense growth of 3.1%. Our efficiency ratio of 54.5% was in line with our guidance of 54% to 54.9%.
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by $122 million or 4.3% compared with the prior year. Strong average earning asset growth was offset somewhat by the impact of a 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 2.98%. The year-over-year decline in the net interest margin primarily reflected increased funding cost, higher average cash balances and lower rates on securities purchases, partially offset by higher rates on new loans.
Compared with the second quarter of 2016, taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $47 million or 1.6%. Growth in average total loans was offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The linked quarter decline in the margin primarily reflects the impact of higher cash balances, which represented 3 out of the 4 basis point decline, as well as lower average rates on securities purchased, offset somewhat by the benefit of higher LIBOR rates on loans during the quarter. 
Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income, which increased $119 million or 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to growth in mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenue and merchant processing revenue. 
Mortgage banking revenue increased $90 million or 40.2%, supported by core growth and strong industry-wide refinancing activity which drove originations and sales volume. Trust and investment management fees increased $33 million or 10%, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, growth in assets under management and improved equity markets. A $30 million or 11.2% increase in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolios.
Merchant processing revenue increased $12 million or 3%. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, merchant processing revenue increased 5.3% from the prior year. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income increased $73 million or 3.1%. The increase was principally due to stronger mortgage banking revenue and growth in payment services revenue. 
Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million or 31.9%, which slightly exceeded our previous guidance range of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenue was driven by higher production volumes, reflecting stronger refinancing activity. Mortgage banking revenue was also supported by a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rates, net of hedging activities. 
Corporate payment products revenue increased by $9 million or 5.0%. And as a reminder, corporate payment products revenue is seasonally stronger in the third quarter of each year. 
Merchant processing revenue increased $9 million or 2.2% due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, merchant processing revenue would have increased by 3.5% sequentially. 
Commercial product revenue decreased by $19 million or 8.0%, primarily due to higher capital markets volume in the second quarter, which in turn reflected market volatility during that quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense increased $156 million or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation expense grew versus the prior year primarily due to hiring decisions to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as the impact of merit increases and variable compensation tied to production. 
Professional services increased $12 million or 10.4%, also reflecting costs associated with compliance programs. Technology and communication expense increased $21 million or 9.5%, including the impact of capital investments and costs related to the acquired credit card portfolios. 
We continue our investment in our brand, which is reflected in slightly higher marketing cost from a year ago. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $89 million or 3.1%. Compensation expense increased $52 million or 4.1% due to the impact of 1 additional day in the quarter and increased staffing. The $23 million increase or 5.1% in other noninterest expense primarily reflected seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and the impact of the FDIC surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016.
Marketing and business development cost decreased $7 million or 6.4% due to the timing of various marketing programs. 
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the fourth quarter, however, at a slower pace than the 3.1% growth that we reported in the third quarter. Our current expectation is for linked-quarter expenses to grow by 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to seasonal expenses, including tax credit amortization cost, which we expect will increase, on a linked-quarter basis, approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we realize the benefit of these tax credits in our tax rate. 
The linked-quarter decline in preferred dividends was reflective of our fourth quarter 2015 preferred stock issuance which has a semi-annual dividend payment. As a result of that issuance, we will have higher quarterly dividends in quarters 2 and 4 of every year compared with quarters 1 and 3. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our capital position remained strong. And in the third quarter, we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward. 
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, as if fully implemented at September 30, was 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.85 at September 30, representing a 9.6% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.1% increase over the prior quarter. 
I will now turn it back to Richard."

Meaning that we're strong in quarter 2 and we expect it to recover in quarter 4. In part based on what we believe is the vagaries of quarter 3, where we had some of the Brexit activities move things up into quarter 2, and some -- perhaps, some of the uncertainty around election and other things moving things into quarter 4. But we see that returning nonetheless. You'll see that we had a particularly kind of across-the-board performance in most of the corporate space as the slowdown reflected things like higher pay downs, reduction in deal activity. And a healthy capital market condition allowed some borrowers to use the debt markets, although we also captured some of that in our capital markets activity. The rest of the lending, though, on the consumer side remained strong, and in fact, got stronger as the year progresses, and we continue to see that progressing into quarter 4 as well. But for a little more color on commercial and CRE, maybe we'll have Andy give you that."

And finally, M&A activity, which was a driver of strong growth in prior quarters, took a little bit of a pause here in the third quarter, either delayed or deferred to future quarters. So those factors all come into play, and that's why we think it was more of a pause, and then we'll come back a little bit as we [indiscernible]."

So the best way to keep it low is to do more revenue, which is our #1 goal. Expense-wise, I think we've telegraphed to you all that we appreciate that the higher cost of compliance and actually some of the capital expenditures we've been making in innovation technology continue to bear down on expenses. So I will continue to let expenses grow only to the level that revenue is allowing it under these circumstances that we set forth at the Investor Day, which is that we think there'll be a couple of rate increases, nominal rate increase, in 2017. With those rate increases, we made a commitment to you all, based on what we can see today, to provide slightly positive operating leverage in this environment. We also said, however, if those rates don't materialize, it will be much harder for us to do that. And to give you a sense of it, without the rates -- a couple of rate increases in the next year, that, for us, is hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses that we would need to reduce further, and I think, would probably cut into some of the muscle of the company's long-term objectives for growth and innovation. So we're not going to make that commitment at this stage, but we'll watch every nickel and dime. I also find a need to pause and remind you guys, to be in the 54s isn't, like, easy. We don't sit there and don't -- we watch every nickel and dime, and we have efficiency programs all over the company. One of the ways we've kept it low is we continue to get better every day, and we take innovation and we let technology make it more efficient for our company and for our people, and therefore, better service. But it's not easy. So we do have expense programs all the time, every day and forever. And some of the companies I know that announced efficiency programs, they put names around them, they give you dollar amounts. We don't do that because it's not our style. We also don't need to, but we do watch it every single day. So we will let revenue be the dictate in most cases to how well that efficiency ratio performs. Our goal is to have it to continue to be in the mid-50s. And for a while at that point, we'll measure against a future that, I think, won't be starved for investment. At the same token, the minute things get better and we have every opportunity to save a dollar, we will do that very thing and give you a better return."

But we really are -- $28 billion in deposits in 1 year. The kind of loan growth we've had consistently, 10% commercial loan growth year-over-year, and we're taking market share. And part of that, John, is also a proxy for next year because we believe that market share momentum not only continues, but it gets stronger. Now in any event, in our environment, just think of the foreign banks or think of other banks that go through any period of stress, we get the benefit of that. And as long as we continue to be -- if we're not their first customer, we're their first choice after that particular bank they're with, that's going to be a really good way for us to grow the business. So next year is, across the board, we expect to be strong in virtually every category. Look at our home equity. We continue to grow home equity. It's not with smoke and mirrors. We do it the old-fashioned way, with really good products and really good branch-based products coming out of the branch employees. And that's something that is really quite a difference for most of the companies that we compete with. So we can do it across the board and we like all the categories. So I think quarter 4, we'll continue to be in that range. I think next year, we'll be in that range and maybe slightly positive bias to that."

So that will take a while. It will definitely be well into next year that we'll get a line of sight and when we can look for an exit of that. In the meantime, it's taken us to a compliance cost level that I hope to recover when we got out of the mortgage consent order, which we're now long out of. But as it turns out, when the AML consent order came in, it virtually replaced those same costs. So with our growth expectation of reducing expenses, we're unable to do that at this point. But it's also finding its way now into kind of the run rate of the company. It's also made us a better bank. I don't like consent orders, and we only have the one and it's frustrating to me. But the fact of the matter is, it's a proxy for the expectations of 0 tolerance for errors. And we've aligned that proxy with everything we do, that it takes a little bit of time to adjust to it, it takes a little bit more money to get your first, second and third lines to do amazing levels of oversight and quality assurance. But once and when you've done that and you put it into your run rate, both in cost and in the way you do business, we'll be a better bank for it. So I'd like you to think that the AML project has extended itself through the whole company to improve our compliance capability, and therefore, send off any other future areas of shortcomings. And I would say next year, we'll be able to give you a better line of sight. But at this stage, we're deep in the middle of it doing our very best job to satisfy the regulators and to over-perform even to our own expectations. And at this point, I'd be hesitant to give you any kind of an actual timetable."

So it is coming down, based upon what we're seeing. You are right that when you end up looking at kind of the mix of where a lot of that refinancing is coming from, it's coming from high-quality product, again, primarily sourced a lot, probably a higher mix through our retail banking system. And so when you end up looking at the gain on sale and that margin, we are seeing, in the third quarter, a better margin than what we had experienced in the past.

Trust fees will be a bit of a function of what the market is doing. We had a strong quarter this quarter with both strong market activity as well as good core growth. I would expect that to continue. And then Terry made reference to money market reform. We did see quite a shift in our balances also. Our prime funds went down in the neighborhood of $6 billion, given money market reform, but our government funds went up almost $9 billion.

Your merit increases alone, say, at a 3%, 3%-plus, and our total expenses are half compensation. That's 1.5% right there. Number two, I want to make it clear. We're spending a lot more in our CapEx in innovation and technology. Gosh, 5 years ago, this company was at a $400 million, $500 million max annual investment in CapEx. This year, it's going to be between $800 million and $1 billion. Now the run rate's probably going to be more like $750 million to $800 million. That's good because it's appropriate because we're now more of a technology company than we used to be. And given our payments leadership, we should be. So making those kinds of investments, which of course, will yield value down the line. So that's another piece of it. What's left then is the compensation cost and the overall just running the company better and spending money on things that we didn't use to spend time -- money on, like quality issuance which isn't related to compliance, that's just doing the job better. And making sure our people are paid fairly, the compensation is entire, it's employee benefits and it's the way we treat the employees and making sure that the culture itself is strong across all the categories. And sometimes, you have to spend money to make sure that the brand is protected, that the employees feel safe, that the work environment is good. And we're investing in all of those things, too. So compliance is a piece of it, Erika. That 6% is a number I don't want to see over the long course of time. I'd like if it comes down -- in more -- in over the course of time, more like a 3% to 5% because I do think you have to spend money on investments. But that's a little bit high and compliance is probably the delta on that, that 1% to 2% delta that I want to bring down over time in these most current periods. So it's probably 1/3 of it, but it's also a part that won't sustain over the course of a long period of time because once we get it right, we'll get the benefits back."

Many years ago at the financial services roundtable, we made an effort to consider a nationwide brand reputation rebuilding after the downturn and discovered very quickly that American population wasn't ready for that. The bank industry, sadly, doesn't speak yet as one voice. And even today, still doesn't. But we did agree that each of us could do a much better job of satisfying our own customers and building our own brand, and eventually, the totality of that would be the way to rebuild. And I think, sadly, we're not where we'd like to be, but that's the way to do it. So each bank needs to stand very strongly on its own and do what's right by its customers. And if one bank falls away from that, then it's just one bank, it's not an industry. So we'll figure out how to tell that story better. At our company, it starts with -- it's where you start that matters the most, in terms of sales culture. And it's not even sales culture, it's culture. Just underline the word culture. Sales practice is a part of that. The way you incentivize people is part of that, the way you handle your customers. So answering your last question first, the guarantee is always stand behind what you promised, over perform. If you made a mistake, atone and apologize, fix what's wrong and then figure out how that applies to the next possible action that could otherwise become a problem later. I've long talked about bankers going from baggage handlers to pilots in the same company. And in fact, as of this morning, baggage handlers now have to be more like pilots if you follow the news out of the White House. But we believe that same thing is the case. I think as an industry, we have to be much better at handling every individual transaction uniquely and honestly and genuinely. And when we make mistakes, get it right, fix it and apply it to the next things. You know me, Mike, I've been with you as long as anybody on this call, and we've never even used the word cross-sell. We -- I don't even know what the cross-sell is at this bank. Honest to God, I've never, ever looked at that number. I would guess it's between 2 and 4 because nobody wants -- any part of their life cycle needs more than probably 2 or 4 services at one time from a bank. But we don't measure that. We don't set quotas. What we do instead do is ask our employees to make sure people know what we have so that as their life cycle change needs, and if we're the trusted partner, they'll ask us for it. So what that means is people buy our products, we don't sell them. And as long as they have something -- we have something they want and it's for services rendered and he's benefited, we'll be happy to provide that. I want to make sure it's clear though, for this industry, selling is not bad. It's not bad anywhere. But as long as you're selling to people's needs and you're making it clear what advantages you have to provide them at the time that they want them. So yes, it's tough on the industry, but it still always goes back to people love their banker, they like their bank because they made those choices. They don't so much like the industry. We're, sadly, years away from getting that right. But if every bank and every banker does a better job, despite what happens on occasion in one location or another, you've got a fighting chance to bring this thing back. And I'll close the soliloquy with the fact that this has all been accomplished under a very negative environment, economic environment. One of the reasons banks were popular 10 years ago, notwithstanding the downturn, was when times were good, banks were doing more positive things. People are healthier, the economy is moving more quickly, people want us, and need us and we can say yes more often. When the world gets a little bit better, we could say yes more often, we're more popular and we're more effective. When times are tough, actually we move on to defense, so we're there to protect people from things that could get them in harm's way. That's a less attractive position. People don't like to watch defensive games either because it's low scoring. At the end of the day, at the very end, it really doesn't matter. So I just think it's a noble occupation. I'm very proud of what we do. I'm very proud of the people that do it across this country. It's one of the most important things that we have in America, and it's what makes us unique. And by the way, it's the only place where you can get leverage. $1 of deposits at a good bank is worth $7 in loans, and that is an amazing way to grow the economy. So I'm going to still be in the camp that it'll get there one day, but one bank at a time, we can control it on that basis, and we're doing our best here to do that.

As Terry mentioned, we would expect the refinancing component to go down in the fourth quarter, as well as the overall volume.

And there will be some adjustments to the election. But as you know, most of these positions are not tied directly to the election or directly to the President's term. They have different term timetables, and think the FDIC and the OCC to name 2. So I think the philosophies and the general sense of what regulation looks like for banks is pretty well set. I think we understand most of those rules, and what we're dealing with now is nuances. Why certain speeches make so much attention because we're trying to read tea leaves and figure out if they'll change anything systemic. I don't think there's anything major to change. I also think a new President, which is undoubtedly going to happen, has a slight variation one way or the other. I won't talk about which one I think does which, but one gets a little more uncertain and causes us to stand back a little bit and wait to see how things settle. The other one is a lot more of the same. And probably, whether we like it or not, it's something we can manage because it's the devil we know. Either way, I don't see any circumstances where bank regulation gets easier or lightens. I don't see a significant place where it gets any tougher or gets a lot stronger. I do think there's going to be a need for us to particularly respond to this current issue on culture and doing the right thing, and that makes sense to me, and that's a place that we'll welcome that oversight. And in fact, maybe to the earlier question, if banks are proven, for the most part, to be doing really the right things the right way, that might be a very positive catalyst for the American people because they now know that we're stronger, they know we're safer. They don't know that we intend to be good with that. And if we can prove that over the course of the next couple of years, especially as the economy might get better at the same time, I think we're in a pretty good place. But for this bank, there's not a lot -- we don't spend a lot of energy trying to figure out what's going to happen next. We have relationships with regulators, both local and national, that we know and trust. And for us, it's part of doing business. And I think it's a normal course of running the bank. And I don't -- we don't fret about it, and we don't try to predict anything."

We're thinking of it as culture, and we always have from the very beginning. But I think that, Nancy, that will find its way probably through, more likely, the OCC and with the doctrine that they have as they oversee the banks, and then the Fed, for the Fed banks, will find their own way to approach it. I don't necessarily see it going into a CCAR stress test environment at this early stage. I see it being more of a pattern of practice for the CAMELS ratings and the overall valuation of management and board oversight. So for me, I think it's just another nuance. And we keep getting different things. There's a spotlight on the stage, right? Everything's on the stage, but you can only see the stuff the spotlight's on.

I think Dan Tarullo's been our best guiding voice on this particular topic, both on what Basel means to the United States banks and what it means in relationship to the global circumstances. As long as he's in position, I don't think it goes away, and I think he continues to argue the position that America's banks need to be at the highest, best, strongest position, first and foremost, but in an environment where all the banks have to account for the same general level of oversight. If Dan were to change positions, I think that will have a meaningful impact on whether or not the position of the domestic banks in relation to the international banks remains the same or not. But I think there's a general sense across the world that everyone wants all the banks to be stronger. They're looking for a governing kind of a doctrine. Basel seems to be the one that allows everybody to think most banks across the world have generally the same minimum oversight and we're all getting there at different speeds.

I think we're all going to stay within confines of a general Basel oversight created out of the institutions across the country that have a voice, and that America being probably the loudest."

I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or a record $0.84 per diluted common share. 
I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. Industry-leading profitability was supported by solid loan and deposit growth and broad-based core revenue growth. As a reminder, our prior quarter results included notable items, including a Visa gain of $180 million in noninterest income and $150 million related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution in noninterest expense. 
There were no notable items to report in the third quarter, so for the remainder of this call, we will discuss the results on a core basis, excluding the notable second quarter items I just described, as this is how we believe the investment community looks at our results. 
Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. In the third quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.5% and our efficiency ratio was 54.5%. 
Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue of $5.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding notable items in the second quarter of 2016, this represents an increase of 2.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Our revenue growth is primarily driven by loan growth of 1.1% and strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including mortgage banking and payment services. 
The industry continues to face headwinds from the low rate environment and the flatter yield curve. This quarter, our net interest margin was also impacted by higher levels of cash balances due to the strong deposit inflows. However, despite a lower net interest margin, which declined by 4 basis points to 2.98% in line with expectations, we reported net interest income growth both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality was stable in the third quarter as expected. Both nonperforming assets and net charge-offs decreased modestly compared with the prior linked quarter. 
Before turning to Terry, I'll provide you with an outlook for the fourth quarter. Currently, we expect average loans to continue to grow in the range of 1% to 1.5% sequentially. While mortgage loan growth is expected to slow in line with industry-wide tapering of refinancing activity and due to seasonality, we look for a rebound in commercial loan growth in the fourth quarter and expect strength in consumer loans to continue. 
Given the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin will decline a couple of basis points. However, we expect net interest income will increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by growth in earning assets. 
We look for somewhat lower mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter in line with an expectation of lower refinancing activity. We expect expenses to grow 2.5% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally higher expenses, including tax credit amortization cost related to our community development business. 
And finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable and we expect the provision to increase in line with loan growth. 
Terry will now provide you with more details about our third quarter results."

I'll start on Slide 6, which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acqui",1427,"Thanks, Richard. I'll start on Slide 6, which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acquisitions completed in the second half of last year and student loans that were reclassified to held for investment in the third quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.4% compared to the prior year. 
In the third quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.0% and strong growth in average total residential mortgage loans of 8.6%. Consumer loan growth was broad based, led by credit card loans and other retail loans. Specifically, credit card loans grew 5.9%, excluding the retail card acquisition; and other retail loans grew 5.2%, excluding the student loans. Home equity loans grew 2.4% on a year-over-year basis, with growth primarily sourced from our branch network. 
On a linked-quarter basis, our average loan growth was 1.1%, in line with our expectations. Credit card loans grew 2.4%, residential mortgage loans grew 1.4%, home equity loans were up 0.5% and other retail loans were up 2.7%. Total average deposits increased by more than $28 billion or 10% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and were up 3.6% on a linked-quarter basis. 
On a year-over-year basis, the trend reflected strong growth of 11.9% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing deposits and our interest-bearing savings deposits. This strong core deposit growth more than offset the run-off in higher-cost time deposits.
Turning to Slide 7. Credit quality remained relatively stable in the third quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs increased by $23 million or 7.9% compared with the prior year, a decrease by $2 million compared with the second quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 46 basis points in the third quarter, unchanged from the prior year and down from the 48 basis points reported in the linked quarter. Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $97 million or 6.2%, mostly due to downgrades that occurred in the prior quarters related to energy credit. 
Linked quarter, nonperforming assets decreased by $8 million or less than 1%, primarily driven mainly from improvements in residential mortgages and other real estate. We continue to add to the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter in line with loan growth.
Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results comparable -- versus comparable periods. Third quarter net income increased by $13 million or 0.9% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenue growth was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 
As Richard mentioned, results in the prior quarter were impacted by notable items, including a $180 million Visa gain in noninterest income and $150 million in noninterest expenses related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution. Excluding notable items from the second quarter, net income increased by $2 million or 0.1%, reflecting total net revenue growth of 2.3%, offset by noninterest expense growth of 3.1%. Our efficiency ratio of 54.5% was in line with our guidance of 54% to 54.9%.
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by $122 million or 4.3% compared with the prior year. Strong average earning asset growth was offset somewhat by the impact of a 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 2.98%. The year-over-year decline in the net interest margin primarily reflected increased funding cost, higher average cash balances and lower rates on securities purchases, partially offset by higher rates on new loans.
Compared with the second quarter of 2016, taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $47 million or 1.6%. Growth in average total loans was offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The linked quarter decline in the margin primarily reflects the impact of higher cash balances, which represented 3 out of the 4 basis point decline, as well as lower average rates on securities purchased, offset somewhat by the benefit of higher LIBOR rates on loans during the quarter. 
Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income, which increased $119 million or 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to growth in mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenue and merchant processing revenue. 
Mortgage banking revenue increased $90 million or 40.2%, supported by core growth and strong industry-wide refinancing activity which drove originations and sales volume. Trust and investment management fees increased $33 million or 10%, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, growth in assets under management and improved equity markets. A $30 million or 11.2% increase in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolios.
Merchant processing revenue increased $12 million or 3%. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, merchant processing revenue increased 5.3% from the prior year. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income increased $73 million or 3.1%. The increase was principally due to stronger mortgage banking revenue and growth in payment services revenue. 
Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million or 31.9%, which slightly exceeded our previous guidance range of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenue was driven by higher production volumes, reflecting stronger refinancing activity. Mortgage banking revenue was also supported by a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rates, net of hedging activities. 
Corporate payment products revenue increased by $9 million or 5.0%. And as a reminder, corporate payment products revenue is seasonally stronger in the third quarter of each year. 
Merchant processing revenue increased $9 million or 2.2% due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, merchant processing revenue would have increased by 3.5% sequentially. 
Commercial product revenue decreased by $19 million or 8.0%, primarily due to higher capital markets volume in the second quarter, which in turn reflected market volatility during that quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense increased $156 million or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation expense grew versus the prior year primarily due to hiring decisions to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as the impact of merit increases and variable compensation tied to production. 
Professional services increased $12 million or 10.4%, also reflecting costs associated with compliance programs. Technology and communication expense increased $21 million or 9.5%, including the impact of capital investments and costs related to the acquired credit card portfolios. 
We continue our investment in our brand, which is reflected in slightly higher marketing cost from a year ago. 
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $89 million or 3.1%. Compensation expense increased $52 million or 4.1% due to the impact of 1 additional day in the quarter and increased staffing. The $23 million increase or 5.1% in other noninterest expense primarily reflected seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and the impact of the FDIC surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016.
Marketing and business development cost decreased $7 million or 6.4% due to the timing of various marketing programs. 
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the fourth quarter, however, at a slower pace than the 3.1% growth that we reported in the third quarter. Our current expectation is for linked-quarter expenses to grow by 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to seasonal expenses, including tax credit amortization cost, which we expect will increase, on a linked-quarter basis, approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we realize the benefit of these tax credits in our tax rate. 
The linked-quarter decline in preferred dividends was reflective of our fourth quarter 2015 preferred stock issuance which has a semi-annual dividend payment. As a result of that issuance, we will have higher quarterly dividends in quarters 2 and 4 of every year compared with quarters 1 and 3. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our capital position remained strong. And in the third quarter, we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward. 
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, as if fully implemented at September 30, was 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.85 at September 30, representing a 9.6% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.1% increase over the prior quarter. 
I will now turn it back to Richard."

In part based on what we believe is the vagaries of quarter 3, where we had some of the Brexit activities move things up into quarter 2, and some -- perhaps, some of the uncertainty around election and other things moving things into quarter 4. But we see that returning nonetheless. You'll see that we had a particularly kind of across-the-board performance in most of the corporate space as the slowdown reflected things like higher pay downs, reduction in deal activity. And a healthy capital market condition allowed some borrowers to use the debt markets, although we also captured some of that in our capital markets activity. The rest of the lending, though, on the consumer side remained strong, and in fact, got stronger as the year progresses, and we continue to see that progressing into quarter 4 as well. But for a little more color on commercial and CRE, maybe we'll have Andy give you that."

And finally, M&A activity, which was a driver of strong growth in prior quarters, took a little bit of a pause here in the third quarter, either delayed or deferred to future quarters.

So the best way to keep it low is to do more revenue, which is our #1 goal. Expense-wise, I think we've telegraphed to you all that we appreciate that the higher cost of compliance and actually some of the capital expenditures we've been making in innovation technology continue to bear down on expenses. So I will continue to let expenses grow only to the level that revenue is allowing it under these circumstances that we set forth at the Investor Day, which is that we think there'll be a couple of rate increases, nominal rate increase, in 2017. With those rate increases, we made a commitment to you all, based on what we can see today, to provide slightly positive operating leverage in this environment. We also said, however, if those rates don't materialize, it will be much harder for us to do that. And to give you a sense of it, without the rates -- a couple of rate increases in the next year, that, for us, is hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses that we would need to reduce further, and I think, would probably cut into some of the muscle of the company's long-term objectives for growth and innovation. So we're not going to make that commitment at this stage, but we'll watch every nickel and dime. I also find a need to pause and remind you guys, to be in the 54s isn't, like, easy. We don't sit there and don't -- we watch every nickel and dime, and we have efficiency programs all over the company. One of the ways we've kept it low is we continue to get better every day, and we take innovation and we let technology make it more efficient for our company and for our people, and therefore, better service. But it's not easy. So we do have expense programs all the time, every day and forever. And some of the companies I know that announced efficiency programs, they put names around them, they give you dollar amounts. We don't do that because it's not our style. We also don't need to, but we do watch it every single day. So we will let revenue be the dictate in most cases to how well that efficiency ratio performs. Our goal is to have it to continue to be in the mid-50s. And for a while at that point, we'll measure against a future that, I think, won't be starved for investment. At the same token, the minute things get better and we have every opportunity to save a dollar, we will do that very thing and give you a better return."

We've been in that range of 1% to 1.5% for a long, long time, and every quarter is different. And yet, we found a way to pretty much stay there. And I think you can count on that to be a forerunner for the future. When revenue is -- when growth is strong in retail, it might be stressed in commercial, but this is a really well-bifurcated model we have here. And we like C&I, we like CRE, we like all consumer categories, but we see actually a little slightly stronger 2017 than '16 based on nothing more than the fact that oil gets better a little bit, slowly but surely, and because we're taking market share. And I haven't talked about market share in a number of quarters because I know it's a hollow kind of a category when all banks are doing well, nobody talks about it. But we really are -- $28 billion in deposits in 1 year. The kind of loan growth we've had consistently, 10% commercial loan growth year-over-year, and we're taking market share. And part of that, John, is also a proxy for next year because we believe that market share momentum not only continues, but it gets stronger. Now in any event, in our environment, just think of the foreign banks or think of other banks that go through any period of stress, we get the benefit of that. And as long as we continue to be -- if we're not their first customer, we're their first choice after that particular bank they're with, that's going to be a really good way for us to grow the business. So next year is, across the board, we expect to be strong in virtually every category. Look at our home equity. We continue to grow home equity. It's not with smoke and mirrors. We do it the old-fashioned way, with really good products and really good branch-based products coming out of the branch employees. And that's something that is really quite a difference for most of the companies that we compete with. So we can do it across the board and we like all the categories. So I think quarter 4, we'll continue to be in that range. I think next year, we'll be in that range and maybe slightly positive bias to that."

So that will take a while. It will definitely be well into next year that we'll get a line of sight and when we can look for an exit of that. In the meantime, it's taken us to a compliance cost level that I hope to recover when we got out of the mortgage consent order, which we're now long out of. But as it turns out, when the AML consent order came in, it virtually replaced those same costs. So with our growth expectation of reducing expenses, we're unable to do that at this point. But it's also finding its way now into kind of the run rate of the company. It's also made us a better bank. I don't like consent orders, and we only have the one and it's frustrating to me. But the fact of the matter is, it's a proxy for the expectations of 0 tolerance for errors. And we've aligned that proxy with everything we do, that it takes a little bit of time to adjust to it, it takes a little bit more money to get your first, second and third lines to do amazing levels of oversight and quality assurance. But once and when you've done that and you put it into your run rate, both in cost and in the way you do business, we'll be a better bank for it. So I'd like you to think that the AML project has extended itself through the whole company to improve our compliance capability, and therefore, send off any other future areas of shortcomings. And I would say next year, we'll be able to give you a better line of sight. But at this stage, we're deep in the middle of it doing our very best job to satisfy the regulators and to over-perform even to our own expectations. And at this point, I'd be hesitant to give you any kind of an actual timetable."

So it is coming down, based upon what we're seeing. You are right that when you end up looking at kind of the mix of where a lot of that refinancing is coming from, it's coming from high-quality product, again, primarily sourced a lot, probably a higher mix through our retail banking system. And so when you end up looking at the gain on sale and that margin, we are seeing, in the third quarter, a better margin than what we had experienced in the past.

Trust fees will be a bit of a function of what the market is doing. We had a strong quarter this quarter with both strong market activity as well as good core growth. I would expect that to continue. And then Terry made reference to money market reform. We did see quite a shift in our balances also. Our prime funds went down in the neighborhood of $6 billion, given money market reform, but our government funds went up almost $9 billion.

Your merit increases alone, say, at a 3%, 3%-plus, and our total expenses are half compensation. That's 1.5% right there. Number two, I want to make it clear. We're spending a lot more in our CapEx in innovation and technology. Gosh, 5 years ago, this company was at a $400 million, $500 million max annual investment in CapEx. This year, it's going to be between $800 million and $1 billion. Now the run rate's probably going to be more like $750 million to $800 million. That's good because it's appropriate because we're now more of a technology company than we used to be. And given our payments leadership, we should be. So making those kinds of investments, which of course, will yield value down the line. So that's another piece of it. What's left then is the compensation cost and the overall just running the company better and spending money on things that we didn't use to spend time -- money on, like quality issuance which isn't related to compliance, that's just doing the job better. And making sure our people are paid fairly, the compensation is entire, it's employee benefits and it's the way we treat the employees and making sure that the culture itself is strong across all the categories. And sometimes, you have to spend money to make sure that the brand is protected, that the employees feel safe, that the work environment is good. And we're investing in all of those things, too. So compliance is a piece of it, Erika. That 6% is a number I don't want to see over the long course of time. I'd like if it comes down -- in more -- in over the course of time, more like a 3% to 5% because I do think you have to spend money on investments. But that's a little bit high and compliance is probably the delta on that, that 1% to 2% delta that I want to bring down over time in these most current periods. So it's probably 1/3 of it, but it's also a part that won't sustain over the course of a long period of time because once we get it right, we'll get the benefits back."

I just want to start off by saying we've long looked at this whole topic as industry and individual bank. Many years ago at the financial services roundtable, we made an effort to consider a nationwide brand reputation rebuilding after the downturn and discovered very quickly that American population wasn't ready for that. The bank industry, sadly, doesn't speak yet as one voice. And even today, still doesn't. But we did agree that each of us could do a much better job of satisfying our own customers and building our own brand, and eventually, the totality of that would be the way to rebuild. And I think, sadly, we're not where we'd like to be, but that's the way to do it. So each bank needs to stand very strongly on its own and do what's right by its customers. And if one bank falls away from that, then it's just one bank, it's not an industry. So we'll figure out how to tell that story better. At our company, it starts with -- it's where you start that matters the most, in terms of sales culture. And it's not even sales culture, it's culture. Just underline the word culture. Sales practice is a part of that. The way you incentivize people is part of that, the way you handle your customers. So answering your last question first, the guarantee is always stand behind what you promised, over perform. If you made a mistake, atone and apologize, fix what's wrong and then figure out how that applies to the next possible action that could otherwise become a problem later. I've long talked about bankers going from baggage handlers to pilots in the same company. And in fact, as of this morning, baggage handlers now have to be more like pilots if you follow the news out of the White House. But we believe that same thing is the case. I think as an industry, we have to be much better at handling every individual transaction uniquely and honestly and genuinely. And when we make mistakes, get it right, fix it and apply it to the next things. You know me, Mike, I've been with you as long as anybody on this call, and we've never even used the word cross-sell. We -- I don't even know what the cross-sell is at this bank. Honest to God, I've never, ever looked at that number. I would guess it's between 2 and 4 because nobody wants -- any part of their life cycle needs more than probably 2 or 4 services at one time from a bank. But we don't measure that. We don't set quotas. What we do instead do is ask our employees to make sure people know what we have so that as their life cycle change needs, and if we're the trusted partner, they'll ask us for it. So what that means is people buy our products, we don't sell them. And as long as they have something -- we have something they want and it's for services rendered and he's benefited, we'll be happy to provide that. I want to make sure it's clear though, for this industry, selling is not bad. It's not bad anywhere. But as long as you're selling to people's needs and you're making it clear what advantages you have to provide them at the time that they want them. So yes, it's tough on the industry, but it still always goes back to people love their banker, they like their bank because they made those choices. They don't so much like the industry. We're, sadly, years away from getting that right. But if every bank and every banker does a better job, despite what happens on occasion in one location or another, you've got a fighting chance to bring this thing back. And I'll close the soliloquy with the fact that this has all been accomplished under a very negative environment, economic environment. One of the reasons banks were popular 10 years ago, notwithstanding the downturn, was when times were good, banks were doing more positive things. People are healthier, the economy is moving more quickly, people want us, and need us and we can say yes more often. When the world gets a little bit better, we could say yes more often, we're more popular and we're more effective. When times are tough, actually we move on to defense, so we're there to protect people from things that could get them in harm's way. That's a less attractive position. People don't like to watch defensive games either because it's low scoring. At the end of the day, at the very end, it really doesn't matter. So I just think it's a noble occupation. I'm very proud of what we do. I'm very proud of the people that do it across this country. It's one of the most important things that we have in America, and it's what makes us unique. And by the way, it's the only place where you can get leverage. $1 of deposits at a good bank is worth $7 in loans, and that is an amazing way to grow the economy. So I'm going to still be in the camp that it'll get there one day, but one bank at a time, we can control it on that basis, and we're doing our best here to do that.

So it is a high-quality portfolio, and I'm very comfortable with the credit. It -- one phenomenon that is occurring in the marketplace is residual values are coming down a bit, and that's a function of dealer incentives going up, which makes the comparison of new versus used favor the new.

And there will be some adjustments to the election. But as you know, most of these positions are not tied directly to the election or directly to the President's term. They have different term timetables, and think the FDIC and the OCC to name 2. So I think the philosophies and the general sense of what regulation looks like for banks is pretty well set. I think we understand most of those rules, and what we're dealing with now is nuances. Why certain speeches make so much attention because we're trying to read tea leaves and figure out if they'll change anything systemic. I don't think there's anything major to change. I also think a new President, which is undoubtedly going to happen, has a slight variation one way or the other. I won't talk about which one I think does which, but one gets a little more uncertain and causes us to stand back a little bit and wait to see how things settle. The other one is a lot more of the same. And probably, whether we like it or not, it's something we can manage because it's the devil we know. Either way, I don't see any circumstances where bank regulation gets easier or lightens. I don't see a significant place where it gets any tougher or gets a lot stronger. I do think there's going to be a need for us to particularly respond to this current issue on culture and doing the right thing, and that makes sense to me, and that's a place that we'll welcome that oversight. And in fact, maybe to the earlier question, if banks are proven, for the most part, to be doing really the right things the right way, that might be a very positive catalyst for the American people because they now know that we're stronger, they know we're safer. They don't know that we intend to be good with that. And if we can prove that over the course of the next couple of years, especially as the economy might get better at the same time, I think we're in a pretty good place. But for this bank, there's not a lot -- we don't spend a lot of energy trying to figure out what's going to happen next. We have relationships with regulators, both local and national, that we know and trust. And for us, it's part of doing business. And I think it's a normal course of running the bank. And I don't -- we don't fret about it, and we don't try to predict anything."

And that does require us to do a lot more record-keeping, a lot more auditing, a lot more quality assurance. I say it's actually a pretty good thing because most banks do it very, very well. And I think we're going to find out that, that's an area of strength that we can showcase. The banks haven't been able to really put those things around until now. Unfortunately, it takes a blemish to bring out the issues, but I think you'll be -- the American people will be quite pleased with what they find."

I think Dan Tarullo's been our best guiding voice on this particular topic, both on what Basel means to the United States banks and what it means in relationship to the global circumstances. As long as he's in position, I don't think it goes away, and I think he continues to argue the position that America's banks need to be at the highest, best, strongest position, first and foremost, but in an environment where all the banks have to account for the same general level of oversight. If Dan were to change positions, I think that will have a meaningful impact on whether or not the position of the domestic banks in relation to the international banks remains the same or not. But I think there's a general sense across the world that everyone wants all the banks to be stronger. They're looking for a governing kind of a doctrine. Basel seems to be the one that allows everybody to think most banks across the world have generally the same minimum oversight and we're all getting there at different speeds. But I think it's probably still the best proxy and I don't think it changes greatly. And I think the verbiage of a speech or a general sentiment that things aren't going to adopted, things are going to be changed, is just that. It's a small nuance. I think we're all going to stay within confines of a general Basel oversight created out of the institutions across the country that have a voice, and that America being probably the loudest."
