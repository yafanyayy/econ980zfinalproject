Today, we are pleased to discuss the fourth quarter and the full year 2015, a year in which we produced solid results, increased the relevance of the firm and built a strong position from which we intend to grow value in the years to come.
In thinking about 2015, it's pretty fun now to reflect on what we've achieved. It wasn't so much a fun during the year, of course, because it was an incredibly intense year for the people of XL Catlin. 2 high-performing organizations would be difficult in any environment. It is particularly difficult in the context of the current pricing environment. As we view it, we are confident that the hard work of our people last year will be well rewarded by the market. Because if we think about the totality of market conditions and some of the wild challenges that are going on, and when we think about the work we've already done, we feel incredibly well positioned for what comes next. We believe that there is a huge payoff for having gone first, from having carefully picked out our partner and for having done this work rapidly and efficiently.
So before getting into the quarter and full year in more detail, let me walk through some of what I think what I just said. When we set out to put these 2 firms together, our objective was to build the company for the future, because as risk keeps mutating, we want to have the best underwriting minds in the lines of business most able to anticipate and respond to that change. This implied we have to do a number of things. First, we have to keep the book together at least as far as we want them to do so. Second, we have to keep our workforce together and energize by the prospect of being part of this future oriented company while creating a common culture. And third, we have to get our systems together, so we could understand how the company is performing and begin applying our unique levels of insight to the needs of our clients. And finally, we had to do all of that while still delivering an acceptable result, because we said all along, this was both long-term strategy and a compelling financial rationale. 
So how did we do against those goals? #1, we kept the book of business together. In fact, we believe that we lost less than 0.5 point of premium, I'll say that, less than 0.5 point of premium that both companies had went away because of the transaction. Now I should add parenthetically that this will go up a little bit more as we know 1 program that will end during the second quarter of this year. But even when that is added, there will be about 1 point of premium loss. We are thrilled by that result, and less than 1/10th of what we had modeled going into the transaction.
#2, we kept the workforce together. Our voluntary attrition rates this year were only slightly elevated from historical levels. Of course, because of the integration, there are certain key areas where you would expect higher turnover, including in underwriting, but let me put it in perspective. Of our more than a 1,200 underwriters, there were literally just a couple of handfuls of voluntary departures that gave us pause. We are simply thrilled that the vast majority of our XL Catlin colleagues see the potential ahead.
So we kept the book together and we kept in the workforce together. 
And our third goal, we managed at the same time to bring all of our key systems together. We are able to stop duplicative investments and projects that no longer fit our needs, and we are already minding the bigger data set at which we can now work.
Now we said that we should do all of those things and not lose sight of the fundamentals of trying to build a better business with better margins over time. One aspect of this, of course, is savings. You will recall that when we first announced the transaction in January of last year, it was certified that we could reach at least $200 million in synergies. And then when we closed the deal in May, we came over the top of that and said that we could do at least $250 million in savings. We have been wrestling with whether we could commit to a higher number. We never want to commit to a number until we are absolutely certain we can achieve it. And so today, we can announce that we have identified not less than $300 million in synergy savings, and that we are committed to -- that we are absolutely committed to deliver and we are committed to searching for more. 
Now you can ask why? How did we find more money? Well, a number of reasons. #1, the transaction continues to reveal additional savings opportunities. And when we see one that we are confident in, we grab it. #2, in line with these challenging market conditions, we continued to increase internal expectations for savings. Our people are well aware that these are difficult times in the pricing environment and they have responded and have come forward with additional identified opportunities for savings. And our hand will not come off the expense lever because the simple truth is that these markets continued to worsen, and if we don't run the business as well we're counting and we do not ever run the business as though we're expecting entered in the cycle. And hope it may come, but we don't plan for it.
Additionally, throughout the year, as we have become increasingly confident that we had meet our integration and synergy targets, we resumed share repurchases, find back all the 12 million shares during 2015. I'm also pleased to note that S&P recently announced that we have revised the outlook of our main efforts are rating from stable to positive, which clearly reflected their review of our competitive position. Additionally, the ratings on several of the core Catlin subsidiaries were upgraded from A to A+ during the course of the year. And then as I said, we hope to continue to improve the business throughout the year as well. 
In terms of the results in the fourth quarter, we produced a total P&C combined ratio of 92.3% and gross written premiums 2.6% -- $2.6 billion. We think that's a solid result for the quarter, but there are some items in the quarter that do make it a bit messy. Pete will provide more detail in a moment, but I'd like to note a couple of important items. 
First, there was a fair amount of tax benefit in the quarter. For those who have been following along over the years, you can think of it as the book end to the fourth quarter of 2011. You may remember that in the 2011 quarter, we had all of our losses happened in the wrong places and round up with an unusually high tax rate. This quarter is the opposite, with our losses happening in place which could yield tax benefit. Second, it is noteworthy that we've had pretty solid PYD releases. And I'm sure that was particularly comforting to you given your questions that were raised during the third quarter. And it reflects the continued prudence of our approach. And third, I'd like to note that we beat our expense targets in real savings during the year and we're very pleased about that. And then to the all-important Insurance x CAT accident year loss ratio, while not ending up where we wanted, we should note that from the market commentary that there have been a number of large non-CAT losses, you've heard that from around the market. We've experienced some of those as well. But our x CAT accident year loss ratio insurance did improve both year-over-year and improved sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter. If we can make this improvement in the conditions of the last year with all that was going on, we can and believe we will do it in the year ahead.
I should note that our underwriters actually began optimizing our books about halfway through this past year. They true up growth the plans that both legacies had, realizing that market conditions had worsened more than what predicted back at the time they were planned. And they are already hard at work walking away from either wild underpriced businesses or accounts that simply don't meet our performance standards. That's why we didn't grow much in this past year. And we are certainly telling our underwriters that last year -- that this year, growth is not the objective. 
The books are assembled, let's begin to optimize them. The underwriters are keeping their wits about them, especially through this complicated market. 
So all in all, we produced what I would call an acceptable quarter and a solid full year effort, particularly when we consider the potential for distractions throughout the year that simply didn't emerge. This is no market in which to be chasing premium. But I remain confident that given our geographic positions in our broadened product lines, we will find isolated spots where there is profitable opportunity for growth.
Last, and I've emphasized this before, we still firmly believe that the strategy in and of itself is great, but it doesn't mean anything until it is married to the right people and the right culture. We have made leaps and bounds of progress in getting our teams together. They are thinking about XL Catlin and not just how it used to be. And by knowing that they're a part of one of the most powerful forces in the Insurance sector, they really believe they are doing special work, and I agree.
As I've said, this is truer every day. Our leadership team functions as it's working together for years. We make decisions together quickly and efficiency. We even have a sense of humor about it. And we work damn hard because we believe that we have a common goal that is worthwhile.
Now I know that if progress doesn't it show up in the numbers, it ain't real. So let me be clear. We did a lot in 2015, but this wasn't the year the financial progress would show. All you'll be able to see are the indicators. I like the indicators. Our loss ratios despite this price environment continued to come down, and we believe that will continue. Our expense ratio is coming down. We kept the book together. We kept this in incredible group of college together and we've energized them around the common future. That's the company we were trying to build. We're pretty happy about where we are.
I'll admit we're a bit glad that last year's more of a memory now. We are really excited to take on this difficult year because it is now about the progress we can and will make together.

Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $195 million or $0.65 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $294 million in 2014 or $1.12 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $706 million or 2.42",1398,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. 
Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $195 million or $0.65 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $294 million in 2014 or $1.12 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $706 million or 2.42%. 
As we indicated during our previous calls, we have excluded direct transaction costs from operating income, but included integration costs. 
During the fourth quarter, we incurred $73 million in deal-related integration costs and $2 million in deal-related transaction costs. The previously disclosed $35 million loss associated with the 100% reinsurance of our U.S. term life business has also been excluded from operating income.
Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $229 million or $0.76 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $139 million or $0.53 per share for the same quarter in 2014 and $1.2 billion or $4.15 per share for the full year compared to $188.3 million or $0.69 per share in the prior year.
As we have previously discussed, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 life Reinsurance sale transaction. We continued to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. And as always, it has no impact on comprehensive income or operating results.
Our Property and Casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 92.3% or 7.8 points higher than the same quarter last year, and the full year's 92% was 3.8 points higher than the prior year. Our combined ratio, excluding prior-year development for the quarter, was 97.4%, 6 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2014, while the full year is 95.8% was higher by 3.2 points.
Our natural catastrophe losses totaled $108 million or 4.6 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $32 million or 2.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2014. Our natural catastrophe losses for the full year of 2015 were $213 million or 2.6 loss ratio points. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes for 2014 totaled $113 million or 2.1 loss ratio points.
Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As we indicated on our previous earnings call, our fourth quarter ground-up reserve review included the alignment of reserving assumptions across the 2 legacy portfolios. The result of this exercise led to modest strengthening of the legacy Catlin portfolio, which is included in our overall favorable development of $121 million or 5.1 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable $97 million or 6.9 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects favorable development of $28 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $93 million in the Reinsurance segment. For the full year, development was a net favorable $307 million or 3.7 loss ratio points compared to $255 million or 4.5 loss ratio points in the prior year.
As was indicated previously, our normal purchase GAAP accounting adjustments will amortize through income over the next number of quarters. Overall, the impact in the quarter is relatively small. However, certain line items can be distorted each quarter. And to the extent these are meaningful, they will be noted by Paul and Greg.
Operating expenses have increased in the quarter as the result of the combination with Catlin. Overall, however, the run-rate operating expense level of the company continues to decline towards the now higher level of expected transaction synergies and excluding integration costs are significantly lower than the combined historic levels of the legacy companies.
We continued to believe that these will be achieved in full by the end of 2017. And we continued to view the overall relationship between the onetime cost to achieve integration and the ongoing synergies to be approximately 1.25 to 1.
You can see it from our fourth quarter expense levels that we have already made material progress achieving these synergies. In fact, compared to the combined starting point we had guided you to of $2.3 million back in May, based on this fourth quarter expenses, we have already achieved over $300 million of run rate savings. However, that would be somewhat misleading as we have had some benefit from foreign exchange rate reducing these costs. We remain committed to driving real expense leverage from this integration and will only report to you those savings when we are sure they are real and not a function of market movements.
Looking towards 2016, we expect that additional synergies will exceed normal cost growth, driven by compensation inflation and additional costs from added businesses. And as a result, we expect to improve our overall operational leverage.
The large tax benefit in the quarter and overall tax rate for the year was heavily impacted by both the absence of catastrophes in lower tax rate jurisdictions and higher proportion of large risk losses in higher tax locations. For the full year, this, combined with the benefit we realized following our ability to utilize legacy Catlin U.S. net operating losses, resulted in an annual operating tax rate of a negative 2.8%.
Turning to the investment portfolio. 
Net investment income, excluding the Life Funds Withheld Assets, were $172 million, in line with the same quarter last year, notwithstanding the addition of the Catlin investments. Changes in foreign exchange rates resulted in approximately $5 million reduction compared to the prior year. The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of December was 2.3%. 
During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.3%. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.7 billion of assets, with book yields of 2.3% rolling off over the next 12 months.
In the current volatile market conditions, we will continue to manage the portfolio for long-term benefit of our shareholders. We had already taken steps in the quarter to reduce our exposure to asset-backed securities and high-yield bonds. And we will continue to take such action as we deem necessary to protect the value of the portfolio, even if this is an adverse impact on the reported net investment income in future periods.
Total affiliate income was $15 million for the quarter compared to $34 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to our operating affiliates where investment manager affiliates, as expected, experienced losses across the board driven by tough third quarter market conditions. 
Investment fund affiliates were $10 million lower than the prior quarter, driven by our hedge fund affiliates where many of our event-driven funds performed poorly on an absolute basis due to the impact of continuing market volatility.
Despite these disciplining absolute returns, our hedge fund portfolio continued to outperform its benchmark, and we continued to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves the risk-adjusted returns we earn on the overall portfolio.
Net realized gains, excluding derivatives, were $11 million for the quarter, down $2 million from the prior year. Our unrealized gain position declined by $203 million during the quarter, driven primarily by increasing rates, offset by tightening spreads, and an increase in unrealized gains in our equity portfolio of $59 million. Unrealized net gains were $544 million at the end of the quarter, including other investments.
On a performance basis, the total return on investments was 0.2% for the quarter, excluding FX. And on a year-to-date basis, the total return on investments was 1.38%.
The duration of the total portfolio was 3.3 years at the end of the quarter, which was broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. 
And with respect to capital management, we continued to execute share buybacks during the fourth quarter where we purchased 4.7 million shares, leaving $703 million available for purchase share under our buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and continued purchasing in line with the philosophy we discussed with you in May. As we continue with our share buyback program, we will remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.
As previously indicated, we have called and canceled all formal Catlin subordinated notes assumed in conjunction with the transaction. These notes will called at par value of $90 million. 
Now I'll turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."
406440,321710066,926354,"XL Group plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Pete. This morning, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an updates on our integration progress and finish with the remarks on current market conditions.First, the results. The fourth quarter marked our 12th consecutive quarter of p",837,"Thanks, Pete. This morning, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an updates on our integration progress and finish with the remarks on current market conditions.
First, the results. 
The fourth quarter marked our 12th consecutive quarter of profitability, with the segment producing a calendar quarter combined ratio of 98.2% compared to 93.8% in the same quarter last year, the full year combined ratio of 96.9% versus 94.4% in 2014. More than half of the Q4 deterioration is due to higher CAT experience of $68 million compared to $18 billion[ph] in Q4 2014, and with the majority of the balance due to lower prior-year reserve releases of $28 million compared to releases of $35 million in the same quarter last year.
The remaining variance is a result of higher acquisition expense, offset by an improvement on our operating expense ratio and a lower accident year X CAT loss ratio.
On an accident quarter X CAT basis, the combined ratio was 95.7% compared to 95.4% in Q4 2014. For the full year, it was 95.4%, similar to the 95.2% we reported in 2014, again, demonstrating that we can absorb exceptional losses, such as without jeopardizing profitability.
For Q4, we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.9%, which was 4.8 points higher than Q4 2014. As mentioned last quarter, this is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business where the acquisition costs are higher than the legacy XL business, which was largely retail. This is offset by a lower Q4 operating expense ratio of 19.5%, which was 3.3 points lower than Q4 2014 and by a lower net accident year X CAT loss ratio of 62.3%, which was 1.2 points lower than Q4 2014.
Insurance gross premiums written in Q4 increased by 59% or $859 million year-over-year and by $2.4 billion or 41% for the full year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all 4 of our underwriting divisions.
When we look at both legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was still positive in Q4 and up nearly 3% year-to-date, reflecting our success in maintaining the 2 legacy portfolios. This is something we continued to be very pleased with, particularly given current market conditions.
Shifting to progress and integration, let me share a few highlights from the Insurance segment perspective. 
Firstly, the market response to XL Catlin continues to be very favorable. As mentioned in last year's -- last quarter's Q&A, we have established a robust process to track lost business emanating from the deal. And throughout 2015, this metric has constantly been tracking at less than 1%. Business protections continues to track well with historical trends. And most importantly, our new business opportunities also continued to be strong despite market conditions.
Second, with our new leadership teams and underwriting organizations fully in place, we have exceeded our 2015 synergy targets for the segment, as we've been able to streamline our underwriting capabilities across divisions and regions.
And third, with regard to our longer-term end state plans, we continue our efforts to consolidate pricing methodologies, operating models and legal entity structures, and that our progress on plan, if not slightly ahead of plan. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are also developing plans to pull our synergy lever ever harder in 2016 through further efficiencies. We will continue to share progress in future quarters.
Turning to market conditions. 
The headwinds, which strengthened throughout the year, have continued. Pricing was negative across most lines of business, as the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter and year-to-date. The most significant decreases were once again in our short-tail lines. We saw broadly flat rate in our long-tail lines. And we continued to see some rate increases, most notably in cyber and environmental North America.
Overall, our Casualty lines were down just 1% and Professional businesses were flat. Our specialty business was down 3%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines, as evidenced by the December airline renewals. And our energy, property and construction businesses were once again most severely impacted, led by reductions in the energy book of approximately 10% and reductions in our international and North American property books of 5%.
Despite these market headwinds, we continue to focus on margin as we transition from retaining the business to tuning the business. Clearly, expense management, as Mike mentioned earlier, we remain a very important lever in 2016, as well improving our mix of business, leveraging analytics into underwriting actions and increasing our Reinsurance efficiency.
By pulling all of these levers, we firmly believe that there are opportunities for further underwriting improvements. And given our greater market presence, we are confident in our ability to expand margins despite the difficult market conditions.
In summary, we delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, continued to grow the book and made significant progress on our integration. And we fully expect this to continue into 2016.
And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."
406440,321710066,926354,"XL Group plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Paul. Today, we'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the January 1 renewals. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 7",713,"Thanks, Paul. 
Today, we'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the January 1 renewals. 
Beginning with the results. 
The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 79.1% and underwriting profit of $154 million compared with 61.2% and $156 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of last year. The result for the quarter continued to benefit from favorable prior-year development, modest catastrophe losses, offset by a higher accident year X CAT loss ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $93 million compared to $62 million a year ago, lowering the combined ratio by 12.6 and 15.4 points, respectively. In the current quarter, all 5 regions experienced releases, driven primarily by the Property Catastrophe and Casualty Treaty lines of business.
As Pete noted, we continued the process of harmonizing and reserving methodology across the segment. And the reserving process continues to recognize bad news quickly and allows potential good news to become credibles.
Catastrophe losses totaled $39 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The major contributors to the CAT activity during the quarter were the U.K. December storms, Indian floods and Australian Hill and bushfire events. While our combined catastrophe portfolio is better diversified, this quarter's CAT activity is indicative of a book that is likely to incur a loss at lower industry loss levels relative to the XL portfolio.
Cigna produced an excellent quarter x CAT loss ratio of 50.2%, which compares to the 39.9% produced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was driven primarily by a Property Facultative large loss, lost activity on our worldwide agricultural portfolio and the impact of recent rate decreases.
The expense ratio increased 2.9 points to 35.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 39 point -- 32.9% for the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily driven by a purchase accounting adjustment of $18 million or 2.4 points. 
Turning to top line. 
Gross written premiums for the quarter was $206 million, up from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was driven primarily but the Catlin acquisition, and was partially offset by the timing of a large quarter share renewal, which moved through January 1 inception.
Given the light activity in the fourth quarter, the full year of the combined XL Catlin is more indicative of how our portfolio changed, and the segments gross written premium fell 8% year-over-year. This reduction was driven by foreign exchange, lower multi-year premium and adjustments to estimated premium. After adjusting for these 3 factors, our top line was essentially flat year-over-year.  Less than 0.5% or $10 million, hardly 8% drop result from client concerns about the XL Catlin combination. And even in these difficult market conditions, we were able to write $372 million of new business in 2015.
Turning to the January 1 renewals. 
The market generally renewed in orderly fashion, and we continued to experience rates across most lines and regions, resulting in a low single-digit decrease. We saw increased demand from a number of clients that have increased retentions over past renewals. And broadly speaking, terms across the book remained as expiring.
Explain on rates, our global property catastrophe portfolio fell 6%, with the U.S. market down roughly 5% and the rest of the world down 7% to 8%. Contrary to recent press coverage, while some clients achieved double-digit decreases, we did not see that as a broad trend across the international catastrophe  market. on catastrophe property portfolio fell 4%, between declining rates and some clients achieving fee and commission increases.
On a positive note, our Casualty Treaty portfolio across the world renewed essentially flat.
Overall, this renewal reinforced our view that rate decreases are decelerating across the Reinsurance marketplace. 
In summary, the fourth quarter and full year results were solid for the Reinsurance segment. Despite the challenging market conditions and the rapid integration with Catlin, our underwriting teams did an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline.
As we head into 2016, we are well-positioned for continued success as our momentum in the market remains strong and we have broad support from our clients and brokers.
I'll now turn it back to David."

It's risk that both XL and Caitlin wrote pre the combination. We renewed it. We'd looked at the loss. We write the risk again. It was just an abnormally large loss for us. Our Facultative portfolio -- both facultative portfolios have run very well over the years, so that 1 pieces out of the norm. The second one is the crop. This is partly a testament to the what the talk about earlier about reflecting bad news fast. We had in our U.S. global business a particular crop that underperformed relative to some conditions that are needed to be successful, and so we took all of that bad news of roughly about $8 million in this quarter. The remainder of the growing season well. In fact, the loss, coverage is the remaining risk that is going very well so far and in California, which is our major exposure. So that's the big -- the remainder of it was abnormal activity, somewhat weather-related around the world. So the 6 points there that I would say are well outside the norm. The remainder of it is a lot of little moving things. A part of it is what we talked about in terms of harmonizing reserves. That's just the reflection that in the fourth quarter, in the current accident year, we will have made some higher picks entire impacts to the full year and in the fourth quarter. And some of it it's a little bit of it's mixed. But again, it's also little bit due to rate. It's hard -- it's impossible to expect flat accident years year-over-year, to the rate environment. But I would put that kind of in the 1 or 2 point range out of that hole, so by and large, a lot of it unusual activity, a little bit of it as we reflect the current market conditions."

And just to be clear, in the fourth quarter and for the year, we recorded about $33 million of adverse prior-year development on those reserves. And what we mean when we said the harmonization, well, we harmonized assumptions at the reserve profile level, so a very detailed. And that included assumptions such as initial expected loss ratios, reporting and payment patterns, group up loss estimates for natural perils, as well as major events. I'd say while its harmonization is largely complete, the ongoing alignment to our process of reacting more slowly to potential good news will take a little bit time to fully implement. And as Greg just noted, I also want to mention that we did harmonize the accident year picks as well in 2015, which did cause a true up in the fourth quarter."

Well, we're pulling it hard, and in fact, harder now than we were at the beginning because of market conditions. We do not mean that we think expense and rate pressure are simply offsetting and we'll leave it at that. Our belief is that this book of business has plenty of room to improve, and that's the underwriters task for this year. We did -- I think Pete said something that I really want to underscore. In the fourth quarter, you've seen not only the harmonization of the reserves come through, but you've seen the harmonization of the loss ratio picks come through. So I do not believe that the fourth quarter x, for example, in insurance, I do not believe that the fourth quarter X CAT accident year loss ratio, that you're looking at this quarter of 62.3, do not believe that, that's the run rate for next year, because we've had things that were harmonized during the year and the catch up was largely in the fourth quarter, so that would have elevated that much so beyond what we actually believe the book is running at. And that doesn't account for the underwriting actions that began, as I mentioned in my remarks, midway through last year, and they will start paying off during the course of this year. So we don't accept that we -- we probably could offset rate with expense ratio, but we don't believe that's the game. The game is a stronger and more profitable book of business, and we believe we are in the process of creating exactly that."

And it's across the place. I mean, when you get past the easy and obvious, it starts to be more of a grind around processes that yield greater efficiency. So you shift from the real estate stop, we are shutting down investment or kind of obvious duplicated efforts, and now you're into making the whole place work in a more efficient way from beginning to end of our dealings with clients, from seeking them to serving them. And that's the work that now comes to the floor. So by definition, that has more meaning in terms of headcount than other kinds of expenses. And by the way, as Pete mentioned when he walked through the numbers, we can already see that as against what we forecast our expense levels to be, although a little bit helped by FX, I don't want to overstate that, it's just a little bit, we're already at a run rate of $300 million already today. So we're -- we wouldn't use a number like that if we weren't highly confident, but at this it like you're going to see some big new thing and the people that are affected are largely already informed. Now that's not -- it's not to say that everybody who may be affected has yet been informed because there is continuing work to make it better and better across each process. But my experience with this, which goes back to days is, that once you get this in motion and you get the right mindset in motion, more and more reveals itself because people strain themselves to imagine it to be better and they can do that. So I'm sorry, I can't point to this or that process. I do think the one area that I'm highly focused on in the beginning of this year is some duplication that crept into Insurance or Insurance organization management levels that we are focused on.

First of all, I just want to note something that I note with some pride. In this quarter, when you take out the cost of synergies and just look at the rate of operating expenses, we overachieved, on absolute dollars, delivered to shareholders in this year alone. And in fact, this is the first quarter in 2 years that our operating expense ratio was below 20, I mean, our insurance operations, so I was delighted to see that. That is -- and all I would say, tell you is we view that as a preview of events to come and not the resting point. #2, there is an elevation in acquisition expense for the reasons Paul mentioned, that there's a different mix and there is more program business in the Catlin book. But we also believe there are some levers to drive that down as well, so we don't accept that's at a long-run level. Between those 2, taken together, yes, you will see absolute improvement. There is expected to be between those 2 absolute improvement in the expenses of the company taken together across acquisition expense. That's the first thing. Second thing, you did slip in a comment of expected accident year loss ratio deterioration because of rate. We don't accept that. We believe this, but even in this environment, can continue to produce through mix change and the underwriting already going on, improvement over the course of next year in the accident year loss ratio.

So let me spend a minute, if I could, and try and help people think through that. The first thing I'd say is the $39 million that we disclosed, at XL, almost all the tax is on operating almost all the time because the nonoperating things, the realized gains and losses, sales and that kind of stuff typically have very little tax impact on those. And so the operating tax impacts would have been a $41 million gain rather than the $39 million that we disclosed in total. To put that in context, okay, so the question of, okay, so you recorded an operating income of $41 million gain, no, how do I think about that? And if you look at what the operating income was before tax, U.S. about that number was $153 million, I had guided everyone just now to 11%, 12% tax rate. If you used 12%, you would've had an expected tax in the quarter of about $18 million, just working the math, so we had as I said, a $41 million benefit. So a delta or a difference of $59 million, right. And as I say -- as was in my comments, you really got to think about 2 things: the actionable tax rate for the year given the distribution of income around the world, and the second one, I referred to the our ability to use the legacy Catlin net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. So in the third quarter, right, we had adjusted our expected tax rate down to 10% was what I disclosed. So now in the third quarter, I need to address that again for what the annual expected tax rate is. It turned out to be at about 3.5%. So that difference times the 9 months income is about $35 million. So that's the first benefit. The second one is the fourth quarter itself, 3.5% versus 12%, that's about a $13 million benefit. And the last one is this quarter's use of the legacy Catlin NOLs, that was about an $11 million or $12 million benefit, and that gets you to the $59 million. So I'm just trying to be transparent here on why the numbers are so different from what you might have expected. So I hope that answers your question, Mike."

So I think that always, one of those I feel is something that we've -- have already adjusted to in the most part, and that's the complexity of the Life transaction. And what we should remember, it does introduce complexity, but it's a pretty simple c",864,"Yes. So I think that always, one of those I feel is something that we've -- have already adjusted to in the most part, and that's the complexity of the Life transaction. And what we should remember, it does introduce complexity, but it's a pretty simple complexity. It goes in, it backs out, and you can fairly easily, and we transparently show you how to do that every quarter. That isn't going to go away. So to me, that's just an adaptation. You just recognize that, that thing has nothing to do with understanding the earnings performance or potential of the company. And you get used to it. My observation would be, Paul, that it becomes more annoying when the underlying results aren't clear and it becomes less annoying with the underlying results are strong. So I'm guessing we all get simply used to that and what we need to be reminded of perhaps from time to time is that the benefit of that transaction was to take enormous volatility and risk off of our balance sheet. When we -- before we had done that for some of those in certainly you would remember this, ball, we used to trade like something like a European bond fund. Reacting our stock price reacting every time Europe got edgy. No, Europe is edgy again right now and I've just assume trade for what we produce in terms of Insurance operating earnings than exposures quit the portfolio that creates a lot of noise every time Europe has a hiccup. So I think it's easier to remember to back in our back out as we completely do let me at the recorder than to have that mice are driving the share price. So that one, it will be around for a while, I don't have any plans to cure it. And it's just something I believe we'll all get used to. And I think we do normally, but when gets noisy, I think we get irritated. The second thing I would point out is most of the noise that has gone on in the third quarter and the fourth quarter has been transaction related. And I think we're all going to have to work together quickly to get to a new kind of a new normal understanding of what the component parts are and how to analyze profitability. But the core to it all is, do we believe that this firm is better positioned to generate improved earnings? And my answer to that is yes, and has been ever since that transaction. #1, because we have -- and we believe we can optimize this book of business to more profitable levels. We have more levers to pull than we ever have. We have a more diversified book of business by both geography and lines of business and that's simply gives us more to play with in order to create a better result. And second, are able to optimize the expenses. And this was a drag on both companies prior performance. It was certainly an issue of concern for analysts over time. And we are demonstrating with real effort and I think real passion that we can create a very efficient expense platform for this business going forward. And then third, we believe that it is about underwriters who have the real ability to make a difference for clients and their changing risk environment. And there, the level of creativity, the continued innovation that we are able to bring into the marketplace will be a source, we believe, of long-term competitive advantage. So these are difficult times in the sectors we are and, both specialty, particularly in London, and Reinsurance have been under some pressure. But that's never a permanent condition. We don't believe it is at all and we like our competitive position in both businesses. Being the leader at Lloyd's gives us a greater ability to of the market than anybody else has, and being one of the largest writers in reinsurance gives us more -- both more intellect, and more capital and more position with which to influence the direction of that market and to take a leading role in the changes coming about in that market. So when I think about the cause of most of the noise, that frustrates, it is to do with the recency of the transaction, that results itself over time in I don't mean over forever, I mean over pretty soon. And I think the earnings power of the firm due to the expense actions and the speed with which they've been taken and the positioning of the company in the markets we play in, I think comes out over the course of next year in large part and certainly with great clarity in '17. So I -- we are -- I get what you're seeing. We viewed very differently. We review the core has always been straightforward. Whereas the accident year ask a flourish of going are we in line with the cats do appear and can we create a more profitable expense platform from which to grow. I think the answer to all of those is yes. Pete?"

And I know that these are well understood, but -- and I know I probably said that a bit more aggressively that I'd like. I have seen some analyses out there that I get why it resonates with people, but I don't agree with it. Because people are buying into this notion that because of specialty and reinsurance are in tough places, notably, tough, that somehow, no one could ever manage to improve a book of business when it's in this condition. Well, just think about the task that faced an underwriter last year and the task that faced that same underwriter this year. Last year, so we had let's say you come -- you got 2 people, 1 from each company who are running these books of business. We pick the leader between the 2. By definition, either if it's a Catlin person spec, by definition, 60% of the book they're are looking at did not seen before and if it's an XL leader, by definition, 40% of what they're looking at. They haven't seen before. I mean, crudely put. And so now, you give them the task, keep that book together if you can, remember that we're running to profit. If someone tries to jam you're doing this crazy market, let it go. And so on. So you have this huge task of learning the book, assembling the book, it is a confusing difficult year. But never did we tell them ""hey, keep the book at the enterprise."" So it meant a profitable way through it. This year, the book's assembled. they've got 1 job to, do. Optimize this book. We are now willing to accept that if you have a prejudice against the segment of that book and you're the leader of that book, act on it. Last year, we told you want that you test it out first before you decide that the other guy was done. I mean, this is a clearer year for every person in our company around the globe, and at the same time, we are telling, and never give up the hunt for profitable opportunity or the opportunity to innovate, to do something different for the client, now that we have more information and now that we have capability. So we're excited about what that unleashes into the market and maybe market conditions, but we're going to be whistling while you work. This is fun stuff."

The back half of this year engine, that's more than 1 point on the loss ratio, just in many companies threw that into market, we didn't. And we were still able to deliver profitability ? What is that? That's the largest man-made loss in Asia's history and one of the largest marine losses in history. And we were able to absorb that and still deliver profit, and have these other smaller losses come through that Paul has described as well and true up the first half of the year, and, and, and still deliver a profit. So this book is more resilient and less subject to the kind of wild spiking as you would've seen with those kinds of events going back to, maybe now 3 years ago, you would seen wild volatility in our quarterly result, you saw a deterioration, but you didn't see wild spikes that took us out of profitability. That is the book performing better. Now is it optimized? Are we really where we'd like to be? No, and there is work we can do, both on limits management, on understanding the flow of volatility of the book, on what we're doing in Reinsurance, all of which are being done by fresh eyes to the whole books. So can it get even better from here? Yes. But what I say this is a quarter that shows wild volatility, I'd actually say, it's a quarter that shows real absorption. And I was kind of pleased with that result. But I'll turn to my colleagues in case they want to add something."

Today, we're pleased to discuss the fourth quarter and the full year 2015, a year in which we produced solid results, increased the relevance of the firm and built a strong position from which we intend to grow value in the years to come.
Thinking about 2015, it's pretty fun now to reflect on what we have achieved. It wasn't so much fun during the year, of course, because it was an incredibly intense year for the people of XL Catlin. Bringing together 2 high-performing organizations would be difficult in any environment. It is particularly difficult in the context of the current pricing environment. As we view it, we are confident that the hard work of our people last year will be well rewarded by the market. Because if we think about the totality of market conditions and some of the wild challenges that are going on, and when we think about the work we've already done, we feel incredibly well positioned for what comes next. We believe there is a huge payoff for having gone first, for having carefully picked out our partner and for having done this work rapidly and efficiently.
So before getting into the quarter and full year in more detail, let me walk through some of what I think proves out what I just said. When we set out to put these 2 firms together, our objective was to build a company for the future, because as risk keeps mutating, we want to have the best underwriting minds in the lines of business most able to anticipate and respond to that change. This implies we'd have to do a number of things: First, we have to keep the book together, at least as far as we wanted to do so. Second, we had to keep our workforce together and energized by the prospect of being part of this future-oriented company while creating a common culture. And third, we had to get our systems together, so we could understand how the company is performing and begin applying our unique levels of insight to the needs of our clients. And finally, we had to do all of that while still delivering an acceptable result, because we said all along, this was about both long-term strategy and a compelling financial rationale. 
So how did we do against those goals? Number one, we kept the book of business together. In fact, we believe that we lost less than 0.5 point of premium. I'll say that, less than 0.5 point of premium that both companies had went away because of the transaction. Now I should add parenthetically that this will go up a little bit more as we know of one program that will end during the second quarter of this year. But even when that is added, it will be about 1 point of premium loss. We are thrilled by that result, and there's less than 0.10 of what we had modeled going into the transaction.
Number two, we kept the workforce together. Our voluntary attrition rates this year were only slightly elevated from historical levels. Of course, because of the integration, there are certain key areas where you would expect higher turnover, including in underwriting, but let me put it in perspective. Of our more than a 1,200 underwriters, there were literally just a couple of handfuls of voluntary departures that gave us pause. We are simply thrilled that the vast majority of our XL Catlin colleagues see the potential ahead. So we kept the book together and we kept in the workforce together. 
And our third goal, we managed, at the same time, to bring all of our key systems together. We're able to stop duplicative investments and projects that no longer fit our needs, and we are already minding the bigger data set with which we can now work.
Now we said that we should do all of those things and not lose sight of the fundamentals of trying to build a better business with better margins over time. One aspect of this, of course, is savings. You'll recall that when we first announced the transaction in January of last year, it was certified that we could reach at least $200 million in synergies. And then, when we closed the deal in May, we came over the top of that and said that we could do at least $250 million in savings. We have been wrestling with whether we could commit to a higher number. We never want to commit to a number until we are absolutely certain we can achieve it. And so today, we can announce that we have identified not less than $300 million in synergy savings, and that we are committed -- that we are absolutely committed to deliver, and we are committed to searching for more. 
Now you can ask why? How did you find more money? Well, a number of reasons: Number one, the transaction continues to reveal additional savings opportunities. And when we see one that we are confident in, we grab it. Number two, in line with these challenging market conditions, we continued to increase internal expectations for savings. Our people are well aware that these are difficult times in the pricing environment, and they have responded and have come forward with additional identified opportunities for savings. And our hand will not come off the expense lever because the simple truth is that these markets continue to worsen. And if we don't run the business as though we're counting -- and we do not ever run the business as though we're expecting a turn in the cycle. We may hope for it. It may come, but we don't plan for it.
Additionally, throughout the year, as we have become increasingly confident that we would meet our integration and synergy targets, we resumed share repurchases, buying back over 12 million in shares during 2015. I'm also pleased to note that S&P recently announced that they have revised the outlook of our main FSR rating from stable to positive, which clearly reflected their review of our competitive position. Additionally, the ratings on several of the core Catlin subsidiaries were upgraded from A to A+ during the course of the year. 
And then as I said, we hope to continue to improve the business throughout the year as well. In terms of the results in the fourth quarter, we produced a total P&C combined ratio of 92.3% and gross written premiums of 2.6% -- $2.6 billion. We think that's a solid result for the quarter, but there are some items in the quarter that do make it a bit messy. Pete will provide more detail in a moment, but I'd like to note a couple of important items. 
First, there was a fair amount of tax benefit in the quarter. For those who've been following along over the years, you can think of it as the book ends to the fourth quarter of 2011. You may remember that in the 2011 quarter, we had all of our losses happen in the wrong places and wound up with an unusually high tax rate. This quarter is the opposite, with our losses happening in places that yield tax benefit. 
Second, it is noteworthy that we've had pretty solid PYD releases. And I'm sure that was particularly comforting to you given the questions that were raised during the third quarter. And it reflects the continued prudence of our approach.
And third, I'd like to note that we beat our expense targets in real savings during the year, and we're very pleased about that. And then to the all-important Insurance ex cat accident year loss ratio. While not ending up where we wanted, we should note that from the market commentary that there have been a number of large non-cat losses. You've heard that from around the market. We've experienced some of those as well. But our ex cat accident year loss ratio insurance did improve, both year-over-year and improved sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter. If we can make this improvement in the conditions of last year with all that was going on, we can and believe we will do it in the year ahead.
I should note that our underwriters actually began optimizing our books about halfway through this past year. They threw out growth the plans that both legacies had, realizing that market conditions had worsened more than what predicted back at the time they were planned and are already hard at work walking away from either wildly underpriced businesses or accounts that simply don't meet our performance standards. That's why we didn't grow much in this past year. And we are certainly telling our underwriters the past year -- that this year, growth is not the objective. The books are assembled. Let's begin to optimize them. The underwriters are keeping their wits about them, especially through this complicated market. 
So all in all, we produced what I would call an acceptable quarter and a solid full year effort, particularly when we consider the potential for distractions throughout the year that simply didn't emerge. This is no market in which to be chasing premium. But I remain confident that given our geographic positions and our broadened product lines, we will find isolated spots where there is profitable opportunity for growth.
Last, and I've emphasized this before, we still firmly believe that the strategy in and of itself is great, but it doesn't mean anything until it is married to the right people and the right culture. We have made leaps and bounds of progress in getting our teams together. They are thinking about XL Catlin and not just how it used to be. And by knowing that they are part of one of the most powerful forces in the insurance sector, they really believe they are doing special work, and I agree.
As I've said, this is truer every day. Our leadership team functions as though it's been working together for years. We make decisions together quickly and efficiency. We even have a sense of humor about it. And we work damn hard because we believe that we have a common goal that is worthwhile.
Now I know that if progress doesn't show up in the numbers, it ain't real. So let me be clear. We did a lot in 2015, but this wasn't the year the financial progress would show. All you'll be able to see are the indicators. I like the indicators. Our loss ratios, despite this price environment, continue to come down, and we believe that will continue. Our expense ratio is coming down. We kept the book together. We kept this incredible group of colleagues together, and we've energized them around a common future. That's the company we were trying to build. We're pretty happy about where we are.
I'll admit we're a bit glad that last year's more of a memory now. We're really excited to take on this difficult year because it is now about the progress we can and will make together.
Pete?"

Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $195 million or $0.65 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $294 million in 2014 or $1.12 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $706 million or $2.43.",1401,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $195 million or $0.65 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $294 million in 2014 or $1.12 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $706 million or $2.43. 
As we indicated during our previous calls, we have excluded direct transaction costs from operating income, but included integration costs. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $73 million in deal-related integration costs and $2 million in deal-related transaction costs. The previously disclosed $35 million loss associated with the 100% reinsurance of our U.S. term life business has also been excluded from operating income.
Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $229 million or $0.76 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $139 million or $0.53 per share for the same quarter in 2014 and $1.2 billion or $4.15 per share for the full year compared to $188.3 million or $0.69 per share in the prior year.
As we have previously discussed, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance sale transaction. We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. And as always, it has no impact on comprehensive income or operating results.
Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 92.3% or 7.8 points higher than the same quarter last year, and the full year's 92% was 3.8 points higher than the prior year. Our combined ratio, excluding prior year development for the quarter, was 97.4%, 6 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2014, while the full year's 95.8% was higher by 3.2 points.
Our natural catastrophe losses totaled $108 million or 4.6 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $32 million or 2.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2014. Our natural catastrophe losses for the full year of 2015 were $213 million or 2.6 loss ratio points. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes for 2014 totaled $113 million or 2.1 loss ratio points.
Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As we indicated on our previous earnings call, our fourth quarter ground-up reserve review included the alignment of reserving assumptions across the 2 legacy portfolios. The result of this exercise led to modest strengthening of the legacy Catlin portfolio, which is included in our overall favorable development of $121 million or 5.1 loss ratio points for the quarter, compared to net favorable $97 million or 6.9 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects favorable development of $28 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $93 million in the Reinsurance segment. For the full year, development was a net favorable $307 million or 3.7 loss ratio points compared to $255 million or 4.5 loss ratio points in the prior year.
As was indicated previously, our normal purchase GAAP accounting adjustments will amortize through income over the next number of quarters. Overall, the impact in the quarter is relatively small. However, certain line items can be distorted each quarter. And to the extent these are meaningful, they will be noted by Paul and Greg.
Operating expenses have increased in the quarter as a result of the combination with Catlin. Overall, however, the run-rate operating expense level of the company continues to decline towards the now higher level of expected transaction synergies and, excluding integration costs, are significantly lower than the combined historic levels of the legacy companies.
We continued to believe that these will be achieved in full by the end of 2017. And we continue to view the overall relationship between the onetime cost to achieve integration and the ongoing synergies to be approximately 1.25 to 1.
You can see from our fourth quarter expense levels that we have already made material progress achieving these synergies. In fact, compared to the combined starting point we had guided you to of $2.3 million back in May, based on these fourth quarter expenses, we have already achieved over $300 million of run rate savings. However, that would be somewhat misleading as we have had some benefit from foreign exchange rate reducing these costs. We remain committed to driving real expense leverage from this integration and will only report to you those savings when we are sure they are real and not a function of market movements.
Looking towards 2016, we expect that additional synergies will exceed normal cost growth, driven by compensation inflation and additional costs from added businesses. And as a result, we expect to improve our overall operational leverage.
The large tax benefit in the quarter and overall tax rate for the year was heavily impacted by both the absence of catastrophes in lower-tax-rate jurisdictions and higher proportion of large risk losses in higher-tax locations. For the full year, this, combined with the benefit we realized following our ability to utilize legacy Catlin U.S. net operating losses, resulted in an annual operating tax rate of a negative 2.8%.
Turning to the investment portfolio. Net investment income, excluding the Life Funds Withheld Assets, were $172 million, in line with the same quarter last year, notwithstanding the addition of the Catlin investments. Changes in foreign exchange rates resulted in approximately a $5 million reduction compared to the prior year. The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of December was 2.3%. 
During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.3%. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.7 billion of assets with book yields of 2.3% rolling off over the next 12 months.
In the current volatile market conditions, we will continue to manage the portfolio for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. We have already taken steps in the quarter to reduce our exposure to asset-backed securities and high-yield bonds. And we will continue to take such action as we deem necessary to protect the value of the portfolio, even if this has an adverse impact on reported net investment income in future periods.
Total affiliate income was $15 million for the quarter compared to $34 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to our operating affiliates where our investment manager affiliates, as expected, experienced losses across the board driven by tough third quarter market conditions. Investment fund affiliates were $10 million lower than the prior quarter, driven by our hedge fund affiliates, where many of our event-driven funds performed poorly on an absolute basis due to the impact of continuing market volatility. Despite these disciplining absolute returns, our hedge fund portfolio continued to outperform its benchmark, and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves the risk-adjusted returns we earn on the overall portfolio.
Net realized gains, excluding derivatives, were $11 million for the quarter, down $2 million from the prior year. Our unrealized gain position declined by $203 million during the quarter, driven primarily by increasing rates, offset by tightening spreads and an increase in unrealized gains in -- of our equity portfolio of $59 million. Unrealized net gains were $544 million at the end of the quarter, including other investments.
On a performance basis, the total return on investments was 0.2% for the quarter, excluding FX. And on a year-to-date basis, the total return on investments was 1.38%. The duration of the total portfolio was 3.3 years at the end of the quarter, which is broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. 
And with respect to capital management, we continued to execute share buybacks during the fourth quarter where we purchased 4.7 million shares, leaving $703 million available for purchase share under our buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and continue purchasing in line with the philosophy we discussed with you in May. As we continue with our share buyback program, we will remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.
And as previously indicated, we have called and canceled all former Catlin subordinated notes assumed in conjunction with the transaction. These notes were called at par value of $90 million. 
And I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."
406440,321710066,926631,"XL Group plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Pete. This morning, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an updates on our integration progress and finish with remarks on current market conditions.First, the results. The fourth quarter marked our 12th consecutive quarter of profi",840,"Thanks, Pete. This morning, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an updates on our integration progress and finish with remarks on current market conditions.
First, the results. 
The fourth quarter marked our 12th consecutive quarter of profitability, with the segment producing a calendar quarter combined ratio of 98.2% compared to 93.8% for the same quarter last year, the full year combined ratio of 96.9% versus 94.4% in 2014. More than half of the Q4 deterioration is due to higher cat experience of $68 million compared to $18 million in Q4 2014, with the majority of the balance due to lower prior year reserve releases of $28 million compared to releases of $35 million in the same quarter last year. The remaining variance is a result of higher acquisition expense, offset by an improvement in our operating expense ratio and a lower accident year ex cat loss ratio.
On an accident quarter ex cat basis, the combined ratio was 95.7% compared to 95.4% in Q4 2014. For the full year, it was 95.4%, similar to the 95.2% we reported in 2014, again, demonstrating that we can absorb exceptional losses, such as Tianjin, without jeopardizing profitability.
For Q4, we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.9%, which was 4.8 points higher than Q4 2014. As mentioned last quarter, this is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business, where the acquisition costs are higher than the legacy XL business, which was largely retail. This is offset by a lower Q4 operating expense ratio of 19.5%, which was 3.3 points lower than Q4 2014 and by a lower net accident year ex cat loss ratio of 62.3%, which was 1.2 points lower than Q4 2014. 
Insurance gross premiums written in Q4 increased by 59% or $859 million year-over-year and by $2.4 billion or 41% for the full year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all 4 of our underwriting divisions.
When we look at both legacy organizations and normalized for foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was still positive in Q4 and up nearly 3% year-to-date, reflecting our success in maintaining the 2 legacy portfolio. This is something we continue to be very pleased with, particularly given current market conditions.
Shifting to progress on integration, let me share a few highlights from the Insurance segment perspective. Firstly, the market response to XL Catlin continues to be very favorable. As mentioned in last year's -- last quarter's Q&A, we have established a robust process to track lost business emanating from the deal. And throughout 2015, this metric has consistently been tracking at less than 1%. Business retentions [ph] continues to track well with historical trends. And most importantly, our new business opportunities also continue to be strong despite market conditions.
Second, with our new leadership teams and underwriting organizations fully in place, we have exceeded our 2015 synergy targets for the segment, as we've been able to streamline our underwriting capabilities across divisions and regions. And third, with regard to our longer-term end-state plans, we continue our efforts to consolidate pricing methodologies, operating models and legal entity structures, and that our progress is on plan, if not slightly ahead of plan. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are also developing plans to pull our synergy lever ever harder in 2016 through further efficiencies. We will continue to share progress in future quarters.
Turning to market conditions. The headwinds, which strengthened throughout the year, have continued. Pricing was negative across most lines of business, as the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter and year-to-date. The most significant decreases were, once again, in our short tail lines. We saw broadly flat rates in our long tail lines. And we continued to see some rate increases, most notably in cyber and environmental North America.
Overall, our casualty lines were down just 1% and professional businesses were flat. Our specialty business was down 3%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines, as evidenced by the December airline renewals. And our energy, property and construction businesses were once again most severely impacted, led by reductions in the energy book of approximately 10% and reductions in our international and North American property books of 5%.
Despite these market headwinds, we continue to focus on margin as we transition from retaining the business to tuning the business. Clearly, expense management, as Mike mentioned earlier, will remain a very important lever in 2016, as well improving our mix of business, leveraging analytics into underwriting actions and increasing our reinsurance sufficiency.
By pulling all of these levers, we firmly believe that there are opportunities for further underwriting improvements. And given our greater market presence, we are confident in our ability to expand margins despite the difficult market conditions.
In summary, we delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, continued to grow the book and made significant progress on our integration. And we fully expect this to continue into 2016.
And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."
406440,321710066,926631,"XL Group plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Paul. Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the January 1 renewals. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 79.1% a",713,"Thanks, Paul. Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the January 1 renewals. 
Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 79.1% and underwriting profit of $154 million compared with 61.2% and $156 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of last year. The result for the quarter continued to benefit from favorable prior year development, modest catastrophe losses, offset by a higher accident year ex cat loss ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $93 million compared to $62 million a year ago, lowering the combined ratio by 12.6 and 15.4 points, respectively. In the current quarter, all 5 regions experienced releases, driven primarily by the property catastrophe and casualty treaty lines of business.
As Pete noted, we continued the process of harmonizing and reserving methodology across the segment. And our reserving process continue to recognize bad news quickly and allows potential good news to become credibles.
Catastrophe losses totaled $39 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The major contributors to cat activity during the quarter were the U.K. December storms, Indian floods and Australian hail and bushfire events. While our combined catastrophe portfolio is better diversified, this quarter's cat activity is indicative of a book that is likely to incur loss at lower industry loss levels relative to the XL portfolio.
The segment produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 50.2%, which compares to the 39.9% produced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was driven primarily by a property facultative large loss, loss activity on our worldwide agricultural portfolio and the impact of recent rate decreases.
The expense ratio increased 2.9 points to 35.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 32.9% for the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily driven by a purchase accounting adjustment of $18 million or 2.4 points. 
Turning to top line. Gross written premiums for the quarter was $206 million, up from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was driven primarily by the Catlin acquisition and was partially offset by the timing of a large quarter share renewal, which moved to a January 1 inception.
Given the light activity in the fourth quarter, the full year of the combined XL Catlin is more indicative of how our portfolio changed, and the segment's gross written premium fell 8% year-over-year. This reduction was driven by foreign exchange, lower multiyear premium and adjustments to estimated premium. After adjusting for these 3 factors, our top line was essentially flat year-over-year. Less than 0.5% or $10 million, part of the 8% drop, result from client concerns about the XL Catlin combination. And even in these difficult market conditions, we're able to write $372 million of new business in 2015.
Turning to January 1 renewals. The market generally renewed in orderly fashion, and we continued to experience deteriorating rates across most lines and regions, resulting in a low single-digit decrease. We saw increased demand from a number of clients that have increased retentions over past renewals. And broadly speaking, terms across the book remain as expiring.
Expanding on rates, our global property catastrophe portfolio fell 6%, with the U.S. market, down roughly 5%; and the rest of the world, down 7% to 8%. Contrary to recent press coverage, while some clients achieved double-digit decreases, we did not see that as a broad trend across the international catastrophe market. [indiscernible] catastrophe property treaty portfolio fell 4%, between declining rates and some clients achieving ceding commission increases. On a positive note, our casualty treaty portfolio across the world renewed essentially flat. Overall, this renewal reinforced our view that rate decreases are decelerating across the Reinsurance marketplace. 
In summary, the fourth quarter and full year results were solid for the Reinsurance segment. Despite the challenging market conditions and the rapid integration with Catlin, our underwriting teams did an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. As we head into 2016, we are well positioned for continued success as our momentum in the market remains strong and we have broad support from our clients and brokers.

It's risk at both XL and Caitlin wrote pre the combination. We renewed it. We'd looked at the loss. We write the risk again. It was just an abnormally large loss for us. Our facultative portfolio -- both facultative portfolios have run very well over the years, so that's one piece that's out of the norm. The second one is the crop. This is partly a testament to the -- what I talked about earlier about reflecting bad news fast. We had in our U.S. global ag business a particular crop that underperformed relative to some conditions that are needed to be successful. And so we took all of that bad news of roughly about $8 million, in this quarter. The remainder of the growing season may go well. In fact, the freeze loss -- freeze coverage is the remaining risk left and it's going very well so far -- I'm touching wood, in California, which is our major exposure. So that's the big -- the remainder of it was abnormal activity, somewhat weather related around the world. So the 6 points there that I would say are well outside the norm. The remainder of it is a lot of little moving things. Part of it is what we talked about in terms of harmonizing reserves. That's just the reflection that, in the fourth quarter, in the current accident year, we would would've made some higher picks. We would've taken the entire impact of the full year in the fourth quarter. And some of it's -- a little bit of it's mixed. But in the end, it's also a little bit due to rate. It's impossible to expect flat accident years year-over-year we've been through the rate environment. But I would put that kind of in the 1 or 2 point range out of that whole 10. So by and large, a lot of it's unusual activity, a little bit of it, as we reflect the current market conditions."

And just to be clear, in the fourth quarter and for the year, we recorded about $33 million of adverse prior year development on those reserves. And what we mean when we said the harmonization, well, we harmonized assumptions at the reserve profile level, so very detailed. And that included assumptions, such as initial expected loss ratios, reporting and payment patterns, ground-up loss estimates for natural cat perils as well as major events. I'd say while this harmonization is largely complete, the ongoing alignment to our process of reacting more slowly to potential good news will take a little bit of time to fully implement. And as Greg just noted, I also want to mention that we did harmonize the accident year picks as well in 2015, which did cause a true-up in the fourth quarter."

We do expect to achieve continued combined ratio improvement, period. But not just because of the expense lever. Well, we're pulling it hard, and in fact, harder now than we were at the beginning because of market conditions. We do not mean that we think expense and rate pressure are simply offsetting, and we'll leave it at that. Our belief is that this book of business has plenty of room to improve, and that's the underwriters' task for this year. We did -- I think Pete said something that I really want to underscore. In the fourth quarter, you've seen not only the harmonization of the reserves come through, but you've seen the harmonization of the loss ratio picks come through. So I do not believe that the fourth quarter ex -- for example, in insurance, I do not believe that the fourth quarter x CAT accident year loss ratio that you're looking at this quarter of 62.3%, I do not believe that, that's the run rate for next year, because we've had things that were harmonized during the year and the catch up was largely in the fourth quarter, so that would have elevated that loss ratio beyond what we actually believe the book is running at. And that doesn't account for the underwriting actions that began, as I mentioned in my remarks, midway through last year, and they will start paying off during the course of this year. So we don't accept that we -- we probably could offset rate with expense ratio, but we don't believe that's the game. The game is a stronger and more profitable book of business, and we believe we are in the process of creating exactly that."

And it's across the place. I mean, when you get past the easy and obvious, it starts to be more of a grind around processes that yield greater efficiency. So you shift from the real estate stop, we are shutting down investment or kind of obvious duplicated efforts, and now you're into making the whole place work in a more efficient way from beginning to end of our dealings with clients, from seeking them to serving them. And that's the work that now comes to the floor. So by definition, that has more meaning in terms of headcount than other kinds of expenses. And by the way, as Pete mentioned when he walked through the numbers, we can already see that as against what we forecast our expense levels to be, although a little bit helped by FX. I don't want to overstate that, it's just a little bit. We're already at a run rate of $300 million already today. So we're -- we wouldn't use a number like that if we weren't highly confident, but it isn't like you're going to see some big new thing, and the people that are affected are largely already informed. Now that's not -- it's not to say that everybody who may be affected has yet been informed because there is continuing work to make it better and better across each process. But my experience with this, which goes back to [indiscernible] is, that once you get this in motion and you get the right mindset in motion, more and more reveals itself because people strain themselves to imagine it to be better and they can do that. So I'm sorry, I can't point to this or that process. I do think the one area that I'm highly focused on in the beginning of this year is some duplication that crept into insurance or insurance organization management levels that we are focused on.

In this quarter, when you take out the cost of synergies and just look at the rate of operating expenses, we overachieved on absolute dollars delivered to shareholders in this year alone. And, in fact, this is the first quarter in 2 years that our operating expense ratio was below 20, I mean, our insurance operations, so I was delighted to see that. That is -- and all I would say -- tell you is we view that as a preview of events to come and not the resting point. #2, there is an elevation in acquisition expense for the reasons Paul mentioned, that there's a different mix and there is more program business in the Catlin book. But we also believe there are some levers to drive that down as well, so we don't accept it's happened to a long-run level. Between those 2, taken together, yes, you will see absolute improvement. There is expected to be, between those 2, absolute improvement in the expenses of the company taken together across the acquisition expense. That's the first thing. Second thing, you did slip in a comment of expected accident year loss ratio deterioration because of rate. We don't accept that.

Let me step back because there, I have heard a few questions about the tax rate and what that -- what the $39 million meant. So let me spend a minute, if I could, and try and help people think through that. The first thing I'd say is the $39 million",411,"Sure. Let me step back because there, I have heard a few questions about the tax rate and what that -- what the $39 million meant. So let me spend a minute, if I could, and try and help people think through that. The first thing I'd say is the $39 million that we disclosed, in -- at XL, almost all the tax is on operating almost all the time, because the nonoperating things, the realized gains and losses, sales of conduits and that kind of stuff typically have very little tax impact on those. And so the operating tax impact was -- would have been a $41 million gain rather than the $39 million that we disclosed in total. To put that in context, so the question of -- so you recorded an operating income of $41 million gain, how do I think about that? And if you look at what the operating income was before tax, you guess that number was $153 million. I had guided everyone just now to 11%, 12% tax rate. If you use 12%, you would've had an expected tax in the quarter of about $18 million, just working the math, so we had, as I said, a $41 million benefit. So a delta or a difference of $59 million, right. And as was in my comments, you really got to think about 2 things: the actual tax rate for the year given the distribution of income around the world; and the second one is, I referred to the -- our ability to use the legacy Catlin net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. So in the third quarter, we had adjusted our expected tax rate down to 10% was what I disclosed. So now in the third quarter, I need to adjust that again for what the annual expected tax rate is. It turned out to be at about 3.5%. So that difference times the 9 months income is about $35 million. So that's the first benefit. The second one is the fourth quarter itself, 3.5% versus 12%, that's about a $13 million benefit. And the last one is this quarter's use of the legacy Catlin NOLs, that was about an $11 million or $12 million benefit, and that gets you to the $59 million. So I'm just trying to be transparent here on why the numbers are so different from what you might have expected. So I hope that answers your question, Mike."

So I think that always, one of those I feel is something that we have already adjusted to in the most part, and that's the complexity of the life transaction. And what we should remember, it does introduce complexity, but it's a pretty simple complex",865,"Yes. So I think that always, one of those I feel is something that we have already adjusted to in the most part, and that's the complexity of the life transaction. And what we should remember, it does introduce complexity, but it's a pretty simple complexity. It goes in, it backs out, and you can fairly easily, and we transparently show you how to do that every quarter. That isn't going to go away. So to me, that's just an adaptation. You just recognize that, that thing has nothing to do with understanding the earnings performance or potential of the company, and you get used to it. My observation would be, Paul, that it becomes more annoying when the underlying results aren't clear, and it becomes less annoying when the underlying results are strong. So I'm guessing we all get simply used to that. And what we need to be reminded of perhaps from time to time is that the benefit of that transaction was to take enormous volatility and risk off of our balance sheet. When we -- before we had done that for some of those who -- and certainly you would remember this, Paul, we used to trade like something like a European bond fund, reacting our stock price, reacting every time Europe got edgy. No, Europe is edgy again right now, and I just assume trade for what we produce in terms of insurance operating earnings than whether our life exposures traded portfolio that creates a lot of noise every time Europe has a hiccup. So I think it's easier to remember to back in or back out as we completely delineate every quarter than to have that noise driving the share price. So that one, it will be around for a while. I don't have any plans to cure it. And it's just something I believe we'll all get used to, and I think we do normally, but when it gets noisy, I think we get irritated. The second thing I would point out is most of the noise that has gone on in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter has been transaction related. And I think we're all going to have to work together quickly to get to a new -- kind of a new normal of understanding of what the component parts are of how to analyze profitability. But the core to it all is, do we believe that this firm is better positioned to generate improved earnings. And my answer to that is, yes, it has been ever since the transaction. #1, because we have -- we believe we can optimize this book of business to more profitable levels. We have more levers to pull than we ever have. We have a more diversified book of business by both geography and lines of business, and that simply gives us more to play with in order to create a better result. We, second, are able to optimize the expenses. And this was a drag on both companies prior performance. It was certainly an issue of concern for analysts over time. And we are demonstrating with real effort and, I think, real passion that we can create a very efficient expense platform for this business going forward. And then third, we believe that it is about underwriters who have the real ability to make a difference for clients and their changing risk environment. And there, the level of creativity, the continued innovation that we are able to bring into the marketplace will be a source, we believe, of long-term competitive advantage. So these are difficult times in the sectors we are in both Specialty, particularly in London, and Reinsurance have been under some pressure. But that's never a permanent condition. We don't believe it is at all, and we like our competitive position in both businesses. Being the leader at Lloyd's gives us a greater ability to influence the market than anybody else has, and being one of the largest writers in reinsurance gives us more -- both more intellect and more capital and more position with which to influence the direction of that market and to take a leading role in the changes coming about in that market. So when I think about the cause of most of the noise that frustrates, it is to do with the recency of the transaction, that resolves itself over time, and I don't mean over forever, I mean over pretty soon. And I think the earnings power of the firm due to the expense actions and the speed with which they've been taken and the positioning of the company in the markets we play in, I think comes out over the course of next year in large part and certainly with great clarity in '17. So I -- we are -- I get what you're seeing. We view it very differently. We view the core has always been straightforward, whereas the accident year x CAT loss ratio going, are we in line when CATs do appear, and can we create a more profitable expense platform from which to grow? I think the answer to all those are yes. Pete?"

But I have seen some analysis out there that I get why it resonates with people, but I don't agree with it. Because people are buying into this notion that because specialty and reinsurance are in tough places, notably tough, that somehow no one could ever manage to improve a book of business when it's in this condition. Well, just think about the task that faced an underwriter last year and the task that faced that same underwriter this year. Last year, so we had -- let's say you come into -- you got 2 people, 1 from each company who are running these books of business. We pick the leader between the 2. By definition, either for if it's a Catlin person that's picked, by definition, 60% of the book they're are looking at they've not seen before, and if it's an XL leader, by definition, 40% of what they're looking at, they haven't seen before, I mean, crudely put. And so now, you give them the task, keep that book together if you can. Remember that we're writing to profit. If someone tries to jam, you're doing this crazy market, let it go and so on. So you have this huge task of learning the book, assembling the book. It is a confusing, difficult year. But never did we tell them ""hey, keep the book at any price."" So they've got a mandate to still find they're profitably through it. This year, the books assembled. They've got 1 job to do, optimize this book. We are now willing to accept that if you have a prejudice against the segment of that book and you're the leader of that book, act on it. Last year, we'd have told you why don't you test it out first before you decide that the other guy was done. I mean, this is a clearer year for every person in our company around the globe, and at the same time, we're telling and never give up the hunt for profitable opportunity or the opportunity to innovate, to do something different for the client now that we have more information and now that we have more capability. So we're excited about what that unleashes into the market and maybe difficult market conditions, but we're going to be whistling while we work. This is fun stuff."

You must remember, we're in a very difficult pricing environment. And while there are some positive signs here and there that there's a different attitude emerging, we are not -- we are certainly not calling a bottom, we can still see competitive behavior. And usually when you start to have players change their positioning in the market, at the initial wave of change is not necessarily positive, bunch of underpriced business gets released, that group still thinks we're in the soft market and expects the same or even more attractive pricing, and the rest when you get a turn coming is when that starts to happen and people don't do it in the same way. They say  well, that's interesting, but that's going to cost a lot more to insure. And we are to that point I don't think. So the initial wave of these kinds of movements, I don't think creates some kind of a turn or some kind of a huge growth opportunity. It's a very, very selective process at the beginning. You got to look for the really good accounts that got thrown out maybe with the bathwater. That's what you're hunting for, and those ones you do want to pick up and grow. So you can be -- our underwriters are going to be on high alert that this is a pretty dangerous time, and there's a lot of underpriced businesses going to flood into the market, and you're going to look through that and pick through that and find your spots. And I would say, there's a number of companies who are engaged in that process, not just the one you mentioned. And to some extent, we will be. We continue to some underwriting. Paul -- maybe I'll ask Paul to elaborate a little bit, but we've been certainly through and been picking and starting to push some stuff out. But I've seen some commentary in the market that, boy, is that going to be a great opportunity for us? I don't think that's quite the right mindset for the underwriters. This is a highly selective moment in time. But what you want to be positioned with is, we have gotten our hard work out of the way, you know your run rate, they're ready to go, you know their quality, you know their capabilities, you know their appetite. You want to be clear in how that is all functioning, and we've got that hard work done last year. So that our odds are, we're totally ready for shifts in the market, totally ready to go through this highly intense and very selected process."

I'm still very impressed with the resilience of our profitability. The back half of this year's search engine [ph], that's more than 1 point on the loss ratio. Just -- many companies threw that into the CAT bucket, we didn't, and we were still able to deliver profitability within -- what is that, that's the largest man-made loss in Asia history and one of the largest marine losses in history. And we were able to absorb that and still deliver profit and have these other smaller losses come through, that Paul has described as well, and true up the first half of the year, and, and, and still deliver a profit. So this book is more resilient and less subject to the kind of wild spiking as that you would've seen -- with those kinds of events, going back to maybe now 3 years ago, you would have seen wild volatility in our quarterly result. You saw a deterioration, but you didn't see wild spikes that took us out of profitability. That is the book performing better. Now is it optimized? Are we really where we'd like to be? No, and there is work we can do, both on limits management, on understanding the flow volatility of the book, on what we're doing in Reinsurance, all of which are being done with fresh eyes to the whole books. So can it get even better from here? Yes. But would I say this is a quarter that shows wild volatility? I'd actually say, it's a quarter that shows real absorption.

Today, we're pleased to discuss the fourth quarter and the full year 2015, a year in which we produced solid results, increased the relevance of the firm and built a strong position from which we intend to grow value in the years to come.
Thinking about 2015, it's pretty fun now to reflect on what we have achieved. It wasn't so much fun during the year, of course, because it was an incredibly intense year for the people of XL Catlin. Bringing together 2 high-performing organizations would be difficult in any environment. It is particularly difficult in the context of the current pricing environment. As we view it, we are confident that the hard work of our people last year will be well rewarded by the market. Because if we think about the totality of market conditions and some of the wild challenges that are going on, and when we think about the work we've already done, we feel incredibly well positioned for what comes next. We believe there is a huge payoff for having gone first, for having carefully picked out our partner and for having done this work rapidly and efficiently.
So before getting into the quarter and full year in more detail, let me walk through some of what I think proves out what I just said. When we set out to put these 2 firms together, our objective was to build a company for the future, because as risk keeps mutating, we want to have the best underwriting minds in the lines of business most able to anticipate and respond to that change. This implies we'd have to do a number of things: First, we had to keep the book together, at least as far as we wanted to do so. Second, we had to keep our workforce together and energized by the prospect of being part of this future-oriented company while creating a common culture. And third, we had to get our systems together, so we could understand how the company is performing and begin applying our unique levels of insight to the needs of our clients. And finally, we had to do all of that while still delivering an acceptable result, because we said all along, this was about both long-term strategy and a compelling financial rationale. 
So how did we do against those goals? Number one, we kept the book of business together. In fact, we believe that we lost less than 0.5 point of premium. I'll say that, less than 0.5 point of premium that both companies had went away because of the transaction. Now I should add parenthetically that this will go up a little bit more as we know of one program that will end during the second quarter of this year. But even when that is added, it will be about 1 point of premium loss. We are thrilled by that result, and there's less than 1/10 of what we had modeled going into the transaction.
Number two, we kept the workforce together. Our voluntary attrition rates this year were only slightly elevated from historical levels. Of course, because of the integration, there are certain key areas where you would expect higher turnover, including in underwriting, but let me put it in perspective. Of our more than a 1,200 underwriters, there were literally just a couple of handfuls of voluntary departures that gave us pause. We are simply thrilled that the vast majority of our XL Catlin colleagues see the potential ahead. So we kept the book together and we kept the workforce together. 
And our third goal, we managed, at the same time, to bring all of our key systems together. We were able to stop duplicative investments and projects that no longer fit our needs, and we are already mining the bigger data set with which we can now work.
Now we said that we should do all of those things and not lose sight of the fundamentals of trying to build a better business with better margins over time. One aspect of this, of course, is savings. You'll recall that when we first announced the transaction in January of last year, it was certified that we could reach at least $200 million in synergies. And then, when we closed the deal in May, we came over the top of that and said that we could do at least $250 million in savings. We have been wrestling with whether we could commit to a higher number. We never want to commit to a number until we are absolutely certain we can achieve it. And so today, we can announce that we have identified not less than $300 million in synergy savings, and that we are committed -- that we are absolutely committed to deliver, and we are committed to searching for more. 
Now you can ask why? How did you find more money? Well, a number of reasons: Number one, the transaction continues to reveal additional savings opportunities. And when we see one that we are confident in, we grab it. Number two, in line with these challenging market conditions, we continue to increase internal expectations for savings. Our people are well aware that these are difficult times in the pricing environment, and they have responded and have come forward with additional identified opportunities for savings. And our hand will not come off the expense lever because the simple truth is that these markets continue to worsen. And if we don't run the business as though we're counting -- and we do not ever run the business as though we're expecting a turn in the cycle. We may hope for it. It may come, but we don't plan for it.
Additionally, throughout the year, as we have become increasingly confident that we would meet our integration and synergy targets, we resumed share repurchases, buying back over 12 million in shares during 2015. I'm also pleased to note that S&P recently announced that they have revised the outlook of our main FSR rating from stable to positive, which clearly reflected their review of our competitive position. Additionally, the ratings on several of the core Catlin subsidiaries were upgraded from A to A+ during the course of the year. 
And then as I said, we hope to continue to improve the business throughout the year as well. In terms of the results in the fourth quarter, we produced a total P&C combined ratio of 92.3% and gross written premiums of 2.6% -- $2.6 billion. We think that's a solid result for the quarter, but there are some items in the quarter that do make it a bit messy. Pete will provide more detail in a moment, but I'd like to note a couple of important items. 
First, there was a fair amount of tax benefit in the quarter. For those who've been following along over the years, you can think of it as the bookends to the fourth quarter of 2011. You may remember that in the 2011 quarter, we had all of our losses happen in the wrong places and wound up with an unusually high tax rate. This quarter is the opposite, with our losses happening in places that yield tax benefit. 
Second, it is noteworthy that we've had pretty solid PYD releases. And I'm sure that was particularly comforting to you given the questions that were raised during the third quarter. And it reflects the continued prudence of our approach.
And third, I'd like to note that we beat our expense targets in real savings during the year, and we're very pleased about that. And then to the all-important Insurance x cat accident year loss ratio. While not ending up where we wanted, we should note that from the market commentary that there have been a number of large non-cat losses. You've heard that from around the market. We've experienced some of those as well. But our x cat accident year loss ratio insurance did improve, both year-over-year and improve sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter. If we can make this improvement in the conditions of last year with all that was going on, we can and believe we will do it in the year ahead.
I should note that our underwriters actually began optimizing our books about halfway through this past year. They threw out the growth the plans that both legacies had, realizing that market conditions had worsened more  that were predicted back at the time they were planned and are already hard at work walking away from either wildly underpriced businesses or accounts that simply don't meet our performance standards. That's why we didn't grow much in this past year. And we are certainly telling our underwriters the past year -- that this year, growth is not the objective. The books are assembled. Let's begin to optimize them. The underwriters are keeping their wits about them, especially through this complicated market. 
So all in all, we produced what I would call an acceptable quarter and a solid full year effort, particularly when we consider the potential for distractions throughout the year that simply didn't emerge. This is no market in which to be chasing premium. But I remain confident that given our geographic positions and our broadened product lines, we will find isolated spots where there is profitable opportunity for growth.
Last, and I've emphasized this before, we still firmly believe that the strategy in and of itself is great, but it doesn't mean anything until it is married to the right people and the right culture. We have made leaps and bounds of progress in getting our teams together. They are thinking about XL Catlin and not just how it used to be. And by knowing that they are part of one of the most powerful forces in the insurance sector, they really believe they are doing special work, and I agree.
As I've said, this is truer every day. Our leadership team functions as though it's been working together for years. We make decisions together quickly and efficiency. We even have a sense of humor about it. And we work damn hard because we believe that we have a common goal that is worthwhile.
Now I know that if progress doesn't show up in the numbers, it ain't real. So let me be clear. We did a lot in 2015, but this wasn't the year the financial progress would show. All you'll be able to see are the indicators. I like the indicators. Our loss ratios, despite this price environment, continue to come down, and we believe that will continue. Our expense ratio is coming down. We kept the book together. We kept this incredible group of colleagues together, and we've energized them around a common future. That's the company we were trying to build. We're pretty happy about where we are.
I'll admit we're a bit glad that last year's more of a memory now. We're really excited to take on this difficult year because it is now about the progress we can and will make together.
Pete?"

Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $195 million or $0.65 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $294 million in 2014 or $1.12 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $706 million or $2.43",1401,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $195 million or $0.65 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $294 million in 2014 or $1.12 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $706 million or $2.43 per share.
As we indicated during our previous calls, we have excluded direct transaction costs from operating income, but included integration costs. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $73 million in deal-related integration costs and $2 million in deal-related transaction costs. The previously disclosed $35 million loss associated with the 100% reinsurance of our U.S. term life business has also been excluded from operating income.
Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $229 million or $0.76 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $139 million or $0.53 per share for the same quarter in 2014 and $1.2 billion or $4.15 per share for the full year compared to $188.3 million or $0.69 per share in the prior year.
As we have previously discussed, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance sale transaction. We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. And as always, it has no impact on comprehensive income or operating results.
Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 92.3% or 7.8 points higher than the same quarter last year, and the full year's 92% was 3.8 points higher than the prior year. Our combined ratio, excluding prior year development for the quarter, was 97.4%, 6 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2014, while the full year's 95.8% was higher by 3.2 points.
Our natural catastrophe losses totaled $108 million or 4.6 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $32 million or 2.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2014. Our natural catastrophe losses for the full year of 2015 were $213 million or 2.6 loss ratio points. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes for 2014 totaled $113 million or 2.1 loss ratio points.
Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As we indicated on our previous earnings call, our fourth quarter ground-up reserve review included the alignment of reserving assumptions across the 2 legacy portfolios. The result of this exercise led to modest strengthening of the legacy Catlin portfolio, which is included in our overall favorable development of $121 million or 5.1 loss ratio points for the quarter, compared to net favorable $97 million or 6.9 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects favorable development of $28 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $93 million in the Reinsurance segment. For the full year, development was a net favorable $307 million or 3.7 loss ratio points compared to $255 million or 4.5 loss ratio points in the prior year.
As was indicated previously, our normal purchase GAAP accounting adjustments will amortize through income over the next number of quarters. Overall, the impact in the quarter is relatively small. However, certain line items can be distorted each quarter. And to the extent these are meaningful, they will be noted by Paul and Greg.
Operating expenses have increased in the quarter as a result of the combination with Catlin. Overall, however, the run-rate operating expense level of the company continues to decline towards the now higher level of expected transaction synergies and, excluding integration costs, are significantly lower than the combined historic levels of the legacy companies.
We continue to believe that these will be achieved in full by the end of 2017. And we continue to view the overall relationship between the onetime cost to achieve integration and the ongoing synergies to be approximately 1.25:1.
You can see from our fourth quarter expense levels that we have already made material progress achieving these synergies. In fact, compared to the combined starting point we had guided you to of $2.3 million back in May, based on these fourth quarter expenses, we have already achieved over $300 million of run rate savings. However, that would be somewhat misleading as we have had some benefit from foreign exchange rate reducing these costs. We remain committed to driving real expense leverage from this integration and will only report to you those savings when we are sure they are real and not a function of market movements.
Looking towards 2016, we expect that additional synergies will exceed normal cost growth, driven by compensation inflation and additional cost from added businesses. And as a result, we expect to improve our overall operational leverage.
The large tax benefit in the quarter and overall tax rate for the year was heavily impacted by both the absence of catastrophes in lower-tax-rate jurisdictions and higher proportion of large risk losses in higher-tax locations. For the full year, this, combined with the benefit we realized following our ability to utilize legacy Catlin U.S. net operating losses, resulted in an annual operating tax rate of a negative 2.8%.
Turning to the investment portfolio. Net investment income, excluding the Life Funds Withheld Assets, were $172 million, in line with the same quarter last year, notwithstanding the addition of the Catlin investments. Changes in foreign exchange rates resulted in approximately a $5 million reduction compared to the prior year. The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of December was 2.3%. 
During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.3%. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.7 billion of assets with book yields of 2.3% rolling off over the next 12 months.
In the current volatile market conditions, we will continue to manage the portfolio for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. We have already taken steps in the quarter to reduce our exposure to asset-backed securities and high-yield bonds. And we will continue to take such action as we deem necessary to protect the value of the portfolio, even if this has an adverse impact on reported net investment income in future periods.
Total affiliate income was $15 million for the quarter compared to $34 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to our operating affiliates where our investment manager affiliates, as expected, experienced losses across the board driven by tough third quarter market conditions. Investment fund affiliates were $10 million lower than the prior quarter, driven by our hedge fund affiliates, where many of our event-driven funds performed poorly on an absolute basis due to the impact of continuing market volatility. Despite these disappointing absolute returns, our hedge fund portfolio continued to outperform its benchmark, and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves the risk-adjusted returns we earn on the overall portfolio.
Net realized gains, excluding derivatives, were $11 million for the quarter, down $2 million from the prior year. Our unrealized gain position declined by $203 million during the quarter, driven primarily by increasing rates, offset by tightening spreads and an increase in unrealized gains in -- of our equity portfolio of $59 million. Unrealized net gains were $544 million at the end of the quarter, including other investments.
On a performance basis, the total return on investments was 0.2% for the quarter, excluding FX. And on a year-to-date basis, the total return on investments was 1.38%. The duration of the total portfolio was 3.3 years at the end of the quarter, which was broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. 
And with respect to capital management, we continued to execute share buybacks during the fourth quarter where we purchased 4.7 million shares, leaving $703 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and continue purchasing in line with the philosophy we discussed with you in May. As we continue with our share buyback program, we will remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.
And as previously indicated, we have called and canceled all former Catlin subordinated notes assumed in conjunction with the transaction. These notes were called at par value of $90 million. 
And I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."

This morning, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on our integration progress and finish with remarks on current market conditions.First, the results. The fourth quarter marked our 12th consecutive quarter of profit",839,"Thanks, Pete. This morning, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on our integration progress and finish with remarks on current market conditions.
First, the results. 
The fourth quarter marked our 12th consecutive quarter of profitability, with the segment producing a calendar quarter combined ratio of 98.2% compared to 93.8% for the same quarter last year, the full year combined ratio of 96.9% versus 94.4% in 2014. More than half of the Q4 deterioration is due to higher cat experience of $68 million compared to $18 million in Q4 2014, with the majority of the balance due to lower prior year reserve releases of $28 million compared to releases of $35 million in the same quarter last year. The remaining variance is a result of higher acquisition expense, offset by an improvement in our operating expense ratio and a lower accident year x cat loss ratio.
On an accident quarter x cat basis, the combined ratio was 95.7% compared to 95.4% in Q4 2014. For the full year, it was 95.4%, similar to the 95.2% we reported in 2014, again, demonstrating that we can absorb exceptional losses, such as Tianjin, without jeopardizing profitability.
For Q4, we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.9%, which was 4.8 points higher than Q4 2014. As mentioned last quarter, this is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business, where the acquisition costs are higher than the legacy XL business, which was largely retail. This is offset by a lower Q4 operating expense ratio of 19.5%, which was 3.3 points lower than Q4 2014 and by a lower net accident year x cat loss ratio of 62.3%, which was 1.2 points lower than Q4 2014. 
Insurance gross premiums written in Q4 increased by 59% or $859 million year-over-year and by $2.4 billion or 41% for the full year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all 4 of our underwriting divisions.
When we look at both legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was still positive in Q4 and up nearly 3% year-to-date, reflecting our success in maintaining the 2 legacy portfolios. This is something we continue to be very pleased with, particularly given current market conditions.
Shifting to progress on integration, let me share a few highlights from the Insurance segment perspective. Firstly, the market response to XL Catlin continues to be very favorable. As mentioned in last year's -- last quarter's Q&A, we have established a robust process to track lost business emanating from the deal. And throughout 2015, this metric has consistently been tracking at less than 1%. Business retentions [ph] continues to track well with historical trends. And most importantly, our new business opportunities also continue to be strong despite market conditions.
Second, with our new leadership teams and underwriting organizations fully in place, we have exceeded our 2015 synergy targets for the segment, as we've been able to streamline our underwriting capabilities across divisions and regions. And third, with regard to our longer-term end-state plans, we continue our efforts to consolidate pricing methodologies, operating models and legal entity structures, and that our progress is on plan, if not slightly ahead of plan. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are also developing plans to pull our synergy lever ever harder in 2016 through further efficiencies. We will continue to share progress in future quarters.
Turning to market conditions. The headwinds, which strengthened throughout the year, have continued. Pricing was negative across most lines of business, as the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter and year-to-date. The most significant decreases were, once again, in our short tail lines. We saw broadly flat rates in our long tail lines. And we continue to see some rate increases, most notably in cyber environmental North America.
Overall, our casualty lines were down just 1% and professional businesses were flat. Our specialty business was down 3%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines, as evidenced by the December airline renewals. And our energy, property and construction businesses were once again most severely impacted, led by reductions in the energy book of approximately 10% and reductions in our international and North American property books of 5%.
Despite these market headwinds, we continue to focus on margin as we transition from retaining the business to tuning the business. Clearly, expense management, as Mike mentioned earlier, will remain a very important lever in 2016, as well improving our mix of business, leveraging analytics into underwriting actions and increasing our reinsurance efficiency.
By pulling all of these levers, we firmly believe that there are opportunities for further underwriting improvements. And given our greater market presence, we are confident in our ability to expand margins despite the difficult market conditions.
In summary, we delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, continued to grow the book and made significant progress on our integration. And we fully expect this to continue into 2016.
And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."
406440,321710066,926847,"XL Group plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Paul. Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the January 1 renewals. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 79.1% a",714,"Thanks, Paul. Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the January 1 renewals. 
Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 79.1% and underwriting profit of $154 million compared with 61.2% and $156 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of last year. The result for the quarter continued to benefit from favorable prior year development, modest catastrophe losses, offset by a higher accident year x cat loss ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $93 million compared to $62 million a year ago, lowering the combined ratio by 12.6 and 15.4 points, respectively. In the current quarter, all 5 regions experienced releases, driven primarily by the property catastrophe and casualty treaty lines of business.
As Pete noted, we continued the process of harmonizing and reserving methodology across the segment. And our reserving process continues to recognize bad news quickly and allows potential good news to become credibles.
Catastrophe losses totaled $39 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The major contributors to cat activity during the quarter were the U.K. December storms, Indian floods and Australian hail and bushfire events. While our combined catastrophe portfolio is better diversified, this quarter's cat activity is indicative of a book that is likely to incur loss at lower industry loss levels relative to the XL portfolio.
The segment produced an accident quarter x cat loss ratio of 50.2%, which compares to the 39.9% produced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was driven primarily by a property facultative large loss, loss activity on our worldwide agricultural portfolio and the impact of recent rate decreases.
The expense ratio increased 2.9 points to 35.8% in the fourth quarter compared with 32.9% for the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily driven by a purchase accounting adjustment of $18 million or 2.4 points. 
Turning to top line. Gross written premiums for the quarter was $206 million, up from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was driven primarily by the Catlin acquisition and was partially offset by the timing of a large quarter share renewal, which moved to a January 1 inception.
Given the light activity in the fourth quarter, the full year of the combined XL Catlin is more indicative of how our portfolio changed, and the segment's gross written premium fell 8% year-over-year. This reduction was driven by foreign exchange, lower multiyear premium and adjustments to estimated premium. After adjusting for these 3 factors, our top line was essentially flat year-over-year. Less than 0.5% or $10 million, part of the 8% drop, resulted from client concerns about the XL Catlin combination. And even in these difficult market conditions, we were able to write $372 million of new business in 2015.
Turning to January 1 renewals. The market generally renewed in orderly fashion, and we continued to experience deteriorating rates across most lines and regions, resulting in a low single-digit decrease. We saw increased demand from a number of clients that have increased retentions over past renewals. And broadly speaking, terms across the book remain as expiring.
Expanding on rates, our global property catastrophe portfolio fell 6%, with the U.S. market, down roughly 5%; and the rest of the world, down 7% to 8%. Contrary to recent press coverage, while some clients achieved double-digit decreases, we did not see that as a broad trend across the international catastrophe market. The non-catastrophe property treaty portfolio fell 4%, between declining rates and some clients achieving ceding commission increases. On a positive note, our casualty treaty portfolio across the world renewed essentially flat. Overall, this renewal reinforced our view that rate decreases are decelerating across the Reinsurance marketplace. 
In summary, the fourth quarter and full year results were solid for the Reinsurance segment. Despite the challenging market conditions and the rapid integration with Catlin, our underwriting teams did an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. As we head into 2016, we are well positioned for continued success as our momentum in the market remains strong and we have broad support from our clients and brokers.

It's risk at both XL and Catlin wrote pre the combination. We renewed it. We'd looked at the loss. We write the risk again. It was just an abnormally large loss for us. Our facultative portfolio -- both facultative portfolios have run very well over the year, so that's one piece that's out of the norm. The second one is the crop. This is partly a testament to the -- what I talked about earlier about reflecting bad news fast. We had in our U.S. global ag business a particular crop that underperformed relative to some conditions that are needed to be successful. And so we took all of that bad news of roughly about $8 million, in this quarter. The remainder of the growing season may go well. In fact, the freeze loss -- freeze coverage is the remaining risk left and it's gone very well so far -- I'm touching wood, in California, which is our major exposure. So that's the big -- the remainder of it was abnormal activity, somewhat weather related around the world. So the 6 points there that I would say are well outside the norm. The remainder of it is a lot of little moving things. Part of it is what we talked about in terms of harmonizing reserves. That's just the reflection that, in the fourth quarter, in the current accident year, we would would've made some higher picks. We would've taken the entire impact of the full year in the fourth quarter. And some of it's -- a little bit of it's mix. But in the end, it's also a little bit due to rate. It's impossible to expect flat accident years year-over-year we've been through the rate environment. But I would put that kind of in the 1 or 2 point range out of that whole 10. So by and large, a lot of it's unusual activity, a little bit of it, as we reflect the current market conditions."

And just to be clear, in the fourth quarter and for the year, we recorded about $33 million of adverse prior year development on those reserves. And what we mean when we said the harmonization, well, we harmonized assumptions at the reserve profile level, so very detailed. And that included assumptions, such as initial expected loss ratios, reporting and payment patterns, ground-up loss estimates for natural cat perils as well as major events. I'd say while this harmonization is largely complete, the ongoing alignment to our process of reacting more slowly to potential good news will take a little bit of time to fully implement. And as Greg just noted, I also want to mention that we did harmonize the accident year picks as well in 2015, which did cause a true-up in the fourth quarter."

We do expect to achieve continued combined ratio improvement, period. But not just because of the expense lever. While we're pulling it hard, and in fact, harder now than we were at the beginning because of market conditions. We do not mean that we think expense and rate pressure are simply offsetting, and we'll leave it at that. Our belief is that this book of business has plenty of room to improve, and that's the underwriters' task for this year. We did -- I think Pete said something that I really want to underscore. In the fourth quarter, you've seen not only the harmonization of the reserves come through, but you've seen the harmonization of the loss ratio picks come through. 
So I do not believe that the fourth quarter x -- for example, in insurance, I do not believe that the fourth quarter x CAT accident year loss ratio that you're looking at this quarter of 62.3%, I do not believe that, that's the run rate for next year, because we've had things that were harmonized during the year and the catch up was largely in the fourth quarter, so that would have elevated that loss ratio beyond what we actually believe the book is running at. And that doesn't account for the underwriting actions that began, as I mentioned in my remarks, midway through last year, and they will start paying off during the course of this year. So we don't accept that we -- we probably could offset rate with expense ratio, but we don't believe that's the game. The game is a stronger and more profitable book of business, and we believe we are in the process of creating exactly that."

And it's across the place. I mean, when you get past the easy and obvious, it starts to be more of a grind around processes that yield greater efficiency. So you shift from the real estate stuff, we are shutting down an investment or kind of obvious duplicated efforts, and now you're into making the whole place work in a more efficient way from beginning to end of our dealings with clients, from seeking them to serving them. And that's the work that now comes to the fore. So by definition, that has more meaning in terms of headcount than other kinds of expenses. And by the way, as Pete mentioned when he walked through the numbers, we can already see that is against what we forecast our expense levels to be, although a little bit helped by FX. I don't want to overstate that, it's just a little bit. We're already at a run rate of $300 million already today. So we're -- we wouldn't use a number like that if we weren't highly confident, but it isn't like you're going to see some big new thing, and the people that are affected are largely already informed. Now that's not -- it's not to say that everybody who may be affected has yet been informed because there is continuing work to make it better and better across each process. But my experience with this, which goes back to [indiscernible] days is, that once you get this in motion and you get the right mindset in motion, more and more reveals itself because people strain themselves to imagine it to be better and they can do that. So I'm sorry, I can't point to this or that process. I do think the one area that I'm highly focused on in the beginning of this year is some duplication that crept into insurance or insurance organization management levels that we are focused on.

But can you just give me some idea because it just looking at kind of what we've seen so far this year versus the comments, I'm having trouble seeing sort of where that -- where we start to cross over here?"

First of all, I just want to note something that I note with some pride. In this quarter, when you take out the cost of synergies and just look at the rate of operating expenses, we overachieved on absolute dollars delivered to shareholders in this year alone. And, in fact, this is the first quarter in 2 years that our operating expense ratio was below 20, I mean, our insurance operations, so I was delighted to see that. That is -- and all I would say -- tell you is we view that as a preview of events to come and not the resting point. Number two, there is an elevation in acquisition expense for the reasons Paul mentioned, that there's a different mix and there is more program business in the Catlin book. But we also believe there are some levers to drive that down as well, so we don't accept it's at the long-run level. Between those 2, taken together, yes, you will see absolute improvement. There is expected to be, between those 2, absolute improvement in the expenses of the company taken together across the acquisition expense. That's the first thing. Second thing, you did slip in a comment of expected accident year loss ratio deterioration because of rate. We don't accept that. We believe this book, even in this environment, can continue to produce through mix change and the reunderwriting already going on, improvement over the course of next year in the accident year loss ratio. So I don't -- I'm sorry to note that, but I don't accept the observation."

So you would have seen some elevation that doesn't reflect these larger losses that have been discussed. Second, you also would have seen some larger losses from the first half of the year develop into the second half of the year, and you did see that across the market, particularly in the marine and energy books, which I think had tough years across the market, not just at our company.

Let me step back because there're, I have heard there are a few questions about the tax rate and what that -- what the $39 million meant. So let me spend a minute, if I could, and try and help people think through that. The first thing I'd say is th",414,"Sure. Let me step back because there're, I have heard there are a few questions about the tax rate and what that -- what the $39 million meant. So let me spend a minute, if I could, and try and help people think through that. The first thing I'd say is the $39 million that we disclosed, in -- at XL, almost all the tax is on operating almost all the time, because the nonoperating things, the realized gains and losses, sales of conduits and that kind of stuff typically have very little tax impact on those. And so the operating tax impact was -- would have been a $41 million gain rather than the $39 million that we disclosed in total. To put that in context, so the question of -- so you recorded on operating income a $41 million gain, how do I think about that? And if you look at what the operating income was before tax, you asked for that number was $153 million. I had guided everyone just now to 11%, 12% tax rate. If you use 12%, you would've had an expected tax in the quarter of about $18 million, just working the math, so we had, as I said, a $41 million benefit. So a delta or a difference of $59 million, right. And as was in my comments, you really got to think about 2 things: the actual tax rate for the year given the distribution of income around the world; and the second one is, I referred to the -- our ability to use the legacy Catlin net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. So in the third quarter, we had adjusted our expected tax rate down to 10% was what I disclosed. So now in the third quarter, I need to adjust that again for what the annual expected tax rate is. It turned out to be at about 3.5%. So that difference times the 9 months income is about $35 million. So that's the first benefit. The second one is the fourth quarter itself, 3.5% versus 12%, that's about a $13 million benefit. And the last one is this quarter's use of the legacy Catlin NOLs, that was about an $11 million or $12 million benefit, and that gets you to the $59 million. So I'm just trying to be transparent here on why the numbers are so different from what you might have expected. So I hope that answers your question, Mike."

So I think that always, one of those I feel is something that we have already adjusted to in the most part, and that's the complexity of the life transaction. And what we should remember, it does introduce complexity, but it's a pretty simple complex",869,"Yes. So I think that always, one of those I feel is something that we have already adjusted to in the most part, and that's the complexity of the life transaction. And what we should remember, it does introduce complexity, but it's a pretty simple complexity. It goes in, it backs out, and you can fairly easily, and we transparently show you how to do that every quarter. That isn't going to go away. So to me, that's just an adaptation. You just recognize that, that thing has nothing to do with understanding the earnings performance or potential of the company, and you get used to it. My observation would be, Paul, that it becomes more annoying when the underlying results aren't clear, and it becomes less annoying when the underlying results are strong. So I'm guessing we all get simply used to that. And what we need to be reminded of perhaps from time to time is that the benefit of that transaction was to take enormous volatility and risk off of our balance sheet. When we -- before we had done that for some of those who -- and certainly you would remember this, Paul, we used to trade like something like a European bond fund, reacting our stock price, reacting every time Europe got edgy. Note, Europe is edgy again right now, and I'd just as soon trade for what we produce in terms of insurance operating earnings than whether our life exposures create a portfolio that creates a lot of noise every time Europe has a hiccup. So I think it's easier to remember to back in or back out as we completely delineate every quarter than to have that noise driving the share price. So that one, it will be around for a while. I don't have any plans to cure it. And it's just something I believe we'll all get used to, and I think we do normally, but when it gets noisy, I think we get irritated. The second thing I would point out is most of the noise that has gone on in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter has been transaction related. And I think we're all going to have to work together quickly to get to a new -- kind of a new normal of understanding of what the component parts are of how to analyze profitability. But the core to it all is, do we believe that this firm is better positioned to generate improved earnings. And my answer to that is, yes, and it has been ever since the transaction. Number one, because we have -- we believe we can optimize this book of business to more profitable levels. We have more levers to pull than we ever have. We have a more diversified book of business by both geography and lines of business, and that simply gives us more to play with in order to create a better result. We, second, are able to optimize the expenses. And this was a drag on both companies' prior performance. It was certainly an issue of concern for analysts over time. And we are demonstrating with real effort and, I think, real passion that we can create a very efficient expense platform for this business going forward. And then third, we believe that it is about underwriters who have the real ability to make a difference for clients in a changing risk environment. And there, the level of creativity, the continued innovation that we are able to bring into the marketplace will be a source, we believe, of long-term competitive advantage. So these are difficult times in the sectors we are in both Specialty, particularly in London, and Reinsurance have been under some pressure. But that's never a permanent condition. We don't believe it is at all, and we like our competitive position in both businesses. Being the leader at Lloyd's gives us a greater ability to influence the market than anybody else has, and being one of the largest writers in reinsurance gives us more -- both more intellect and more capital and more position with which to influence the direction of that market and to take a leading role in the changes coming about in that market. So when I think about the cause of most of the noise that frustrates, it is to do with the recency of the transaction, that resolves itself over time, and I don't mean over forever, I mean over pretty soon. And I think the earnings power of the firm due to the expense actions and the speed with which they've been taken and the positioning of the company in the markets we play in, I think comes out over the course of next year in large part and certainly with great clarity in '17. So I -- we are -- I get what you're seeing. We view it very differently. We view the core has always been straightforward, whereas the accident year x CAT loss ratio going, are we in line when CATs do appear, and can we create a more profitable expense platform from which to grow? I think the answer to all those are yes. Pete?"

Because people are buying into this notion that because specialty and reinsurance are in tough places, notably tough, that somehow no one could ever manage to improve a book of business when it's in this condition. Well, just think about the task that faced an underwriter last year and the task that faced that same underwriter this year. Last year, so we had -- let's say you come into -- you got 2 people, 1 from each company who are running these books of business. We pick the leader between the 2. By definition, either for if it's a Catlin person that's picked, by definition, 60% of the book they're looking at they've not seen before, and if it's an XL leader, by definition, 40% of what they're looking at, they haven't seen before, I mean, crudely put. And so now, you give them the task, keep that book together if you can. Remember that we're writing to profit. If someone tries to jam you during this crazy market, let it go and so on. So you have this huge task of learning the book, assembling the book. It is a confusing, difficult year. But never did we tell them ""hey, keep the book at any price."" So they've got a mandate to still find their profitable way through it. This year, the books assembled. They've got 1 job to do, optimize this book. We are now willing to accept that if you have a prejudice against the segment of that book and you're the leader of that book, act on it. Last year, we would have told you, ""Why don't you test it out first before you decide that the other guy was dumb."" I mean, this is a clearer year for every person in our company around the globe, and at the same time, we're telling them and never give up the hunt for profitable opportunity or the opportunity to innovate, to do something different for the client now that we have more information and now that we have more capability. So we're excited about what that unleashes into the market. They may be difficult market conditions, but we're going to be whistling while we work. This is fun stuff."

You must remember, we're in a very difficult pricing environment. And while there are some positive signs here and there that there's a different attitude emerging, we are not -- we are certainly not calling a bottom, we can still see competitive behavior. And usually when you start to have players change their positioning in the market, at the initial wave of change is not necessarily positive, a bunch of underpriced business gets released, that group still thinks we're in the soft market and expects the same or even more attractive pricing, and the rest when you get a turn coming is when that starts to happen and people don't do it in the same way. They say  well, that's interesting, but that's going to cost a lot more to insure. And we aren't to that point I don't think. So the initial wave of these kinds of movements, I don't think creates some kind of a turn or some kind of a huge growth opportunity. It's a very, very selective process at the beginning.

Paul -- maybe I'll ask Paul to elaborate a little bit, but we've been certainly through and been picky and starting to push some stuff out. But I've seen some commentary in the market that, boy, is that going to be a great opportunity for us? I don't think that's quite the right mindset for the underwriters.

It wi",1287,"Good evening, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings call. The call XL Catlin navigated challenging conditions and produced good underwriting results while maintaining our focus on bottom line underwriting and top line discipline. It will be no surprise to you that our view is consistent with what you've already been hearing from others during this quarter that market headwinds are very tough. But as we'll discussed tonight in our results, we think you can see many indicators of a well-managed book. At the same time, a few one-off impacts related to the continuing fine-tuning of some of processes in underwriting following the Catlin acquisition. Particularly now our seeded programs. So I'm going to walk through our results in a few of these highlights and impacts, and then we also give you a little bit more help break with our normal tradition of little guidance on 2 specific areas, the Insurance acquisition expense ratio and the split between Insurance and Reinsurance. Now that we have nearly 12 months of XL Catlin results to point to. And then, of course, I'll turn it over to Pete for some additional financial information and to Paul and Greg to discuss the segment results in greater detail. 
Looking at our results from the top of the house. In this quarter, we produced the P&C combined ratio of 92.5%, gross premiums written of $4.4 billion and an underwriting profit of $175 million. Our operating net income for the quarter of $103 million was impacted by $55 million of transaction-related integration costs and a higher level of cats in the quarter at $53 million in this first quarter versus $15 million in the first quarter of 2015. We also considered continue to see impacts from the financial markets and affiliate income with $8 million of earnings in this quarter compared with $58 million in the first quarter of 2015. Now that as a portfolio that has served us really well over time, and we think it will do so again in the future. Obviously, it is difficult time for the hedge funds right now. Prior year releases in the quarter were $43 million versus $48 million in the first quarter of 2015. As a reminder, we conduct a full review of our reserves in the second and fourth quarters. 
In terms of the segments results, we continue to look for pockets of opportunity of amid the tough pricing environment new business opportunities which Greg will discuss and produced a solid combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119million. In Insurance, the ongoing fine-tuning and hard work came through once again in the accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 61.2%. As you know, this has been an area of focus for us. And we're pleased to see this metric continue to improve now for 3 consecutive quarters. And it again points to the determination to focus on the bottom line fundamentals amidst all the difficulties of the current market conditions. Paul will have further detail regarding the Insurance segment in his results -- in his remarks. 
Now I said that there were one-offs and unique items impacting these results, particularly in Insurance, including higher acquisition costs, due in part to the timing and mix of our programs. And here as I said, for one time I'm going to give you some forward-looking items. As these acquisition expenses even through the rest of the year, we expect that the Insurance segment acquisition expense ratio should move back in line with what we saw in the second half of 2015. And then to the second bit of guidance I mentioned. We realized that this overall challenging rate environment as well as the transition haven't made it easy for you to model certain things like the Insurance and Reinsurance business split for net earned premium. We have now reported, of course, 11 months as a combined company. When you add in April last year, and include the Catlin results for that period, you have a trailing 12-month split of between 68% and 69% for Insurance with the balance being Reinsurance. And that would be the gauge I would look to use looking forward for the full year. 
To stepping back, how should you think about XL Catlin in this current market. This is a question obviously we've been asking our leaders, broker partners and clients quite a bit as well. And the challenge that the market that the actual reception XL Catlin receives from brokers and clients is not yet fully showing up in the numbers. But the fundamentals we intended to deliver through the transaction continued to be very strong. First, I've already mentioned our continued loss ratio progress in Insurance. Second, we're ahead of the transaction-related synergy savings targets and as you recall, in the previous quarter, we increased our expected run rate synergy savings to $300 million. Further, the P&C expense ratio for the quarter decreased to 16.6% in Q1 versus the 19.1% in the prior-year quarter. And that is the actually lowest this metric has been in 8 quarters. And as we've said, we're working to greater efficiency, and we are ready to pull the expense level further if and when it should prove necessary. Third, this transaction was based on combining 2 underwriting centric cultures, and we are insisting on fundamental bottom line focused behavior. And when you tell underwriters to do what's right for the bottom line in a difficult rate environment like this, you will get less premium. It's that simple. But we like the discipline, we like the focus, and we like what our combined trends have been able to do so far, whether fine-tuning their books exiting some underperforming lines or simply walking away from new opportunities where we don't see the margins. Yes. We want them out to seeking the opportunities. And we see an amazing flow of opportunities just not willing -- not just not many that we're willing to write at these prices. Fourth, we've maintained
ability to manage our capital. Based on what we told to you previously, you should've expected around $700 million in buybacks for the year. Then seeing our premium trends in this quarter, combined with our comfort in our capital position lead us to during in the quarter to add $250 million in buybacks to the plan. With this additional $250 million, we got buying back about $180 million in quarter 1. We expect to finish the balance of that additional $250 million in buybacks as well as the planned amount towards to original $700 million in the next quarter. So to be very clear, as of right now, around $950 million is what you should expect for the year for buybacks. Of course, we'll continue to evaluate this as the trends emerge 
So all in, the company's producing good results than the reaction from clients and brokers continues to be enormously positive. And I certainly know, you have good networks to check me out on this. The recent RIMS Conference was simply resounding success for our firm, we're producing on the new opportunities as we intended, but we will not change top line, this isn't the market for us. While we are going to write what was see the margin. And we will make the tough decisions to stay disciplined, exit lines, well we don't see future potential and plan for these difficult market to continue. Even though, in the end, of course,, they are unsustainable. And when is turn, we intend to be in the best position firm in the marketplace. We're seeing that come true, and we're looking forward to that inevitable time 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."

Operating net income for the first quarter was $103 million, or $0.35 per share, on a fully diluted basis compared to $194 million in 2015, or $0.75 per share. As we previously disclosed, during the first quarter, we incurred $55 million in integration costs, which have been included in operating income. 
Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $22 million, or $0.07 per share, on a fully diluted basis compared to $36 million, or $0.14 per share, for the same quarter in 2015. As we've previously noted, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance sale transaction 
We continue to show our relationship in the summary consolidated financial data, including with the press release. As always, there is no impact on comprehensive income or operating results. Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 92.5%, or 3.6 points, higher than last quarter. Our property and casualty combined ratio, excluding private development and the impact of natural catastrophes for the quarter, was 92.1%, 0.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015. Our natural catastrophe losses totaled $53 million, or 2.2 loss ratio points for the quarter, compared to $15 million, or 1.1 loss ratio points, in the same quarter of 2015 
Prior year developments was positive $43 million, or 1.8 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net development of $48 million, and 3.7 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects a favorable developments of $11 million in the insurance segment and favorable development of $32 million in the reinsurance segment. As we've discussed in previous calls, during the first and third quarters, our reserve based actual versus expected losses. Our semiannual actuarial review will be included in our results next quarter, and we intend to provide our global triangles later this quarter. These will be our first as a combined company. Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail. 
Operating expenses have decreased in the quarters as we're making material progress achieving synergies with the transaction. We continue to view the overall relationship between the one-time cost to achieve integration and the ongoing synergies to be approximately 1.25 to 1. We expect that additional synergies will exceed normal cost expense growth to improve our overall operational leverage and this is already coming our results as our P&C operating expense ratios has decreased by 2.4 points from the first quarter of 2015. Total combined operating expenses excluding integration costs are already more than 10% lower than at the time of acquisition. Our first quarter operating tax rate was approximately 11% with certain taxes on nonoperating mark-to-market items driving the higher tax rate on net income. We still expect our overall operating tax rate will be in the 10% to 12% range. 
Turning to the investment portfolio reflecting the addition of the Catlin portfolio net investment excluding the funds withheld assets was $164 million, up $6 million. The gross book yield of portfolio at the end of March was 2.4%. Given current yield, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we have approximately $3.6 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% lowering off over the next 12 months. During the quarter, our average rate was 1.7%. Total income was $8 million for the quarter compared to $58 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to our investment funded affiliates where equity and credit market volatility impacted returns in our hedge fund affiliate portfolio was not immune. Despite these disappointing absolute results, our hedge fund portfolio continues to significantly outperform its benchmark, and we continue to believe that modest allocation to this asset class improves the risk-adjusted returns we earned on the overall portfolio. Our strategic and other operating affiliates are $13 million compared to $23 million in the prior year quarter due primarily to the sale of the ARX Holdings in the second quarter of 2015. Net realized losses excluding derivatives were $8 million for the quarter, down $13 million in the prior year. Our unrealized gain position including other investments increased by $417 million during the quarter driven primarily by rate decreases in our major jurisdictions. Unrealized net gains were $939 million at the end of the quarter, including other investments. On a performance basis, the total return on investments was 1.7% for the quarter, excluding foreign exchange. The duration of the total portfolio was consistent at 3.2 years. Now with respect to capital management under the share buyback program approved by our Board of Directors at our August meeting, we purchased just under 10 million shares for $355 million at an average price of $35.69 per share, leaving $348 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. As Mike noted, we increased our level of share buybacks in the first quarter with the goal of $250 million of additional purchases over our typical pace in the first quarter. Given the combination of the limited time with the open trading window and relatively low volumes of market trading in March, we completed only $118 million through March 31, and we expect to complete these purchases during our next open trading window. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and will return capital when we believe appropriate. We also remain focused on ensuring that overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years. I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results."

But I'd firstly like to share some thoughts on current market conditions. The headwinds were strengthened throughout 2015 have continued with pricing being negative across most lines of business. The overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter. Overall, our Casualty lines were flat, professional businesses were down 1%. Our Specialty business was down 2% continues competitive condition of the aviation management lines although energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%. This negative environment has had an impact on top line, to preserve margins, sacrifice top line in terms they would meet our requirements. We've also chosen to exit certain underperforming books, which in aggregate reduced top line by approximately $70 million in the quarter. Against this backdrop, I'm pleased to report we've continued our trend to profitable quarters dating back to quarter 1 2013. The second producing combined ratio of 96.5% compared to 94.1% in quarter 1 2015 and 98.2% last quarter. Prior cash experience of $35 million compared to $15 million in the quarter 1 2015 contributions of 1/3 of the With the majority of the balance due to higher acquisition expenses, largely offset by improvement in operating expense and accident ex-cap loss ratios. Prior year reserves over $11 million or 0.7 points was consistent with prior-year quarter. By an accident quarter ex CapEx is combined ratio was 95% compared to 93.2% in quarter 1 2015 and 95.7 last order. 
In Q1, we reported acquisition ratio of 14.1% compared to 8.4% in Q1 2015 and 13.9% reported last quarter. The majority of this increase is because of legacy Catlin business included a larger share of Specialty business with the growth acquisition costs are higher and the loss ratios are lower in the legacy XL business. Remaining difference is largely driven by highest in Q1 2015 legacy XL book generated additional commissions acquisition ratio. 
Looking forward, we expect this ratio to reduce modestly in line with our experience in Q3 and Q4 2015 as changes in insurance hopefully implemented. This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a lower Q1 operating expense ratio at 19.7%, which was 1.9 points lower than Q1 2015. And by 11 ex Cap loss ratio of 61.2%, which was 2 points lower than Q1 2015. Insurance gross premiums written in Q1 increased by 51% or $849 million year-over-year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred at all 4 of our underwriting divisions. 
Let me look at both organizations and normalize the foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was flat in Q1. However, when you also consider the activity in 2015 whereas mentioned previously decisions were made to exit certain underwriting books, we would see growth in the 3% to 4% range. This underlying demonstrates the market is difficult entirely opportunity, and while we consider experience by some competitors have a positive impact on rate returns. We saw little evidence of this in the present quarter. Our underwriters will continue to monitor the market closely and given our capabilities and stronger market presence transaction, we're well positioned to execute profitable opportunity when they rise, be that next quarter or next year. This expectation is underpinned Catlin continues to be very favorable as evidenced repeatedly at this month 26 2016 as both current and perspective clients were interested in hearing how we could help. In the insurance segment premiums written in the quarter were $1 billion premium written lines reflects some changes the way we buy our insurance by them and the timing of our insurance purchasing as we move towards more integrated enterprise-wide reinsurance presence. In Q1, approximately $100 million exceeded premium written came solely from timing differences. They have included consolidation alignment of group covers 11, bringing forward our Q3 international casualty renewal and placing the cap funds who provides cover for 3 years. Adjusting for these timing differences, the insurance segment spends a portion of PBW in Q1 2016 with 35.9%, roughly 4.1% less combination of the individual companies in Q1 2015. While the 35.9% is slightly higher than 34.3% in quarters in Q1 2015 for legacy XL, we expect this to reduce in the full year unfolds. And we fully transition to our integrated reinsurance program. The benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the group's written profile, strong coordination across capital strategy. As Mike have mentioned reacts to the top line challenges by careful management expenses, we have developed further plans to improve efficiencies during 2016. We began executing these plans in the quarter by selectively exiting 35 positions as we continue to stay on our underwriting capabilities across divisions and regions. 
While the expense savings from these actually are not reflected in the quarter, they will begin through in subsequent quarters along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway. In summary, we've taken the response to a difficult market. We have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, continued to grow the book and make significant progress on our efficiency and management initiatives. And we fully expect this to continue margin expense as our first priority. And now that to Greg to discuss Reinsurance results."

Today, I will discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119 million compared with 74.7% and $19 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year. Results for the quarter continued to benefit from favorable prior year development, lower accident year ex cap loss ratio and modest catastrophe losses, although to a lesser extent than the prior year. Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $32 million compared to $42 million a year ago, lowering the combined ratio by 4.3 and 11.9 points, respectively. In the current quarter, the releases were primarily in the property classes and reflect our harmonized reserve process. Further, our actual versus expected announces continues to be positive and indicative of strong reserve position going forward. The reinsurance segment accident quarter ex cap loss ratio of 52.3%, which compares to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease is driven primarily by favorable loss activity in our property business and the impact of a change in business mix resulting from the Catlin acquisition. The expense ratio increased 1.9 points to 33.8% in the first quarter compared to 31.9% for the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a purchase accounting adjustment of $7 million or 0.9 points, and higher commissions due to the competitive pricing commitment, particularly in our classes. The cash totaled $17 million, net of premiums during the quarter compared to no catastrophe losses in the first quarter of last year. The activity during the quarter related to Taiwan earthquake and impacted our property catastrophe and property lines of business. 
Turning to the top line. Gross written premiums for the quarter was $1.86 billion, up from $826 million in the first quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. We continue to see very little loss business as a result of the transaction. Again has less than 1%. In fact clients have been very supportive of XL Catlin and we're seeing significant new business opportunities as we generated $240 million of new business during the first quarter of 2016. This was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we not renewed $150 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing our terms and conditions. On the combined XL Catlin view, after adjusting for foreign exchange, the segment top line was flat in the quarter. 
Turning to Reinsurance market conditions. We found the environment to be challenging, but decreases continue to decelerate in both classes and regions. During the quarter, reinsurance segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 6% and at a lower rate of change the prior year. And the remainder of the property portfolio, rates were down 3% and ceding commission's on pro rata increased slightly. Our Casualty portfolio renewed essentially flat over last year. And remainder of our classes were flat to down, low single digits. Having just completed the recent April 1 renewals, rates in Japan were down 7.5% for property catastrophe coverage. We observed an increase in client demand, and we're able to grow our portfolio at this renewal. In summary, the first quarter results were solid for the Reinsurance segment. Despite difficult market conditions, our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job, retaining a profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. We're well positioned for continued success broad support from our clients and brokers. I'll now turn it back to David."

The most important thing that I would emphasize is that we have always emphasized the effects of the transaction in terms of loss business as a discrete category. In other words, where we were focused is, was there a market reaction that took business away from us. In other words, somebody feeling that because there was  Catlin line and XL line previously that they couldn't support the combination of lines on an account or someone feeling that because of the transaction that we were somehow going to become invertedly focused and therefore not someone they want to trade with during a period of consolidation and integration. Those were the kinds of things we were worried about. And overwhelmingly, and we really knew this and repeatedly by the middle of last year, we knew that the market reaction was actually quite positive and going to give us more opportunities, not declining opportunities. And we have continued to monitor that as Greg just mentioned, it's still through less than 1% of the premiums in Reinsurance had any effect because of the transaction as when just defined. And I think, it will go slightly over 1%, because of one program that comes up this year that will be right around 1% in Insurance as well. So to me that is a fantastic endorsement by the market of the combination. That is not the same, and we've been very specific about that this throughout last half of last year. That is not the same you're saying and we will keep all of the business at any cost. We have continued to focus on bottom line underwriting. And I've mentioned many times that by the middle of last year, we knew very well that book was going to stick together and people were enthusiastic for the combination. And we gave our underwriters at that point our usual instructions the job is to underwrite what we think is reasonably priced business under appropriate terms and conditions and if we can't find it, we won't write. We also made sure that our underwriters knew they had permission as they came to know the books better through the year to take larger actions if they felt profitability warranted it. So we have come off some program business, for example, we have off the Insurance and operations that we simply didn't have in the future earnings potential. And that is what you're hearing about when we mentioned the underwriting activities. All of that shows up in the way particularly in Insurance, the first quarter net on premium works out, although, there you have to add the impact that Paul mentioned about the reinsurance programs being in terms of readjustments. So this quarter over those impacts, but those impacts are in there as well. In terms of going forward, I'm having started this underwriting back in the middle of last year, and seeing it now more fully in swing as we went through the planning process and are executing. We in fact believe that that will be a contributor to being able to expand margins, because we believe that's exactly the kinds of actions that are necessary to lower the loss ratio and of course as Pete mentioned, we are well on track and in fact of the timing on seeing the expense reductions come through and with those 2 categories in decline and with the acquisition ratio increase, that's the -- what we have to solve for expand margins, but those have to all add up to the end lower and combine and we're still on track to do so. In fact, in this quarter, if we took out the one-time noise that was mentioned by Paul on the acquisition ratio, we would have nearly done, so just in this quarter alone. Never mind that we benefits of those reunderwriting actions and the benefits of the expense ratio should show up more prominently in the back half of the year. Now a lot of caution though on that. We are in a very difficult pricing environment, more difficult certainly than we anticipated and certainly every call I have listened to or let the transcript of this quarter emphasizes the same realization that will make it more difficult over time to show the margin expansion we planned, but it doesn't mean that we give up or think its impossible. We certainly have the expense piece in the right place and this quarter at least is a good indicator on the loss ratio as well. So with all of that said, and the capital actions that we've talked about, do I think it means that in the reasonable future, we can deliver a double-digit ROI? No. I still believe that in the reasonable future that we have the tools to get there conditions just make it more difficult. But by no means walked away from that goal or believe that that is possible in the reasonable term."

The first thing, we're thinking about is can we -- what are our plans for premium and how are they with what is available at a reasonable rate. And at this the start of the year when we're back in planning as we're going back into last year, we were not expecting the level of deterioration and intensifying competition that we're seeing. So we would have expected to be able to write a bit more of a top line. In fact, Paul referenced when yid talk about the fact that we're seeing that's not much coming with terms and conditions that we would be writing whether that will change or not, it's very hard to say, because we're fairly early in those processes, so the first thing we realize is we're not going to have -- we're not going to be able through our organic writings to put as much to work of the capital as we have thought, that's the first place you go to. The second place then you go to is, is there any other way we can put that money to work for our shareholders, and then finding none, we've always believe that then if we can't put it to good work, then it's not necessary for our then we should do our best to give back to shareholders. And then, of course, you also look at the ROI economics in such a decision, how do we view where we're treading. And then what does that tell us about the economics of buybacks. So you take that all equations together and as we look at all of those factors, we said this is, in fact, not only does it indicate, you will need less to hold less capital for the year relative to our buffers and relative to our planned writings and not only did we find where we were's trading attractive relative to our tandem book value not only all those things were true, but we just we should do it in the first part of the year rather than just spreading across the year, and then react to market conditions later. So we're kind of as a baseline, you should forecast for equal installments of the 700, but then we've decided in the first half of the year that to go after $250 million more giving you a total for the year of $950 million.

We think, in this quarter, we show as we've seen a couple of times in recent quarters, some unusual activity that is one-time and related to the coming together, but it's the way we're putting our seeded programs together, which we believe will be meaningfully beneficial over the course of the year, but it did have some unusual effects in the period. So when we back up those unusual facts and we look at the progress that we're making, we had all that up and say we believe we can get to the levels of return that we've planned and there's nothing that has happened outside of market conditions being more difficult that has shaken us from that belief that could change the pace some, it could change  how you have to drive it some, but it doesn't change our fundamental belief that we can get this company to those kinds of results. And I just point out across Reinsurance and Specialty, we're certainly incredibly difficult conditions and if we're able to produce these results with all that noise in this period, I'd like our chances as we get further into the year. But the lot of that will depend on things beyond our control, but the things we're controlling, we're pleased with the job we're doing. So that's what I'm talking about and that continues to please me, and I'm particularly pleased that our underwriters have kept about them in an environment like this where conditions are very difficult, you always worry about underwriters on the frontline not respond to the challenging conditions they face. And I'm simply very pleased with the quality of our underwriting behavior and the way in which that will produce results now, and well into the future and we certainly see organizations or underwriters are not maintaining their discipline and well that makes a challenging for now that makes our relative performance position all that much better over time."

It will be no surprise to you that our view is consistent with what you've already been hearing from others during this quarter that market headwinds are very tough. But as we'll discussed tonight our results -- in our results, we think you can see many indicators of a well-managed book, at the same time, a few one-off impacts related to the continuing fine-tuning of some of processes in underwriting following the Catlin acquisition, particularly, now our ceded reprograms. So I'm going to walk through our results and a few of these highlights and impacts, and then, we also want to give you a little bit more help. And in a break with our normal tradition, a little guidance on 2 specific areas: the insurance acquisition expense ratio, and the split between Insurance and Reinsurance, now that we have nearly 12 months of XL Catlin results to point to. And then, of course, I'll turn it over to Pete for some additional financial information, and to Paul and Greg to discuss the segment results in greater detail. 
Looking at our results from the top of the house. In this quarter, we produced a P&C combined ratio of 92.5%, gross premiums written of $4.4 billion, and an underwriting profit of $175 million. Our operating net income for the quarter of $103 million was impacted by $55 million of transaction-related integration costs and a higher level of CATs in the quarter at $53 million in this first quarter versus $15 million in the first quarter of 2015. We also considered -- continued to see impacts from the financial markets in our affiliate income, with $8 million of earnings in this quarter compared with $58 million in the first quarter of 2015. Now that is a portfolio that has served us really well over time, and we think it will do so again in the future. Obviously, it is a difficult time for the hedge funds right now. Prior year releases in the quarter were $43 million versus $48 million in the first quarter of 2015. As a reminder, we conduct a full review of our reserves in the second and fourth quarters. 
In terms of the segments results, we continue to look for pockets of opportunity amid the tough pricing environment, reinsuring and saw some new business opportunities, which Greg will discuss, and produced a solid combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119 million. 
In Insurance, the ongoing fine-tuning and hard work came through once again in the accident quarter, ex CAT loss ratio of 61.2%. As you know, this has been an area of focus for us, and we are pleased to see this metric continue to improve now for 3 consecutive quarters. And it again points to the determination to focus on the bottom line fundamentals amidst all the difficulties of the current market conditions. 
Paul will have further detail regarding the Insurance segment in his results -- in his remarks. 
Now I said that there were one-off and unique items impacting these results, particularly in Insurance, including higher acquisition costs, due in part to the timing and mix of our ceded reprograms. And here, as I said, for one time, I'm going to give you some forward-looking items. As these acquisition expenses even out through the rest of the year, we expect that the Insurance segment acquisition expense ratio should move back in line with what we saw in the second half of 2015. And then to the second bit of guidance I mentioned. We realized that this overall challenging rate environment as well as the transaction effects themselves haven't made it easy for you to model certain things like the Insurance and Reinsurance business split for net earned premium. We have now reported, of course, 11 months as a combined company. When you add in April of last year and include the Catlin results for that period, you have a trailing 12-month split of between 68% and 69% for Insurance, with the balance being Reinsurance. And that would be the gauge I would look to use looking forward for the full year. 
So stepping back, how should you think about XL Catlin in this current market? This is a question, obviously, we've been asking our leaders, broker partners and clients quite a bit as well. And the challenge of the market means that the actual reception XL Catlin receives from brokers and clients is not yet fully showing up in the numbers. But the fundamentals we intended to deliver through the transaction continued to be very strong. 
First, I've already mentioned our continued loss ratio progress in Insurance. 
Second, we are ahead of the transaction-related synergy savings targets; and as you'll recall, in the previous quarter, we increased our expected run rate synergy savings to $300 million. Further, the P&C expense ratio for the quarter decreased to 16.6% in Q1 versus the 19.1% in the prior year quarter. And that is actually lowest this metric has been in 8 quarters. And as we've said, we're working toward greater efficiency, and we're ready to pull the expense level further if and when it should prove necessary. 
Third, this transaction was based on combining 2 underwriting-centric cultures, and we are insisting on fundamental bottom line-focused behavior. And when you tell underwriters to do what's right for the bottom line in a difficult rate environment like this, you will get less premium. It's that simple. But we like the discipline, we like the focus, and we like what our combined trends have been able to do so far, whether it's in fine-tuning their books and exiting some underperforming lines; or simply walking away from new opportunities where we don't see the margins. Yes, we want them out there seeking opportunities. And we see an amazing flow of opportunities just not willing -- not -- just not many, that we're willing to write at these prices. 
Fourth, we've maintained the ability to manage our capital. Based on what we told to you previously, you should've expected around $700 million in buybacks for the year. Then seeing our premium trends in this quarter, combined with our comfort in our capital position, lead us to -- during in the quarter to add $250 million in buybacks to the plan. With this additional $250 million, we got thru buying back about $180 million in quarter 1. We expect to finish the balance of that additional $250 million in buybacks as well as the planned amount towards to original $700 million in the next quarter. 
So to be very clear, as of right now, around $950 million is what you should expect for the year for buybacks. Of course, we'll continue to evaluate this as the trends emerge. 
So all in, the company's producing good results, and the reaction from clients and brokers continues to be enormously positive. And I certainly know you have good networks to check me out on this. 
The recent RIMS concert -- conference was simply a resounding success for our firm. We are producing on the new opportunities, as we intended, but we will not chase top line. This isn't the market for it. We're only going to write when we see the margin. And we will make the tough decisions to stay disciplined, exit lines where we don't see future potential, and plan for these difficult markets to continue, even though, in the end, of course, they are unsustainable. And when there is a turn, we intend to be the best prevention firm in the marketplace. We're seeing that come true, and we're looking forward to that inevitable time. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."
406440,330471289,965267,"XL Group plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Well, thanks, Mike, and good evening.

Operating net income for the first quarter was $103 million or $0.35 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $194 million in 2015 or $0.75 per share. As we've previously disclosed, during the first quarter, we incurred $55 million in integration costs, which have been included in operating income. 
Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $22 million or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $36 million or $0.14 per share for the same quarter in 2015. As we have previously noted, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that trend to the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance sale transaction. 
We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data, included with the press release.  As always, it has no impact on comprehensive income or operating results. 
Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 92.5% or 3.6 points higher than the same quarter last year. Our property and casualty combined ratio, excluding prior year development and the impact of natural catastrophes for the quarter was 92.1%, 0.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015. 
Our natural catastrophe losses totaled $53 million or 2.2 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $15 million or 1.1 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. 
Prior year development was a positive $43 million or 1.8 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $48 million and 3.7 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $11 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $32 million in the Reinsurance segment. 
As we have discussed in previous calls, during the first and third quarters, our reserving process is on our review of actual versus expected losses. Our semi-annual full actuarial review will be included in our results next quarter, and we intend to provide our global loss triangles later this quarter. These will be our first as a combined company. 
And Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail. 
Operating expenses have decreased in the quarter as we have made material progress achieving synergies for the transaction. We continue to view the overall relationship between the one-time cost to achieve integration and the ongoing synergies to be approximately 1.25:1. We expect that additional synergies will exceed normal cost expense growth to improve our overall operational leverage, and this is already coming through our results as our P&C operating expense ratios had decreased by 2.4 points from the first quarter of 2015. 
Total combined operating expenses, excluding integration costs, are already more than 10% lower than at the time of acquisition. 
Our first quarter operating tax rate was approximately 11%, with certain taxes on nonoperating mark-to-market items driving the higher tax rate on net income. We still expect our overall operating tax rate to be in the 10% to 12% range. 
Turning to the investment portfolio. Reflecting the addition of the Catlin portfolio, net investment income, excluding the Life Funds Withheld Assets was $164 million, up $6 million. The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of March was 2.4%. 
Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.6 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. 
During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7%. 
Total affiliate income was $8 million for the quarter compared to $58 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to our investment fund affiliates, where equity and credit market volatility impacted returns, and our hedge fund affiliate portfolio was not immune. 
Despite these disappointing absolute results, our hedge fund portfolio continues to significantly outperform its benchmark, and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves the risk-adjusted returns we earn on the overall portfolio. 
Our strategic and other operating affiliates are at $13 million compared to $23 million in the prior year quarter due primarily to the sale of ARX Holdings in the second quarter of 2015. 
Net realized losses, excluding derivatives, were $8 million for the quarter, down $13 million from the prior year. Our unrealized gain position, including other investments, increased by $417 million during the quarter, driven primarily by rate decreases on major jurisdictions. 
Unrealized net gains were $939 million at the end of the quarter, including other investments. 
On a performance basis, the total return on investments was 1.7% for the quarter, excluding foreign exchange. The duration of the total portfolio was consistent at 3.2 years. 
Now with respect to capital management, under the share buyback program approved by our Board of Directors at our August meeting, we purchased just under 10 million shares for $355 million at an average price of $35.69 per share, leaving $348 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. 
As Mike noted, we increased our level of share buybacks in the first quarter with the goal of adding $250 million of additional purchases over our typical pace in the first quarter. 
Given the combination of the limited time with the open trading window and relatively low volumes of market trading in March, we completed only $118 million through March 31, and we expect to complete these purchases during our next open trading window. 
We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool, and we'll return capital when we believe it appropriate. We also remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years. 
I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."
406440,330471289,965267,"XL Group plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Pete. Good evening. I'll cover the results for the segment, but would firstly like to share some thoughts on current market conditions. The headwinds we strengthened throughout 2015 have continued, with pricing being negative across most lines of",983,"Thanks, Pete. Good evening. I'll cover the results for the segment, but would firstly like to share some thoughts on current market conditions. The headwinds we strengthened throughout 2015 have continued, with pricing being negative across most lines of business, but the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter. Overall, our casualty lines were flat, professional businesses were down 1%. Our specialty business was down 2%, reflecting continued competitive conditions of the aviation and crisis management lines. And our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%. 
This negative environment has had an impact on top line, but our underwriters are under clear instruction to preserve margins and sacrifice top line if terms don't meet our requirements. 
We have also chosen to exit certain underperforming books which, in aggregate, reduced top line by approximately $70 million in the quarter. 
Against this backdrop, I'm pleased to report that we have continued our trend to profitable quarters dating back to quarter 1 2013, with the segment producing a kind of quarter-combined ratio of 96.5% compared to 94.1% in quarter 1 2015, and 98.2% last quarter. 
Higher CAT experience of $35 million compared to $15 million in the quarter 1 2015 contributed to 1/3 of the deterioration, with the majority of the balance due to the higher acquisition expenses, largely offset by an improvement in our operating expense and accident year, ex CAT loss ratios. 
Prior year reserve releases of $11 million, or 0.7 points, was consistent with prior year quarter. 
On an accident quarter, ex CAT basis, the combined ratio was 95% compared to 93.2% in quarter 1 2015 and 95.7 last quarter. 
For Q1, we reported an acquisition ratio of 14.1% compared to 8.4% in Q1 2015 and 13.9% reported last quarter. The majority of this increase is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business, where the gross acquisition costs are higher and the loss ratios are lower than the legacy XL business. The remaining difference is largely driven by high-liquidity share sessions in Q1 2015 on the legacy XL book, which generated additional ceding commissions reducing the net acquisition ratio. 
Looking forward, we expect this ratio to reduce modestly to be more in line with that experienced in Q3 and Q4 2015, as changes in our reinsurance strategy are fully implemented. 
This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a lower Q1 operating expense ratio of 19.7%, which was 1.9 points lower than Q1 2015 and by a lower net accident year ex CAT loss ratio of 61.2%, which was 2 points lower than Q1 2015. 
Insurance gross premiums written in Q1 increased by 51% or $849 million year-over-year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all 4 of our underwriting divisions. 
When we look at both legacy organizations and normalize the foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was flat in Q1. However, when you also consider the portfolio-tuning activities that started in 2015, whereas mentioned previously, decisions were made to exit certain underperforming books, we would see growth in the 3% to 4% range. This underlying growth demonstrates that while the market is difficult, it is not entirely bereft of opportunity. And while we consider that the dislocation experienced by some competitors should have a positive impact on rate and terms, we saw little evidence of this in the first quarter. 
Our underwriters will continue to monitor the market closely, and given our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction, we are well positioned to execute profitable opportunities when they arise, be that next quarter or next year. 
This expectation is further underpinned as the market response to XL Catlin continues to be very favorable, as was evidenced repeatedly at this month's 26 RIMS -- 2016 RIMS conference, as both current and prospective clients were interested in hearing how we could help. 
For the Insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $1 billion. The ceded premium written line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance program and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing as we move towards a more integrated enterprise-wide reinsurance presence. 
In Q1, approximately $100 million of ceded premium written came solely from timing differences. These included consolidation alignment of the group catastrophe covers of 1 1, bringing forward our Q3 international casualty renewal, and placing the Galileo CAT bond, which provides cover for 3 years. 
Adjusting for these timing differences, the Insurance segment spend, as a proportion of GPW in Q1 2016, was 35.9%, roughly 4.1% less than for the combination of the individual companies in Q1 2015. 
While the 35.9% is slightly higher than the 34.3% reported in Q1 2015 for legacy XL, we expect this to reduce as the full year unfolds and we fully transition to our integrated reinsurance program. The benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the group's risk return profile, a strong coordination across our wider capital strategy. 
As Mike has mentioned, it is essential to react to the top line challenges by carefully managing expenses, and we have developed further plans to improve efficiencies during 2016. We began executing these plans in the quarter by selectively exiting 35 positions, as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across divisions and regions. 
While the expense savings from these actions are not reflected in the quarter, they will begin flowing through in subsequent quarters, along with the other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway. 
In summary, we have taken the correct action in response to a difficult market, and we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, continued to grow the book, and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiative. As we fully expect this to continue, margin expansion remains our first priority. 
And now, to Greg to discuss Reinsurance results."

Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119 million compared with 74.7% and $90 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year. Results for the quarter continued to benefit from favorable prior year development, lower accident year ex CAT loss ratio, and modest catastrophe losses, although, to a lesser extent, than in the prior year. 
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $32 million compared to $42 million a year ago, lowering the combined ratio by 4.3 and 11.9 points, respectively. In the current quarter, the releases were primarily in the property classes, and reflect our harmonized reserve process. 
Further, our actual-versus-expected analysis continued to be positive, and indicative of a strong reserve position going forward. 
The Reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex CAT loss ratio of 52.3%, which compares to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by favorable attritional loss activity in our property treaty business and the impact of a change in business mix resulting from the Catlin acquisition. 
The expense ratio increased 1.9 points to 33.8% in the first quarter compared to 31.9% for the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a purchase accounting adjustment of $7 million or 0.9 points, and higher ceding commissions due to the competitive pricing commitment, particularly in our short-tail classes. 
Catastrophe losses totaled $17 million, net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter, compared to no catastrophe losses in the first quarter of last year. The CAT activity during the quarter related to Taiwan earthquake and impacted our property catastrophe and property treaty lines of business. 
Turning to the top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $1.86 billion, up from $826 million in the first quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. We continue to see very little loss business as a result of the transaction. Again, writing at less than 1%. 
In fact, brokers and clients have been very supportive of XL Catlin Re, and we're seeing significant new business opportunities as we generated $240 million of new business during the first quarter of 2016. This was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we nonrenewed $150 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms and conditions. 
On a combined XL Catlin review, after adjusting for foreign exchange, the segment top line was flat in the quarter. 
Turning to Reinsurance market conditions. We found the environment to be challenging, but rate decreases continued to decelerate in most classes and regions. During the quarter, rates for the segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 6% and at a lower rate of change from the prior year. 
On the remainder of the property treaty portfolio, rates were down 3%, and ceding commissions on pro rata treaties increased slightly. 
Our casualty portfolio renewed essentially flat over last year. And the remainder of our classes were flat to down, low single digits. 
Having just completed the recent April 1 renewals, rates in Japan were down 7.5% for property catastrophe covers. We observed an increase in client demand, and we're able to grow our portfolio at this renewal. 
In summary, the first quarter results were solid for the Reinsurance segment. Despite difficult market conditions, our underwriting teams continued to do an excellent job, retaining a profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. 
We're well positioned for continued success as we have the broad support from our clients and brokers. 
I'll now turn it back to David."

The most important thing that I would emphasize is that the -- that we have always emphasized the effects of the transaction in terms of loss business as a discrete category. In other words, where we were focused is, was there a market reaction that took business away from us. In other words, somebody feeling that because there was a Catlin line and an XL line previously, that they couldn't support the combination of lines on an account; or someone feeling that because of the transaction, that we were somehow going to become inwardly focused and, therefore, not someone they want to trade with during a period of consolidation and integration. Those were the kinds of things we were worried about. And overwhelmingly, and we really knew this and have expressed it to you repeatedly, by the middle of last year, we knew that the market reaction was actually quite positive and going to give us more opportunities, not declining opportunities. And we have continued to monitor that, as Greg just mentioned. It's still true that less than 1% of the premiums in Reinsurance had any effect because of the transaction as was just defined. And I think it'll go slightly over 1% because of one program that comes out this year, but it'll be right around 1% in Insurance as well. So to me, that is a fantastic endorsement by the market of the combination. That is not the same -- and we've been very specific about that -- this throughout last half of last year. That is not the same as saying, ""And we will keep all of the business at any cost."" We have continued to focus on bottom line underwriting. And I've mentioned many times that by the middle of last year, we knew very well the book was going to stick together, and people were enthusiastic for the combination. And we gave our underwriters, at that point, our usual instruction. The job is to underwrite what we think is reasonably priced business under appropriate terms and conditions. If we can't find it, we won't write it. We also made sure that our underwriters knew they had permission as they came to know the books better, which they did through the year, to take larger actions if they felt profitability warranted it. So we have come off some program business. For example, we have off the -- we've shuttered some operations that we simply didn't have -- we didn't think had the future earnings potential. And that is what you're hearing about when we mention the re-underwriting activities. All of that shows up in the way -- particularly in Insurance, the first quarter net earned premium works out. Although, there, you have to add in the impacts that Paul mentioned about the reinsurance programs being in-flight in terms of ceded readjustments. So this quarter overstates those impacts, but those impacts are in there as well. In terms of going forward, having started this re-underwriting back in kind of the middle of last year, and seeing it now more fully in swing as we went through the planning process and are executing, we, in fact, believe that, that will be a contributor to being able to expand margins because we believe that's exactly the kinds of actions that are necessary to lower the loss ratio and, of course, as Pete mentioned, we are well on track -- ahead, in fact, of the timing on seeing the expense reductions come through. And with those 2 categories in decline and with the acquisition ratio increase, that's the -- that's what we have to solve for to expand margins. But those have to all add up to -- in the end -- or lower combined, and we're still on track to do so. In fact, in this quarter, if you took out the one-time noise that was mentioned by Paul on the acquisition ratio, we would have nearly done so just in this quarter alone. Nevermind that we know the benefits of those re-underwriting actions and the benefits of the expense ratio should show up more prominently in the back half of the year. Now I want to caution, though, on that. We are in a very difficult pricing environment, more difficult, certainly, than we anticipated. And certainly, every call I have listened to or read the transcript of this quarter, emphasizes the same realization. That will make it more difficult over time to show the margin expansion we planned, but it doesn't mean that we give up or think it's impossible. We certainly have the expense piece in the right place, and this quarter, at least, is a good indicator on the loss ratio as well. So with all of that said, and with capital actions that we've talked about, do I think it means that in the reasonable future, we can't deliver a double-digit ROE? No. I still believe that in the reasonable future, that we have the tools to get there. These conditions just make it more difficult. But no, by no means have we walked away from that goal or the belief that, that is plausible in the reasonable term."

Clearly, we're just -- we and our clients have just getting going on the loss-adjusting process. Japan has an added complexity because of the nature of the policies. The personalized policies respond to a percentage of damage, rather than a dollar loss amount. The commercial policies don't have a uniform approach to business interruption. And so there's a lot at play there that makes it very difficult to get through a precise number quickly. But certainly, as we've looked at the exposure, we're not concerned by what we see as -- on our books in Japan. Equity would be much less. It's a lower industry loss, and so lower penetration for us. I guess, the third piece of activity would be on the Texas or Midwest storms that have been going on. They're likely to impact something. But generally, on a lot of the coverage if you're on the large nationals, you're going to see it be well within the retentions of our customers. So I don't have anything definitive to report, but so far, what we see doesn't concern me."

But when you're concentrated in those and they're in the toughest pricing environment, many of us can remember, you're going to have difficulty getting to your target combined ratio. But that doesn't mean that over time, you aren't making progress as we are right now, and it doesn't mean that you can't get to those in more appropriate markets. But these markets are making it very, very difficult to make progress. We believe -- as I said, we believe we can, and we're continuing to do the things that are necessary. But at the same time, getting to a 90 ex -- and then with PYD right now, this is darn tough. We're moving toward it, but it's going to be tough until these markets improve somehow."

And so I see the progress as meaningful. I do give you the caution that these markets are making it much more difficult, but I would encourage -- when your focus is on the loss ratio as one of the metrics that we've got to sell for, I'd break them up and think about it in that way.

The first thing we're thinking about is can we -- what are our plans for premium and how are they jiving with what is available to write at a reasonable rate. And at the start of the year, when we were back in planning, as you're going back into last year, we were not expecting the level of deterioration and intensifying competition that we're seeing. So we would have expected to be able to write a bit more of top line. In fact, Paul referenced as well when he talked about the fact that we're seeing a lot of dislocation, there's not much that's coming at us with terms and conditions that we would be interested in writing. Whether that will change or not, it's very hard to say because we're fairly early in those processes. So the first thing we realize is we're not going to have -- we're not going to be able, through our organic writings, to put as much to work of the capital as we have thought. That's the first place you go to. The second place then you go to is, is there any other way we can put that money to work for our shareholders. And then finding none, we've always believed that then if we can't put it to good work and it's not necessary for our buffer, then we should do our best to give it back to shareholders. And then, of course, you also look at the raw economics of such a decision, how do we view and where we're trading and what does that tell us about the economics of buybacks. So you take that all equation together, and as we looked at all of those factors, we said this is -- in fact, not only does it indicate we'll need less to hold less capital for the year relative to our buffers and relative to our planned writings. And not only did we find where we were trading attractive relative to our intangible book value but -- our book value. Not only all those things were true, but we just said, gee, we should do it in the first part of the year rather than just spreading it across the year and then react to market conditions later. So kind of as a baseline, you should forecast 4 equal installments of the 700. But then we've decided in the first half of the year that to go after 250 million more, giving you a total for the year of 950 million, and as I said, we'll continue to evaluate our needs and market conditions and these trends, and whether we'll do more or not is for future decisions."

We continue to see the expense ratio dropping, and we expect it to continue to drop. We continue to see the loss ratio dropping, and we believe -- though I've been cautious to note the conditions out there, but we believe and have shown in this quarter that we can continue to bring it down. We think, in this quarter, we show, as we've seen a couple of times in recent quarters, some unusual activity that is onetime and related to the way that books are coming together. But it's the way we're putting our ceded re program together, which we believe will be meaningfully beneficial over the course of the year, but it did have some unusual effects in the period. So when we back out those unusual effects and we look at the progress that we're making, we add all that up and say we believe we can get to the levels of return that we have planned. And there's nothing that has happened outside of market conditions being more difficult that has shaken us from that belief. That could change the pace some. It could change how you have to drive it some. But it doesn't change our fundamental belief that we can get this company to those kinds of results. And I'll just point out, across Reinsurance and Specialty, we're certainly in incredibly difficult conditions. And if we're able to produce these results with all that noise in this period, I like our chances as we get further into the year. But a lot of that will depend on things beyond our control, but the things we're controlling, we're pleased with the job we're doing. So that's what I'm talking about, Ian. And that continues to please me, and I'm particularly pleased that our underwriters have kept their wits about them in an environment like this. Where conditions are very difficult, you always worry about underwriters on the frontline who will respond to the challenging conditions they face. And I'm simply very pleased with the quality of our underwriting behavior and the way in which that will produce results now and well into the future. And we certainly see organizations or underwriters are not maintaining that discipline. And while that makes it challenging for now, that makes our relative performance position all that much better over time."

And so when I look at it right now, right, to be honest, we're past the 300 right. And so we can get more granular on the synergies. Maybe we need another conversation about expense levels and where they can go, but I think that actually might be a more fruitful conversation than a focus on the synergies. I got -- when you run the numbers -- and this is not a surprise to anybody because of where you all think we're going to come out on expenses, right. Everyone has modeled more than 300 already in there."

It will be no surprise to you that our view is consistent with what you've already been hearing from others during this quarter: That market headwinds are very tough. But as we'll discuss tonight our results -- in our results, we think you can see many indicators of a well-managed book, and at the same time, a few one-off impacts related to the continuing fine-tuning of some of our processes in underwriting following the Catlin acquisition, particularly, now our ceded re programs. So I'm going to walk through our results and a few of these highlights and impacts, and then, we also want to give you a little bit more help, and in a break with our normal tradition, a little guidance on 2 specific areas: the insurance acquisition expense ratio, and the split between Insurance and Reinsurance, now that we have nearly 12 months of XL Catlin results to point to. And then, of course, I'll turn it over to Pete for some additional financial information, and to Paul and Greg to discuss the segment results in greater detail. 
Looking at our results from the top of the house. In this quarter, we produced a P&C combined ratio of 92.5%, gross premiums written of $4.4 billion, and an underwriting profit of $175 million. Our operating net income for the quarter of $103 million was impacted by $55 million of transaction-related integration costs and a higher level of cats in the quarter at $53 million in this first quarter versus $15 million in the first quarter of 2015. We also considered -- continued to see impacts from the financial markets in our affiliate income, with $8 million of earnings in this quarter compared with $58 million in the first quarter of 2015. Now that is a portfolio that has served us really well over time, and we think it will do so again in the future. Obviously, it is a difficult time for the hedge funds right now. Prior year releases in the quarter were $43 million versus $48 million in the first quarter of 2015. As a reminder, we conduct a full review of our reserves in the second and fourth quarters. 
In terms of the segments results, we continue to look for pockets of opportunity amid the tough pricing environment. Reinsuring saw some new business opportunities, which Greg will discuss, and produced a solid combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119 million. 
In Insurance, the ongoing fine-tuning and hard work came through once again in the accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 61.2%. As you know, this has been an area of focus for us, and we are pleased to see this metric continue to improve now for 3 consecutive quarters. And it again points to the determination to focus on the bottom line fundamentals amidst all the difficulties of the current market conditions. 
Paul will have further detail regarding the Insurance segment in his results -- in his remarks. 
Now I said that there were one-off and unique items impacting these results, particularly in Insurance, including higher acquisition costs, due in part to the timing and mix of our ceded re programs. And here, as I said, for one time, I'm going to give you some forward-looking items. As these acquisition expenses even out through the rest of the year, we expect that the Insurance segment acquisition expense ratio should move back in line with what we saw in the second half of 2015. And then to the second bit of guidance I mentioned. We realize that this overall challenging rate environment as well as the transaction effects themselves haven't made it easy for you to model certain things like the Insurance and Reinsurance business split for net earned premium. We have now reported, of course, 11 months as a combined company. When you add in April of last year and include the Catlin results for that period, you have a trailing 12-month split of between 68% and 69% for Insurance, with the balance being Reinsurance. And that would be the gauge I would look to use looking forward for the full year. 
So stepping back, how should you think about XL Catlin in this current market? This is a question, obviously, we've been asking our leaders, broker partners and clients quite a bit as well. And the challenge of the market means that the actual reception XL Catlin receives from brokers and clients is not yet fully showing up in the numbers. But the fundamentals we intended to deliver through the transaction continued to be very strong. 
First, I've already mentioned our continued loss ratio progress in Insurance. 
Second, we are ahead of the transaction-related synergy savings targets. And as you'll recall, in the previous quarter, we increased our expected run rate synergy savings to $300 million. Further, the P&C expense ratio for the quarter decreased to 16.6% in Q1 versus the 19.1% in the prior year quarter. And that is actually the lowest this metric has been in 8 quarters. And as we've said, we're working toward greater efficiency, and we're ready to pull the expense level further if and when it should prove necessary. 
Third, this transaction was based on combining 2 underwriting-centric cultures, and we are insisting on fundamental bottom line-focused behavior. And when you tell underwriters to do what's right for the bottom line in a difficult rate environment like this, you will get less premium. It's that simple. But we like the discipline, we like the focus, and we like what our combined teams have been able to do so far, whether it's in fine-tuning their books and exiting some underperforming lines; or simply walking away from new opportunities where we don't see the margins. Yes, we want them out there seeking new opportunities. And we see an amazing flow of opportunities, just not willing -- not -- just not many that we're willing to write at these prices. 
Fourth, we've maintained the ability to manage our capital. Based on what we told you previously, you should have expected around $700 million in buybacks for the year. Then seeing our premium trends in this quarter, combined with our comfort in our capital position, led us to -- during the quarter to add $250 million in buybacks to the plan. With this additional $250 million, we got through buying back about $180 million in quarter 1. We expect to finish the balance of that additional $250 million in buybacks as well as the planned amount towards the original $700 million in the next quarter. 
So to be very clear, as of right now, around $950 million is what you should expect for the year for buybacks. Of course, we'll continue to evaluate this as the trends emerge. 
So all in, the company's producing good results, and the reaction from clients and brokers continues to be enormously positive. And I certainly know you have good networks to check me out on this. 
The recent RIMS concert -- conference was simply a resounding success for our firm. We are producing on the new opportunities, as we intended, but we will not chase top line. This isn't the market for it. We're only going to write when we see the margin. And we will make the tough decisions to stay disciplined, exit lines where we don't see future potential, and plan for these difficult markets to continue, even though, in the end, of course, they are unsustainable. And when there is a turn, we intend to be the best-positioned firm in the marketplace. We're seeing that come true, and we're looking forward to that inevitable time. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."
406440,330471289,965323,"XL Group plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Well, thanks, Mike, and good evening.

Operating net income for the first quarter was $103 million or $0.35 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $194 million in 2015 or $0.75 per share. As we've previously disclosed, during the first quarter, we incurred $55 million in integration costs, which have been included in operating income. 
Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $22 million or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $36 million or $0.14 per share for the same quarter in 2015. As we have previously noted, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that trend to the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 Life reinsurance sale transaction. 
We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. As always, it has no impact on comprehensive income or operating results. 
Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 92.5% or 3.6 points higher than the same quarter last year. Our property and casualty combined ratio, excluding prior year development and the impact of natural catastrophes for the quarter was 92.1%, 0.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015. 
Our natural catastrophe losses totaled $53 million or 2.2 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $15 million or 1.1 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. 
Prior year development was a positive $43 million or 1.8 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $48 million and 3.7 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $11 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $32 million in the Reinsurance segment. 
As we have discussed in previous calls, during the first and third quarters, our reserving process is based on our review of actual versus expected losses. Our semi-annual full actuarial review will be included in our results next quarter, and we intend to provide our global loss triangles later this quarter. These will be our first as a combined company. 
And Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail. 
Operating expenses have decreased in the quarter as we have made material progress achieving synergies from the transaction. We continue to view the overall relationship between the one-time cost to achieve integration and the ongoing synergies to be approximately 1.25:1. We expect that additional synergies will exceed normal cost expense growth to improve our overall operational leverage, and this is already coming through our results, as our P&C operating expense ratios have decreased by 2.4 points from the first quarter of 2015. 
Total combined operating expenses, excluding integration costs, are already more than 10% lower than at the time of the acquisition. 
Our first quarter operating tax rate was approximately 11%, with certain taxes on nonoperating mark-to-market items driving the higher tax rate on net income. We still expect our overall operating tax rate to be in the 10% to 12% range. 
Turning to the investment portfolio. Reflecting the addition of the Catlin portfolio, net investment income, excluding the Life Funds Withheld Assets was $164 million, up $6 million. The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of March was 2.4%. 
Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.6 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. 
During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7%. 
Total affiliate income was $8 million for the quarter compared to $58 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to our investment fund affiliates, where equity and credit market volatility impacted returns, and our hedge fund affiliate portfolio was not immune. 
Despite these disappointing absolute returns, our hedge fund portfolio continues to significantly outperform its benchmark, and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves the risk-adjusted returns we earn on the overall portfolio. 
Our strategic and other operating affiliates earned $13 million compared to $23 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the sale of ARX Holdings in the second quarter of 2015. 
Net realized losses, excluding derivatives, were $8 million for the quarter, down $13 million from the prior year. Our unrealized gain position, including other investments, increased by $417 million during the quarter, driven primarily by rate decreases in our major jurisdictions. 
Unrealized net gains were $939 million at the end of the quarter, including other investments. 
On a performance basis, the total return on investments was 1.7% for the quarter, excluding foreign exchange. The duration of the total portfolio was consistent at 3.2 years. 
Now with respect to capital management, under the share buyback program approved by our Board of Directors at our August meeting, we purchased just under 10 million shares for $355 million at an average price of $35.69 per share, leaving $348 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. 
As Mike noted, we increased our level of share buybacks in the first quarter with the goal of adding $250 million of additional purchases over our typical pace in the first quarter. 
Given the combination of the limited time with the open trading window and relatively low volumes of market trading in March, we completed only $180 million through March 31, and we expect to complete these purchases during our next open trading window. 
We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool, and we'll return capital when we believe it appropriate. We also remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years. 
I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."

I'll cover the results for the segment, but would firstly like to share some thoughts on current market conditions. The headwinds were strengthened throughout 2015 have continued, with pricing being negative across most lines of business, with the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter. Overall, our casualty lines were flat, professional businesses were down 1%. Our specialty business was down 2%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation and crisis management lines. And our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%. 
This negative environment has had an impact on top line, but our underwriters are under clear instructions to preserve margins and sacrifice top line if terms don't meet our requirements. 
We have also chosen to exit certain underperforming books, which in aggregate, reduced top line by approximately $70 million in the quarter. 
Against this backdrop, I'm pleased to report that we have continued our trend of profitable quarters dating back to quarter 1 2013, with the segment producing a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.5% compared to 94.1% in quarter 1 2015 and 98.2% last quarter. 
Higher cat experience of $35 million compared to $15 million in the quarter 1 2015 contributed to 1/3 of the deterioration, with the majority of the balance due to the higher acquisition expenses, largely offset by improvement in our operating expense and accident year, ex cat loss ratios. 
Prior year reserve releases of $11 million, or 0.7 points, was consistent with prior year quarter. 
On an accident quarter, ex cat basis, the combined ratio was 95% compared to 93.2% in quarter 1 2015 and 95.7% last quarter. 
For Q1, we reported an acquisition ratio of 14.1% compared to 8.4% in Q1 2015 and 13.9% reported last quarter. The majority of this increase is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business, where the gross acquisition costs are higher and the loss ratios are lower than the legacy XL business. The remaining difference is largely driven by higher quota share sessions in Q1 2015 on the legacy XL book, which generated additional ceding commissions reducing the net acquisition ratio. 
Looking forward, we expect this ratio to reduce modestly to be more in line with our experience in Q3 and Q4 2015, as changes in our reinsurance strategy are fully implemented. 
This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a lower Q1 operating expense ratio of 19.7%, which was 1.9 points lower than Q1 2015, and by a lower net accident year ex cat loss ratio of 61.2%, which was 2 points lower than Q1 2015. 
Insurance gross premiums written in Q1 increased by 51% or $849 million year-over-year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all 4 of our underwriting divisions. 
When we look at both legacy organizations and normalize the foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was flat in Q1. However, when you also consider the portfolio-tuning activities that started in 2015, where as mentioned previously, decisions were made to exit certain underperforming books, we would see growth in the 3% to 4% range. This underlying growth demonstrates that while the market is difficult, it is not entirely bereft of opportunity. And while we consider that the dislocation experienced by some competitors should have a positive impact on rate and terms, we saw little evidence of this in the first quarter. 
Our underwriters will continue to monitor the market closely, and given our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction, we are well positioned to execute profitable opportunities when they arise, be that next quarter or next year. 
This expectation is further underpinned as the market response to XL Catlin continues to be very favorable, as was evidenced repeatedly at this month's 26 RIMS -- 2016 RIMS conference, as both current and prospective clients were interested in hearing how we could help. 
For the Insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $1 billion. The ceded premium written line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance program and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing as we move towards a more integrated enterprise-wide reinsurance program. 
In Q1, approximately $100 million of ceded premium written came solely from timing differences. These included consolidation alignment of the group catastrophe covers at 1/1, bringing forward our Q3 international casualty renewal and placing the Galileo cat bond, which provides cover for 3 years. 
Adjusting for these timing differences, the Insurance segment spend as a proportion of GPW in Q1 2016, was 35.9%, roughly 4.1% less than for the combination of the individual companies in Q1 2015. 
While the 35.9% is slightly higher than the 34.3% reported in Q1 2015 for legacy XL, we expect this to reduce as the full year unfolds and we fully transition to our integrated reinsurance program, the benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the group's risk return profile and strong coordination across our wider capital strategy. 
As Mike has mentioned, it is essential to react to the top line challenges by carefully managing expenses, and we have developed further plans to improve efficiencies during 2016. We began executing these plans in the quarter by selectively exiting 35 positions, as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across divisions and regions. 
While the expense savings from these actions are not reflected in the quarter, they will begin flowing through in subsequent quarters, along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway. 
In summary, we have taken the correct action in response to a difficult market, and we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, continued to grow the book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiative. And we fully expect this to continue, margin expansion remains our first priority. 
And now to Greg to discuss Reinsurance results."

Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with the calendar quarter combined ratio of",619,"Thanks, Paul. Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119 million compared with 74.7% and $90 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year. Results for the quarter continued to benefit from favorable prior year development, lower accident year ex cat loss ratio, and modest catastrophe losses, although to a lesser extent than the prior year. 
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $32 million compared to $42 million a year ago, lowering the combined ratio by 4.3 and 11.9 points, respectively. In the current quarter, the releases were primarily in the property classes, and reflect our harmonized reserve process. 
Further, our actual-versus-expected analysis continued to be positive, and indicative of a strong reserve position going forward. 
The Reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 52.3%, which compares to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by favorable attritional loss activity in our property treaty business and the impact of a change in business mix resulting from the Catlin acquisition. 
The expense ratio increased 1.9 points to 33.8% in the first quarter compared to 31.9% for the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a purchase accounting adjustment of $7 million or 0.9 points, and higher ceding commissions due to the competitive pricing environment, particularly in our short-tail classes. 
Catastrophe losses totaled $17 million, net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter, compared to no catastrophe losses in the first quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter related to the Taiwan earthquake and impacted our property catastrophe and property treaty lines of business. 
Turning to the top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $1.86 billion, up from $826 million in the first quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. We continue to see very little loss business as a result of the transaction. Again, running at less than 1%. 
In fact, brokers and clients have been very supportive of XL Catlin Re, and we're seeing significant new business opportunities as we generated $240 million of new business during the first quarter of 2016. This was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we nonrenewed $150 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms and conditions. 
On a combined XL Catlin view, after adjusting for foreign exchange, the segment top line was flat in the quarter. 
Turning to Reinsurance market conditions. We found the environment to be challenging, with rate decreases continuing to decelerate in most classes and regions. During the quarter, rates for the segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 6% and at a lower rate of change than the prior year. 
On the remainder of the property treaty portfolio, rates were down 3%, and ceding commissions on pro rata treaties increased slightly. 
Our casualty portfolio renewed essentially flat over last year. And the remainder of our classes were flat to down low single digits. 
Having just completed the recent April 1 renewals, rates in Japan were down 7.5% for property catastrophe covers. We observed an increase in client demand, and we're able to grow our portfolio at this renewal. 
In summary, the first quarter results were solid for the Reinsurance segment. Despite difficult market conditions, our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job, retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. 
We're well positioned for continued success as we have the broad support from our clients and brokers. 
I'll now turn it back to David."

The most important thing that I would emphasize is that the -- that we have always emphasized the effects of the transaction in terms of loss business as a discrete category. In other words, where we were focused is, was there a market reaction that took business away from us? In other words, somebody feeling that because there was a Catlin line and an XL line previously, that they couldn't support the combination of lines on an account; or someone feeling that because of the transaction, that we were somehow going to become inwardly focused, and therefore, not someone they want to trade with during a period of consolidation and integration. Those were the kinds of things we were worried about. And overwhelmingly, and we really knew this and have expressed it to you repeatedly, by the middle of last year, we knew that the market reaction was actually quite positive and going to give us more opportunities, not declining opportunities. And we have continued to monitor that, as Greg just mentioned. It's still true that less than 1% of the premiums in Reinsurance had any effect because of the transaction, as was just defined. And I think it'll go slightly over 1% because of one program that comes off year, but it'll be right around 1% in Insurance as well. So to me, that is a fantastic endorsement by the market of the combination. That is not the same -- and we've been very specific about that -- this throughout last half of last year, that is not the same as saying, ""And we will keep all of the business at any cost."" We have continued to focus on bottom line underwriting. And I've mentioned many times that by the middle of last year, we knew very well the book was going to stick together, and people were enthusiastic for the combination. And we gave our underwriters, at that point, our usual instruction. The job is to underwrite what we think is reasonably priced business under appropriate terms and conditions. If we can't find it, we won't write it. We also made sure that our underwriters knew they had permission as they came to know the books better, which they did through the year, to take larger actions if they felt profitability warranted it. So we have come off some program business. For example, we have come off the -- we've shuttered some operations that we simply didn't have -- we didn't think had the future earnings potential. And that is what you're hearing about when we mention the re-underwriting activities. All of that shows up in the way -- particularly in Insurance, the first quarter net earned premium works out. Although there, you have to add in the impacts that Paul mentioned about the reinsurance programs being in-flight in terms of ceded readjustments. So this quarter overstates those impacts, but those impacts are in there as well. 
In terms of going forward, having started this re-underwriting back in kind of the middle of last year, and seeing it now more fully in swing as we went through the planning process and are executing, we, in fact, believe that, that will be a contributor to being able to expand margins because we believe that's exactly the kinds of actions that are necessary to lower the loss ratio, and of course, as Pete mentioned, we are well on track -- ahead, in fact, of the timing on seeing the expense reductions come through. And with those 2 categories in decline and with the acquisition ratio increased, that's the -- that's what we have to solve for to expand margins. But those have to all add up to in the end a lower combined, and we're still on track to do so. In fact, in this quarter, if you took out the one-time noise that was mentioned by Paul on the acquisition ratio, we would have nearly done so just in this quarter alone. Never mind that we know the benefits of those re-underwriting actions and the benefits of the expense ratio should show up more prominently in the back half of the year. Now I want to caution, though, on that. We are in a very difficult pricing environment, more difficult, certainly, than we anticipated. And certainly, every call I have listened to or read the transcript of this quarter, emphasizes the same realization. That will make it more difficult over time to show the margin expansion we planned, but it doesn't mean that we give up or think it's impossible. We certainly have the expense piece in the right place, and this quarter, at least, is a good indicator on the loss ratio as well. So with all of that said, and with capital actions that we've talked about, do I think it means that in the reasonable future, we can't deliver a double-digit ROE? No, I still believe that in the reasonable future, that we have the tools to get there. These conditions just make it more difficult. But no, by no means have we walked away from that goal or the belief that, that is plausible in the reasonable term."

But certainly, as we've looked at the exposure, we're not concerned by what we see as -- on our books in Japan. Ecuador would be much less, it's a lower industry loss, it's a lower penetration for us. I guess the third piece of activity would be on the Texas or Midwest storms that have been going on.

The first thing we're thinking about is can we -- what are our plans for premium and how are they jiving with what is available to write at a reasonable rate. And at the start of the year, when we were back in planning, as you're going back into last year, we were not expecting the level of deterioration and intensifying of competition that we're seeing. So we would have expected to be able to write a bit more the top line. In fact, Paul referenced it well when he talked about the fact that we're seeing a lot of dislocation, there's not much that's coming at us with terms and conditions that we would be interested in writing. Whether that will change or not, it's very hard to say because we're fairly early in those processes. So the first thing to realize is we're not going to have -- we're not going to be able, through our organic writings, to put as much to work of the capital as we have thought. That's the first place you go to. The second place then you go to is, is there any other way we can put that money to work for our shareholders. And then finding none, we've always believed that then if we can't put it to good work and it's not necessary for our buffer, then we should do our best to give it back to shareholders. And then, of course, you also look at the raw economics of such a decision, how do we view where we're trading and what does that tell us about the economics of buybacks. So you take that whole equation together, and as we looked at all of those factors, we said this is -- this is in fact, not only does it indicate we'll need less, to hold less capital for the year relative to our buffers and relative to our planned writings. And not only did we find where we were trading attractive relative to our intangible book value but -- and our book value. Not only all those things were true, but we just said, gee, we should do it in the first part of the year rather than just spreading it across the year and then react to market conditions later. So kind of as a baseline, you should forecast 4 equal installments of the $700 million. But then we've decided in the first half of the year to go after $250 million more, giving you a total for the year of $950 million, and as I said, we'll continue to evaluate our needs and market conditions and these trends, and whether we'll do more or not is for future decisions."

And it wasn't just affiliates or the acquisition costs, the core loss ratio was also below Street and some of the other items as well. And when I look at the 12 months, the first -- basically the combined ratio since the deal happened, it's around 93, and that's with low cats. And maybe if I normalize that, it's more in the mid-90s, and to get to a double-digit ROE, you need to get closer to 90. So can you help us understand how we're getting those high points? Because I think the reason this question keeps coming up is a lot of people are struggling to see how the improvement comes given the pace, I think, has been slower than people anticipated."

We continue to see the expense ratio dropping, and we expect it to continue to drop. We continue to see the loss ratio dropping, and we believe -- though I've been cautious to note the conditions out there, but we believe and have shown in this quarter that we can continue to bring it down. We think, in this quarter, we show, as we've seen a couple of times in recent quarters, some unusual activity that is onetime and related to the way the books are coming together. Whether it's the way we're putting our ceded re program together, which we believe will be meaningfully beneficial over the course of the year, but it did have some unusual effects in the period. So when we back out those unusual effects and we look at the progress that we're making, we add all that up and say we believe we can get to the levels of return that we have planned. And there's nothing that has happened outside of market conditions being more difficult that has shaken us from that belief. That could change the pace some. It could change how you have to drive it some. But it doesn't change our fundamental belief that we can get this company to those kinds of results. And I'll just point out, across Reinsurance and specialty, we're certainly in incredibly difficult conditions. And if we're able to produce these results with all that noise in this period, I like our chances as we get further into the year. But a lot of that will depend on things beyond our control, but the things we're controlling, we're very pleased with the job we're doing. So that's what I'm talking about, Ian. And that continues to please me, and I'm particularly pleased that our underwriters have kept their wits about them. In an environment like this, where conditions are very difficult, you always worry about how underwriters on the frontline will respond to the challenging conditions they face. And I'm simply very pleased with the quality of our underwriting behavior and the way in which that will produce results now and well into the future. And we certainly see organizations where underwriters are not maintaining their discipline. And while that makes it challenging for now, that makes our relative performance position all that much better over time."

It's just -- it's very hard to model still, even at year-end and to really be able to sort of assess where you are versus where you started, right. We've seen the expense synergy goal go up, which is a positive, but you know what I mean, we can't really see evidence of that in the income statement per se, because there are so many other adjustments.

Now we have a little bit of FX benefit there, which is way more than offset by what you would have had for expected wage inflation over that period. And so when I look at it right now, right, to be honest, we're past the 300, right. And so we can get more granular on the synergies. Maybe we need another conversation about expense levels and where they can go, but I think that actually might be a more fruitful conversation than a focus on the synergies. I got -- when you run the numbers, and this is not a surprise to anybody, because of where you all think we're going to come out on expenses, right.

Tonight, as is our normal practice, I'll share some highlights for the quarter and the results, Pete will discuss the financials, and then Greg and Paul will go through the Insurance and reinsurance segmen",787,"Good evening, and thank you for joining our call. Tonight, as is our normal practice, I'll share some highlights for the quarter and the results, Pete will discuss the financials, and then Greg and Paul will go through the Insurance and reinsurance segments, retrospectively.
Turning to our results. The most notable aspect of the quarter as it has been through the entire sector, was the high level of catastrophes. We preannounced our losses of $240 million due to these events back on July 13. The major sources of loss was the wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta; the earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador; and U.S. and European storms. These events reduced our second quarter operating earnings by $0.84 per share, $0.84 per share. As you will hear in greater detail from Greg and from Paul, these losses were in line with our expectations and in line with or below our market share and it is noteworthy that both segments turned to profit despite these losses.
Turning then to our underlying performance in the quarter. We would say simply this is more like it. The quarter was largely free of distortions related to the Catlin acquisition and many of the metrics suggest that we have taken an important step forward in the right direction. Despite the cat events and including $52 million of integration cost in the second quarter, XL Catlin generated $0.37 in operating earnings per share and grew fully diluted tangible book value per share by 3.6%. XL Catlin's ex-accident year P&C combined ratio of 90.3% was an improvement of 1.8 points from the first quarter of the year and 2 points from the second quarter a year ago. These improvements came from both operating and underwriting discipline.
Let me focus briefly on underwriting discipline. You've heard us often comment that we believe that this combination of XL and Catlin has really changed our relationship to the market. We know that the way clients and brokers think about us is truly different. And as a result, we have been given the opportunity to write things that neither XL nor Catlin would have seen before. And what we're seeing now is the effect of these new opportunities and the effect of our discipline come together. You'll hear in a moment from Paul that when you take out programs we're exiting, the growth rate in Insurance was actually about 5%. So why would we be having that success?
Well, submission volume is up from our top broker partners, and we are quoting a commensurate more amount. But our hit ratio, the amount that we actually write when we quote, has stayed flat. Meaning we're finding about the same portion that we are willing to write on our conditions but we're getting a greater volume to select from. This gives me comfort that we are not just business as does our system of back-checking price adequacy. This is a hallmark of underwriting discipline, and while this progress has been building quarter-over-quarter, it is exactly this kind of thing that we believe we should be able to continue to produce, even accelerate, as our underwriting teams are really hitting their strides. We are very proud of the hard work of our underwriters and their support teams in these difficult market conditions.
Before I turn it over to be to discuss our financial report results, I'll make 2 brief comments on other important topics that I'm sure on your minds. First is Brexit. We believe we are well-prepared -- as well-prepared as possible for this outcome that we have thought about the future possibilities and we're in a great position to respond accordingly to whatever develops.
Second, our parent company move to Bermuda, which was completed as of Monday. Bermuda has served as a base for global Insurance and reinsurance providers for decades, and has, in the Bermuda monetary authority, a proven world-class regulator. XL has had substantial operations in Bermuda for 30 years. And, of course, it was the corporate home for Catlin before our companies joined.  So our integration, combined with the Bermuda receding full Solvency II equivalents early this year, made this a very logical move which we think will serve the company well. We are pleased to be there.  It is worth noting from a day per day perspective, our clients, brokers, counterparties and partners should see no change in how we work with them. And as we said before, we expect no material impact to our future results or global effective tax rate as a result of this move.
So in sum, positive progress showed in the numbers in the second quarter. We have determined that it will continue. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."

Operating net income for the second quarter was $106 million or $0.37 per share on a fully dilute basis compared to $246 million or $0.84 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included 2 months of the legacy Catlin operations. As indicated on our July 13 8-K, our natural catastrophe losses for the second quarter totaled $240 million compared to $60 million in the prior year quarter. The largest of these events: the wildfires in and around Fort McMurray, accounted for approximately half of our estimate of catastrophe losses for the quarter. During the second quarter, we incurred $52 million in integration costs which are included in our operating income.
For the quarter, our property and casualty combined ratio was 96%, was 6.1 points higher than the same quarter last year, again primarily driven by those catastrophe losses. As Mike noted, our ex-CAT accident year combined ratio was 90.3%, or 2 points better than the preceding period last year. Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As discussed on previous calls, the second and fourth quarters are significant reserve valuation quarters. And as a result, we react appropriately to any development indications identified during those in-depth reviews. Prior year net development in the second quarter was a favorable $99 million or 3.9 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $109 million or 5.3 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $34 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $65 million in the Reinsurance segment.
Operating expenses have remained generally flat compared to the first quarter of this year and slightly higher than the second quarter of 2015 due to legacy Catlin was being included only from May 2015 onwards. We continue to be view full year over expense levels and integration expense levels as in line with the estimates provided in our 8-K filed in June.
Our estimated operating tax rate to ordinary shareholders remains consistent with the 10% to 12% we noted in April, with adjustments to the prior year tax revisions lowering the 6-month rate to 8.8%. Our annualized operating ROE, excluding integration cost and AOCI, was 5.7% for the 6-month ended June 30, 2016, and was significantly impacted by the catastrophe losses in the second quarter.
Turning to the investment portfolio, and as usual, my comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income was $176 million, in line with the same quarter last year and greater than the $164 million in the previous quarter. While the low interest rate environment continue to pressure net investment income, the second quarter benefited to a modest extent from some nonrecurring factors including certain amortization adjustments. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we have approximately $3.1 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the second quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7%.
The gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio at the end of June was 2.3%, virtually unchanged from the first quarter. The duration of the fixed income and cash portfolio was 3.3 years at the end of the quarter, marginally higher than the prior year quarter mainly due to cash being put to work. Total affiliate income was $35 million for the quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter. While our hedge fund affiliate portfolio broke even in the quarter, it did not meet its benchmarks. Many of our our funds pursuing quantitative equity strategies were challenged and several of our directional equity funds did not fully capture the market rally. On a year-to-date basis, our hedge fund portfolio continues to outperform its benchmark and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns.
Our private equity, strategic and other operating affiliates posted relatively strong equity earnings. Our investment manager affiliates contributed $15 million to affiliate income, with the gain on the sale of an individual position being an important contributor. Unrealized net gains of $1.14 billion at the end of the quarter. The total mark-to-market return on investments was 1.5% for the quarter in original currency.
Favorable returns driven by lower rates, which more than offset the adverse impact of credit spread widening. Looking forward, we expect financial markets to remain volatile over the near to midterm, and we will continue to monitor our portfolios closely as a result.
And with respect to capital management, we continue to execute share buybacks during the second quarter. Our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback program at our May meeting, authorizing the purchase of up to $1 billion of ordinary shares, replacing the remaining amount under our previous share buyback authorization. During the quarter, we purchased 9.7 million shares for $328 million at an average price of $34 per share, leaving $860 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. This accelerated rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April, as well as a slight acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.
I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."

I am pleased to report our 14th consecutive quarter o",841,"Thanks, Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management.
First, the results. I am pleased to report our 14th consecutive quarter of profitability dating back to Q1 2013 despite higher cat activity we experienced during the quarter. This segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.4% compared to 97% in Q2 2015 and 96.5% last quarter. Higher cat expense of $97 million compared to $60 million in Q2 2015, and slightly lower prior year reserve releases or $34 million compared to $38 million last year are more than offset by material improvements in the underwriting expense ratio of 1.8 points and the accident year ex cat loss ratio of 1.1 points. On an accident quarter ex cat basis, the combined ratio was 92.6% compared to 95.4% in Q2 2015 and 95% last quarter.
For Q2, we report an acquisition ratio of 13.7% compared to 12.9% in Q2 2015 and 14.1% reported last quarter. This is more in line with the guidance provided last quarter. The reason for the slight increase in the prior year is because Q2 2015 only reflected 2 months of the Catlin business, which included the largest share of wholesale specialty business, with the gross acquisition costs are higher and the loss ratio is lower than the legacy XL business. This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a Q2 operating expense ratio of 18.1%, which was 2.6 points lower than Q2 2015 and by a net accident year ex cat loss ratio of 60.8%, which is 1.1 points lower than Q2 2015.
Pricing has remained broadly consistent at minus 3% in the quarter. Our casualty lines shared flat pricing the quarter, our Professional and specialty business were both down 3%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the North American Professional, aviation and crisis management lines and our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%.
Insurance gross premiums written in Q2 increased by 13% or $292 million year-over-year, driven mostly from the Catlin acquisition where we had 3 months of the Catlin business in the quarter versus only 2 months in Q2 2015. When we look at these legacy organizations and normalize foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was circa 1% in Q2. However, when you consider the portfolio tuning activities that started in 2015, whereas mentioned previously decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses totaling approximately $100 million at a quarter, we see growth in the range of 5% and 3% on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth -- whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction into finding new, profitable opportunities.
Driving some of these opportunities was also the addition of new talent as Q2 was a strong quarter for new leaders of both existing and you businesses. We've recruited Dan -- to lead our global political risk and trading business; Patrick Corbett [ph], joined to head our you retail and accident health business; Simon -- was added to head our ultrahigh net worth; Brian Benjamin [ph], joined our global mergers and acquisitions businesses; and Stephen --, was recruited to lead our ex surface mines business. We fully expect these new business leaders and businesses to add further profitable growth to the business in both the short and long term.
For the Insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $732 million compared to $818 million in Q2 2015. This represents 29.1% of GPW compared to 36.8% in Q2 2015 and 39.9% reported in Q1 2016. As mentioned last quarter, ceded written premium line reflects some changes the way we purchase our reinsurance program, the timing of our reinsurance program purchasing as we move towards an enterprise-wide reinsurance program.
On the year-to-date basis, our -- ratio was 34.5% compared to 35.7% in 2015, and we expect this to further reduce as the full year unfolds and we fully transition to our enterprise-wide reinsurance program. The benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the group's risk return profile with strong correlation across our wider capital strategy.
It is essential that we react to the top line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter, we selectively exited another 35 positions for a total of over 70 positions during the first half as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across our divisions and regions. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will flow through in subsequent quarters along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway.
In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher ex cat activity. We continue to grow the book and have made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And we fully expect this to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus.
And now, to Greg to discuss the reinsurance results."
406440,374450750,1014370,"XL Group plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Paul.

Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter with added color on property catastrophe losses and some rise current market conditions.
Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced acceptable underlying performance, given the property catastrophe activity with the counter-quarter combined ratio of 95.1% compared with 74.5% for the second quarter of last year. The results for the quarter experienced favorable prior year development, increased accident quarter ex cat losses ratio and property catastrophe losses, offset by lower expense ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $65 million compared to $71 million a year ago. As Pete noted in the second quarter, we completed a full review of our reserves and the releases were primarily in casualty classes. This quarter, we see the impact of the aligned parameters and reserving assumptions across both legacy companies for prior and current accident years. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios.
The Reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex cat ratio of 54.4%, which compares to 50% in the second quarter of 2015. The increase is driven primarily by last year's harmonized accident year loss ratio fix across the combined segment, particularly in the casualty treaty and catastrophe exposed portfolios. As we have noted in previous calls, XL Catlin's losses reserve bad news quickly and a lot of good news to fully season. In particular, for property catastrophe exposed treaties, we allow for the seasonality of exposure in a lag for delayed reporting from our clients. Further within the reinsurance segment, we record attritional cat losses in the accident year ex cat loss ratio. This produces a higher accident year ex cat loss ratio in the first half of the year relative to the second half. This can be seen in historical accident year ex cat quarterly loss ratios for the legacy XL portfolio.
Catastrophe losses totaled $143 million net of reinstated written premiums during the quarter compared to no catastrophe losses in the second quarter last year. The cat activity in the quarter resulted from numerous events and produced between $15 billion and $20 billion of market insured loss around the globe. For context, we estimate that XL Catlin has roughly a 2.5% share of the $150 billion global Property & Casualty reinsurance market and between 4% and 5% of the $20 billion to $25 billion catastrophe excess of loss market. While a precise reinsured market loss estimate is difficult to calculate, we are satisfied that our losses in the quarter were at or below our market share.
As we have noted previously, our combined catastrophe portfolio will produce higher nominal dollars of loss relative to the legacy XL book but is a better diversified portfolio.
The expense ratio decreased 4.7 points to 30.6% in the second quarter compared to 35.3% for the second quarter of 2015. This decrease is primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies earned through. Further, we saw 1.9 point drop in our acquisition expense as the impact from purchase accounting begins to diminish.
Turning to top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $1.02 billion, up from $782 million in the second quarter of 2015 with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. April 1 was the last renewal to complete as a combined company and we were able to grow our share of the Japanese market, contributing to $221 million of new business across the segment. This is offset by continued underwriting discipline as we nonrenewed nearly $100 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms. And finally, a long-standing client decided to retain a quarter share treaty which resulted in just over $80 million of nonrenewed premium. On a combined basis for the full quarter, our top line grew 2% after adjusting for foreign exchange and reinstatement premiums.
Shifting to reinsurance market conditions. We found the pricing environment challenging, but great decreases continue to decelerate in most lines and regions and we appear to be reaching the bottom in many classes of business. During the quarter, rates for the segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 3% this quarter, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015. In the remainder of the property treaty book, rates were also down 3%. Our casualty business renewed essentially flat over the last year and the remainder of our classes were flat to down low single digits. Overall, the U.S. short-tail and global casualty treaty markets resisted any meaningful reductions on renewals as many placements were repriced or failed to reach their target placement.
In summary, the second quarter results were acceptable for the Reinsurance segment despite increased cat activity, we were able to generate an underwriting profit in the quarter. Underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job retaining profitable business and find new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. And during our second year together, we are well positioned for success given the strong support from our clients and brokers.
I'll now turn it back to David."

Thanks. A couple of things. First flow, we are continuing to excuse on our synergy program, and that benefit continues to grow in its impact over time depending on, of course, on the timing of departures, the timing of shut-downs of systems, all those things that we've been doing have a growing impact on into next year. So those are the sources and those are the reasons that it continues to grow is it's just timing of the execution. We have had some continuing activity, as Paul described. And those just kind of go on top of what we've done before and continue to earn out again according to the actual departure dates or shutdowns of operations. So we do expect the expense ratio and the absolute level expenses to be able to continue to decline. Of course, in the end, expense ratios are coefficient between what goes on with the top line and that absolute level of expense. And there, we are seeing some meaningful growth, as you would have heard, when new XL programs that are exiting our interest operations, for example, grew about 5%. We saw some growth in the Reinsurance segment as well. And so that can have a continuing improvement effect on the ratio. In terms of the absolute level of expense, we remain on track to deliver what we said we would deliver as we issued in the 8-K, where we give you 4-Ks all the way through to next year. I would only add one other thought, and that is the -- I think it is one point that I've made over time but I don't know that I made it emphatically enough. When we established that 8-K level of expense for next year, that was based on a series of presumptions about what volume of premium we'll be working there because, of course, some costs are variable and some, fixed. But I want to make it clear that if for some reason and I wouldn't forecast it today, but if, for some reason, we see the market get from here even more difficult than it has been, and you've heard both Greg and Paul talk about some decline or -- in the rate of deterioration or in Greg's case, perhaps reaching the bottom in some lines, but if it were to suddenly get worse again, we would expect to get beneath the absolute level of expense that we put out in that 8-K. We would have to drive our expenses down to match what the market delivers in terms of top line."

So let me start with a cat and non-cat. Step back for a moment. In the financial supplement, we have 2 lines in there that we are impacted predominantly by property catastrophe. The property cat line, which is the pure excess of loss cat reinsurance there, right? And the property treaty line, which is the pro risk and the pro rata, which has both cat and non-cat exposures in it. So with that property treaty book, we set a loss ratio for the year is comprised of cat, large loss and attritional. And if the quarters unfold, we tend to react -- not react to a reported experience, particularly because it's very limited any of the year, and instead prefer to true that up at the end of the year. And so it's in line with our bad news fast, good news slow philosophy that you see that what they were referred to which is higher in the first half of the year, lower in the second half of the year. Of course, I would not be doing my job if I didn't point out future loss activity could happen that would vary this outcome depending upon how losses broke. The second piece of the casualty and quite simple he our casualty treaty portfolio relative to last year, the legacy Catlin business is now set at a higher initial pick, in line with the legacy XL book. This increase was established during the fourth quarter of last year, which was another full review quarter and where we harmonized our accident year picks, which Mike just talked about. Within project that forward to the current accident year, which we've done. And then here again, we allowed us seasonal for a number of years to make sure any good news that might emerge is real and solid. And finally, the third piece, rate and mix. Rate, as we've been talking about, has been done over the last 2 years. So you see a little bit of a small impact from that in increased loss ratios in 2016 and mix has impacted the loss ratio of debt although it's not really mix across those different segments of the portfolio, it's within the segment certain treaties that we've written because a number of these Property & Casualty, we roll our accident year pick up by treaty. So the mix of how those break in a given year will be impacted. So intersection of property cat and non-cat, casualty treaty portfolio, rate and mix. And I think this is just a very prudent way to run our book for long-term success. Paul?"

But our view was that my becoming a leader in the reinsurance market place, and particularly in the catastrophe marketplace where we had a very long track record of extraordinary results, was the way that we could continue to participate effectively that marketplace given the structural changes that they're going on. So in essence, size is really mattering in reinsurance and we believe that pushing those expertise into greater concentration would give us greater opportunity to write through structural changes. The guys are getting hurt by the alternative capital coming in are largely the smaller players. So we think we've been well-positioned. We think that this also going to give us the opportunity over time and we've already some of this particularly in terms of terms and conditions to leave the market where it needs to go, not just follow. So we're very pleased with the position we've charted international intentionally. And we see this quarter as our it's reflection of that larger share of market. Having said that, when it relates to how we consider our reinsurance programs, the reinsurance programs now put together for the whole firm. And we can therefore are able, as Paul noted, to see last what with what we think is actually better protection to our peak exposures and better protection to the overall loss experience. So we already are seeing the benefits to those lower sections of profits and we think equal to or better protections for the firm. Individual cats play out is a whole different story.

When I look at this, if I'm really forcing to estimate a remarket loss, I'd give you much broader range than I gave you on the industry loss. So the $15 billion to $20 billion industry loss could be around about $5 billion to $7.5 billion of reinsured market loss. And when we look at our numbers, we have $167 million of gross loss in the current quarter events from these cats and that gets us about a 2% to 3.5% market share, somewhere framed between that 2.5% overall market share and the 4% to 5% cat market share. So that's roughly the math we went through and how we felt good about where we are on these events."

We have obviously have an expenses part as a part of that, we build it up. But we are not forecasting to, oh gee, we can take on a lesser price because we are going to have less expenses. So we are driving our expenses down to expand our margins not consume them by worst-performing business. So our pricing strategy remains unchanged. It is about the risk we are taking on and taking them on appropriately. And while that is difficult to do in this market, that's why I emphasized the statistics I gave at the beginning of the call. We're seeing more volume from which to choose, but we're finding our success rate against that volume to be the same as it was before. And that I think reflects that market discipline. And as I mentioned briefly in my remarks, we also have a rigorous process that is done through crosschecking of teams across different lines to make sure that our adherence to our pricing principles is done appropriately. So we would not chase top line just because we would get more efficient. We'll be looking to apply that more efficient operation to expanding our margins.

The harmonization would have put Catlin at the end of the year kind of to the midpoint of the range, as we would expect and then we'll see what happens over time. In terms of the specifics right now, I won't be doing this again to be blunt because in future quarters, you just won't be able to tell where it came from. It's getting too far away from when the books are on separately. And of course, since 8 months of last year, we were operating as a combined business, pricing in a combined way. It just gets less and less meaningful to try and ascribe attribution. But if you did look at the backward and try and sort it out in this quarter, you did see some releases from things that were attributable to Catlin in the past.

I don't see anything at the moment in there was a rush of capital coming into the business that would change that dynamic of a lowering or diminishing of the rate of decrease in kind of a flattening coming in. And the other part of the question I heard was around just kind of who we are. We definitely operate in a syndicated marketplace, so I would think from what I've heard so far anyways, these are in line with some of our larger peers are seeing. We do view ourselves as a market leader and we think June 1, for renewals in particular, we will say our book there relative to 3% decline for cat overall we were flat in category in Florida. We felt we were really one of the handful of market leaders around pushing the AOB prices in the state, and so we definitely differentiated between clients that have a good form and look at that exposure and have a great claims capability. With the idea that when an event comes, those that aren't well-prepared will have higher losses. So we have reduced our exposure in the state. We've reshaped our portfolio there are a bit and just to me this is the ability to do that is a good sign that there wasn't a bunch of capital rushing in and people cutting off our ability to do that."

I think Paul identified only casualty as relatively flat. I think Greg identified casualty as relatively flat. Well given these interest rate is in casualty flat, we're all idiots. So to me, the fact that some areas are a little bit flatter or slowing down isn't the same as saying this is a sustainable market condition. And so our people are rightly picking their way through and being very cautious but certainly hunting for opportunity. And I do think your point is right. Over time, I expect our different market position, which we hear complements about constantly, can yield a bit of a difference but complements hunt for the that growth would be careful. And given that they know how serious we are about that, I wouldn't have expected to see that hit ratio move at this point. There are a couple of things that give us greater confidence over time and why I didn't say in my comments, we could see some acceleration of our opportunity. Number one, it's known to everyone that every player in this phase shows distress to varying degrees. And you've certainly got some of our key competitors who are showing that. And then that kind of thing happens, our underwriters are going through a very careful exercise to identify accounts either have personal history or knowledge with or where we now that's our kind of risk. And then we do target and go after things, that good, I think, it has been showing signs of success in that activity and it wouldn't surprise me that improved our image. Because you're kind of pre-selecting. So that can help. A second thing that we've been doing and it's really, again, I think accelerating, is we've been working very hard to make sure that our line sizes with good clients reflect our good new position in the Macon and aren't just static to one or the other companies historical level of participation. Those are obviously good ads because you know those accounts very, very well. So I do see opportunities for it to accelerate but I'm not at all displeased to see the equation I described at this point. Sure, we could see that. I'm very pleased with our underwriting discipline. And I just -- I know a lot of our underwriters and actuaries of the folks that support those that they listen to these calls and I just want them to know I'm very pleased. Let's keep those opportunities. And if we can show a difference in that way, I'll be even more pleased."

Tonight, as is our normal practice, I'll share some highlights from the quarter of the results, Pete will discuss the financials, and then Greg and Paul will go through the Insurance and Reinsurance segmen",790,"Good evening, and thank you for joining our call. Tonight, as is our normal practice, I'll share some highlights from the quarter of the results, Pete will discuss the financials, and then Greg and Paul will go through the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, retrospectively.
Turning to our results. The most notable aspect of the quarter, as it has been through the entire sector, was the high level of catastrophes. We preannounced our losses of $240 million due to these events back on July 13. The major sources of loss were the wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta; the earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador; and U.S. and European storms. These events reduced our second quarter operating earnings by $0.84 per share, $0.84 per share. As you will hear in greater detail from Greg and from Paul, these losses were in line with our expectations and in line with or below our market share, and it is noteworthy that both segments turned a profit despite these losses.
Turning then to our underlying performance in the quarter. We would say, simply, this is more like it. The quarter was largely free of distortions related to the Catlin acquisition, and many of the metrics suggest that we have taken an important step forward in the right direction. Despite the cat events and including $52 million in integration cost, in the second quarter, XL Catlin generated $0.37 in operating earnings per share and grew fully diluted tangible book value per share by 3.6%. XL Catlin's ex cat accident year P&C combined ratio of 90.3% was an improvement of 1.8 points from the first quarter of the year and 2 points from the second quarter a year ago. These improvements came from both operating and underwriting discipline. Let me focus briefly on underwriting discipline.
You've heard us often comment that we believe that this combination of XL and Catlin has really changed our relationship to the market. We know that the way clients and brokers think about us is truly different. And as a result, we have been given the opportunity to write things that neither XL nor Catlin would have seen before. And what we're seeing now is the effect of these new opportunities and the effect of our discipline come together. You'll hear in a moment from Paul that when you take out programs we're exiting, the growth rate in Insurance was actually about 5%. So why would we be having that success?
Well, submission volume is up from our top broker partners, and we are quoting a commensurate more amount. But our hit ratio, the amount that we actually write when we quote, has stayed flat. Meaning we're finding about the same portion that we are willing to write on our conditions but we're getting a greater volume to select from. This gives me comfort that we are not chasing business as does our system of back-checking price adequacy. This is the hallmark of underwriting discipline, and while this progress has been building quarter-over-quarter, it is exactly the kind of thing that we believe we should be able to continue to produce, even accelerate, as our underwriting teams are really hitting their strides. We are very proud of the hard work of our underwriters and their support teams in these difficult market conditions.
Before I turn it over to Pete to discuss our financial results, I'll make 2 brief comments on other important topics that I'm sure are on your minds. First is Brexit. We believe we are well-prepared -- as well-prepared as possible for this outcome that we have thought about the future possibilities and that we're in a great position to respond accordingly to whatever develops.
Second, our parent company move to Bermuda, which was completed as of Monday. Bermuda has served as a base for global insurance and reinsurance providers for decades, and has, in the Bermuda monetary authority, a proven world-class regulator. XL has had substantial operations in Bermuda for 30 years. And, of course, it was the corporate home for Catlin before our companies joined. So our integration, combined with the Bermuda receiving full Solvency II equivalents early this year, made this a very logical move which we think will serve the company well. We are pleased to be here. It is worth noting from a day per day perspective, our clients, brokers, counterparties and partners should see no change in how we work with them. And as we said before, we expect no material impact to our future results or global effective tax rate as a result of this move.
So in sum, positive progress showed in the numbers in the second quarter. We are determined that it will continue.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."

Operating net income for the second quarter was $106 million or $0.37 per share on a fully dilute basis compared to $246 million or $0.84 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included 2 months of the legacy",920,"Well, thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating net income for the second quarter was $106 million or $0.37 per share on a fully dilute basis compared to $246 million or $0.84 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included 2 months of the legacy Catlin operations. As indicated in our July 13 8-K, our natural catastrophe losses for the second quarter totaled $240 million compared to $60 million in the prior year quarter. The largest of these events, the wildfires in and around Fort McMurray, accounted for approximately half of our estimate of catastrophe losses for the quarter. During the second quarter, we incurred $52 million in integration costs, which are included in our operating income.
For the quarter, our property and casualty combined ratio was 96%, was 6.1 points higher than the same quarter last year, again, primarily driven by those catastrophe losses. As Mike noted, our ex cat accident year combined ratio was 90.3%, or 2 points better than the preceding period last year. Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As discussed on previous calls, the second and fourth quarters are significant reserve valuation quarters and as a result, we reacted appropriately to any development indications identified during those in-depth reviews. Prior year net development in the second quarter was a favorable $99 million or 3.9 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $109 million or 5.3 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $34 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $65 million in the Reinsurance segment.
Operating expenses have remained generally flat compared to the first quarter of this year and slightly higher than the second quarter of 2015 due to legacy Catlin costs being included only from May 2015 onwards. We continue to be view full year overall expense levels and integration expense levels as in line with the estimates provided in our 8-K filed in June.
Our estimated operating tax rate to ordinary shareholders remains consistent with the 10% to 12% we noted in April, with adjustments to the prior year tax revisions lowering the 6-month rate to 8.8%. Our annualized operating ROE, excluding integration cost and AOCI, was 5.7% for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, and was significantly impacted by the catastrophe losses in the second quarter.
Turning to the investment portfolio, and as usual, my comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income was $176 million, in line with the same quarter last year and greater than the $164 million in the previous quarter. While the low interest rate environment continue to pressure net investment income, the second quarter benefited to a modest extent from some nonrecurring factors including certain amortization adjustments. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we have approximately $3.1 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the second quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7%.
The gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio at the end of June was 2.3%, virtually unchanged from the first quarter. The duration of the fixed income and cash portfolio was 3.3 years at the end of the quarter, marginally higher than the prior year quarter mainly due to cash being put to work. Total affiliate income was $35 million for the quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter. While our hedge fund affiliate portfolio broke even for the quarter, it did not meet its benchmarks. Many of our funds pursuing quantitative equity strategies were challenged and several of our directional equity funds did not fully capture the market rally. On a year-to-date basis, our hedge fund portfolio continues to outperform its benchmark and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns.
Our private equity, strategic and other operating affiliates posted relatively strong equity earnings. Our investment manager affiliates contributed $15 million to affiliate income, with the gain on the sale of an individual position being an important contributor. Unrealized net gains are $1.14 billion at the end of the quarter. The total mark-to-market return on investments was 1.5% for the quarter in original currency. The favorable return was driven by lower rates, which more than offset the adverse impact in credit spread widening. Looking forward, we expect financial markets to remain volatile over the near to midterm, and we will continue to monitor our portfolios closely as a result.
And with respect to capital management, we continued to execute share buybacks during the second quarter. Our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback program at our May meeting, authorizing the purchase of up to $1 billion of our ordinary shares, replacing the remaining amount under our previous share buyback authorization. During the quarter, we purchased 9.7 million shares for $328 million at an average price of $34 per share, leaving $860 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. This accelerated rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April, as well as a slight acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.
I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."

This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management.
First, the results. I am pleased to report our 14th consecutive quarter of profitability dating back to Q1 2013 despite higher cat activity we experienced during the quarter. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.4% compared to 97% in Q2 2015 and 96.5% last quarter. Higher cat expense of $97 million compared to $60 million in Q2 2015, and slightly lower prior year reserve releases or $34 million compared to $38 million last year are more than offset by material improvements in the underwriting expense ratio of 1.8 points and the accident year ex cat loss ratio of 1.1 points. On an accident quarter ex cat basis, the combined ratio was 92.6% compared to 95.4% in Q2 2015 and 95% last quarter.
For Q2, we report an acquisition ratio of 13.7% compared to 12.9% in Q2 2015 and 14.1% reported last quarter. This is more in line with the guidance provided last quarter. The reason for the slight increase over prior year is because Q2 2015 only reflected 2 months of the Catlin business, which included the largest share of wholesale specialty business where the gross acquisition costs are higher and the loss ratio is lower than the legacy XL business. This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a Q2 operating expense ratio of 18.1%, which was 2.6 points lower than Q2 2015, and by a net accident year ex cat loss ratio of 60.8%, which was 1.1 points lower than Q2 2015.
Pricing has remained broadly consistent at minus 3% in the quarter. Our casualty lines showed flat pricing in the quarter. Our professional and specialty businesses were both down 3%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the North American professional, aviation and crisis management lines; and our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%.
Insurance gross premiums written in Q2 increased by 13% or $292 million year-over-year, driven mostly from the Catlin acquisition where we had 3 months of the Catlin business in the quarter versus only 2 months in Q2 2015. When we look at those legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was circa 1% in Q2. However, when you consider the portfolio-tuning activities that started in 2015, whereas mentioned previously decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses totaling approximately $100 million in the quarter, we see growth in the range of 5%, and 3% on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth demonstrates that whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction into finding new profitable opportunities.
Driving some of these opportunities was also the addition of new talent as Q2 was a strong quarter for new leaders of both existing and new businesses. We recruited Dan Riordan to lead our Global Political Risk & Trade Credit business; Patrick Corbett, joined to head our new Retail Accident & Health business; Simon Mobey was added to head our Ultra High Net Worth; Brian Benjamin joined to lead our Global Mergers and Acquisitions businesses; and Stephen Oh was recruited to lead our Excess & Surplus lines business. We fully expect these new leaders and businesses to add further profitable growth to the segment in both the short and long term.
For the Insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $732 million compared to $818 million in Q2 2015. This represents 29.1% of GPW compared to 36.8% in Q2 2015 and 39.9% reported in Q1 2016. As mentioned last quarter, ceded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we purchase our reinsurance program, the timing of our reinsurance program purchasing as we move towards an enterprise-wide reinsurance program.
On a year-to-date basis, our cession ratio is 34.5% compared to 35.7% in 2015, and we expect this to further reduce as the full year unfolds and we fully transition to our enterprise-wide reinsurance program. The benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the group's risk return profile with strong coordination across our wider capital strategy.
It is essential that we react to the top line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter, we selectively exited another 35 positions for a total of over 70 positions during the first half as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across our divisions and regions. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will flow through in subsequent quarters, along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway.
In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continue to grow the book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And we fully expect this to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus.
And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."

The Reinsurance segment produced acceptable underlying performance, given th",840,"Thanks, Paul. Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter with added color on property catastrophe losses and summarize current market conditions.
Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced acceptable underlying performance, given the property catastrophe activity with a calendar-quarter combined ratio of 95.1% compared with 74.5% for the second quarter of last year. The results for the quarter experienced favorable prior year development, increased accident quarter ex cat loss ratio and property catastrophe losses, offset by lower expense ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $65 million compared to $71 million a year ago. As Pete noted, in the second quarter, we completed a full review of our reserves and the releases were primarily in casualty classes. This quarter, we see the impact of the aligned parameters and reserving assumptions across both legacy companies for prior and current accident years. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios.
The Reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 54.4%, which compares to 50% in the second quarter of 2015. The increase is driven primarily by last year's harmonized accident year loss ratio fix across the combined segment, particularly in the casualty treaty and property catastrophe exposed portfolios. As we have noted in previous calls, XL Catlin's philosophy on reserving is to take bad news quickly and allow good news to fully season. In particular, for property catastrophe exposed treaties, we allowed for the seasonality of exposure in a lag for delayed reporting from our clients. Further within the reinsurance segment, we recorded attritional cat losses in the accident year ex cat loss ratio. This produces a higher accident year ex cat loss ratio in the first half of the year relative to the second half. This can be seen in the historical accident year ex cat quarterly loss ratios for the legacy XL portfolio.
Catastrophe losses totaled $143 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared to no catastrophe losses in the second quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter resulted from numerous events and produced between $15 billion and $20 billion of market-insured loss around the globe. For context, we estimate that XL Catlin Re has roughly a 2.5% share of the $150 billion global property and casualty reinsurance market, and between 4% and 5% of the $20 billion to $25 billion catastrophe excess of loss market. While a precise reinsured market loss estimate is difficult to calculate, we are satisfied that our losses in the quarter were at or below our market share. As we have noted previously, our combined catastrophe portfolio will produce higher nominal dollars of loss relative to the legacy XL book but is a better diversified portfolio.
The expense ratio decreased 4.7 points to 30.6% in the second quarter compared to 35.3% for the second quarter of 2015. This decrease is primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies earn through. Further, we saw a 1.9 point drop at our acquisition expense as the impact from purchase accounting begins to diminish.
Turning to top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $1.02 billion, up from $782 million in the second quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. April 1 was the last renewal to complete as a combined company and we were able to grow our share of the Japanese market, contributing to $221 million of new business across the segment. This is offset by continued underwriting discipline as we nonrenewed nearly $100 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms. And finally, a long-standing client decided to retain a quarter share treaty, which resulted in just over $80 million of nonrenewed premium. On a combined basis for the full quarter, our top line grew 2% after adjusting for foreign exchange and reinstatement premiums.
Shifting to reinsurance market conditions. We found the pricing environment challenging, but great decreases continued to decelerate in most lines and regions and we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business. During the quarter, rates for this segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 3% this quarter, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015. In the remainder of the property treaty book, rates were also down 3%. Our casualty business renewed essentially flat over last year and the remainder of our classes were flat-to-down low single digits. Overall, the U.S. short-tail and global casualty treaty markets resisted any meaningful reductions on renewals as many placements were repriced or failed to reach their target placement.
In summary, the second quarter results were acceptable for the Reinsurance segment. Despite increased cat activity, we were able to generate an underwriting profit in the quarter. Underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. Entering our second year together, we are well-positioned for success, given the strong support from our clients and brokers.
I'll now turn it back to David."

A couple of things. First of all, we are continuing to execute on our synergy program, and that benefit continues to grow in its impact over time depending, of course, on the timing of departures, the timing of shut-downs of systems, all those things that we've been doing have a growing impact on into next year. So those are the sources and those are the reasons that it continues to grow as it's just timing of the execution. We have had some continuing activity, as Paul described. And those just kind of go on top of what we've done before and continue to earn out again according to the actual departure dates or shutdowns of operations. So we do expect the expense ratio and the absolute level of expenses to be able to continue to decline. Of course, in the end, expense ratios are a coefficient between what goes on with the top line and that absolute level of expense. And there, we are seeing some meaningful growth. As you would have heard, when you exile programs that we're exiting, our Insurance operations, for example, grew about 5%. We saw some growth in the Reinsurance segment as well. And so that can have a continuing improvement effect on the ratio. In terms of the absolute level of expense, we remain on track to deliver what we said we would deliver as we issued in the 8-K where we gave you a forecast all the way through to next year. I would only add one other thought, and that is the -- I think it is one point that I've made over time but I don't know that I've made it emphatically enough. When we established that 8-K level of expense for next year, that was based on a series of presumptions about what volume of premium we'd be working with because, of course, some costs are variable and some are fixed. But I want to make it clear that if for some reason, and I wouldn't forecast it today, but if for some reason we see the market get from here even more difficult than it has been, and you've heard both Greg and Paul talk about some decline or -- in the rate of deterioration or in Greg's case, perhaps reaching a bottom in some lines, but if it were to suddenly get worse again, we would expect to get beneath the absolute level of expense that we put out in that 8-K. We would have to drive our expenses down to match what the market delivers in terms of top line."

Kai, before I start, a little preface here, attribution to any one of these 3 categories I'm going to give you is difficult with the Reinsurance portfolio. They're large chunky treaties, a handful of them can impact the outcome of any subset of our book. But in looking at the 4.4% increase, I'd attribute it roughly 40% to the intersection of cat and non-cat in our property portfolios, 40% to the casualty treaty initial accident year loss pick and about 20% to rate and mix. So let me start with the cat and non-cat. Let's step back for a moment. In the financial supplement, we have 2 lines in there that really are impacted predominantly by property catastrophe. The property cat line, which is the pure excess of loss cat reinsurance that we write, and the property treaty line, which is the per risk and the pro rata, which has both cat and non-cat exposures in it. So with that property treaty book, we said our loss ratio pick for the year, it's comprised of cat, large loss and attritional. And as the quarters unfold, we tend to react -- not react to a reported experience, particularly because it's very limited early in the year, and instead prefer to true that up at the end of the year. And so it's in line with our bad news fast, good news slow philosophy that you see that what I referred to, which is higher in the first half of the year, lower in the second half of the year. Of course, I would not be doing my job if I didn't point out future loss activity could happen that would vary this outcome depending upon how losses broke. The second piece of the casualty and quite simply our casualty treaty portfolio relative to last year, the legacy Catlin business, is now set at a higher initial pick in line with the legacy XL book. This increase was established during the fourth quarter of last year, which was another full review quarter and where we harmonized our accident year picks, which Mike just talked about. We then project that forward to the current accident year, which we've done. And then here, again, we allowed this to season up for a number of years to make sure any good news that might emerge is real and solid. And finally, the third piece, rate and mix. Rate, as we've been talking about, has been done over the last 2 years. So you're seeing a little bit of a small impact from that in increased loss ratios in 2016, and mix has impacted the loss ratio a bit, although it's not really mix across those different segments of the portfolio, it's within this segment certain treaties that we've written that might -- because a number of this class is particularly casualty, we roll our accident year pick up by treaty. So the mix of how those break in a given year will be impacted. So intersection of property cat and non-cat, casualty treaty portfolio, rate and mix, and I think this is just a very prudent way to run our book for long-term success. Paul?"

I mean as we've talked about before, we started sort of reunderwriting even before May when we came together. And I think that the impact of some of those actions around exiting some lines of business, it takes a bit of time for that to start to run through in the loss ratio because you obviously still have the unearned premium to earn through. We're also very focused in terms of additional underwriting actions that we can take. We've got a big lift in terms of how we think about pricing and portfolio analysis by bringing the businesses together and we've been working in some of those insights, and that is starting to show through in the numbers in the second quarter."

We should also start to see this working through and potentially helping with our loss ratios as well. So again, we go through quite an exhaustive set of discussions around, again, what the optimal points for some of these things are and that's -- it depends upon our view of risk, our view of prices and the availability of different reinsurance products. But easier to make improvements at the moment as in other times."

Let me give you a few really important notions. Number one, the market share, Greg will talk about. But our view was that my becoming a leader in the reinsurance marketplace, and particularly in the catastrophe marketplace where we had a very long track record of extraordinary results, was the way that we could continue to participate effectively that marketplace given the structural changes that are going on. So in essence, size is really mattering in reinsurance and we believe that pushing those expertises into greater concentration would give us greater opportunity to ride through structural changes. The guys who are getting hurt by all the alternative capital coming in are largely the smaller players. So we think we've been well-positioned. We think that this also going to give us the opportunity over time and we've already some of this particularly in terms of terms and conditions to leave the market where it needs to go, not just follow. So we're very pleased with the position we charted intentionally. And we see this quarter as a reflection of that larger share of market. Having said that, when it relates to how we consider our reinsurance programs, the reinsurance programs now put together for the whole firm. And we can therefore are able, as Paul noted, to seed last with what we think is actually better protection to our peak exposures and better protection to the overall loss experience. So we already are seeing the benefits to those lower sections of profits and we think equal to or better protections for the firm. Individual cats play out is a whole different story. You never know what zone you're going to get him. How that fits with the whole story. But this quarter, we would tell you this came out as expected, it came out relative to our market share or better across the various events."

When I look at this, if I'm really forcing to estimate a remarket loss, I'd give you a much broader range than I gave you on the industry loss. So the $15 billion to $20 billion industry loss could be around about $5 billion to $7.5 billion of reinsured market loss. And when we look at our numbers, we have $167 million of gross loss in the current quarter events from these cats and that gets us about a 2% to 3.5% market share, somewhere framed between that 2.5% overall market share and the 4% to 5% cat market share.

In terms of the specifics right now, I won't be doing this again to be blunt because in future quarters, you just won't be able to tell where it came from. It's getting too far away from when the books were run separately. And of course, since 8 months of last year, we were operating as a combined business, pricing in a combined way. It just gets less and less meaningful to try and ascribe attribution.

And I think the answer I heard was that you're leveraging the size of the platform to drive that. So I mean, the question I guess I have is twofold. One, do you have any sense if that level of holding line on price is consistent with what other reinsurers of a similar size are seeing in the market? And is this a pause before more capital comes into your market? Or do you really think that it's sustainable? Because intuitively, it seems like you would -- it would be getting worse than that."

On the cat book, the 3% this quarter relative to 8% last year certainly is a much improved part of the term result relative to the prior year. We certainly see pricing, particularly in the markets I've talked about, short tail lines and the global cat -- U.S. short tail lines and the global casualty book, we see pricing there very much reaching the bottom. Now from my perspective, we could be at the bottom for a while and we think we're well-suited and well-prepared to do very well and succeed if it stays in the bottom. I don't see anything at the moment there was a rush of capital coming into the business that would change that dynamic of a lowering or diminishing of the rate of decrease and kind of a flattening coming in. And the other part of the question I heard was around just kind of who we are. We definitely operate in a syndicated marketplace, so I would think from what I've heard so far anyways, these are in line with what some of our larger peers are seeing. We do view ourselves as a market leader and we think June 1, for the renewals in particular, we would say our book there relative to the 3% decline for cat overall, we were flat in category in Florida. We felt we were really one of the handful of market leaders around, pushing the AOB prices in the state, and so we're definitely differentiated between clients that have a good form and look after that exposure and have a great claims capability. With the idea that when an event comes, those that aren't well-prepared will have higher losses. So we reduced our exposure in the State. We've reshaped our portfolio there are a bit and just to me this is the ability to do that is a good sign that there wasn't a bunch of capital rushing in and people cutting off our ability to do that."

So to me, the fact that some areas are a little bit flatter or slowing down isn't the same as saying this is a sustainable market condition. And so our people are rightly picking their way through and being very cautious, but certainly hunting for opportunity. And I do think your point is right. Over time, I expect our different market position, which we hear compliments about constantly, can yield a bit of a difference but we've encouraged our people to be -- to hunt for that growth would but be careful. And given that they know how serious we are about that, I wouldn't have expected to see that hit ratio move at this point. There are a couple of things that give us greater confidence over time, and why I didn't say in my comments, we could see some acceleration of our opportunity. Number one, it's known to everyone that every player in this phase shows distress to varying degrees. And we've certainly got some of our key competitors who are showing that. And when that kind of thing happens, our underwriters are going through a very careful exercise to identify accounts that either they have personal history or knowledge with or where we know that's our kind of risk. And then we do target and go after things. That could, I think -- it has been showing signs of success in that activity. And it wouldn't surprise me if that improved our image, because you're kind of pre-selecting. So that can help. A second thing that we've been doing, and it's really, again, I think accelerating, is we've been working very hard to make sure that our line sizes with good clients reflect our good new position in the market and aren't just static to one or the other companies historical level of participation. Those are obviously good ads, because you know those accounts very, very well. So I do see opportunities for it to accelerate, but I'm not at all displeased to see the equation I described at this point. Sure, we could see that. I'm very pleased with our underwriting discipline. And I just -- I know a lot of our underwriters and the actuaries and the folks that support us that they listen to these calls and I just want them to know I'm very pleased. Let's keep those opportunities. And if we can show a difference in that way, I'll be even more pleased."

We are cognizant that, that ratio though really can't go up meaningfully. It really hasn't gone up over the last couple of quarters at least. We do have $300 million of debt coming due in 2018, right, so there is something out there in the midterm that you might think that would be unlikely to be refinanced as a result of that. But it is something that we weigh pretty much every quarter about is that, do we need to do something?

And our colleagues experienced that dissonance too and say, ""Geez, what's going on?"" My -- and so I -- but no, this quarter tells a clear and more compelling story, but it's one quarter. And I'm going to take the humbling lesson of last quarter and be cautious on how I comment on that for the time being. But you shouldn't take in that any less commitment to our goal or any certainty that we can't make that goal in the right way at the right time. So I'm -- look, we'll take this conversation up more. You can tell I'm a little bit itching to say more than that for, but all my colleagues are about to slip my slit my throat. So we're done. But I'm -- there's -- when you phrase the question the way you did, it really is a 2-letter answer: No."

Tonight, as is our normal practice, I'll share some highlights from the quarter of the results, Pete will discuss the financials, and then Greg and Paul will go through the Insurance and Reinsurance segmen",789,"Good evening, and thank you for joining our call. Tonight, as is our normal practice, I'll share some highlights from the quarter of the results, Pete will discuss the financials, and then Greg and Paul will go through the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, retrospectively.
Turning to our results. The most notable aspect of the quarter, as it has been through the entire sector, was the high level of catastrophes. We preannounced our losses of $240 million due to these events back on July 13. The major sources of loss were the wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta; the earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador; and U.S. and European storms. These events reduced our second quarter operating earnings by $0.84 per share, $0.84 per share. As you will hear in greater detail from Greg and from Paul, these losses were in line with our expectations and in line with or below our market share, and it is noteworthy that both segments turned a profit despite these losses.
Turning then to our underlying performance in the quarter. We would say, simply, this is more like it. The quarter was largely free of distortions related to the Catlin acquisition, and many of the metrics suggest that we have taken an important step forward in the right direction. Despite the cat events and including $52 million in integration cost, in the second quarter, XL Catlin generated $0.37 in operating earnings per share and grew fully diluted tangible book value per share by 3.6%. XL Catlin's ex cat accident year P&C combined ratio of 90.3% was an improvement of 1.8 points from the first quarter of the year and 2 points from the second quarter a year ago. These improvements came from both operating and underwriting discipline. Let me focus briefly on underwriting discipline.
You've heard us often comment that we believe that this combination of XL and Catlin has really changed our relationship to the market. We know that the way clients and brokers think about us is truly different. And as a result, we have been given the opportunity to write things that neither XL nor Catlin would have seen before. And what we're seeing now is the effect of these new opportunities and the effect of our discipline come together. You'll hear in a moment from Paul that when you take out programs we're exiting, the growth rate in Insurance was actually about 5%. So why would we be having that success?
Well, submission volume is up from our top broker partners, and we are quoting a commensurate more amount. But our hit ratio, the amount that we actually write when we quote, has stayed flat. Meaning we're finding about the same portion that we are willing to write on our conditions but we're getting a greater volume to select from. This gives me comfort that we are not chasing business, as does our system of back-checking price adequacy. This is the hallmark of underwriting discipline, and while this progress has been building quarter-over-quarter, it is exactly the kind of thing that we believe we should be able to continue to produce, even accelerate, as our underwriting teams are really hitting their strides. We are very proud of the hard work of our underwriters and their support teams in these difficult market conditions.
Before I turn it over to Pete to discuss our financial results, I'll make 2 brief comments on other important topics that I'm sure are on your minds. First is Brexit. We believe we are well-prepared -- as well-prepared as possible for this outcome, that we have thought about the future possibilities and that we're in a great position to respond accordingly to whatever develops.
Second, our parent company move to Bermuda, which was completed as of Monday. Bermuda has served as a base for global insurance and reinsurance providers for decades, and has, in the Bermuda Monetary Authority, a proven world-class regulator. XL has had substantial operations in Bermuda for 30 years. And, of course, it was the corporate home for Catlin before our companies joined. So our integration, combined with Bermuda receiving full Solvency II equivalence early this year, made this a very logical move which we think will serve the company well. We are pleased to be there. It is worth noting from a day per day perspective, our clients, brokers, counterparties and partners should see no change in how we work with them. And as we said before, we expect no material impact to our future results or global effective tax rate as a result of this move.
So in sum, positive progress showed in the numbers in the second quarter. We are determined that it will continue.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."

Operating net income for the second quarter was $106 million or $0.37 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $246 million or $0.84 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included 2 months of the legacy Catlin operations. As indicated in our July 13 8-K, our natural catastrophe losses for the second quarter totaled $240 million compared to $60 million in the prior year quarter. The largest of these events, the wildfires in and around Fort McMurray, accounted for approximately half of our estimate of catastrophe losses for the quarter. During the second quarter, we incurred $52 million in integration costs, which are included in our operating income.
For the quarter, our property and casualty combined ratio was 96%, or 6.1 points higher than the same quarter last year, again, primarily driven by those catastrophe losses. As Mike noted, our ex cat accident year combined ratio was 90.3%, or 2 points better than the preceding period last year. Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As discussed on previous calls, the second and fourth quarters are significant reserve valuation quarters and as a result, we reacted appropriately to any development indications identified during those in-depth reviews. Prior year net development in the second quarter was a favorable $99 million or 3.9 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $109 million or 5.3 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $34 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $65 million in the Reinsurance segment.
Operating expenses have remained generally flat compared to the first quarter of this year and slightly higher than the second quarter of 2015 due to legacy Catlin costs being included only from May 2015 onwards. We continue to view full year overall expense levels and integration expense levels as in line with the estimates provided in our 8-K filed in June.
Our estimated operating tax rate to ordinary shareholders remains consistent with the 10% to 12% we noted in April, with adjustments to the prior year tax revisions lowering the 6-month rate to 8.8%. Our annualized operating ROE, excluding integration cost and AOCI, was 5.7% for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, and was significantly impacted by the catastrophe losses in the second quarter.
Turning to the investment portfolio, and as usual, my comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income was $176 million, in line with the same quarter last year and greater than the $164 million in the previous quarter. While the low interest rate environment continued to pressure net investment income, the second quarter benefited to a modest extent from some nonrecurring factors including certain amortization adjustments. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.1 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the second quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7%.
The gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio at the end of June was 2.3%, virtually unchanged from the first quarter. The duration of the fixed income and cash portfolio was 3.3 years at the end of the quarter, marginally higher than the prior year quarter mainly due to cash being put to work. Total affiliate income was $35 million for the quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter. While our hedge fund affiliate portfolio broke even for the quarter, it did not meet its benchmarks. Many of our funds pursuing quantitative equity strategies were challenged and several of our directional equity funds did not fully capture the market rally. On a year-to-date basis, our hedge fund portfolio continues to outperform its benchmark and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns.
Our private equity, strategic and other operating affiliates posted relatively strong equity earnings. Our investment manager affiliates contributed $15 million to affiliate income, with the gain on the sale of an individual position being an important contributor. Unrealized net gains are $1.14 billion at the end of the quarter. The total mark-to-market return on investments was 1.5% for the quarter in original currency. The favorable return was driven by lower rates, which more than offset the adverse impact in credit spread widening. Looking forward, we expect financial markets to remain volatile over the near to midterm, and we will continue to monitor our portfolios closely as a result.
And with respect to capital management, we continued to execute share buybacks during the second quarter. Our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback program at our May meeting, authorizing the purchase of up to $1 billion of our ordinary shares, replacing the remaining amount under our previous share buyback authorization. During the quarter, we purchased 9.7 million shares for $328 million at an average price of $34 per share, leaving $860 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. This accelerated rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April, as well as a slight acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.
I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."

I am pleased to report our 14th consecutive quarter o",843,"Thanks, Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management.
First, the results. I am pleased to report our 14th consecutive quarter of profitability dating back to Q1 2013 despite higher cat activity we experienced during the quarter. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.4% compared to 97% in Q2 2015 and 96.5% last quarter. Higher cat expense of $97 million compared to $60 million in Q2 2015, and slightly lower prior year reserve releases of $34 million compared to $38 million last year are more than offset by material improvements in the underwriting expense ratio of 1.8 points and the accident year ex cat loss ratio of 1.1 points. On an accident quarter ex cat basis, the combined ratio was 92.6% compared to 95.4% in Q2 2015 and 95% last quarter.
For Q2, we report an acquisition ratio of 13.7% compared to 12.9% in Q2 2015 and 14.1% reported last quarter. This is more in line with the guidance provided last quarter. The reason for the slight increase over prior year is because Q2 2015 only reflected 2 months of the Catlin business, which included the largest share of wholesale specialty business where the gross acquisition costs are higher and the loss ratio is lower than the legacy XL business. This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a Q2 operating expense ratio of 18.1%, which was 2.6 points lower than Q2 2015, and by a net accident year ex cat loss ratio of 60.8%, which was 1.1 points lower than Q2 2015.
Pricing has remained broadly consistent at minus 3% in the quarter. Our casualty lines showed flat pricing in the quarter. Our professional and specialty businesses were both down 3%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the North American professional, aviation and crisis management lines; and our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%.
Insurance gross premiums written in Q2 increased by 13% or $292 million year-over-year, driven mostly from the Catlin acquisition where we had 3 months of the Catlin business in the quarter versus only 2 months in Q2 2015. When we look at those legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was circa 1% in Q2. However, when you consider the portfolio-tuning activities that started in 2015, whereas mentioned previously decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses totaling approximately $100 million in the quarter, we see growth in the range of 5%, and 3% on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth demonstrates that whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction into finding new profitable opportunities.
Driving some of these opportunities was also the addition of new talent, as Q2 was a strong quarter for new leaders of both existing and new businesses. We recruited Dan Riordan to lead our Global Political Risk & Trade Credit business; Patrick Corbett joined to head our new Retail Accident & Health business; Simon Mobey was added to head our Ultra High Net Worth; Brian Benjamin joined to lead our Global Mergers and Acquisitions businesses; and Stephen Oh was recruited to lead our Excess & Surplus lines business. We fully expect these new leaders and businesses to add further profitable growth to the segment in both the short and long term.
For the Insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $732 million compared to $818 million in Q2 2015. This represents 29.1% of GPW compared to 36.8% in Q2 2015 and 39.9% reported in Q1 2016. As mentioned last quarter, ceded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we purchase our reinsurance program, the timing of our reinsurance program purchasing as we move towards an enterprise-wide reinsurance program.
On a year-to-date basis, our cession ratio is 34.5% compared to 35.7% in 2015, and we expect this to further reduce as the full year unfolds and we fully transition to our enterprise-wide reinsurance program. The benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the group's risk return profile with strong coordination across our wider capital strategy.
It is essential that we react to the top line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter, we selectively exited another 35 positions for a total of over 70 positions during the first half as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across our divisions and regions. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will flow through in subsequent quarters, along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway.
In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continue to grow the book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And we fully expect this to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus.
And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."

Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter with added color on property catastrophe losses and summarize current market conditions.
Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced acceptable underlying performance, given the property catastrophe activity with a calendar-quarter combined ratio of 95.1% compared with 74.5% for the second quarter of last year. The results for the quarter experienced favorable prior year development, increased accident quarter ex cat loss ratio and property catastrophe losses, offset by a lower expense ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $65 million compared to $71 million a year ago. As Pete noted, in the second quarter, we completed a full review of our reserves and the releases were primarily in casualty classes. This quarter, we see the impact of the aligned parameters and reserving assumptions across both legacy companies for prior and current accident years. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios.
The Reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 54.4%, which compares to 50% in the second quarter of 2015. The increase is driven primarily by last year's harmonized accident year loss ratio fix across the combined segment, particularly in the casualty treaty and property catastrophe exposed portfolios. As we have noted in previous calls, XL Catlin's philosophy on reserving is to take bad news quickly and allow good news to fully season. In particular, for property catastrophe exposed treaties, we allowed for the seasonality of exposure and a lag for delayed reporting from our clients. Further, within the reinsurance segment, we recorded attritional cat losses in the accident year ex cat loss ratio. This produces a higher accident year ex cat loss ratio in the first half of the year relative to the second half. This can be seen in the historical accident year ex cat quarterly loss ratios for the legacy XL portfolio.
Catastrophe losses totaled $143 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared to no catastrophe losses in the second quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter resulted from numerous events and produced between $15 billion and $20 billion of market-insured loss around the globe. For context, we estimate that XL Catlin Re has roughly a 2.5% share of the $150 billion global property and casualty reinsurance market, and between 4% and 5% of the $20 billion to $25 billion catastrophe excess of loss market. While a precise reinsured market loss estimate is difficult to calculate, we are satisfied that our losses in the quarter were at or below our market share. As we have noted previously, our combined catastrophe portfolio will produce higher nominal dollars of loss relative to the legacy XL book but is a better diversified portfolio.
The expense ratio decreased 4.7 points to 30.6% in the second quarter compared to 35.3% for the second quarter of 2015. This decrease is primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies earn through. Further, we saw a 1.9 point drop at our acquisition expense as the impact from purchase accounting begins to diminish.
Turning to top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $1.02 billion, up from $782 million in the second quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. April 1 was the last renewal to complete as a combined company and we were able to grow our share of the Japanese market, contributing to $221 million of new business across the segment. This is offset by continued underwriting discipline as we nonrenewed nearly $100 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms. And finally, a long-standing client decided to retain a quota share treaty, which resulted in just over $80 million of nonrenewed premium. On a combined basis for the full quarter, our top line grew 2% after adjusting for foreign exchange and reinstatement premiums.
Shifting to reinsurance market conditions. We found the pricing environment challenging, but great decreases continued to decelerate in most lines and regions and we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business. During the quarter, rates for this segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 3% this quarter, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015. In the remainder of the property treaty book, rates were also down 3%. Our casualty business renewed essentially flat over last year and the remainder of our classes were flat to down low single digits. Overall, the U.S. short-tail and global casualty treaty markets resisted any meaningful reductions on renewals as many placements were repriced or failed to reach their target placements.
In summary, the second quarter results were acceptable for the Reinsurance segment. Despite increased cat activity, we were able to generate an underwriting profit in the quarter. Underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. Entering our second year together, we are well-positioned for success, given the strong support from our clients and brokers.
I'll now turn it back to David."

A couple of things. First of all, we are continuing to execute on our synergy program, and that benefit continues to grow in its impact over time depending, of course, on the timing of departures, the timing of shut-downs of systems, all those things that we've been doing have a growing impact on into next year. So those are the sources and those are the reasons that it continues to grow as it's just timing of the execution. We have had some continuing activity, as Paul described. And those just kind of go on top of what we've done before and continue to earn out again according to the actual departure dates or shutdowns of operations. So we do expect the expense ratio and the absolute level of expenses to be able to continue to decline. Of course, in the end, expense ratios are a coefficient between what goes on with the top line and that absolute level of expense. And there, we are seeing some meaningful growth. As you would have heard, when you ex out programs that we're exiting, our Insurance operations, for example, grew about 5%. We saw some growth in the Reinsurance segment as well. And so that can have a continuing improvement effect on the ratio. In terms of the absolute level of expense, we remain on track to deliver what we said we would deliver, as we issued in the 8-K, where we gave you a forecast all the way through to next year. I would only add one other thought, and that is the -- I think that there's one point that I've made over time but I don't know that I've made it emphatically enough. When we established that 8-K level of expense for next year, that was based on a series of presumptions about what volume of premium we'd be working with because, of course, some costs are variable and some are fixed. But I want to make it clear that if for some reason, and I wouldn't forecast it today, but if for some reason we see the market get from here even more difficult than it has been, and you've heard both Greg and Paul talk about some decline or -- in the rate of deterioration or in Greg's case, perhaps reaching a bottom in some lines, but if it were to suddenly get worse again, we would expect to get beneath the absolute level of expense that we put out in that 8-K. We would have to drive our expenses down to match what the market delivers in terms of top line."

What Greg is commenting on is that some of the impact of the higher loss ratio picks for this year, that work having been done at the beginning of the year, now starts showing up relative to last year's lower picks. But generally speaking, that harmonization work is done and we continue to be very pleased with where the loss ratios are going across both segments."

Kai, before I start, a little preface here, attribution to any one of these 3 categories I'm going to give you is difficult with the Reinsurance portfolio. They're large chunky treaties, a handful of them can impact the outcome of any s",530,"Yes, thanks, Mike. Kai, before I start, a little preface here, attribution to any one of these 3 categories I'm going to give you is difficult with the Reinsurance portfolio. They're large chunky treaties, a handful of them can impact the outcome of any subset of our book. But in looking at the 4.4% increase, I'd attribute it roughly 40% to the intersection of cat and non-cat in our property portfolios, 40% to the casualty treaty initial accident year loss pick and about 20% to rate and mix. So let me start with the cat and non-cat. Let's step back for a moment. In the financial supplement, we have 2 lines in there that really are impacted predominantly by property catastrophe. The property cat line, which is the pure excess of loss cat reinsurance that we write, and the property treaty line, which is the per risk and the pro rata, which has both cat and non-cat exposures in it. So with that property treaty book, we set a loss ratio pick for the year. It's comprised of cat, large loss and attritional. And as the quarters unfold, we tend to react -- not react to reported experience, particularly because it's very limited early in the year, and instead prefer to true that up at the end of the year. And so it's in line with our bad news fast, good news slow philosophy that you see that, what I referred to, which is higher in the first half of the year, lower in the second half of the year. Of course, I would not be doing my job if I didn't point out future loss activity could happen that would vary this outcome depending upon how losses broke. The second piece of the casualty and quite simply our casualty treaty portfolio relative to last year, the legacy Catlin business, is now set at a higher initial pick in line with the legacy XL book. This increase was established during the fourth quarter of last year, which was another full review quarter and where we harmonized our accident year picks, which Mike just talked about. We then project that forward to the current accident year, which we've done. And then here, again, we allow this to season over a number of years to make sure any good news that might emerge is real and solid. And finally, the third piece, rate and mix. Rate, as we've been talking about, has been done over the last 2 years. So you're seeing a little bit of a small impact from that in increased loss ratios in 2016, and mix has impacted the loss ratio a bit, although it's not really mix across those different segments of the portfolio, it's within this segment certain treaties that we've written that might -- because a number of these classes, particularly casualty, we roll our accident year pick up by treaty. So the mix of how those break in a given year will be impacted. So intersection of property cat and non-cat, casualty treaty portfolio, rate and mix, and I think this is just a very prudent way to run our book for long-term success. Paul?"

I mean as we've talked about before, we started sort of reunderwriting even before May when we came together. And I think that the impact of some of those actions around exiting some lines of business, it takes a bit of time for that to start to run through in the loss ratio because you obviously still have the unearned premium to earn through. We're also very focused in terms of additional underwriting actions that we can take. We've got a big lift in terms of how we think about pricing and portfolio analysis by bringing the businesses together and we've been working on some of those insights, and that is starting to show through in the numbers in the second quarter."

So there's no good way to give you a good idea that this was just a piece, but this is just a piece of this puzzle, was the -- that lumpiness of earned premium. And we will have that in Reinsurance as we go quarter-to-quarter."

Let me give you a few really important notions. Number one, the market share, Greg will talk about. But our view was that by becoming a leader in the reinsurance marketplace, and particularly in the catastrophe marketplace where we had a very long track record of extraordinary results, was the way that we could continue to participate effectively in that marketplace given the structural changes that are going on. So in essence, size is really mattering in reinsurance and we believe that pushing those expertises into greater concentration would give us an opportunity to ride through those structural changes. The guys who are getting hurt by all the alternative capital coming in are largely the smaller players. So we think we've been well-positioned. We think that also is going to give us the opportunity over time and we've already some of this particularly in terms of terms and conditions to lead the market where it needs to go, not just follow. So we're very pleased with the position we charted intentionally. And we see this quarter as a reflection of that larger share of market. Having said that, when it relates to how we consider our reinsurance programs, the reinsurance programs now put together for the whole firm. And we can therefore are able, as Paul noted, to cede less with what we think is actually better protection to our peak exposures and better protection to the overall loss experience. So we already are seeing the benefits to those lower sections of profits and we think equal to or better protections for the firm. How individual cats play out is a whole different story. You never know what zone you're going to get hit in, how that fits with the whole story. But this quarter, we would tell you this came out as expected, it came out relative to our market share or better across the various events."

When I look at this, if I'm really forcing to estimate a re market loss, I'd give you a much broader range than I gave you on the industry loss. So the $15 billion to $20 billion industry loss could be around about $5 billion to $7.5 billion of reinsured market loss. And when we look at our numbers, we have $167 million of gross loss in the current quarter events from these cats and that gives us about a 2% to 3.5% market share, somewhere framed between that 2.5% overall market share and the 4% to 5% cat market share.

We are driving our expenses down to expand our margins, not consume them by worse performing business. So our pricing strategy remains unchanged. It is about the risk we are taking on and taking it on appropriately. And while that is difficult to do in this market, that's why I emphasized the statistics I did at the beginning of the call. We're seeing more volume from which to choose, but we're finding our success rate against that volume to be the same as it was before. And that I think reflects that market discipline. And as I mentioned briefly in my remarks, we also have a rigorous process that is done through crosschecking of teams across different lines to make sure that our adherence to our pricing principles is done appropriately. So we would not chase top line just because we would get more efficient. We've been looking to apply that more efficient operation to expanding our margins.

Perhaps I was -- I apologize, I wasn't probably clear in the opening remarks.

The harmonization would have put Catlin at the end of the year kind of to the midpoint of the range, as we would expect, and then we'll see what happens over time. In terms of the specifics right now, I won't be doing this again, to be blunt, because in future quarters, you just won't be able to tell where it came from. It's getting too far away from when the books were run separately. And of course, since 8 months of last year, we were operating as a combined business, pricing in a combined way. It just gets less and less meaningful to try and ascribe attribution. But if you did look backward and try and sort it out in this quarter, you did see some releases from things that were attributable to Catlin activity in the past. You saw some that were attributable to XL activity in the past. There was no one theme. And so I think that overall guidance was true in this quarter, and we think it'll be true going forward."

We certainly see pricing, particularly in the markets I've talked about, short tail lines and the global cat -- U.S. short tail lines and the global casualty book, we see pricing there very much reaching the bottom. Now from my perspective, we could be at the bottom for a while and we think we're well-suited and well-prepared to do very well and succeed if it stays in the bottom. I don't see anything at the moment that would indicate a rush of capital coming into the business that would change that dynamic of a lowering or diminishing of the rate of decrease and kind of a flattening coming in. And the other part of the question I heard was around just kind of who we are. We definitely operate in a syndicated marketplace, so I would think from what I've heard so far anyways, these are in line with what some of our larger peers are saying. We do view ourselves as a market leader and we think June 1, for the renewals in particular, we would say our book there relative to the 3% decline for cat overall, we were flat in Florida. We felt we were really one of the handful of market leaders around pushing the AOB prices in the state, and so we're definitely differentiated between clients that have a good forum and look after that exposure and have a great claims capability. With the idea that when an event comes, those that aren't well-prepared will have higher losses. So we reduced our exposure in the state. We've reshaped our portfolio there a bit and, just to me, this is -- the ability to do that is a good sign that there wasn't a bunch of capital rushing in and people cutting off our ability to do that."

I think Paul identified only casualty as relatively flat. I think Greg identified casualty as relatively flat. Well, given this interest rate, if casualty isn't flat, we're all idiots. So to me, the fact that some areas are a little bit flatter or slowing down isn't the same as saying this is a sustainable market condition. And so our people are rightly picking their way through and being very cautious, but certainly hunting for opportunity. And I do think your point is right. Over time, I expect our different market position, which we hear compliments about constantly, can yield a bit of a difference but we've encouraged our people to be -- to hunt for that growth but be careful. And given that they know how serious we are about that, I wouldn't have expected to see that hit ratio move at this point. There are a couple of things that give us greater confidence over time, and why I did say in my comments that we could see some acceleration of our opportunity. Number one, it's known to everyone that every player in this phase shows distress to varying degrees. And we've certainly got some of our key competitors who are showing that. And when that kind of thing happens, our underwriters are going through a very careful exercise to identify accounts that either they have personal history or knowledge with or where we know that's our kind of risk. And then we do target and go after things. That could, I think, and has been showing signs of success in that activity. And it wouldn't surprise me if that improved our image, because you're kind of pre-selecting. So that can help. A second thing that we've been doing, and it's really, again, I think accelerating, is we've been working very hard to make sure that our line sizes with good clients reflect our good new position in the market and aren't just static to one or the other companies' historical level of participation. Those are obviously good adds, because you know those accounts very, very well. So I do see opportunities for it to accelerate, but I'm not at all displeased to see the equation I described at this point. Sure, we could see that. I'm very pleased with our underwriting discipline. And I just -- I know a lot of our underwriters and the actuaries and the folks that support us that they listen to these calls and I just want them to know I'm very pleased. Let's keep hunting for those opportunities. And if we can show a difference in that way, I'll be even more pleased."

As Mike said, given the share price today, it's hard to justify taking capital and doing -- and buying in debt rather than buying in stock. We are cognizant that, that ratio though really can't go up meaningfully. It really hasn't gone up over the last couple of quarters at least. We do have $300 million of debt coming due in 2018, right, so there is something out there in the midterm that you might think that would be unlikely to be refinanced as a result of that. But it is something that we weigh pretty much every quarter about is that, do we need to do something? So one thing I would say is that anything that we did on the debt side, it would only be 25% of what we would have to do pretty much on the buyback side."

Tonight, as is our normal practice, I'll share some highlights from the quarter of the results, Pete will discuss the financials, and then Greg and Paul will go through the Insurance and Reinsurance segmen",789,"Good evening, and thank you for joining our call. Tonight, as is our normal practice, I'll share some highlights from the quarter of the results, Pete will discuss the financials, and then Greg and Paul will go through the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, retrospectively.
Turning to our results. The most notable aspect of the quarter, as it has been through the entire sector, was the high level of catastrophes. We preannounced our losses of $240 million due to these events back on July 13. The major sources of loss were the wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta; the earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador; and U.S. and European storms. These events reduced our second quarter operating earnings by $0.84 per share, $0.84 per share. As you will hear in greater detail from Greg and from Paul, these losses were in line with our expectations and in line with or below our market share, and it is noteworthy that both segments turned a profit despite these losses.
Turning then to our underlying performance in the quarter. We would say, simply, this is more like it. The quarter was largely free of distortions related to the Catlin acquisition, and many of the metrics suggest that we have taken an important step forward in the right direction. Despite the cat events and including $52 million in integration cost, in the second quarter, XL Catlin generated $0.37 in operating earnings per share and grew fully diluted tangible book value per share by 3.6%. XL Catlin's ex cat accident year P&C combined ratio of 90.3% was an improvement of 1.8 points from the first quarter of the year and 2 points from the second quarter a year ago. These improvements came from both operating and underwriting discipline. Let me focus briefly on underwriting discipline.
You've heard us often comment that we believe that this combination of XL and Catlin has really changed our relationship to the market. We know that the way clients and brokers think about us is truly different. And as a result, we have been given the opportunity to write things that neither XL nor Catlin would have seen before. And what we're seeing now is the effect of these new opportunities and the effect of our discipline come together. You'll hear in a moment from Paul that when you take out programs we're exiting, the growth rate in Insurance was actually about 5%. So why would we be having that success?
Well, submission volume is up from our top broker partners, and we are quoting a commensurate more amount. But our hit ratio, the amount that we actually write when we quote, has stayed flat. Meaning we're finding about the same portion that we are willing to write on our conditions but we're getting a greater volume to select from. This gives me comfort that we are not chasing business, as does our system of back-checking price adequacy. This is the hallmark of underwriting discipline, and while this progress has been building quarter-over-quarter, it is exactly the kind of thing that we believe we should be able to continue to produce, even accelerate, as our underwriting teams are really hitting their strides. We are very proud of the hard work of our underwriters and their support teams in these difficult market conditions.
Before I turn it over to Pete to discuss our financial results, I'll make 2 brief comments on other important topics that I'm sure are on your minds. First is Brexit. We believe we are well-prepared -- as well-prepared as possible for this outcome, that we have thought about the future possibilities and that we're in a great position to respond accordingly to whatever develops.
Second, our parent company move to Bermuda, which was completed as of Monday. Bermuda has served as a base for global insurance and reinsurance providers for decades, and has, in the Bermuda Monetary Authority, a proven world-class regulator. XL has had substantial operations in Bermuda for 30 years. And, of course, it was the corporate home for Catlin before our companies joined. So our integration, combined with Bermuda receiving full Solvency II equivalence early this year, made this a very logical move which we think will serve the company well. We are pleased to be there. It is worth noting from a day per day perspective, our clients, brokers, counterparties and partners should see no change in how we work with them. And as we said before, we expect no material impact to our future results or global effective tax rate as a result of this move.
So in sum, positive progress showed in the numbers in the second quarter. We are determined that it will continue.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."

Operating net income for the second quarter was $106 million or $0.37 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $246 million or $0.84 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included 2 months of the legacy",919,"Well, thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating net income for the second quarter was $106 million or $0.37 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $246 million or $0.84 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included 2 months of the legacy Catlin operations. As indicated in our July 13 8-K, our natural catastrophe losses for the second quarter totaled $240 million compared to $60 million in the prior year quarter. The largest of these events, the wildfires in and around Fort McMurray, accounted for approximately half of our estimate of catastrophe losses for the quarter. During the second quarter, we incurred $52 million in integration costs, which are included in our operating income.
For the quarter, our property and casualty combined ratio was 96%, or 6.1 points higher than the same quarter last year, again, primarily driven by those catastrophe losses. As Mike noted, our ex cat accident year combined ratio was 90.3%, or 2 points better than the preceding period last year. Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As discussed on previous calls, the second and fourth quarters are significant reserve valuation quarters and as a result, we reacted appropriately to any development indications identified during those in-depth reviews. Prior year net development in the second quarter was a favorable $99 million or 3.9 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $109 million or 5.3 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $34 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $65 million in the Reinsurance segment.
Operating expenses have remained generally flat compared to the first quarter of this year and slightly higher than the second quarter of 2015 due to legacy Catlin costs being included only from May 2015 onwards. We continue to view full year overall expense levels and integration expense levels as in line with the estimates provided in our 8-K filed in June.
Our estimated operating tax rate to ordinary shareholders remains consistent with the 10% to 12% we noted in April, with adjustments to the prior year tax revisions lowering the 6-month rate to 8.8%. Our annualized operating ROE, excluding integration cost and AOCI, was 5.7% for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, and was significantly impacted by the catastrophe losses in the second quarter.
Turning to the investment portfolio, and as usual, my comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income was $176 million, in line with the same quarter last year and greater than the $164 million in the previous quarter. While the low interest rate environment continued to pressure net investment income, the second quarter benefited to a modest extent from some nonrecurring factors including certain amortization adjustments. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.1 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the second quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7%.
The gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio at the end of June was 2.3%, virtually unchanged from the first quarter. The duration of the fixed income and cash portfolio was 3.3 years at the end of the quarter, marginally higher than the prior year quarter mainly due to cash being put to work. Total affiliate income was $35 million for the quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter. While our hedge fund affiliate portfolio broke even for the quarter, it did not meet its benchmarks. Many of our funds pursuing quantitative equity strategies were challenged and several of our directional equity funds did not fully capture the market rally. On a year-to-date basis, our hedge fund portfolio continues to outperform its benchmark and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns.
Our private equity, strategic and other operating affiliates posted relatively strong equity earnings. Our investment manager affiliates contributed $15 million to affiliate income, with the gain on the sale of an individual position being an important contributor. Unrealized net gains are $1.14 billion at the end of the quarter. The total mark-to-market return on investments was 1.5% for the quarter in original currency. The favorable return was driven by lower rates, which more than offset the adverse impact in credit spread widening. Looking forward, we expect financial markets to remain volatile over the near to midterm, and we will continue to monitor our portfolios closely as a result.
And with respect to capital management, we continued to execute share buybacks during the second quarter. Our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback program at our May meeting, authorizing the purchase of up to $1 billion of our ordinary shares, replacing the remaining amount under our previous share buyback authorization. During the quarter, we purchased 9.7 million shares for $328 million at an average price of $34 per share, leaving $860 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. This accelerated rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April, as well as a slight acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.
I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."

I am pleased to report our 14th consecutive quarter o",843,"Thanks, Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management.
First, the results. I am pleased to report our 14th consecutive quarter of profitability dating back to Q1 2013 despite higher cat activity we experienced during the quarter. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.4% compared to 97% in Q2 2015 and 96.5% last quarter. Higher cat expense of $97 million compared to $60 million in Q2 2015, and slightly lower prior year reserve releases of $34 million compared to $38 million last year are more than offset by material improvements in the underwriting expense ratio of 1.8 points and the accident year ex cat loss ratio of 1.1 points. On an accident quarter ex cat basis, the combined ratio was 92.6% compared to 95.4% in Q2 2015 and 95% last quarter.
For Q2, we report an acquisition ratio of 13.7% compared to 12.9% in Q2 2015 and 14.1% reported last quarter. This is more in line with the guidance provided last quarter. The reason for the slight increase over prior year is because Q2 2015 only reflected 2 months of the Catlin business, which included the largest share of wholesale specialty business where the gross acquisition costs are higher and the loss ratio is lower than the legacy XL business. This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a Q2 operating expense ratio of 18.1%, which was 2.6 points lower than Q2 2015, and by a net accident year ex cat loss ratio of 60.8%, which was 1.1 points lower than Q2 2015.
Pricing has remained broadly consistent at minus 3% in the quarter. Our casualty lines showed flat pricing in the quarter. Our professional and specialty businesses were both down 3%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the North American professional, aviation and crisis management lines; and our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%.
Insurance gross premiums written in Q2 increased by 13% or $292 million year-over-year, driven mostly from the Catlin acquisition where we had 3 months of the Catlin business in the quarter versus only 2 months in Q2 2015. When we look at those legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was circa 1% in Q2. However, when you consider the portfolio-tuning activities that started in 2015, whereas mentioned previously decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses totaling approximately $100 million in the quarter, we see growth in the range of 5%, and 3% on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth demonstrates that whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction into finding new profitable opportunities.
Driving some of these opportunities was also the addition of new talent, as Q2 was a strong quarter for new leaders of both existing and new businesses. We recruited Dan Riordan to lead our Global Political Risk & Trade Credit business; Patrick Corbett joined to head our new Retail Accident & Health business; Simon Mobey was added to head our Ultra High Net Worth; Brian Benjamin joined to lead our Global Mergers and Acquisitions businesses; and Stephen Oh was recruited to lead our Excess & Surplus lines business. We fully expect these new leaders and businesses to add further profitable growth to the segment in both the short and long term.
For the Insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $732 million compared to $818 million in Q2 2015. This represents 29.1% of GPW compared to 36.8% in Q2 2015 and 39.9% reported in Q1 2016. As mentioned last quarter, ceded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we purchase our reinsurance program, the timing of our reinsurance program purchasing as we move towards an enterprise-wide reinsurance program.
On a year-to-date basis, our cession ratio is 34.5% compared to 35.7% in 2015, and we expect this to further reduce as the full year unfolds and we fully transition to our enterprise-wide reinsurance program. The benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the group's risk return profile with strong coordination across our wider capital strategy.
It is essential that we react to the top line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter, we selectively exited another 35 positions for a total of over 70 positions during the first half as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across our divisions and regions. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will flow through in subsequent quarters, along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway.
In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continue to grow the book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And we fully expect this to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus.
And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."

Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter with added color on property catastrophe losses and summarize current market conditions.
Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced acceptable underlying performance, given the property catastrophe activity with a calendar-quarter combined ratio of 95.1% compared with 74.5% for the second quarter of last year. The results for the quarter experienced favorable prior year development, increased accident quarter ex cat loss ratio and property catastrophe losses, offset by a lower expense ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $65 million compared to $71 million a year ago. As Pete noted, in the second quarter, we completed a full review of our reserves and the releases were primarily in casualty classes. This quarter, we see the impact of the aligned parameters and reserving assumptions across both legacy companies for prior and current accident years. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios.
The Reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 54.4%, which compares to 50% in the second quarter of 2015. The increase is driven primarily by last year's harmonized accident year loss ratio fix across the combined segment, particularly in the casualty treaty and property catastrophe exposed portfolios. As we have noted in previous calls, XL Catlin's philosophy on reserving is to take bad news quickly and allow good news to fully season. In particular, for property catastrophe exposed treaties, we allowed for the seasonality of exposure and a lag for delayed reporting from our clients. Further, within the reinsurance segment, we recorded attritional cat losses in the accident year ex cat loss ratio. This produces a higher accident year ex cat loss ratio in the first half of the year relative to the second half. This can be seen in the historical accident year ex cat quarterly loss ratios for the legacy XL portfolio.
Catastrophe losses totaled $143 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared to no catastrophe losses in the second quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter resulted from numerous events and produced between $15 billion and $20 billion of market-insured loss around the globe. For context, we estimate that XL Catlin Re has roughly a 2.5% share of the $150 billion global property and casualty reinsurance market, and between 4% and 5% of the $20 billion to $25 billion catastrophe excess of loss market. While a precise reinsured market loss estimate is difficult to calculate, we are satisfied that our losses in the quarter were at or below our market share. As we have noted previously, our combined catastrophe portfolio will produce higher nominal dollars of loss relative to the legacy XL book but is a better diversified portfolio.
The expense ratio decreased 4.7 points to 30.6% in the second quarter compared to 35.3% for the second quarter of 2015. This decrease is primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies earn through. Further, we saw a 1.9 point drop at our acquisition expense as the impact from purchase accounting begins to diminish.
Turning to top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $1.02 billion, up from $782 million in the second quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. April 1 was the last renewal to complete as a combined company and we were able to grow our share of the Japanese market, contributing to $221 million of new business across the segment. This is offset by continued underwriting discipline as we nonrenewed nearly $100 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms. And finally, a long-standing client decided to retain a quota share treaty, which resulted in just over $80 million of nonrenewed premium. On a combined basis for the full quarter, our top line grew 2% after adjusting for foreign exchange and reinstatement premiums.
Shifting to reinsurance market conditions. We found the pricing environment challenging, but great decreases continued to decelerate in most lines and regions and we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business. During the quarter, rates for this segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 3% this quarter, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015. In the remainder of the property treaty book, rates were also down 3%. Our casualty business renewed essentially flat over last year and the remainder of our classes were flat to down low single digits. Overall, the U.S. short-tail and global casualty treaty markets resisted any meaningful reductions on renewals as many placements were repriced or failed to reach their target placements.
In summary, the second quarter results were acceptable for the Reinsurance segment. Despite increased cat activity, we were able to generate an underwriting profit in the quarter. Underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. Entering our second year together, we are well-positioned for success, given the strong support from our clients and brokers.
I'll now turn it back to David."

A couple of things. First of all, we are continuing to execute on our synergy program, and that benefit continues to grow in its impact over time depending, of course, on the timing of departures, the timing of shut-downs of systems, all those things that we've been doing have a growing impact on into next year. So those are the sources and those are the reasons that it continues to grow as it's just timing of the execution. We have had some continuing activity, as Paul described. And those just kind of go on top of what we've done before and continue to earn out again according to the actual departure dates or shutdowns of operations. So we do expect the expense ratio and the absolute level of expenses to be able to continue to decline. Of course, in the end, expense ratios are a coefficient between what goes on with the top line and that absolute level of expense. And there, we are seeing some meaningful growth. As you would have heard, when you ex out programs that we're exiting, our Insurance operations, for example, grew about 5%. We saw some growth in the Reinsurance segment as well. And so that can have a continuing improvement effect on the ratio. In terms of the absolute level of expense, we remain on track to deliver what we said we would deliver, as we issued in the 8-K, where we gave you a forecast all the way through to next year. I would only add one other thought, and that is the -- I think that there's one point that I've made over time but I don't know that I've made it emphatically enough. When we established that 8-K level of expense for next year, that was based on a series of presumptions about what volume of premium we'd be working with because, of course, some costs are variable and some are fixed. But I want to make it clear that if for some reason, and I wouldn't forecast it today, but if for some reason we see the market get from here even more difficult than it has been, and you've heard both Greg and Paul talk about some decline or -- in the rate of deterioration or in Greg's case, perhaps reaching a bottom in some lines, but if it were to suddenly get worse again, we would expect to get beneath the absolute level of expense that we put out in that 8-K. We would have to drive our expenses down to match what the market delivers in terms of top line."

Kai, before I start, a little preface here, attribution to any one of these 3 categories I'm going to give you is difficult with the Reinsurance portfolio. They're large chunky treaties, a handful of them can impact the outcome of any subset of our book. But in looking at the 4.4% increase, I'd attribute it roughly 40% to the intersection of cat and non-cat in our property portfolios, 40% to the casualty treaty initial accident year loss pick and about 20% to rate and mix. So let me start with the cat and non-cat. Let's step back for a moment. In the financial supplement, we have 2 lines in there that really are impacted predominantly by property catastrophe. The property cat line, which is the pure excess of loss cat reinsurance that we write, and the property treaty line, which is the per risk and the pro rata, which has both cat and non-cat exposures in it. So with that property treaty book, we set a loss ratio pick for the year. It's comprised of cat, large loss and attritional. And as the quarters unfold, we tend to react -- not react to reported experience, particularly because it's very limited early in the year, and instead prefer to true that up at the end of the year. And so it's in line with our bad news fast, good news slow philosophy that you see that, what I referred to, which is higher in the first half of the year, lower in the second half of the year. Of course, I would not be doing my job if I didn't point out future loss activity could happen that would vary this outcome depending upon how losses broke. The second piece of the casualty and quite simply our casualty treaty portfolio relative to last year, the legacy Catlin business, is now set at a higher initial pick in line with the legacy XL book. This increase was established during the fourth quarter of last year, which was another full review quarter and where we harmonized our accident year picks, which Mike just talked about. We then project that forward to the current accident year, which we've done. And then here, again, we allow this to season over a number of years to make sure any good news that might emerge is real and solid. And finally, the third piece, rate and mix. Rate, as we've been talking about, has been done over the last 2 years. So you're seeing a little bit of a small impact from that in increased loss ratios in 2016, and mix has impacted the loss ratio a bit, although it's not really mix across those different segments of the portfolio, it's within this segment certain treaties that we've written that might -- because a number of these classes, particularly casualty, we roll our accident year pick up by treaty. So the mix of how those break in a given year will be impacted. So intersection of property cat and non-cat, casualty treaty portfolio, rate and mix, and I think this is just a very prudent way to run our book for long-term success. Paul?"

I mean as we've talked about before, we started sort of reunderwriting even before May when we came together.

We've got a big lift in terms of how we think about pricing and portfolio analysis by bringing the businesses together and we've been working on some of those insights, and that is starting to show through in the numbers in the second quarter."

And I also commented that our corporate expenses, mostly as a result of that, were lower than what you would expect mostly for timing. And in this quarter, that timing reversed. I would say the corporate expenses are higher than what I would say the normal run rate would be. And so therefore, you will have seen that allocation change a little bit to the segment but not -- and not in a material amount. The difference from quarter-to-quarter for corporate was about $20-odd million, right? And if -- and again, as I think about corporate going forward, it'll be a little bit less than what we had in this quarter so far but not materially. And so the -- there wasn't an allocation change, it was more just the way that the accruals ran through the corporate segment."

Let me give you a few really important notions. Number one, the market share, Greg will talk about. But our view was that by becoming a leader in the reinsurance marketplace, and particularly in the catastrophe marketplace where we had a very long track record of extraordinary results, was the way that we could continue to participate effectively in that marketplace given the structural changes that are going on. So in essence, size is really mattering in reinsurance and we believe that pushing those expertises into greater concentration would give us an opportunity to ride through those structural changes. The guys who are getting hurt by all the alternative capital coming in are largely the smaller players. So we think we've been well-positioned. We think that also is going to give us the opportunity over time and we've already some of this particularly in terms of terms and conditions to lead the market where it needs to go, not just follow. So we're very pleased with the position we charted intentionally. And we see this quarter as a reflection of that larger share of market. Having said that, when it relates to how we consider our reinsurance programs, the reinsurance programs now put together for the whole firm. And we can therefore are able, as Paul noted, to cede less with what we think is actually better protection to our peak exposures and better protection to the overall loss experience. So we already are seeing the benefits to those lower sections of profits and we think equal to or better protections for the firm. How individual cats play out is a whole different story. You never know what zone you're going to get hit in, how that fits with the whole story. But this quarter, we would tell you this came out as expected, it came out relative to our market share or better across the various events."

When I look at this, if I'm really forcing to estimate a re market loss, I'd give you a much broader range than I gave you on the industry loss. So the $15 billion to $20 billion industry loss could be around about $5 billion to $7.5 billion of reinsured market loss. And when we look at our numbers, we have $167 million of gross loss in the current quarter events from these cats and that gives us about a 2% to 3.5% market share, somewhere framed between that 2.5% overall market share and the 4% to 5% cat market share.

But if you did look backward and try and sort it out in this quarter, you did see some releases from things that were attributable to Catlin activity in the past. You saw some that were attributable to XL activity in the past. There was no one theme. And so I think that overall guidance was true in this quarter, and we think it'll be true going forward."

And I think the answer I heard was that you're leveraging the size of the platform to drive that. So I mean, the question I guess I have is twofold. One, do you have any sense if that level of holding line on price is consistent with what other reinsurers of a similar size are seeing in the market?

On the cat book, the 3% this quarter relative to 8% last year certainly is a much improved, if you'll pardon the term, result relative to the prior year. We certainly see pricing, particularly in the markets I've talked about, short tail lines and the global cat -- U.S. short tail lines and the global casualty book, we see pricing there very much reaching the bottom. Now from my perspective, we could be at the bottom for a while and we think we're well-suited and well-prepared to do very well and succeed if it stays in the bottom. I don't see anything at the moment that would indicate a rush of capital coming into the business that would change that dynamic of a lowering or diminishing of the rate of decrease and kind of a flattening coming in. And the other part of the question I heard was around just kind of who we are. We definitely operate in a syndicated marketplace, so I would think from what I've heard so far anyways, these are in line with what some of our larger peers are saying. We do view ourselves as a market leader and we think June 1, for the renewals in particular, we would say our book there relative to the 3% decline for cat overall, we were flat in Florida. We felt we were really one of the handful of market leaders around pushing the AOB prices in the state, and so we're definitely differentiated between clients that have a good forum and look after that exposure and have a great claims capability. With the idea that when an event comes, those that aren't well-prepared will have higher losses. So we reduced our exposure in the state. We've reshaped our portfolio there a bit and, just to me, this is -- the ability to do that is a good sign that there wasn't a bunch of capital rushing in and people cutting off our ability to do that."

I think Paul identified only casualty as relatively flat. I think Greg identified casualty as relatively flat. Well, given this interest rate, if casualty isn't flat, we're all idiots. So to me, the fact that some areas are a little bit flatter or slowing down isn't the same as saying this is a sustainable market condition. And so our people are rightly picking their way through and being very cautious, but certainly hunting for opportunity. And I do think your point is right. Over time, I expect our different market position, which we hear compliments about constantly, can yield a bit of a difference but we've encouraged our people to be -- to hunt for that growth but be careful. And given that they know how serious we are about that, I wouldn't have expected to see that hit ratio move at this point. There are a couple of things that give us greater confidence over time, and why I did say in my comments that we could see some acceleration of our opportunity. Number one, it's known to everyone that every player in this phase shows distress to varying degrees. And we've certainly got some of our key competitors who are showing that. And when that kind of thing happens, our underwriters are going through a very careful exercise to identify accounts that either they have personal history or knowledge with or where we know that's our kind of risk. And then we do target and go after things. That could, I think, and has been showing signs of success in that activity. And it wouldn't surprise me if that improved our image, because you're kind of pre-selecting. So that can help. A second thing that we've been doing, and it's really, again, I think accelerating, is we've been working very hard to make sure that our line sizes with good clients reflect our good new position in the market and aren't just static to one or the other companies' historical level of participation. Those are obviously good adds, because you know those accounts very, very well. So I do see opportunities for it to accelerate, but I'm not at all displeased to see the equation I described at this point. Sure, we could see that. I'm very pleased with our underwriting discipline. And I just -- I know a lot of our underwriters and the actuaries and the folks that support us that they listen to these calls and I just want them to know I'm very pleased. Let's keep hunting for those opportunities. And if we can show a difference in that way, I'll be even more pleased."

We are cognizant that, that ratio though really can't go up meaningfully. It really hasn't gone up over the last couple of quarters at least. We do have $300 million of debt coming due in 2018, right, so there is something out there in the midterm that you might think that would be unlikely to be refinanced as a result of that.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain matters we discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including and estimates on losses resulting from recent national catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to manufacturers including those identified in our most reports on forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date in which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statements and response to new information, future developments or otherwise provide our call today also includes management financial measures.

Tonight, I'll share some highlights from the quarterly results, Pete will discussed the financial and then Paul and Greg will go to the insurance and reinsurance segments, respectively. And then I'll come",1007,"Good evening, and thank you for joining our call. Tonight, I'll share some highlights from the quarterly results, Pete will discussed the financial and then Paul and Greg will go to the insurance and reinsurance segments, respectively. And then I'll come back to make a few comments on our realigned P&C operating model and some related role changes which we announced this morning. We will then open it up for questions. As I commented in the results press release, this is the second quarter of solid progress and seeing the power of the business that we are building emerged in the numbers.
I see 5 solid trends that demonstrate how we are doing the right things and especially the right things given the difficult market conditions in which we operate. First, as Paul will detail, our submissions have gone up both in quantity and the variety risk we are asked to look at. This means our trading partners like doing business with us and wants to do more. This is a reflection of our successful combination. Second, our underwriters are doing the really tough work and it is hard for them to find adequately priced risk. This quarter, our reinsurance book was the driver of some growth in a somewhat bottoming pricing environment and our insurance book, when you take out the noise created by underwriting actions also showed modest growth year-over-year.
So our underwriters are doing the right stuff, but you only see modest growth as a result of their efforts and even these greater submissions because it's so tough to find the risk that is appropriately price. That is exactly what a good underwriting company does in times like these.
Third, despite multiple years of pricing deterioration, our loss ratio continues to improve year-over-year. Now I know it ticked up a bit in the third quarter relative to the second but with a book like ours, we do not find this meaningful. Paul can get into that with a little more color. But when you look at it year-over-year, we see significant and sustained improvement. Fourth, our expenses continue to decline as we have said they would, which taken together with our underwriting actions, is producing our overall improved combined ratio. And then fifth, we continue to repurchase shares in line with what we told you we would do and let's say, with some opportunistic clear.
These are the 5 things you should be expecting us to do given market conditions and our numbers bear it out. So turning to these results. Excluding the Catlin integration cost of $55 million, operating earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64 and the operating ROE, excluding unrealized gains and losses was 6.6% for the quarter.
Our P&C combined ratio in the quarter of 93.1% was an improvement of 2.2 points from quarter 3 a year ago. That's where the expense-and-loss ratio improvements are coming through. Our P&C top-line growth is 2% year-over-year was largely driven by reinsurance, where as I mentioned, we are finding a few more opportunities. But insurance, when you take out the noise, also showed underlying growth of 2% in the quarter. So we see this as good progress that we can continue. Before I turn it over to Pete, 2 other items of note. I comment on the recent hurricanes and a few thoughts on our innovation efforts. First, hurricane Nicole, while not financially significant, obviously was a near direct hit to Bermuda and when you are a Bermuda-based company, this, of course, makes it very personal. Happily, our people fared well and the company has minimal disruption and the island and its people once again demonstrated their tremendous resilience.
With respect to Hurricane Matthew, it's early in the process. To give some meaning to that, you can understand that this is a difficult claims environment with regard to wind versus flood. Moreover for us, it is even more complicated because as a large commercial property underwriter, they may well be some pinpoint losses covered by commercial flood insurance added to what we are observing in reinsurance. But with what we've seen so far and with both sources of loss in mind, we'd estimate a range of between $100 million and $2 million of loss -- and $200 million of loss. And although it is early, there is nothing that we're seeing that is giving us any surprise. We will make a pre-announcement as things clarify further.
Then as to innovation. I want to emphasize this because quite remarkable, when you consider all of the other things going on, this difficult and intense operational objectives of ours. First, as we'll talk about later, we had news today about Paul Brand for the new role he will be taking in leading our innovation effort. He'll have a small team, some of which is already recruited to push us forward faster. I think in retrospect, this will be seen as a important moment in the history of our company. Second, our XL innovative efforts continue to bear more and more fruit and you'll see more and more announcements about the new renovations we're pushing into the market and new investments we're making.
And finally then there's our relationship with [indiscernible], a leader in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence which has taken off and we are actively at work with them in some very exciting new projects, teaching us about risk in these new autonomous systems, the Internet of Things and how we can think about potentially using dynamic pricing.
So we see our innovation efforts as maturing, not just in the many citations for the new products introduced, which we've always enjoyed, not just in the many new pricing models that work in the company but in these even more fundamental and potentially revolutionary ways.
We are proud of the way our underwriters are working our way through this market. We're excited about our progress and the way these trends indicate that more progress is at hand.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."
406440,404123049,1062336,"XL Group Ltd, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Mike shared with you the improvement in our operating net income per share versus the same quarter last year. We achieved this even with significantly higher catastrophe losses in the third quarter than we had in the same q",1041,"Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Mike shared with you the improvement in our operating net income per share versus the same quarter last year. We achieved this even with significantly higher catastrophe losses in the third quarter than we had in the same quarter a year ago. Our natural catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premiums for the third quarter, totaled $97 million or 4.1 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $31 million or 1.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. The 2.2-point improvement in our P&C combined ratio versus the same quarter last year was driven by the improvements in the operating expense ratio, and Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As David mentioned, we've provided several slides this quarter in addition to our normal materials. These slides are in response to the numerous requests from investors and analysts that we provide for the clarity of our view of our ongoing business.
Slide 5 details the improvement in the third quarter 2016 earnings per share compared to last year. Slide 6 pictorially shows what we disclosed in our June 8-K on expenses. As we turn to Slide 7, we provide a normalized view of our 9-month operating ROE, excluding net unrealized investment gains that includes adjustments to reported results for the timing differences and to our naturally barring elements of our results.
We start with our operating ROE excluding net unrealized investment gains. The first adjustment is to simply exclude integration costs which are nonrecurring.
The next adjustment is to annualized our preferred dividends, most of which are incurred in the first and third quarters. The next 3 adjustments used the Street's consensus view at the beginning of 2016 for key areas of volatility.
We have chosen to normalize using the Street's consensus view to avoid making qualitative adjustments and to use information produced by the investment community. This is not an endorsement of the Street's consensus view. We simply obtained the Street's consensus for each column for the full year, multiply it by 75% and then subtracted our actual 9 months result and then tax effected it.
The adjustment to prior year development has been included to reflect that we conduct in-depth reviews of our reserves only twice each year and as a result, our prior development does not emerge equally by quarter. The next 2 adjustments to our affiliate assets and catastrophes are in attempt to normalize for naturally volatile parts of our operations.
With these adjustments, our annualized ROE for the first 3 quarters of 2016 will be 8.6%. I know the slide has limitations, but I hope you'll find it responsive. Operating expenses improved compared to both the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2015 as our ongoing integration and synergy benefits take hold. Our estimates for operating expense levels for the rest of this year and next year remain in line with those provided in our 8-K filed in June, except for an estimated additional $10 million and one-time integration cost in the fourth quarter of this year due to the change in our insurance operating model.
As is our normal practice, during the first and third quarters, our reserve in process is based on our review of our actual versus expected losses. Our semiannual full actuarial review will be included in next quarter's results. Prior year net development in the third quarter was a favorable $54 million or 2.3 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $28 million or 1.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015.
This reflects favorable development of $23 million in the insurance segment and $31 million in the Reinsurance segment. As detailed in our financial supplement, our estimated operating tax rate, exclusive of discrete impacts, has declined to 8.5% reflecting breadth of distribution of our underwriting profits.
Fully diluted booked value per share grew by 1.6% in the third quarter and by 9% in the 9 months ended September 30.
Turning to the investment portfolio, and as usual, my comments will exclude the life funds withheld assets. Net investment income was $171 million compared to $179 million for the prior year third quarter and $176 million in the second quarter, which as I mentioned last quarter, was somewhat elevated for a few nonrecurring factors. Net investment income will continue to remain under pressure given the current low interest rate environment and from lower cash flow as a result of our share repurchase program. We have approximately $3.5 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the  third quarter, our average new money rate was 1.9%. And at the end of September, the gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio was 2.3% percent and the duration of the total investment portfolio remained at 3.3 years.
Total affiliate income was $25 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year third quarter. All categories of affiliate holdings contributed positive earnings this quarter although the absolute returns from our hedge fund portfolio remained disappointing. Despite that, we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns over time.
Unrealized net gains were $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Total return on investments was 0.7% for the quarter in original currency.
And with respect to capital management, we continue to execute share buybacks during the third quarter. During the quarter, we purchased 6.6 million shares for $222 million at an average price of $33.61 per share, leaving $594 million available for purchase under our share buyback program.
For the 9 months, we have purchased 26.2 million shares for $905 million at an average price of $34.54.
As I've noted before, this rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April as well as an acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and expect to continue share buybacks at a more modest rate for the rest of the year.
And now I'll turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results."

This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management. First, the results. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.3% compared to 97.2% in Q3 2015 and 96.4% last quarter. Higher cat expense was $71 million, of which $28 million is related to prior quarter cats compared to $7 million in Q3 2015. It was more than offset by prior year reserve releases of $23 million, by material improvements and the underwriting expense ratio of 2 points and a reduction in the x year x cat ratio of 1 point. On x quarter x cat basis, the combined ratio is 93.3% compared to 96.3% in Q3 2015. And if we look at the first 3 quarters we reported, On x year ex cat combined ratio of 93.6% compared to 95.3% in 2015. At Q3, we reported an acquisition ratio with 13.4% compared to 13.2% in Q3 2015 and 13.7% reported last quarter. This continues to be in line with the guidance we've provided in Q1.
This slight increase in acquisition ratio is more than offset by a Q3 operating expense ratio of 18.3%, which was 2.2 points lower than Q3 2015, by a net accident year x cat loss ratio of 61.7% which is 1 point lower than Q3 2015 and give the result of the underwriting work we started last year. Pricing was slightly better at [ph] minus 1.3% for the quarter and minus 2.6% for the full year. Our casualty lines were up 1%. Our specialty business was largely flat with the improvements in our accent and health lines hoplites offset by the continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines.
Our professional businesses were down 2%. Our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5% once again driven by energy and North American property.
Insurance price premiums written in Q3 were down by 2% or $47 million on a reported basis year-over-year and when we normalize the foreign exchange, down less than 1% in the quarter.
However, when you also consider the activities that started in 2015, where decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses, we continuously grow in the 3% range for the business we like on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth demonstrates that whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction into finding new profitable opportunities. As Mike mentioned, we continue to see plenty of new business opportunities. Our submission flow is up 8%. And our credit ratio is a 5% with our top brokers.
So we're seeing more business than we'd like. One of our conversion rates are down 84%, clearly reflecting over underwriting discipline given the market.
For the insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter was $538 million compared to $536 million in Q3 2015. This represents 25% of the GPW compared to 24.3% in Q3 2015.
As mentioned previously, the ceded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance programs and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing. And as a result, the risk concession ratios can and will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
As mentioned in the previous quarter, it is essential to react to the top-line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter, we selectively exited another 15 positions for a total of nearly 90 positions so for this year as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across the segment. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will continue to flow through in subsequent quarters along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway.
In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continue to grow the underlying book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives.
And as we finally -- finalized our business plans for 2017, we fully expect this momentum to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus. And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."

Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 86.5% compared with 91.2% in t",605,"Thanks, Paul. Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 86.5% compared with 91.2% in the third quarter of last year. Results for the quarter experienced favorable prior year development, lower accident quarter ex cat ratio and an improved expense ratio.
Reserve release in the quarter totaled $31 million compared to $35 million a year ago. As Pete noted, the third quarter is not a full valuation quarter and reserve was driven by property classes of business. In particular, our loss from last year's tangent explosion reduced by $7 million and estimates from a number of smaller catastrophe events were lowered. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios.
The reinsurance limit produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 54.9% which compares to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by the tangent event last year also predominantly by a handful of medium size of 9 cat losses as well as a smaller impact from a change and mix of business and market conditions.
Catastrophe losses totaled $26 billion, net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter, compared to $23 million in the third quarter of last year.
The cat activity during the quarter resulted from a number of small events as well as developments from Texas hailstorms in the second quarter. Offsetting these events, reduced estimates for the Fort Myers fires and Japan earthquake from last quarter.
Expense ratio decreased 3.9 points to 32.1% in the third quarter compared to 36% for the third quarter of 2015.
This decrease was primarily driven by a lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies continued to earn through. Further, we saw a 1 point drop in our acquisition expense ratio as the impact from purchase accounting continues to diminish.
Turning to top line, gross written premium for the quarter was $566 million, up from $459 million in the third quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by new business and share increases.
As we have discussed in prior quarters, excellent strong support from our clients and brokers. We are pleased to see that support show up in the top line.
This growth was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we nonrenewed or reduced shares under $160 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms.
On a year-to-date basis, for the combined portfolio, we have grown just over 7% after adjusting for foreign exchange and multiple year premiums. Shifting to market conditions. We found the pricing environment challenging but rate decreases continued to decelerate in most lines and regions and as noted last quarter, we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business.
During the quarter, class segment were down approximately 2%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 4% this quarter and 5% of the year-to-date, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015.
The remainder of the property book, rates were down 2.5% and our casualty business remained flat over last year. The remainder of our classes were flat-to-down low single digits. U.S. short tail and global casualty treaty placements continue to struggle as terms and conditions were aggressively pushed at renewal.
In summary, the third quarter results were respectable for the Reinsurance segment. As the market reach the bottom in many classes, we are well positioned to succeed as our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job growing profitable business and finding the opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline.
I'll now turn it back to Mike."

Much of this now announced realignments started with an observation from Paul Brand and Kelly Lyles earlier this year and on top of their minds must or have a lot of that accelerated and defend our innovation successes and responded better to the market by streamlining decision-making and getting the business as close to the customer as possible.

Then there are no changes to the operating model itself. The most obvious of which is that we are bringing together insurance and reinsurance into 1 P&C organization under Greg Hendrick's leadership. We will, of course, maintain all of the appropriate governance and separation required between the insurance and reinsurance operations but we feel that by working together at a high level under the same span of control, we can harness the power of that adjacency for our customer's benefit. Solutions are clearly blending and we want to be in a position to lead these developments on our client's behalf. Having led insurance and reinsurance and having been instrumental in developing our long-standing strategy, Greg is clearly ideally suited for this new role.
Then another key learning for us has been the instrumental role country and territorial leadership placed for us around the world. So you'll see that in the new model, our P&C business groups are supported by 4 key capabilities, one of which is client and country management. And Kelly Lyles, who as you know, is currently our chief regional officer for insurance, would become Chief Executive client and country management who will be responsible for our global broker relationships and for ensuring that we have a strong leadership in our key geographies.
Kelly will report directly to me and to Greg and will continue to be a member of our group leadership team. You can find a much more detailed breakdown of the new structure and the names of who will lead within it in what we released this morning. We firmly believe that this realignment will create a more efficient, responsive and profitable business. While the announcement is new, this is something we have been contemplating for some time. And although there are people impacts, they will be very limited among handful of senior positions.
We will still have some people who we are really excited about move on as there just aren't new roles in the new model. We are proud to work with these 2 -- I've worked with this people and we wish them the very best. One more topic. You would have seen an 8-K this afternoon that I'm going to be selling some shares and I can understand that this could be misinterpreted in 2 important ways: First, that I am somehow less committed to my job; or second, that I believe this is somehow a good price at which to be selling. The opposite is in the case in both respects.
More than 2 years ago, I decided with my family that my commitment to XL was open-ended. That this wasn't going to be just some turnaround gig, but a mission far greater and longer than that. As a result, I made some broader financial plans, the last part of which was to sell some shares. Happily for XL, but not so happily for my personal plans before I acted on selling, the XL Catlin combination talks heated up. This is the first time since that I have felt comfortable taking this long-delayed action.
That said, I fully expect to be kicking myself next year over the price I will have to accept. But I am simply passed the point where I can wait given what I put in motion 2 long years ago. And I want to emphasize that even after these sales, XL shares will remain our family's largest single asset by far, as it should be.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A."

I think we're in line. Those are driven by reinsurance is not a heavily attrition-driven loss ratio, it's a number of small mid and sometimes large losses. I think we had a little bit more this quarter than we would normally expect but nothing outside and I believe strongly that the new portfolio is a diversified reinsurance and able to withstand more of that activity."

You also asked sort of taken as a whole, does this mean another relative to our ambition to be delivering double digits ROEs and how would you that there. A couple of comments. Number one, I've mentioned these 5 trends. The idea that we're getting more flow from our partners and we're even seeing more business that we'd like to write, but at this point in the market, find it difficult to actually write more. So that flow is a very good sign of our position in the marketplace today. The second thing is we are finding some growth. As I've mentioned for this quarter in essence, the overall was 2%. If you then went back and normalize for some of the re-underwriting activities in reinsurance, we actually had growth there that was positive.
And then third, I talked about the fact that the loss ratio year-over-year, the underlying loss ratio has declined and whether there has been some higher large loss activity in this year which the market's been talking about, we've been talking about, we've been largely, not entirely, but largely able to absorbed that as we go along which is a sign of the greater resilience of this book of business. Fourth, we talked about expenses and the fact that for meeting those aggressive targets of that we have laid out in The Street and expect to continue to do so. And fifth, of course, I talked about capital management which, of course, has been very significant in this year and continues to improve to be against which you work. If I take those 5 together, that is where some of the progress toward this objective comes from. But there's 2 additional things that come into play next year that isn't evident this year. Number 1, he will have worked most of those larger we underwriting actions through the book and they will no longer have the same negative impact on our loss ratio that they continues to have today. Now, we're always doing a little bit of re-underwriting but those actions we took in '15 were a very significant dimension and we finally get them largely through the book of business and where they won't have that same negative loss ratio drag. Second, we also will be away from the negative top-line drag that those activities have created and I will hope that the next year, we'll actually see the growth that underwriters are able to find come through in the numbers. So those are 2 more accelerants that are added to those 5 trends as we get in 2017. Now I know you want to me to conclude that was some table forecast, I'm not going to do that. Our budget is still in the works. The board has not yet adopted it, but I like what those trends imply about our ability to continue to expand margins and as we finalize the budget, I'll have more to say about what that yields in totality. But it's clearly trends that work in favor of what we say we will do."

It will moderate but it will clearly exceed that for the balance of the year. With respect to next year, it's a bit premature, right, I mean, we haven't adopted the budget as I mentioned, a moment ago and that work finalizes in early December in more quick the board. And that's why historically, as you know, we have commented in giving some directional intended around both share repurchases and around expenses and that end-of-year call kind of 3 months from now. That's still win will give you more about expenses, there's no guidance to give, we've already talked the expense levels we're going to achieve and we're going to achieve them. The only direction that could change it somehow we forecast a lot lower revenue then we will probably drive them even lower. But I don't, at this point, expect that. Second, with respect to share repurchases, there a couple of thoughts. One there's nothing going on that would indicate we will do any less than we originally intended to do last year. So I would can't find it very hard to imagine the circumstances will be lower than the initial guidance and obviously, we continue to feel that this -- that XL is fundamentally underpriced and as a result, we've been more opportunistic this year as we've had opportunities to do so. I would like to think that somewhere between those 2 is, I would think where we might come out but it's just a bit premature to say.
But I'm still bullish on how share repurchases fit into the entire story and will give more precise directional observations when it comes to the end of your call."

And I'll start at the highest level. Given their history and given their scale, there is no way that the expense savings that have been achieved to date and will be achieved by the end of '17 could possibly have taken place without the combination. And given how the soft market playbook works as it were, expenses become more and more important as the soft market grinds on. So that is the first and most obvious and tangible benefit to shareholders. Second, we did not expect as this combination was created, that the pricing environment would become so dire especially in specialty lines. That took us off guard. There is, again, no way that the prior separate institutions could have thought through with the success that they're having in trading again, when you clean out the re-underwriting FX, some modest growth, that wouldn't have happened. Each franchise would have been weaker, you would have seen this lift in submissions, the opportunity to see more and to try to pick your way through this market was greatly enhanced by the combination that we have made and I know and I say this every call, you have lots of contacts in the broker community, the market community, you know that, that's true and we go to all of our meetings and we hear it time and time again. A part of how we've been able to achieve that in way that this doesn't lose underwriting control is we have been able to up our relationships with existing clients with proven track records. That couldn't have been possible for each company independently before because it was only through bringing the firms together that we have the greater capital base in the greater diversified couple others for those counterparties to trust our continuing growth with them.
So in each of those cases, Josh, we're talking about things that really possible by the combination. Now in a tougher market"

So from my -- you cut me right towards the end. And by the way, that diversified balance sheet gave rise to a greater opportunity for capital management as well, then independently, I think you would have seen from either company. Moreover, we are able to better absorb patterns of larger losses as we have seen this year. So in everyone of those respects, this firm is performing better than the separate companies would have performed in the same market conditions. We didn't foresee it, we didn't do it because we saw it coming, we did it because it was the right thing to do. Greg has an expression that I quite like and that since this is a largely U.S. audience, I can use it, I find it difficult to recreate around the world. From an underwriting talent point of view, which was the key objective and to put it to work for our clients and for our shareholders. We've really got a lineup like the 1927 Yankees. I mean this is the most powerful of collection of specialty, market-leading thinkers that you could get. But it's likely to assemble that talent and then there was a player strike, I mean, that is the equivalent. They can't do everything they could do because the market conditions are what they are. And in the end, maintaining our discipline in this market, which the very statistics Paul walked you through, is exactly what they should be doing and I can't tell you how grateful for the work they're doing because they do it in a miserable conditions over and over and over.

One is we're seeing opportunity we would not have seen as independent firms in the reinsurance and I let Paul talk to the reinsurance side. We just wouldn't have seen a large participations with clients that don't go out to the broad market. You see it coming through in our Q3 growth. I want to make sure I point out. Remember, reinsurance is a lumpy business. So that's not to say that the growth we have in the third quarter is now embedded in there going forward. It's not the case but we do see more and more of that so you see that coming through in this quarter. We got more focused on client management so we're seeing more business from the clients we like and know that we used to do. In the past when you are perhaps not quite structured about it as independent firms. I think might catch on diversification point, you don't see it in the Fin Supp. But if I look just at the other line in reinsurance in the Fin Supp, and you can see a pretty good set of growth there. Well that's because XL wasn't in credit and surety, XL and Catlin have build a good business around that. And Catlin wasn't in health reinsurance and we were in health reinsurance at XL. And so If you bring these 2 books together, just a much better diversified, more stable business."

We Phase II headwinds all of us together, right. We faced the soft market headwind together and that can be variable  according to any particular mix of business but that is a common across the board. And we faced this interest rate environment in common together which put so much more demand on the underwriting result. So both of those I don't see huge change coming in either one. You never know but there's nothing that's happened that would forecast that.
So let me walk through kind of the pricing environments and our attitude toward across the 2 books. In reinsurance, as Greg said, we've seen it bottoming out and if you've been following the news in the blog, for example, where there's a lot of reinsurance contracts being discussed, you're seeing a clear change in attitude from the market side of the equation and just seeing a lot more prospect on terms and conditions, you're seeing no more, that's enough, you're seeing a different attitude in very public display and I think that's very encouraging. And I would carry that further to the large commercial marketplace. And we look at global program type progress, these events are one of the leaders of one of the buyer associations in Germany publicly say that the conversation had to become more balanced in the interest of our carriers. When they start saying that, community that usually is talking you down all the time, that just tells you that there's something new and different going on in the marketplace. I don't think it pretends you turn but it's a change that is clearly going to moderate the downward pressure in some areas. Now there's some like energy, aviation where it's just hard to understand what's going on. So I do believe that all competitors facing that pressure in, and father I don't know exactly how to translate that to an ROE headwind because it differs by how the companies respond to it. For others, we've been cutting back writings and those lines where competition has gotten ridiculous. We don't have a broad one-size-fits-all attitude. We have a lot of sophistication in how we do pricing and we're able to be very clear with our clients kind of we're just becomes something we can't do. We do that client by client in conversation. But if we look at aviation, if we look at energy, if we look at some of the marine areas, those are clear areas where we're going to have less writings because our underwriters are at a point where they can't tolerate what's going on. There are other pockets where we can grow. And so I can't translate it into an industry effect I can tell you what we're doing. And so far, as you see by the improvement in the loss ratio year-over-year on a sustained basis, we are seeing that strategy play out to our benefit. We're fighting off these headwinds which were present last year and accelerated at the beginning of this year. So I feel okay about that. I really can't put myself in the other shoes because I don't know how the effects of activity and repurchasing all that. I just know what our trends are. I can't speak to theirs."

That should speed up decision-making and make it simpler both for our people and for the market to know where to go when there's a little bit of hair on the risk as it were. And that, in a soft market, that comes up more, frankly. So having that simplified should accelerate how we make decisions and should have a positive impact in the eyes of our broker community and partners. So we are already seeing greater submissions. This could enable us to work faster and better and maybe even see that stimulated more. The final bit is just do the country management piece. In essence, if you step back, we had put in a pretty heavy regional structure. This lightens that regional structures some but it empowers more that country level manager because that's where we saw the real lift. This we appreciate those work with relationships and so those people that we were actually seeing some growth because of them. For example, in LatAm, our 2 operations there in Mexico City and then Brazil happened to the be in both offices over the last few weeks, they're off a small base but they're winning awards for their responsiveness in the marketplace and we're seeing kind of 80% type growth rate off those small bases because of these newer local presence. That we've enhanced by this and taken off some of the upstream requirements so we can make decisions faster. So no, I'm sorry for the long answer, but this is really important to us. No, we don't expect that at all."

So that seems to leave only 2 more levers and I'm including investment income because it is what it is. That's your corporate expense and the operating levers that you used, to get you to on ROE. And it seems like those are the 2 pieces that if you're actually going to get to a really solid double-digit ROE or what you have to pull to achieve that. Is that right?"

I'll walk you through those 5 trends, all of which are meant to address the belief we have, absolutely we have, that we continue to expand margins in our insurance operation. And I mentioned 2 accelerants that come into play more next year that were not constant this year. So we'll get a fuller benefit of the growth that our underwriters are able to create and we'll gets less of a drag as we just discussed on the loss ratio due to that re-underwriting activity. So those are meant to directly address that we believe the insurance combined ratio can improve from here and that we can fight our way through the obvious negative effects of the pricing environment. So first, that. Second, we have been very aggressive in on the east side of things through our share repurchases in this year. As Pete mentioned, we're already at 9 50 and I think the way anyone reasonably listen to him would say and that's going to go up. And as I answered Kai, we see something certainly better than our initial expectations for this year and perhaps up to what we did do this year. So you're talking about a couple of levers that move things meaningfully in the equation it is you're trying to solve for and we're starting from what is, as Pete laboriously described in great detail, what if something like a normalized 8 6 and let's see what the fourth quarter ex Matthew, of course, produces. But so we see the -- so if you were looking at it from our shoes, if you believe that the combined ratio and insurance could continue to come down, if you believe that overall expenses, including corporate expenses, would continue to come down at the levels that we have described before, and if you believe you can get a modest bit of growth into that more efficient model, you would say to yourself, that's within range. Exactly how more to describe that. I told you I'm not going up on the table today. I haven't finished the budget. Pete's got a couple of thoughts to add. We're getting there and we're very pleased with our progress or to know what else to tell you."

So the numbers that we put out in that Slide were for the 9 months and everyone knows that we had not a very good first quarter and so the run rate, the last 2 quarters are certainly better than the average for the 3 quarters. The second thing is I wouldn't just think about the corporate expenses. The way we think about it is we need to do better on, I will call it, the loss ratio and commission ratio to get to the technical ratio, right. And then we look at the overall expenses, if you look at what we said we were going to do, that's about a $70 million improvement year-on-year, right, so that's a 7 tenths of a percent right there. And then sense our expenses are in essence, locked at this point in time, right, you're talking about leverage, its ultimate leverage, right? So for every dollar premium, extra premium that we write, 1 minus technical ratio falls through the bottom line.

I think that is the biggest thing as regards to we were going after in the business there. That growth rates in going to be lumpy. It was 23% in the quarter on gross written. It's 7% for the year when you adjust for FX and multiyear. So there's just -- it's never -- we're not growing at 23% on a per annum basis, that's not going to happen but we did have a couple of opportunities. In this quarter, one of them was to expand an existing relationship we have with the credit customer, another couple were around motor or auto coverage which have a slightly higher combined ratio but also a lower volatility and less downside to them. So it's that kind of they came up, they were offered to us, we believe because of our new presence in the marketplace and we took advantage of that.

I think you're right to ask and the need to give more thoughts exactly how we present them. Let me give you examples. First of all, yesterday a first question are we always hunting for more ISIs? Sure. We don't make a lot of those kinds of bets but in those bets, we get a couple of benefits. Number 1, we get, we believe, attractively priced reinsurance opportunities. Because of the strategic relationship, we're able to negotiate differently on the terms of reinsurance and we find out a very attractive method in this difficult market add to our reinsurance writings. And then you get the potential. That kind of -- that tends to lessen the risk of whatever investment might be associated to go and then you get the potential upside if the investment proves wise as well. So we like both of those. And we don't take a lot. We're not a spread shooter, we're very targeted on things that are related, 2 things, 2 things you want to learn about and look at that benefit. The second thing we get this we get eyes on, hands dirty experience with some of these new and potentially disruptive insurance models. We get to learn how the technology works, we get to learn whether it works, we got to learn whether the promise innovation is real and we get to think about what application that might have for our businesses. And him because of the way we negotiate this in some cases, we have even likes to increase ownership or 2 use technology. This different elements on how we negotiate each one of these. So that's the second benefit I get. The third one relates to our pricing insight. We have been actively and I'd say, somewhat quietly, building models to gain pricing advantages. We all know that when you are an early adopter in modeling, you get a double lift. You not only get the benefit of your model, assuming it's right, and ours has been uncannily effective, but you also get the benefit that those things that you turn away for reasons that others I would be able to analyze can actually lead to some adverse business building for them. So we get 2 hope for out of that. I'm not ready to talk about it, others like to talk about this a lot. We actually kind of enjoy the quite effectiveness. We have a number of these models up and running and adhere to across XL and over the coming years, I think it will be right to put some metrics around that for you to understand better. So there you get loss ratio lift and we have a meaningful portion of the book no getting that left from that to do. And then fourth, we also will be innovate, we get to invent markets where we are the only in our competition which is rare in our space but I'll give you an explicit example. You heard me talk about it before but it's worth mentioning, that's new energy risk where we've built an MGA MTU, created an entirely new product for it. We're the first to market in it. We had much less cost to building that out because the brokers didn't have expertise to contribute and wound up in a weaker position in the transaction and extract the less fees. In the end, we're now writing about $75 million of that. And at this stage, I'm touching on the word I can find, there's been no losses on that business. And it is growing. It's, in fact, we're working on some adjacent products that we're hoping shortened to be rolling out. Wherever you're able to do something like that, you do so with less of these crazy competitive environment that we've all been talking about. You have any position, you are able to run ahead. That's where I think what Paul is taking on, what we're doing all of that, that fits in that category. We can actually innovate a part of what they do when I talk about first but a part of what they do is this to, where they are entirely reinventing the business model and eating out with a new product that we think his -- it's very hard imitate. We run with obviously people try but they can't, they haven't spent for several years deep into the science which we do. So that's why the relationship is what I call out specifically because it is teaching us things that we know are coming and that we believe we can lead because of our deep understanding of the science behind it in creating the insurance products that people are going to need. That kind of thing really gives us a differential lift in the marketplace. So, yes, you're right, it's tough to measure externally particularly at this point. I've brought it up because it is now at the maturing point and we believe we will need to get in front of you and give much more definition to the Sully for you to think about it but I think that those who are not -- we aren't the only one doing some of these things, I think we're doing it with a coherence and a practicality that is starting to show up in our numbers and am looking forward to talking about that in greater depth in the future."

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. 
Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date in which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. 
Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our website and in the earnings release included as an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing third quarter 2016 results.

Tonight, I'll share some highlights from the quarterly results, Pete will discuss the financials and then Paul and Greg will go to the insurance and reinsurance segments, respectively. And then I'll come back to make a few comments on our realigned P&C operating model and some related role changes, which we announced this morning. We will then open it up for questions. 
As I commented in the results press release, this is the second quarter of solid progress and seeing the power of the business that we are building emerge in the numbers. 
I see 5 solid trends that demonstrate how we are doing the right things and especially the right things given the difficult market conditions in which we operate. 
First, as Paul will detail, our submissions have gone up both in quantity and in the variety of risk we are asked to look at. This means our trading partners like doing business with us and wants to do more. This is a reflection of our successful combination. 
Second, our underwriters are doing the really tough work, and it is hard for them to find adequately priced risk. This quarter, our reinsurance book was the driver of some growth in a somewhat bottoming pricing environment. And our insurance book, when you take out the noise created by underwriting actions, also showed modest growth year-over-year. So our underwriters are doing the right stuff, but you only see modest growth as a result of their efforts and even these greater submissions because it's so tough to find risk that is appropriately priced. That is exactly what a good underwriting company does in times like these.
Third, despite multiple years of pricing deterioration, our loss ratio continues to improve year-over-year. Now I know it ticked up a bit in the third quarter relative to the second, but with a book like ours, we do not find this meaningful. Paul can get into that with a little more color. But when you look at it year-over-year, we see significant and sustained improvement. 
Fourth, our expenses continue to decline as we have said they would, which, taken together with our underwriting actions, is producing our overall improved combined ratio. 
And then fifth, we continue to repurchase shares in line with what we told you we would do and I'd say with some opportunistic flair.
These are the 5 things you should be expecting us to do given market conditions, and our numbers bear it out. 
So turning to these results. Excluding the Catlin integration costs of $55 million, operating earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, and operating ROE, excluding unrealized gains and losses, was 6.6% for the quarter. Our P&C combined ratio in the quarter of 93.1% was an improvement of 2.2 points from quarter 3 a year ago. That's where the expense and loss ratio improvements are coming through. Our P&C top line growth of 2% year-over-year was largely driven by reinsurance, where, as I mentioned, we are finding a few more opportunities. But insurance, when you take out the noise, also showed underlying growth of 2% in the quarter. So we see this as good progress that we can continue. 
Before I turn it over to Pete, 2 other items of note, a comment on the recent hurricanes and a few thoughts on our innovation efforts. First, Hurricane Nicole, while not financially significant, obviously was a near direct hit to Bermuda. And when you are a Bermuda-based company, this, of course, makes it very personal. Happily, our people fared well, and the company had minimal disruption. And the island and its people once again demonstrated their tremendous resilience.
With respect to Hurricane Matthew, it is early in the process. To give some meaning to that, you can understand that this is a difficult claims environment with regard to wind versus flood. Moreover for us, it is even more complicated, because as a large commercial property underwriter, there may well be some pinpoint losses covered by commercial flood insurance added to what we're observing in reinsurance. But with what we've seen so far and with both sources of loss in mind, we'd estimate a range of between $100 million and $2 million of loss -- and $200 million of loss. And although it is early, there is nothing that we've seen that is giving us any surprise. We will make a pre-announcement as things clarify further.
Then as to innovation. I want to emphasize this because it's quite remarkable when you consider all of the other things going on, these difficult and intense operational objectives of ours. First, as we'll talk about later, we had news today about Paul Brand and the new role he will be taking in leading our innovation effort. He'll have a small team, some of which is already recruited, to push us forward faster. I think in retrospect, this will be seen as a very important moment in the history of our company. Second, our XL Innovate efforts continue to bear more and more fruit, and you'll see more and more announcements about the new innovations we're pushing into the market and new investments we are making. And finally then, there's our relationship with Oxbotica, a leader in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence, which has taken off. And we are actively at work with them in some very exciting new projects, teaching us about risk in these new autonomous systems, the Internet of Things and how we can think about potentially using dynamic pricing.
So we see our innovation efforts as maturing, not just in the many citations for new products introduced, which we've always enjoyed, not just in the many new pricing models that work in the company, but in these even more fundamental and potentially revolutionary ways.
We are proud of the way our underwriters are working our way through this market. We're excited about our progress and the way these trends indicate that more progress is at hand.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."

Mike shared with you the improvement in our operating net income per share versus the same quarter last year. We achieved this even with significantly higher catastrophe losses in the third quarter than we had in the same quarter a year ago. Our natural catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premiums for the third quarter, totaled $97 million or 4.1 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $31 million or 1.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. The 2.2-point improvement in our P&C combined ratio versus the same quarter last year was driven by improvements in the operating expense ratio, and Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As David mentioned, we provided several slides this quarter in addition to our normal materials. These slides are in response to the numerous requests from investors and analysts that we provide further clarity of our view of our ongoing business.
Slide 5 details the improvement in the third quarter 2016 earnings per share compared to last year. Slide 6 pictorially shows what we disclosed in our June 8-K on expenses. And if you could turn to Slide 7, we provide a normalized view of our 9-month operating ROE, excluding net unrealized investment gains that includes adjustments to reported results for timing differences and for naturally varying elements of our results.
We start with our operating ROE, excluding net unrealized investment gains. The first adjustment is to simply exclude integration costs which are nonrecurring. The next adjustment is to annualize our preferred dividends, most of which are incurred in the first and third quarters. The next 3 adjustments used the Street's consensus view at the beginning of 2016 for key areas of volatility.
We have chosen to normalize using The Street's consensus view to avoid making qualitative adjustments and to use information produced by the investment community. This is not an endorsement of The Street's consensus view. We simply obtained The Street's consensus for each column for the full year, multiplied it by 75% and then subtracted our actual 9-month results and then tax-effected it.
The adjustment to prior year development has been included to reflect that we conduct in-depth reviews of our reserves only twice each year, and as a result, our prior development does not emerge equally by quarter. The next 2 adjustments to our affiliate assets and catastrophes are in attempt to normalize for naturally volatile parts of our operations.
With these adjustments, our annualized ROE for the first 3 quarters of 2016 will be 8.6%. I know the slide has limitations, but I hope you'll find it responsive. 
Operating expenses improved compared to both the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2015 as our ongoing integration and synergy benefits take hold. Our estimates for operating expense levels for the rest of this year and next year remain in line with those provided in our 8-K filed in June, except for an estimated additional $10 million and onetime integration costs in the fourth quarter of this year due to the change in our insurance operating model.
As is our normal practice, during the first and third quarters, our reserving process is based on a review of our actual versus expected losses. Our semiannual full actuarial review will be included in next quarter's results. 
Prior year net development in the third quarter was a favorable $54 million or 2.3 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $28 million or 1.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $23 million in the Insurance segment and $31 million in the Reinsurance segment. 
As detailed in our financial supplement, our estimated operating tax rate, exclusive of discrete impacts, has declined to 8.5%, reflecting geographic distribution of our underwriting profits.
Fully diluted book value per share grew by 1.6% in the third quarter and by 9% in the 9 months ended September 30.
Turning to the investment portfolio. And as usual, my comments will exclude the life funds withheld assets. Net investment income was $171 million compared to $179 million for the prior year third quarter and $176 million in the second quarter, which, as I mentioned last quarter, was somewhat elevated for a few nonrecurring factors. 
Net investment income will continue to remain under pressure given the current low interest rate environment and from lower cash flow as a result of our share repurchase program. We have approximately $3.5 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the  third quarter, our average new money rate was 1.9%. And at the end of September, the gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio was 2.3%, and the duration of the total investment portfolio remained at 3.3 years.
Total affiliate income was $25 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year third quarter. All categories of affiliate holdings contributed positive earnings this quarter, although the absolute returns from our hedge fund portfolio remained disappointing. Despite that, we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns over time.
Unrealized net gains were $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Total return on investments was 0.7% for the quarter in original currency.
And with respect to capital management, we continue to execute share buybacks during the third quarter. During the quarter, we purchased 6.6 million shares for $222 million at an average price of $33.61 per share, leaving $594 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. For the 9 months, we have purchased 26.2 million shares for $905 million at an average price of $34.54.
As I've noted before, this rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April as well as an acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and expect to continue share buybacks at a more modest rate for the rest of the year.
And now I'll turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."

The segment produced a calendar quarter combined rat",697,"Thanks, Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management. 
First, the results. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.3% compared to 97.2% in Q3 2015 and 96.4% last quarter. Higher cat expense was $71 million, of which $28 million is related to prior quarter cats compared to $7 million in Q3 2015. It was more than offset by prior year reserve releases of $23 million, by material improvements and the underwriting expense ratio of 2 points and a reduction in the accident year x cat loss ratio of 1 point. On an accident quarter x cat basis, the combined ratio is 93.3% compared to 96.3% in Q3 2015. And if we look at the first 3 quarters we reported an accident year x cat combined ratio of 93.6% compared to 95.3% in 2015. At Q3, we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.4% compared to 13.2% in Q3 2015 and 13.7% reported last quarter. This continues to be in line with the guidance we provided in Q1. This slight increase in acquisition ratio is more than offset by a Q3 operating expense ratio of 18.3%, which was 2.2 points lower than Q3 2015, by a net accident year x cat loss ratio of 61.7%, which was 1 point lower than Q3 2015 and is the result of the reunderwriting work we started last year. 
Pricing was slightly better at minus 1.3% for the quarter and minus 2.6% for the full year. Our casualty lines were up 1%. Our specialty businesses were largely flat with the improvements in our accident and health lines, offset by continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines. 
Our professional businesses were down 2%. Our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%, once again, driven by energy and North American property.
Insurance price premiums written in Q3 were down by 2% or $47 million on a reported basis year-over-year and when we normalize the foreign exchange, down less than 1% in the quarter.
However, when you also consider the portfolio-tuning activity that started in 2015, where decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses, we continue to see growth in the 3% range for the business we like on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth demonstrates that whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction and to finding new profitable opportunities. 
As Mike mentioned, we continue to see plenty of new business opportunities. Our submission flow is up 8%, and our credit ratio is up 5% with our top brokers. So we're seeing more business that we like. One of our conversion rates are down nearly 4%, clearly reflecting over underwriting discipline given the market.
For the insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $538 million compared to $536 million in Q3 2015. This represents 25% of the GPW compared to 24.3% in Q3 2015.
As mentioned previously, the ceded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance programs and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing. And as a result, the written session ratios can and will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
As mentioned in the previous quarter, it is essential that we react to top line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter, we selectively exited another 15 positions for a total of nearly 90 positions so far this year as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across the segment. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will continue to flow through in subsequent quarters along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway.
In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continue to grow the underlying book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And as we finally -- finalized our business plans for 2017, we fully expect this momentum to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus. 
And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."

Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results.

Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 86.5% compared with 91.2% in the third quarter last year. The result for the quarter experienced favorable prior year development, lower accident quarter x cat loss ratio and an improved expense ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $31 million compared to $35 million a year ago. As Pete noted, the third quarter is not a full valuation quarter, and reserve releases were driven by property classes of business. In particular, our loss from last year's Tianjin explosion reduced by $7 million, and estimates for a number of small catastrophe events were lowered. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios.
The reinsurance limit produced an accident quarter x cat loss ratio of 54.9%, which compares to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by the Tianjin event last year, offset predominantly by a handful of medium size of 9 cat losses as well as a smaller impact from a change in mix of business and market conditions.
Catastrophe losses totaled $26 billion, net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter, compared to $23 million in the third quarter of last year.
The cat activity during the quarter resulted from a number of small events as well as developments from the Texas hailstorms in the second quarter. Offsetting these events reduced our estimates of the Fort McMurray fires and Japan earthquake from last quarter.
The expense ratio decreased 3.9 points to 32.1% in the third quarter compared to 36% for the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies continued to earn through. Further, we saw a 1 point drop in our acquisition expense ratio as the impact from purchase accounting continues to diminish.
Turning to top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $566 million, up from $459 million in the third quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by new business and share increases. As we have discussed in prior quarters, XL Catlin has received strong support from our clients and brokers. We are pleased to see that support show up in the top line. This growth was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we non-renewed or reduced shares on nearly $60 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms. On a year-to-date basis, for the combined portfolio, we have grown just over 7% after adjusting for foreign exchange and multiple year premiums. 
Shifting to market conditions. We found the pricing environment challenging, but rate decreases continued to decelerate in most lines and regions. And as noted last quarter, we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business.
During the quarter, rates across the segment were down approximately 2%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 4% this quarter and 5% for the year-to-date, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015.
The remainder of the Property Treaty book, rates were down 2.5%, and our casualty business remained flat over last year. The remainder of our classes were flat-to-down low single digits. U.S. short tail and global casualty treaty placements continue to struggle if terms and conditions were aggressively pushed at renewal.
In summary, the third quarter results were respectable for the Reinsurance segment. As the market reaches the bottom in many classes, we are well positioned to succeed as our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job growing profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline.
I'll now turn it back to Mike."

As you saw this morning, we announced a realignment of our P&C operating model, and I want to quickly walk you through this news. If you go back to when we brought the 2 companies together, we combined XL and Catlin into a classically matrix-ed insurance organization to take advantage of the best of both prior operating models. And we knew that when the time was right, we take a step back to adjust for what we were learning about the organization and to be able to even better respond to the marketplace.
Much of this now announced realignments started with observations from Paul Brand and Kelly Lyles earlier this year. And on top of their minds was to have a model that accelerated and defend our innovation successes and responded better to the market by streamlining decision-making and getting the business as close to the customer as possible.
So as to innovation, Paul will be taking on the new roll as Director of Accelerate, the new internal innovation team. I'm extraordinarily excited to see what they will produce.
Then there are other changes to the operating model itself. The most obvious of which is that we are bringing together insurance and reinsurance into 1 P&C organization under Greg Hendrick's leadership. We will, of course, maintain all of the appropriate governance and separation required between the insurance and reinsurance operations, but we feel that by working together at a high level under the same span of control, we can harness the power of that adjacency for our customers' benefit. Solutions are clearly blending, and we want to be in a position to lead these developments on our client's behalf. Having led insurance and reinsurance and having been instrumental in developing our long-standing strategy, Greg is clearly ideally suited for this new role.
Then another key learning for us has been the instrumental role country and territorial leadership plays for us around the world. So you'll see that in the new model, our P&C business groups are supported by 4 key capabilities, one of which is client and country management. And Kelly Lyles, who, as you know, is currently our Chief Regional Officer for insurance, will become the Chief Executive Client and Country Management, who will be responsible for our global broker relationships and for ensuring that we have strong leadership in our key geographies. Kelly will report directly to me and to Greg and will continue to be a member of our group leadership team. 
You can find a much more detailed breakdown of the new structure and the names of who will lead within it in, in what we released this morning. We firmly believe that this realignment will create a more efficient, responsive and profitable business. While the announcement is new, this is something we have been contemplating for some time. And although there are people impacts, they will be very limited among a handful of senior positions. We will still have some people who we are really excited about move on as there just aren't as many roles in the new model. We are proud to work with -- to have worked with these people, and we wish them the very best. 
One more topic. You would have seen an 8-K this afternoon that I'm going to be selling some shares, and I can understand that this could be misinterpreted in 2 important ways: First, that I am somehow less committed to my job; or second, that I believe this is somehow a good price at which to be selling. The opposite isn't the case in both respects.
More than 2 years ago, I decided with my family that my commitment to XL was open-ended, that this wasn't going to be just some turnaround gig but a mission far greater and longer than that. As a result, I made some broader financial plans, the last part of which was to sell some shares, happily for XL, but not so happily for my personal plans. Before I acted on selling, the XL Catlin combination talks heated up. This is the first time since that I have felt comfortable taking this long-delayed action. That said, I fully expect to be kicking myself next year over the price I will have to accept. But I am simply past the point where I can wait given what I put in motion 2 long years ago. And I want to emphasize that even after these sales, XL shares will remain our family's largest single asset by far, as it should be.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A."

And we'd observed for Q3 anywhere between 49% and 58% for accident year x cat loss ratio, with a 54% average, right around 54% and a bit where we are this quarter. So I think we're in line. Those are driven by reinsurance's not heavily attrition-driven loss ratio. It's a number of small mid and sometimes large losses. I think we had a little bit more this quarter than we would normally expect but nothing outside. And I believe strongly, the new portfolio is a diversified reinsurance and able to withstand more of that activity."

You also asked, sort of taken as a whole, does this mean anything relative to our ambition to be delivering double-digit ROEs? And how would you get there? A couple of comments. Number one, I mentioned these 5 trends, the idea that we're getting more flow from our partners. And we're even seeing more business that we'd like to write, but at this point in the market, find it difficult to actually write more. So that flow is a very good sign of our position in the marketplace today. The second thing is we are finding some growth. As I mentioned for this quarter, in essence, the overall was 2%. If you then went back and normalize for some of the reunderwriting activities in reinsurance, we actually had growth there that was positive. And then third, I talked about the fact that the loss ratio year-over-year, that the underlying loss ratio has declined. And where there has been some higher large loss activity in this year, which the market's been talking about, we've been talking about, we've been largely, not entirely, but largely able to absorb that as we've gone along, which is a sign of the greater resilience of this book of business. Fourth, I talked about expenses and the fact that we're meeting those aggressive targets that we have laid out to The Street and we expect to continue to do so. And fifth, of course, I talked about capital management, which, of course, has been very significant in this year and continues to improve [indiscernible] against which we work. If I take those 5 together, that is where some of the progress toward this objective comes from. But there's 2 additional things that come into play next year that isn't evident this year. Number one, we will have worked most of those larger reunderwriting actions through the book, and they will no longer have the same negative impact on our loss ratio that it continues to have today. Now we're always doing a little bit of reunderwriting, but those actions we took in '15 were a very significant dimension. And we finally get them largely through the book of business. And they won't have that same negative loss ratio drag. Second, we also will be away from the negative top line drag that those activities have created. And I would hope that then next year, we'll actually see the growth that our underwriters are able to find come through into the numbers. So those are 2 more accelerants that are added to those 5 trends as we get in 2017. Now I know you want me to conclude that was some table-pounding forecast. I'm not going to do that. Our budget is still in the works. The board has not yet adopted it. But I like what those trends imply about our ability to continue to expand margins. And as we finalize the budget, I'll have more to say about what that yields in totality. But it's clearly trends that work in favor of what we've said we will do."

First of all, we will likely exceed modestly what we've talked about so far. So it won't just reduce to kind of $50 million. It will moderate, but it will clearly exceed that for the balance of the year. With respect to next year, it's a bit premature, right? I mean, we haven't adopted the budget, as I mentioned a moment ago, and that work finalizes in early December and work with the board. And that's why historically, as you know, we have commented and given some directional intent around both share repurchases and around expenses and that end-of-year call kind of 3 months from now. That still win will give you more guidance. Now on expenses, there's no more guidance to give. We've already talked about the expense levels we're going to achieve, and we're going to achieve them. And the only direction that could change is if somehow we forecast a lot lower revenue, then we would probably drive them even lower. But I don't, at this point, expect that. Second, with respect to share repurchases, a couple of thoughts. One, there's nothing going on that would indicate we would do any less than we originally intend to do last year. So I would find it very hard to imagine the circumstance would be lower than our initial guidance. And obviously, we continue to feel that this -- that XL is fundamentally underpriced. And as a result, we've been more opportunistic this year as we had opportunities to do so. I would like to think that somewhere between those two is, I would think, where we might come out, but it's just -- it's a bit premature to say. But I'm still bullish on how share repurchases fit into the entire story. And we'll give more precise directional observations when it comes to the end of your call."

And I'll start at the highest level. Given their history and given their scale, there is no way that the expense savings that have been achieved to date and will be achieved by the end of '17 could possibly have taken place without the combination. And given how the soft market playbook works as it were, expenses become more and more important as the soft market grinds on. So that is the first and most obvious and tangible benefit to shareholders. Second, we did not expect, as this combination was created, that the pricing environment would become so dire, especially in specialty lines. That took us off guard. There is, again, no way that the prior separate institutions could have thought through, with the success that they're having and creating, again, when you clean out the reunderwriting FX, some modest growth. That wouldn't have happened. Each franchise would have been weaker, you wouldn't have seen this lift in submissions. The opportunity to see more and to try and pick your way through this market was greatly enhanced by the combination that we have made. And I know and I say this every call, you have lots of contacts in the broker community, the market community. You know that, that's true. And we go to all of our meetings, and we hear it time and time again. A part of how we've been able to achieve that in a way that doesn't lose underwriting control is we've been able to up our relationships with existing clients with proven track records. That couldn't have been possible for each company independently before because it was only through bringing the firms together that we have both the greater capital base and the greater diversified capital base for those counterparties to trust our continuing growth with them. So in each of those cases, Josh, we are talking about things that were made possible by the combination. Now in a tougher market..."

So from my -- you cut me right toward the end. And by the way, that diversified balance sheet gave rise to a greater opportunity for capital management as well than independently, I think, you would have seen from either company. Moreover, we are able to better absorb patterns of larger losses as we had seen this year. So in every one of those respects, this firm is performing better than the separate companies would have performed in the same market conditions. We didn't foresee it, we didn't do it because we saw it coming, we did it because we thought it was the right thing to do. Greg has an expression that I quite like, and since this is a largely U.S. audience, I can use it. I find it difficult to recreate it around the world. But from an underwriting talent point of view, which was the key objective to aggregate that talent and to put it to work for our clients and for our shareholders, we've really got a lineup like the 1927 Yankees. I mean, this is the most powerful collection of the specialty and market-leading thinkers that you could get. But it's likely disassemble that talent and then there was a player strike. I mean, that is the equivalent. They can't do everything they could do because the market conditions are what they are. And in the end, maintaining our discipline in this market, which the very statistics that Paul walked you through, is exactly what they should be doing. And I can't tell you how grateful I am for the work they're doing, because they do it in miserable conditions over and over and over. You get told, well, we'd love you, but you just didn't match this crazy price someone else gave you. And then they got to go, do it again and do it again. It's hard doing work, and they're doing an excellent job of it. Greg, you've got something to add?"

One is we're seeing opportunity we would not have seen as independent firms in the reinsurance, and I'll let Paul talk to the insurance stuff. We just wouldn't have seen large participations with clients that don't go out to the broad market. You see it coming through in our Q3 growth. I want to make sure I point out. Remember, reinsurance is a lumpy business, so that's not to say that the growth we had in the third quarter is now embedded in there going forward. It's not the case. But we do see more and more of those, so you see that coming through in this quarter. We've got more focused on client management, so we're seeing more business from the clients we like and know than we used to do in the past when we where perhaps not quite as structured about it as independent firms. And I think Mike touched on the diversification point. You don't see it in the Fin Supp. But if I look just at the other line in reinsurance in the Fin Supp, you'll see a pretty good set of growth there. Well, that's because XL wasn't in credit and surety. XL and Catlin have build a good business around that. And Catlin wasn't in health reinsurance, and we were in health reinsurance at XL. And so as you bring these 2 books together, just a much better diversified, more stable business."

We faced 2 headwinds, all of us together, right? We faced the soft market headwind together, and that can be variable according to any particular mix of business, but that is common across the board. And we faced this interest rate environment in common together, which puts so much more demand on the underwriting result. So those -- both of those, I don't see huge change coming in either one. You never know, but I -- there's nothing that's happened that would forecast that. In -- so let me walk through kind of the pricing environments and our attitude toward -- across the 2 books. In reinsurance, as Greg said, we've seen it bottoming out. And if you've been following news out of Button Bob [ph], for example, where there's a lot of reinsurance contracts being discussed, you're seeing a clear change in attitude from the market side of the equation, and you're just seeing a lot more prospect in terms and conditions, you're seeing no more, that's enough. I mean, you're just seeing a different attitude in very public display, and I think that's very encouraging. And I would carry that further to the large commercial marketplace. And we look at global program-type business. We even saw one of the leaders of one of the buyer associations in Germany publicly say that the conversation had to become more balanced in the interest of our carriers. When they start saying that, community that usually is talking you down all the time, that just tells you there's something new and different going on in the marketplace. I don't think it portends a turn, but it's a change that is clearly going to moderate the downward pressure in some areas. Now there's some like energy, aviation, where it's just hard to understand what's going on. So I do believe that all competitors face that pressure in common. I don't know exactly how to translate that to an ROE headwind because it differs by how the companies respond to it. For us, we've been cutting back writings in those lines where our competition has gotten ridiculous. We don't have a broad one-size-fits-all attitude. We have a lot of sophistication in how we do pricing, and we're able to be very clear with our clients kind of where it just becomes something we can't do. So we do that client by client in conversation. But if we look at aviation, if we look at energy, if we look at some of the marine areas, those are clear areas where we're going to have less writings because our underwriters are at a point where they can't tolerate what's going on. There are other pockets where we can grow. And so I can't make it -- I can't translate it to an industry effect. I can tell you what we're doing. And so far, as you see by the improvement in the loss ratio year-over-year on a sustained basis, we are seeing that strategy play out to our benefit. We're fighting off these headwinds which were present last year and accelerated at the beginning of this year. So I feel okay about that. I really can't put myself in the other shoes because I don't know how their mix of activity and repurchasing all that. I just know what our trends are. I can't speak to theirs."

Look, in our insurance operations, which is where -- if the reinsurance operating model is essentially the same, you take Greg out, you replace Greg and move on, and there's a lot of stability there, a lot of history there. But on the insurance operations, which is where the meat of this is, we're really talking about, at the very top level, a few people and at the next level, a couple of handfuls. And they aren't -- well, they are market-facing in the sense that they have presence in the marketplace. They are not the people conducting daily transactional business. And in fact, one of the prime why we made this change and how it works is the daily transactional level is practically unaffected. So tomorrow, they're working for the same people, they are answering. It's just -- but what there is, is there is a simplified referral process in essence. There's less hands with different points of views injecting themselves into that process. That should speed up decision-making and make it simpler both for our people and for the market to know where to go when there's a little bit of hair on the risk as it were. And that -- in a soft market, that comes up more, frankly. So having that simplified should accelerate how we make decisions and should have a positive impact in the eyes of our broking community and partners. So we're already seeing greater submissions. This could enable us to work faster and better and maybe even see that stimulated more. The final bit is just that country management piece. In essence, if you step back, we had put in a pretty heavy regional structure. This lightens that regional structure some, but it empowers more that country level manager because that's where we saw the real lift. That's where we saw that work with the relationships. And so those people that were -- we were actually seeing some growth because of them. For example, in LatAm, our 2 operations there in Mexico City and then in Brazil, I happened to have been in both offices over the last few weeks, they're off a small base, but they're winning awards for their responsiveness in the marketplace. And we're seeing kind of 80% type growth rate off those small bases because of this newer local presence. That we've enhanced by this and taken off some of the upstream requirements so we can make decisions faster. So no, I'm sorry for the long answer, but this is really important to us. No, we don't expect that at all."

But I'll walk through those 5 trends, all of which are meant to address the belief we have, absolutely we have, that we can continue to expand margins in our insurance operation. And I mentioned 2 accelerants that come into play more next year that were not present this year. So we'll get a fuller benefit of the growth that our underwriters are able to create, and we'll get less of a drag as was just discussed on the loss ratio due to that re-underwriting activity. So those are meant to directly address that we believe the insurance combined ratio can improve from here and that we can fight our way through the obvious negative effects of the pricing environment. So first, that. Second, we have been very aggressive in -- on the east side of things through our share repurchases in this year. As Pete mentioned, we're already $950 million. And I think the way anyone reasonably listen to him would say, ""And that's going to go up."" And as I answered Kai, we see something certainly better than our initial expectation for this year and, perhaps, up to what we did do this year. So you're talking about a couple of levers that move things meaningfully in the equation it is you're trying to solve for. And we're starting from what is -- as Pete laboriously described in great detail, what is something like a normalized 8.6%. And let's see what the fourth quarter, ex-Matthew of course, produces. But -- so we see the -- so if you were looking at it from our shoes, if you believe that the combined ratio and insurance could continue to come down, if you believe that overall expenses, including corporate expenses, would continue to come down at the levels that we have described before, and if you believe you could get a modest bit of growth into that more efficient model, you would say to yourself, that's within range. Exactly how more to describe that -- I told you I'm not going to pound the table today. I'm not -- I haven't finished the budget. Pete's got a couple of thoughts to add. But we're getting there, and we're pretty pleased with our progress, so I don't know what else to tell you."

So the numbers that we put out in that slide were for the 9 months, and everyone knows that we had not a very good first quarter. And so the run rate the last 2 quarters are certainly better than the average for the 3 quarters. The second thing is I wouldn't just think about the corporate expenses. The way we think about it is we need to do better on, I will call it, the loss ratio and commission ratio to get to the technical ratio, right? And then we look at the overall expenses. If you look at what we said we were going to do, that's about a $70 million improvement year-on-year, right? So that's 0.7% of a percent right there. And then since our expenses are in essence locked at this point in time, right, you're talking about leverage, it's ultimate leverage, right. So for every dollar of a premium, extra premium that we write, 1 minus technical ratio falls through the bottom line. So I do think that there are levers there, but again, this is not to try and walk you to a 10%."

Not everything in the reinsurance market is at a very low return level. You've seen cat experiences in a couple of countries around the year and in last year, and you're seeing rates respond to that. You're seeing casualty in general starting to flatten out and really renew same again year-over-year. So there isn't just one big, bad market out there. The general tone of it across is not great, but there is pockets of opportunities. And I would say the folks on the ground have been going really hard at making sure they find us focusing on the clients that we know because we trade with them already in other areas. I think that is the biggest thing as a regard to the -- as regards to who we're going after in the business there. The growth rate is going to be lumpy, right? It was 23% in the quarter on gross written. It's 7% for the year when you adjust for FX and multiyear. So there's just -- it's never -- we're not growing at 23% on a per annum basis. That's not going to happen, but we did have a couple of opportunities. In this quarter, one of them was to expand an existing relationship we have with a credit customer. Another couple were around motor or auto coverage, which have a slightly higher combined ratio but also a lower volatility and less downside to them. So it's that kind of -- they came up. They were offered to us. We believe because of our new presence in the marketplace, and we took advantage of them. There may not be any of them in the fourth quarter. We're trying hard to find them all the time and do it the right way, but they don't always come up in that same quarter-to-quarter fashion."

What we're able to do by piecing these opportunities together is we're able to maintain the margin that we have today, right? That's the way how I think about it. So in a particular example I gave you, our credit book runs at a -- it's a lower loss ratio business than the average. The motor's a little bit higher. When you blend them together, you're coming back to this. That's why I cited the last kind of 5 years of third quarter accident year ex-cat. You're in that 50% to 58% or 54% We're basically counteracting kind of what's tough market, some tough pricing by blending in these new pieces. So there isn't -- I wouldn't point you to there's going to be a dramatic improvement in accident year ex-cat as they seem to come online. If the market turns, and we have a lot of opportunity to lift and get that kind of growth in a major way, you would start to see a lower, I would believe, a lower accident year ex-cat loss ratio. But right -- I'm sorry, accident year ex-cat combined ratio on the expense side. But this is really the -- it's piece by piece. You don't have my budget.

So given that it's still -- I wouldn't call early days but relatively early. I think it's -- I think you're right to ask, and we need to give more t",971,"Yes, let me give you -- and to be honest, over time, we're going to work on many more metrics around this. So given that it's still -- I wouldn't call early days but relatively early. I think it's -- I think you're right to ask, and we need to give more thought exactly how to present to you. But let me give you some examples. First of all, yes to your first question. Are we always hunting for more ASIs? Sure. We don't make a lot of those kinds of bets. But in those bets, we get a couple of benefits. Number one, we get, we believe, attractively priced reinsurance opportunities. Because of the strategic relationship, we're able to negotiate differently on the terms of reinsurance, and we find out a very attractive method to -- in this difficult market add to our reinsurance writings. And then you get the potential. That kind of -- that tends to lessen the risk of whatever investment might be associated, and then you get the potential upside if the investment proves wise as well. So we like both of those. And we don't take a lot. We're not a spread shooter. We're very targeted on things that are related to things where you have extra keys or things that we want to learn about, and we get that benefit. The second thing we get is we get eyes-on, hands-dirty experience with some of these new and potentially disruptive insurance models. We get to learn how the technology works. We get to learn whether it works. We get to learn whether the promised innovation is real, and we get to think about what application that might have for our businesses. And if -- and because of the way we negotiate these in some cases, we have even rights to increase our ownership or to use technology. There's different elements of how we negotiate each one of these. So that's the second benefit we get. The third one relates to our pricing insight. We have been actively, and I'd say, somewhat quietly building models to gain pricing advantages. We all know that when you are an early adopter in modeling, you get a double lift. You not only get the benefit of your model, assuming it's right, and ours have been uncannily effective, but you also get the benefit that those things that you turn away for reasons that others aren't able to analyze can actually lead to some adverse business-building for them. So we get 2 for out of that. We are -- I'm not ready to talk about it. Others like to talk about this a lot. We actually kind of enjoy the quiet effectiveness. We have a number of these models up, running and adhered to across XL. And over the coming years, I think it would be right to put some metrics around that for you to understand better. So there, you get loss ratio lift, and we have a meaningful portion of the book now getting that lift from that activity. And then fourth, we -- also where we innovate, we get to invent markets where we are lonely in our competition, which is rare in our space, but I'll give you an explicit example. You've heard me talk about it before, but it's worth mentioning. That's new energy risk, where we've built an MGA/MGU, created an entirely new product for it. We're the first to market in it. We had much less cost to building that out because the brokers didn't have expertise to contribute and wound up in a weaker position in the transaction, and therefore, extracted less fees. And in the end, we're now writing about $75 million of that. And at this stage, I'm touching all the wood I can find, there has been no losses on that business, and it is growing. It's -- in fact, we're working on some adjacent products that we're hoping shortly to be rolling out. Whenever you're able to do something like that, you do so with less of this crazy competitive environment that we've all been talking about. You're doing it -- you have a lead position. You are able to run ahead. That's where, I think, what Paul is taking on, what we're doing with Oxbotica. All of that, that fits in that category. XL Innovate, a part of what they do is what I talked about first, but a part of what they do is this too, where they are entirely reinventing the business model and leading out with a new product that we think has -- is very hard to imitate. We run with -- obviously, people try, but they can't because they haven't spent several years deep into the science, which we do. So that's why the Oxbotica relationship is one I call out specifically because it is teaching us things that we know are coming and that we believe we can lead because of our deep understanding of the science behind it in creating the insurance products that people are going to need. That kind of thing really gives us a differential lift in the marketplace. So, yes, you're right. It's tough to measure externally, particularly at this point. I brought it up because it is now at a maturing point, and we believe we will need to get in front of you and give much more definition to this a way for you to think about it. But I think that those who are not -- there -- we aren't the only one doing some of these things. I think we're doing it with a coherence and a practicality that is starting to show up in our numbers, and I'm looking forward to talking about that in greater depth in the future, Ian."

Today was an exciting day to announce the changes with respect to Paul and Greg and to start streamlining and making this place work given better. We're really excited about these changes. But I want to put in a little more context. 
In a speech I remember from 2012, we talked about innovation and how you go about getting innovation in a existing industry, and we emphasized that you had to be willing to take your best minds and take them out of P&L process and put them on innovation, or else, you weren't going to get there. And the example I used then, a decision we felt very heroic about and very good about was taking Greg Hendrick out of his highly profitable job running our cat book in Bermuda and putting him on the strategy for the company, the reinvention of this company. We felt that was a great decision then and has led to subsequent successes that gave us great confidence in his role as a leader of all P&C. And you see us taking that playbook out again with respect to Paul, and the opportunity to take one of the sharpest underwriting minds any of us have ever met and set him loose on bringing these maturing activities to greater impact throughout our book of business and into the future. When we have a confident and great set of hands like Greg to leave the resulting P&C operation and a mind like Paul set loose on innovation, we see this as a day we will remember in future years as one of those moments when XL really took on the next level of opportunity. 
It's an exciting day for us. We look forward to the future. Thank you very much for the call and the questions on the call, and good night."

On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group CEO, will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results; followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer, Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team; and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions; Mike will make some comments on our realigned P&C operating model, then we'll open it up for questions.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. 
Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date in which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. 
Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our website and in the earnings release included as an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing third quarter 2016 results.

Tonight, I'll share some highlights from the quarterly results, Pete will discuss the financials and then Paul and Greg will go through the insurance and reinsurance segments, respectively. And then I'll come back to make a few comments on our realigned P&C operating model and some related role changes, which we announced this morning. We will then open it up for questions. 
As I commented in the results press release, this is the second quarter of solid progress and seeing the power of the business that we are building emerge in the numbers. 
I see 5 solid trends that demonstrate how we are doing the right things and especially the right things given the difficult market conditions in which we operate. 
First, as Paul will detail, our submissions have gone up both in quantity and in the variety of risk we are asked to look at. This means our trading partners like doing business with us and wants to do more. This is a reflection of our successful combination. 
Second, our underwriters are doing the really tough work, and it is hard for them to find adequately priced risk. This quarter, our reinsurance book was the driver of some growth in a somewhat bottoming pricing environment. And our insurance book, when you take out the noise created by underwriting actions, also showed modest growth year-over-year. So our underwriters are doing the right stuff, but you only see modest growth as a result of their efforts and even these greater submissions because it's so tough to find risk that is appropriately priced. That is exactly what a good underwriting company does in times like these.
Third, despite multiple years of pricing deterioration, our loss ratio continues to improve year-over-year. Now I know it ticked up a bit in the third quarter relative to the second, but with a book like ours, we do not find this meaningful. Paul can get into that with a little more color. But when you look at it year-over-year, we see significant and sustained improvement. 
Fourth, our expenses continue to decline as we have said they would, which, taken together with our underwriting actions, is producing our overall improved combined ratio. 
And then fifth, we continue to repurchase shares in line with what we told you we would do and I'd say with some opportunistic flair.
These are the 5 things you should be expecting us to do given market conditions, and our numbers bear it out. 
So turning to these results. Excluding the Catlin integration costs of $55 million, operating earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, and operating ROE, excluding unrealized gains and losses, was 6.6% for the quarter. Our P&C combined ratio in the quarter of 93.1% was an improvement of 2.2 points from quarter 3 a year ago. That's where the expense and loss ratio improvements are coming through. Our P&C top line growth of 2% year-over-year was largely driven by reinsurance, where, as I mentioned, we are finding a few more opportunities. But insurance, when you take out the noise, also showed underlying growth of 2% in the quarter. So we see this as good progress that we can continue. 
Before I turn it over to Pete, 2 other items of note, a comment on the recent hurricanes and a few thoughts on our innovation efforts. First, Hurricane Nicole, while not financially significant, obviously was a near direct hit to Bermuda. And when you are a Bermuda-based company, this, of course, makes it very personal. Happily, our people fared well, and the company had minimal disruption. And the island and its people once again demonstrated their tremendous resilience.
With respect to Hurricane Matthew, it is early in the process. To give some meaning to that, you can understand that this is a difficult claims environment with regard to wind versus flood. Moreover for us, it is even more complicated, because as a large commercial property underwriter, there may well be some pinpoint losses covered by commercial flood insurance added to what we're observing in reinsurance. But with what we've seen so far and with both sources of loss in mind, we'd estimate a range of between $100 million and $2 million of loss -- and $200 million of loss. And although it is early, there is nothing that we've seen that is giving us any surprise. We will make a pre-announcement as things clarify further.
Then as to innovation. I want to emphasize this because it's quite remarkable when you consider all of the other things going on, these difficult and intense operational objectives of ours. First, as we'll talk about later, we had news today about Paul Brand and the new role he will be taking in leading our innovation effort. He'll have a small team, some of which is already recruited, to push us forward faster. I think in retrospect, this will be seen as a very important moment in the history of our company. Second, our XL Innovate efforts continue to bear more and more fruit, and you'll see more and more announcements about the new innovations we're pushing into the market and new investments we are making. And finally then, there's our relationship with Oxbotica, a leader in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence, which has taken off. And we are actively at work with them in some very exciting new projects, teaching us about risk in these new autonomous systems, the Internet of Things and how we can think about potentially using dynamic pricing.
So we see our innovation efforts as maturing, not just in the many citations for new products introduced, which we've always enjoyed, not just in the many new pricing models that work in the company, but in these even more fundamental and potentially revolutionary ways.
We are proud of the way our underwriters are working our way through this market. We're excited about our progress and the way these trends indicate that more progress is at hand.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."

Mike shared with you the improvement in our operating net income per share versus the same quarter last year.

Mike shared with you the improvement in our operating net income per share versus the same quarter last year. We achieved this even with significantly higher catastrophe losses in the third quarter than we had in the same quarter a year ago. Our natural catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premiums for the third quarter, totaled $97 million or 4.1 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $31 million or 1.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. The 2.2-point improvement in our P&C combined ratio versus the same quarter last year was driven by improvements in the operating expense ratio, and Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As David mentioned, we provided several slides this quarter in addition to our normal materials. These slides are in response to the numerous requests from investors and analysts that we provide further clarity of our view of our ongoing business.
Slide 5 details the improvement in the third quarter 2016 earnings per share compared to last year. Slide 6 pictorially shows what we disclosed in our June 8-K on expenses. And if you could turn to Slide 7, we provide a normalized view of our 9-month operating ROE, excluding net unrealized investment gains that includes adjustments to reported results for timing differences and for naturally varying elements of our results.
We start with our operating ROE, excluding net unrealized investment gains. The first adjustment is to simply exclude integration costs which are nonrecurring. The next adjustment is to annualize our preferred dividends, most of which are incurred in the first and third quarters. The next 3 adjustments used the Street's consensus view at the beginning of 2016 for key areas of volatility.
We have chosen to normalize using The Street's consensus view to avoid making qualitative adjustments and to use information produced by the investment community. This is not an endorsement of The Street's consensus view. We simply obtained The Street's consensus for each column for the full year, multiplied it by 75% and then subtracted our actual 9-month results and then tax-effected it.
The adjustment to prior year development has been included to reflect that we conduct in-depth reviews of our reserves only twice each year, and as a result, our prior development does not emerge equally by quarter. The next 2 adjustments to our affiliate assets and catastrophes are an attempt to normalize for naturally volatile parts of our operations.
With these adjustments, our annualized ROE for the first 3 quarters of 2016 will be 8.6%. I know this slide has limitations, but I hope you'll find it responsive. 
Operating expenses improved compared to both the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2015 as our ongoing integration and synergy benefits take hold. Our estimates for operating expense levels for the rest of this year and next year remain in line with those provided in our 8-K filed in June, except for an estimated additional $10 million and onetime integration costs in the fourth quarter of this year due to the change in our insurance operating model.
As is our normal practice, during the first and third quarters, our reserving process is based on a review of our actual versus expected losses. Our semiannual full actuarial review will be included in next quarter's results. 
Prior year net development in the third quarter was a favorable $54 million or 2.3 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $28 million or 1.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $23 million in the Insurance segment and $31 million in the Reinsurance segment. 
As detailed in our financial supplement, our estimated operating tax rate, exclusive of discrete impacts, has declined to 8.5%, reflecting geographic distribution of our underwriting profits.
Fully diluted book value per share grew by 1.6% in the third quarter and by 9% in the 9 months ended September 30.
Turning to the investment portfolio. And as usual, my comments will exclude the life funds withheld assets. Net investment income was $171 million compared to $179 million for the prior year third quarter and $176 million in the second quarter, which, as I mentioned last quarter, was somewhat elevated for a few nonrecurring factors. 
Net investment income will continue to remain under pressure given the current low interest rate environment and from lower cash flow as a result of our share repurchase program. We have approximately $3.5 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the  third quarter, our average new money rate was 1.9%. And at the end of September, the gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio was 2.3%, and the duration of the total investment portfolio remained at 3.3 years.
Total affiliate income was $25 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year third quarter. All categories of affiliate holdings contributed positive earnings this quarter, although the absolute returns from our hedge fund portfolio remained disappointing. Despite that, we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns over time.
Unrealized net gains were $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Total return on investments was 0.7% for the quarter in original currency.
And with respect to capital management, we continue to execute share buybacks during the third quarter. During the quarter, we purchased 6.6 million shares for $222 million at an average price of $33.61 per share, leaving $594 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. For the 9 months, we have purchased 26.2 million shares for $905 million at an average price of $34.54.
As I've noted before, this rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April as well as an acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and expect to continue share buybacks at a more modest rate for the rest of the year.
And now I'll turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."

The segment produced a calendar quarter combined rat",697,"Thanks, Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management. 
First, the results. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.3% compared to 97.2% in Q3 2015 and 96.4% last quarter. Higher cat expense was $71 million, of which $28 million is related to prior quarter cats compared to $7 million in Q3 2015. It was more than offset by prior year reserve releases of $23 million, by material improvements and the underwriting expense ratio of 2 points and a reduction in the accident year x cat loss ratio of 1 point. On an accident quarter x cat basis, the combined ratio is 93.3% compared to 96.3% in Q3 2015. And if we look at the first 3 quarters we reported an accident year x cat combined ratio of 93.6% compared to 95.3% in 2015. At Q3, we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.4% compared to 13.2% in Q3 2015 and 13.7% reported last quarter. This continues to be in line with the guidance we provided in Q1. This slight increase in acquisition ratio is more than offset by a Q3 operating expense ratio of 18.3%, which was 2.2 points lower than Q3 2015, by a net accident year x cat loss ratio of 61.7%, which was 1 point lower than Q3 2015 and is the result of the reunderwriting work we started last year. 
Pricing was slightly better at minus 1.3% for the quarter and minus 2.6% for the full year. Our casualty lines were up 1%. Our specialty businesses were largely flat with the improvements in our accident and health lines, offset by continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines. 
Our professional businesses were down 2% and our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%, once again, driven by energy and North American property.
Insurance price premiums written in Q3 were down by 2% or $47 million on a reported basis year-over-year and when we normalize the foreign exchange, down less than 1% in the quarter.
However, when you also consider the portfolio-tuning activity that started in 2015, where decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses, we continue to see growth in the 3% range for the business we like on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth demonstrates that whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction and to finding new profitable opportunities. 
As Mike mentioned, we continue to see plenty of new business opportunities. Our submission flow is up 8%, and our quote ratio is up 5% with our top brokers. So we're seeing more business that we like. However our conversion rates are down nearly 4%, clearly reflecting over underwriting discipline given the market.
For the insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $538 million compared to $536 million in Q3 2015. This represents 25% of the GPW compared to 24.3% in Q3 2015.
As mentioned previously, the ceded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance programs and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing. And as a result, the written session ratios can and will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
As mentioned in the previous quarter, it is essential that we react to top line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter, we selectively exited another 15 positions for a total of nearly 90 positions so far this year as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across the segment. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will continue to flow through in subsequent quarters along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway.
In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continue to grow the underlying book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And as we finally -- finalized our business plans for 2017, we fully expect this momentum to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus. 
And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."

Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results.

Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 86.5% compared with 91.2% in the third quarter of last year. The result for the quarter experienced favorable prior year development, lower accident quarter x cat loss ratio and an improved expense ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $31 million compared to $35 million a year ago. As Pete noted, the third quarter is not a full valuation quarter, and reserve releases were driven by property classes of business. In particular, our loss from last year's Tianjin explosion reduced by $7 million, and estimates for a number of small catastrophe events were lower. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios.
The reinsurance limit produced an accident quarter x cat loss ratio of 54.9%, which compares to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by the Tianjin event last year, offset predominantly by a handful of medium size of 9 cat losses as well as a smaller impact from a change in mix of business and market conditions.
Catastrophe losses totaled $26 billion, net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter, compared to $23 million in the third quarter of last year.
The cat activity during the quarter resulted from a number of small events as well as developments from the Texas hailstorms in the second quarter. Offsetting these events reduced our estimates of the Fort McMurray fires and Japan earthquake from last quarter.
The expense ratio decreased 3.9 points to 32.1% in the third quarter compared to 36% for the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies continued to earn through. Further, we saw a 1 point drop in our acquisition expense ratio as the impact from purchase accounting continues to diminish.
Turning to top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $566 million, up from $459 million in the third quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by new business and share increases. As we have discussed in prior quarters, XL Catlin has received strong support from our clients and brokers. We are pleased to see that support show up in the top line. This growth was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we non-renewed or reduced shares on nearly $60 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms. On a year-to-date basis, for the combined portfolio, we have grown just over 7% after adjusting for foreign exchange and multiple year premiums. 
Shifting to market conditions. We found the pricing environment challenging, but rate decreases continued to decelerate in most lines and regions. And as noted last quarter, we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business.
During the quarter, rates across the segment were down approximately 2%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 4% this quarter and 5% for the year-to-date, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015.
The remainder of the Property Treaty book, rates were down 2.5%, and our casualty business remained flat over last year. The remainder of our classes were flat-to-down low single digits. U.S. short tail and global casualty treaty placements continue to struggle if terms and conditions were aggressively pushed at renewal.
In summary, the third quarter results were respectable for the Reinsurance segment. As the market reaches the bottom in many classes, we are well positioned to succeed as our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job growing profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline.
I'll now turn it back to Mike."
406440,404123049,1062559,"XL Group Ltd, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Greg. As you saw this morning, we announced a realignment of our P&C operating model, and I want to quickly walk you through this news.

As you saw this morning, we announced a realignment of our P&C operating model, and I want to quickly walk you through this news. If you go back to when we brought the 2 companies together, we combined XL and Catlin into a classically matrix-ed insurance organization to take advantage of the best of both prior operating models. And we knew that when the time was right, we'd take a step back to adjust for what we were learning about the organization and to be able to even better respond to the marketplace.
Much of this now announced realignments started with observations from Paul Brand and Kelly Lyles earlier this year. And on top of their minds was to have a model that accelerated and deepened our innovation successes and responded better to the market by streamlining decision-making and getting the business as close to the customer as possible.
So as to innovation, Paul will be taking on the new roll as Director of Accelerate, the new internal innovation team. I'm extraordinarily excited to see what they will produce.
Then there are other changes to the operating model itself. The most obvious of which is that we are bringing together insurance and reinsurance into 1 P&C organization under Greg Hendrick's leadership. We will, of course, maintain all of the appropriate governance and separation required between the insurance and reinsurance operations, but we feel that by working together at a high level under the same span of control, we can harness the power of that adjacency for our customers' benefit. Solutions are clearly blending, and we want to be in a position to lead these developments on our client's behalf. Having led insurance and reinsurance and having been instrumental in developing our long-standing strategy, Greg is clearly ideally suited for this new role.
Then another key learning for us has been the instrumental role country and territorial leadership plays for us around the world. So you'll see that in the new model, our P&C business groups are supported by 4 key capabilities, one of which is client and country management. And Kelly Lyles, who, as you know, is currently our Chief Regional Officer for insurance, will become the Chief Executive Client and Country Management, who will be responsible for our global broker relationships and for ensuring that we have strong leadership in our key geographies. Kelly will report directly to me and to Greg and will continue to be a member of our group leadership team. 
You can find a much more detailed breakdown of the new structure and the names of who will lead within it in, in what we released this morning. We firmly believe that this realignment will create a more efficient, responsive and profitable business. While the announcement is new, this is something we have been contemplating for some time. And although there are people impacts, they will be very limited among a handful of senior positions. We will still have some people who we are really excited about move on as there just aren't as many roles in the new model. We are proud to work with -- to have worked with these people, and we wish them the very best. 
One more topic. You would have seen an 8-K this afternoon that I'm going to be selling some shares, and I can understand that this could be misinterpreted in 2 important ways: First, that I am somehow less committed to my job; or second, that I believe this is somehow a good price at which to be selling. The opposite isn't the case in both respects.
More than 2 years ago, I decided with my family that my commitment to XL was open-ended, that this wasn't going to be just some turnaround gig but a mission far greater and longer than that. As a result, I made some broader financial plans, the last part of which was to sell some shares, happily for XL, but not so happily for my personal plans. Before I acted on selling, the XL Catlin combination talks heated up. This is the first time since that I have felt comfortable taking this long-delayed action. That said, I fully expect to be kicking myself next year over the price I will have to accept. But I am simply past the point where I can wait given what I put in motion 2 long years ago. And I want to emphasize that even after these sales, XL shares will remain our family's largest single asset by far, as it should be.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A."

And we'd observed for Q3 anywhere between 49% and 58% for accident year x cat loss ratio, with a 54% average, right around 54% and a bit where we are this quarter. So I think we're in line. Those are driven by reinsurance's not heavily attrition-driven loss ratio. It's a number of small mid and sometimes large losses. I think we had a little bit more this quarter than we would normally expect but nothing outside.

You also asked, sort of taken as a whole, does this mean anything relative to our ambition to be delivering double-digit ROEs? And how would you get there? A couple of comments. Number one, I mentioned these 5 trends, the idea that we're getting more flow from our partners. And we're even seeing more business that we'd like to write, but at this point in the market, find it difficult to actually write more. So that flow is a very good sign of our position in the marketplace today. The second thing is we are finding some growth. As I mentioned for this quarter, in essence, the overall was 2%. If you then went back and normalize for some of the reunderwriting activities in insurance, we actually had growth there that was positive. And then third, I talked about the fact that the loss ratio year-over-year, that the underlying loss ratio has declined. And where there has been some higher large loss activity in this year, which the market's been talking about, we've been talking about, we've been largely, not entirely, but largely able to absorb that as we've gone along, which is a sign of the greater resilience of this book of business. Fourth, I talked about expenses and the fact that we're meeting those aggressive targets that we have laid out to The Street and we expect to continue to do so. And fifth, of course, I talked about capital management, which, of course, has been very significant in this year and continues to improve the E in which we work. If I take those 5 together, that is where some of the progress toward this objective comes from. But there's 2 additional things that come into play next year that isn't evident this year. Number one, we will have worked most of those larger reunderwriting actions through the book, and they will no longer have the same negative impact on our loss ratio that it continues to have today. Now we're always doing a little bit of reunderwriting, but those actions we took in '15 were a very significant dimension. And we finally get them largely through the book of business. And they won't have that same negative loss ratio drag. Second, we also will be away from the negative top line drag that those activities have created. And I would hope that then next year, we'll actually see the growth that our underwriters are able to find come through into the numbers. So those are 2 more accelerants that are added to those 5 trends as we get in 2017. Now I know you want me to conclude that was some table-pounding forecast. I'm not going to do that. Our budget is still in the works. The board has not yet adopted it. But I like what those trends imply about our ability to continue to expand margins. And as we finalize the budget, I'll have more to say about what that yields in totality. But it's clearly trends that work in favor of what we've said we will do."

First of all, we will likely exceed modestly what we've talked about so far. So it won't just reduce to kind of $50 million. It will moderate, but it will clearly exceed that for the balance of the year. With respect to next year, it's a bit premature, right? I mean, we haven't adopted the budget, as I mentioned a moment ago, and that work finalizes in early December and work with the board. And that's why historically, as you know, we have commented and given some directional intent around both share repurchases and around expenses and that end-of-year call kind of 3 months from now. That still when we will give you more guidance. Now on expenses, there's no more guidance to give. We've already talked about the expense levels we're going to achieve, and we're going to achieve them. And the only direction that could change is if somehow we forecast a lot lower revenue, then we would probably drive them even lower. But I don't, at this point, expect that. Second, with respect to share repurchases, a couple of thoughts. One, there's nothing going on that would indicate we would do any less than we originally intend to do last year. So I would find it very hard to imagine a circumstance where it would be lower than our initial guidance. And obviously, we continue to feel that this -- that XL is fundamentally underpriced. And as a result, we've been more opportunistic this year as we had opportunities to do so. I would like to think that somewhere between those 2 is, I would think, where we might come out, but it's just -- it's a bit premature to say. But I'm still bullish on how share repurchases fit into the entire story. And we'll give more precise directional observations when it comes to the end of your call."

And I'll start at the highest level. Given their history and given their scale, there is no way that the expense savings that have been achieved to date and will be achieved by the end of '17 could possibly have taken place without the combination. And given how the soft market playbook works as it were, expenses become more and more important as the soft market grinds on. So that is the first and most obvious and tangible benefit to shareholders. Second, we did not expect, as this combination was created, that the pricing environment would become so dire, especially in specialty lines. That took us off guard. There is, again, no way that the prior separate institutions could have thought through, with the success that they're having in creating, again, when you clean out the reunderwriting effects, some modest growth. That wouldn't have happened. Each franchise would have been weaker, you wouldn't have seen this lift in submissions. The opportunity to see more and to try and pick your way through this market was greatly enhanced by the combination that we have made. And I know and I say this every call, you have lots of contacts in the broker community, the market community. You know that, that's true. And we go to all of our meetings, and we hear it time and time again. A part of how we've been able to achieve that in a way that doesn't lose underwriting control is we've been able to up our relationships with existing clients with proven track records. That couldn't have been possible for each company independently before because it was only through bringing the firms together that we had both the greater capital base and the greater diversified capital base for those counterparties to trust our continuing growth with them. So in each of those cases, Josh, we are talking about things that were made possible by the combination. Now in a tougher market..."

So from my -- you caught me right toward the end. And by the way, that diversified balance sheet gave rise to a greater opportunity for capital management as well than independently, I think, you would have seen from either company. Moreover, we are able to better absorb patterns of larger losses as we had seen this year. So in every one of those respects, this firm is performing better than the separate companies would have performed in the same market conditions. We didn't foresee it, we didn't do it because we saw it coming, we did it because we thought it was the right thing to do. Greg has an expression that I quite like, and since this is a largely U.S. audience, I can use it. I find it difficult to recreate it around the world. But from an underwriting talent point of view, which was the key objective to aggregate that talent and to put it to work for our clients and for our shareholders, we've really got a lineup like the 1927 Yankees. I mean, this is the most powerful collection of this specialty and market-leading thinkers that you could get. But it's like we assembled that talent and then there was a player strike. I mean, that is the equivalent. They can't do everything they could do because the market conditions are what they are. And in the end, maintaining our discipline in this market, which the very statistics that Paul walked you through, is exactly what they should be doing. And I can't tell you how grateful I am for the work they're doing, because they do it in miserable conditions over and over and over. You get told, well, we'd love you, but you just didn't match this crazy price someone else gave you. And then they got to go, do it again and do it again.

We just wouldn't have seen large participations with clients that don't go out to the broad market. You see it coming through in our Q3 growth. I want to make sure I point out. Remember, reinsurance is a lumpy business, so that's not to say that the growth we had in the third quarter is now embedded in there going forward. It's not the case. But we do see more and more of those, so you see that coming through in this quarter. We've got more focused on client management, so we're seeing more business from the clients we like and know than we used to do in the past when we where perhaps not quite as structured about it as independent firms. And I think Mike touched on the diversification point. You don't see it in the Fin Supp. But if I look just at the other line in reinsurance in the Fin Supp, you'll see a pretty good set of growth there. Well, that's because XL wasn't in credit and surety. XL and Catlin have build a good business around that. And Catlin wasn't in health reinsurance, and we were in health reinsurance at XL. And so as you bring these 2 books together, there's just a much better diversified, more stable business."

We faced 2 headwinds, all of us together, right? We faced the soft market headwind together, and that can be variable according to any particular mix of business, but that is common across the board theme. And we faced this interest rate environment in common together, which puts so much more demand on the underwriting result. So those -- both of those, I don't see huge change coming in either one. You never know, but I -- there's nothing that's happened that would forecast that. In -- so let me walk through kind of the pricing environments and our attitude toward -- across the 2 books. In reinsurance, as Greg said, we've seen a bottoming out. And if you've been following the news out of Button Bob [ph], for example, where there's a lot of reinsurance contracts being discussed, you're seeing a clear change in attitude from the market side of the equation, and you're just seeing a lot more prospect in terms and conditions, you're seeing no more, that's enough. I mean, you're just seeing a different attitude in very public display, and I think that's very encouraging. And I would carry that further to the large commercial marketplace. And we look at global program-type business. We even saw one of the leaders of one of the buyer associations in Germany publicly say that the conversation had to become more balanced in the interest of our carriers. When they start saying that, a community that usually is talking you down all the time, that just tells you there's something new and different going on in the marketplace. I don't think it portends a turn, but it's a change that is clearly going to moderate the downward pressure in some areas. Now there's some like energy, aviation, where it's just hard to understand what's going on. So I do believe that all competitors face that pressure in common. I don't know exactly how to translate that to an ROE headwind because it differs by how the companies respond to it. For us, we've been cutting back writings in those lines where our competition has gotten ridiculous. We don't have a broad one-size-fits-all attitude. We have a lot of sophistication in how we do pricing, and we're able to be very clear with our clients kind of where it just becomes something we can't do. So we do that client by client in conversation. But if we look at aviation, if we look at energy, if we look at some of the marine areas, those are clear areas where we're going to have less writings because our underwriters are at a point where they can't tolerate what's going on. There are other pockets where we can grow. And so I can't make it -- I can't translate it to an industry FX. I can tell you what we're doing. And so far, as you see by the improvement in the loss ratio year-over-year on a sustained basis, we are seeing that strategy play out to our benefit. We're fighting off these headwinds which were present last year and accelerated at the beginning of this year. So I feel okay about that. I really can't put myself in the other shoes because I don't know how their mix of activity and repurchasing and all that. I just know what our trends are. I can't speak to theirs."

And they aren't -- well, they are market-facing in the sense that they have presence in the marketplace. They are not the people conducting daily transactional business. And in fact, one of the primes of why we made this change and how it works is the daily transactional level is practically unaffected. So tomorrow, they're working for the same people, they are answering. It's just -- but what there is, is there is a simplified referral process in essence. There's less hands with different points of views injecting themselves into that process. That should speed up decision-making and make it simpler both for our people and for the market to know where to go when there's a little bit of hair on the risk as it were.

This could enable us to work faster and better and maybe even see that stimulated more. The final bit is just that country management piece. In essence, if you stepped back, we had put in a pretty heavy regional structure. This lightens that regional structure some, but it empowers more that country level manager because that's where we saw the real lift. That's where we saw that work with the relationships. And so those people that were -- we were actually seeing some growth because of them. For example, in LatAm, our 2 operations there in Mexico City and in Brazil, I happened to have been in both offices over the last few weeks, they're off a small base, but they're winning awards for their responsiveness in the marketplace. And we're seeing kind of 80% type growth rates off those small bases because of this newer local presence. That we've enhanced by this and taken off some of the upstream requirements so we can make decisions faster. So no, I'm sorry for the long answer, but this is really important to us. No, we don't expect that at all."

As I look at your company, it looks like the reinsurance business has a really very good combined ratio. The insurance business is maybe a little bit of improvement but really dramatically not more of the low-90s. It's really a pretty solid combined ratio for that business. So that seems to leave only 2 more levers, and I'm excluding investment income because it is what it is. That's your corporate expense and the operating levers that you use to get you to an ROE. And it seems like those are the 2 pieces that if you're actually going to get to a really solid double-digit ROE or what you have to pull to achieve that. Is that right?"

But I walked through those 5 trends, all of which are meant to address the belief we have, the absolutely we have, that we can continue to expand margins in our insurance operation. And I mentioned 2 accelerants that come into play more next year that were not present this year. So we'll get a fuller benefit of the growth that our underwriters are able to create, and we'll get less of a drag as was just discussed on the loss ratio due to that reunderwriting activity. So those are meant to directly address that we believe the insurance combined ratio can improve from here and that we can fight our way through the obvious negative effects of the pricing environment. So first, that. Second, we have been very aggressive in -- on the ease side of things through our share repurchases in this year. As Pete mentioned, we're already at $950 million. And I think the way anyone reasonably listen to him would say, ""And that's going to go up."" And as I answered Kai, we see something certainly better than our initial expectation for this year and, perhaps, up to what we did do this year. So you're talking about a couple of levers that move things meaningfully in the equation it is you're trying to solve for. And we're starting from what is -- as Pete laboriously described in great detail, what is something like a normalized 8.6%. And let's see what the fourth quarter, ex-Matthew of course, produces. But -- so we see the -- so if you were looking at it from our shoes, if you believed that the combined ratio and insurance could continue to come down, if you believed that overall expenses, including corporate expenses, would continue to come down at the levels that we have described before, and if you believed you could get a modest bit of growth into that more efficient model, you would say to yourself, that's within range. Exactly how more to describe that -- I told you I'm not going to pound the table today. I'm not -- I haven't finished the budget. Pete's got a couple of thoughts to add. But we're getting there, and we're pretty pleased with our progress, so I don't know what else to tell you."

So the numbers that we put out in that slide were for the 9 months, and everyone knows that we had not a very good first quarter. And so the run rate the last 2 quarters are certainly better than the average for the 3 quarters. The second thing is I wouldn't just think about the corporate expenses. The way we think about it is we need to do better on, I will call it, the loss ratio and commission ratio to get to the technical ratio, right? And then we look at the overall expenses. If you look at what we said we were going to do, that's about a $70 million improvement year-on-year, right? So that's 0.7 of a percent right there. And then since our expenses are in essence locked at this point in time, right, you're talking about leverage, it's ultimate leverage, right. So for every dollar of premium, extra premium that we write, 1 minus technical ratio falls through the bottom line. So I do think that there are levers there, but again, this is not to try and walk you to a 10%."

Not everything in the reinsurance market is at a very low return level. You've seen cat experiences in a couple of countries around the year and in last year, and you're seeing rates respond to that. You're seeing casualty in general starting to flatten out and really renew same again year-over-year. So there isn't just one big, bad market out there. The general tone of it across it is not great, but there is pockets of opportunities. And I would say the folks on the ground have been going really hard at making sure they find those, focusing on the clients that we know because we trade with them already in other areas. I think that is the biggest thing as a regard to the -- as regards to who we're going after in the business there. The growth rate is going to be lumpy, right? It was 23% in the quarter on gross written. It's 7% for the year when you adjust for FX and multiyear. So there's just -- it's never -- we're not growing at 23% on a per annum basis. That's not going to happen, but we did have a couple of opportunities. In this quarter, one of them was to expand an existing relationship we have with a credit customer. Another couple were around motor or auto coverage, which have a slightly higher combined ratio but also a lower volatility and less downside to them. So it's that kind of -- they came up. They were offered to us. We believe because of our new presence in the marketplace, and we took advantage of them. There may not be any of them in the fourth quarter. We're trying hard to find them all the time and do it the right way, but they don't always come up in that same quarter-to-quarter fashion."

We're basically counteracting kind of what's tough market, some tough pricing by blending in these new pieces. So there isn't -- I wouldn't point you to there's going to be a dramatic improvement in accident year ex-cat as they seem to come online. If the market turns, and we have a lot of opportunity to lift and get that kind of growth in a major way, you would start to see a lower, I would believe, a lower accident year ex-cat loss ratio.

Or is it something that translates into better growth and margins in the core underwriting businesses? How do we evaluate whether this initiative is doing well?"

So given that it's still -- I wouldn't call early days but relatively early. I think it's -- I think you're right to ask, and we need to give more t",973,"Yes, let me give you -- and to be honest, over time, we're going to work on many more metrics around this. So given that it's still -- I wouldn't call early days but relatively early. I think it's -- I think you're right to ask, and we need to give more thought to exactly how to present to you. But let me give you some examples. First of all, yes to your first question. Are we always hunting for more ASIs? Sure. We don't make a lot of those kinds of bets. But in those bets, we get a couple of benefits. Number one, we get, we believe, attractively priced reinsurance opportunities. Because of the strategic relationship, we're able to negotiate differently on the terms of reinsurance, and we find that a very attractive method to -- in this difficult market add to our reinsurance writings. And then you get the potential. That kind of -- that tends to lessen the risk of whatever investment might be associated, and then you get the potential upside if the investment proves wise as well. So we like both of those. And we don't take a lot. We're not a spread shooter. We're very targeted on things that are related to things where you have extra keys or things that we want to learn about, and we get that benefit. The second thing we get is we get eyes-on, hands-dirty experience with some of these new and potentially disruptive insurance models. We get to learn how the technology works. We get to learn whether it works. We get to learn whether the promised innovation is real, and we get to think about what application that might have for our businesses. And if -- and because of the way we negotiate these in some cases, we have even rights to increase our ownership or to use technology. There's different elements of how we negotiate each one of these. So that's the second benefit we get. The third one relates to our pricing insight. We have been actively, and I'd say, somewhat quietly building models to gain pricing advantages. We all know that when you are an early adopter in modeling, you get a double lift. You not only get the benefit of your model, assuming it's right, and ours have been uncannily effective, but you also get the benefit that those things that you turn away for reasons that others aren't able to analyze can actually lead to some adverse business-building for them. So we get a twofer for out of that. We are -- I'm not ready to talk about it. Others like to talk about this a lot. We actually kind of enjoy the quiet effectiveness. We have a number of these models up, running and adhered to across XL. And over the coming years, I think it would be right to put some metrics around that for you to understand better. So there, you get loss ratio lift, and we have a meaningful portion of the book now getting that lift from that activity. And then fourth, we -- also where we innovate, we get to invent markets where we are lonely in our competition, which is rare in our space, but I'll give you an explicit example. You've heard me talk about it before, but it's worth mentioning. That's new energy risk, where we've built an MGA/MGU, created an entirely new product for it. We're the first to market in it. We had much less cost to building that out because the brokers didn't have expertise to contribute and wound up in a weaker position in the transaction, and therefore, extracted less fees. And in the end, we're now writing about $75 million of that. And at this stage, I'm touching all the wood I can find, there has been no losses on that business, and it is growing. It's -- in fact, we're working on some adjacent products that we're hoping shortly to be rolling out. Whenever you're able to do something like that, you do so with less of this crazy competitive environment that we've all been talking about. You're doing it -- you have a lead position. You are able to run ahead. That's where, I think, what Paul is taking on, what we're doing with Oxbotica. All of that, that fits in that category. XL Innovate, a part of what they do is what I talked about first, but a part of what they do is this too, where they are entirely reinventing a business model and leading out with a new product that we think has -- is very hard to imitate. We run with -- obviously, people try, but they can't because they haven't spent several years deep into the science, which we do. So that's why the Oxbotica relationship is one I call out specifically because it is teaching us things that we know are coming and that we believe we can lead because of our deep understanding of the science behind it in creating the insurance products that people are going to need. That kind of thing really gives us a differential lift in the marketplace. So, yes, you're right. It's tough to measure externally, particularly at this point. I brought it up because it is now at a maturing point, and we believe we will need to get in front of you and give much more definition to this a way for you to think about it. But I think that those who are not -- there -- we aren't the only one doing some of these things. I think we're doing it with a coherence and a practicality that is starting to show up in our numbers, and I'm looking forward to talking about that in greater depth in the future, Ian."

It's because, as I said last quarter, our non large cat losses, so those small attritional cats, are recorded as accident year ex-cat in our numbers. Those are to reflect the fact that there's seasonality in the exposures. And that as a reinsurer, there's a lag in information. We're usually behind as you get these events reported, particularly on your pro rata, proportional treaties that you're getting information quite often in arrears.

Today was an exciting day to announce the changes with respect to Paul and Greg and to start streamlining and making this place work even better. We're really excited about these changes. But I want to put it in a little more context. 
In a speech I remember from 2012, we talked about innovation and how you go about getting innovation in a existing industry, and we emphasized that you had to be willing to take your best minds and take them out of P&L process and put them on innovation, or else, you weren't going to get there. And the example I used then, of a decision we felt very heroic about and very good about was taking Greg Hendrick out of his highly profitable job running our cat book in Bermuda and putting him on the strategy for the company, the reinvention of this company. We felt that was a great decision then and it has led to subsequent successes that give us great confidence in his role as a leader of all of P&C. And you see us taking that playbook out again with respect to Paul, and the opportunity to take one of the sharpest underwriting minds any of us have ever met and set him loose on bringing these maturing activities to greater impact throughout our book of business and into the future. When we have a confident and great set of hands like Greg to lead the resulting P&C operation and a mind like Paul set loose on innovation, we see this as a day we will remember in future years as one of those moments when XL really took on the next level of opportunity. 
It's an exciting day for us. We look forward to the future. Thank you very much for the call and the questions on the call, and good night."

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. 
Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date in which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. 
Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our website and in the earnings release included as an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing third quarter 2016 results.

And then I'll come back to make a few comments on our realigned P&C operating model and some related role changes, which we announced this morning. We will then open it up for questions. 
As I commented in the results press release, this is the second quarter of solid progress and seeing the power of the business that we are building emerge in the numbers. 
I see 5 solid trends that demonstrate how we are doing the right things and especially the right things given the difficult market conditions in which we operate. 
First, as Paul will detail, our submissions have gone up both in quantity and in the variety of risk we are asked to look at. This means our trading partners like doing business with us and wants to do more. This is a reflection of our successful combination. 
Second, our underwriters are doing the really tough work, and it is hard for them to find adequately priced risk. This quarter, our reinsurance book was the driver of some growth in a somewhat bottoming pricing environment. And our insurance book, when you take out the noise created by underwriting actions, also showed modest growth year-over-year. So our underwriters are doing the right stuff, but you only see modest growth as a result of their efforts and even these greater submissions because it's so tough to find risk that is appropriately priced. That is exactly what a good underwriting company does in times like these.
Third, despite multiple years of pricing deterioration, our loss ratio continues to improve year-over-year. Now I know it ticked up a bit in the third quarter relative to the second, but with a book like ours, we do not find this meaningful. Paul can get into that with a little more color. But when you look at it year-over-year, we see significant and sustained improvement. 
Fourth, our expenses continue to decline as we have said they would, which, taken together with our underwriting actions, is producing our overall improved combined ratio. 
And then fifth, we continue to repurchase shares in line with what we told you we would do and I'd say with some opportunistic flair.
These are the 5 things you should be expecting us to do given market conditions, and our numbers bear it out. 
So turning to these results. Excluding the Catlin integration costs of $55 million, operating earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, and operating ROE, excluding unrealized gains and losses, was 6.6% for the quarter. Our P&C combined ratio in the quarter of 93.1% was an improvement of 2.2 points from quarter 3 a year ago. That's where the expense and loss ratio improvements are coming through. Our P&C top line growth of 2% year-over-year was largely driven by reinsurance, where, as I mentioned, we are finding a few more opportunities. But insurance, when you take out the noise, also showed underlying growth of 2% in the quarter. So we see this as good progress that we can continue. 
Before I turn it over to Pete, 2 other items of note, a comment on the recent hurricanes and a few thoughts on our innovation efforts. First, Hurricane Nicole, while not financially significant, obviously was a near direct hit to Bermuda. And when you are a Bermuda-based company, this, of course, makes it very personal. Happily, our people fared well, and the company had minimal disruption. And the island and its people once again demonstrated their tremendous resilience.
With respect to Hurricane Matthew, it is early in the process. To give some meaning to that, you can understand that this is a difficult claims environment with regard to wind versus flood. Moreover for us, it is even more complicated, because as a large commercial property underwriter, there may well be some pinpoint losses covered by commercial flood insurance added to what we're observing in reinsurance. But with what we've seen so far and with both sources of loss in mind, we'd estimate a range of between $100 million and $2 million of loss -- and $200 million of loss. And although it is early, there is nothing that we've seen that is giving us any surprise. We will make a pre-announcement as things clarify further.
Then as to innovation. I want to emphasize this because it's quite remarkable when you consider all of the other things going on, these difficult and intense operational objectives of ours. First, as we'll talk about later, we had news today about Paul Brand and the new role he will be taking in leading our innovation effort. He'll have a small team, some of which is already recruited, to push us forward faster. I think in retrospect, this will be seen as a very important moment in the history of our company. Second, our XL Innovate efforts continue to bear more and more fruit, and you'll see more and more announcements about the new innovations we're pushing into the market and new investments we are making. And finally then, there's our relationship with Oxbotica, a leader in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence, which has taken off. And we are actively at work with them in some very exciting new projects, teaching us about risk in these new autonomous systems, the Internet of Things and how we can think about potentially using dynamic pricing.
So we see our innovation efforts as maturing, not just in the many citations for new products introduced, which we've always enjoyed, not just in the many new pricing models that work in the company, but in these even more fundamental and potentially revolutionary ways.
We are proud of the way our underwriters are working our way through this market. We're excited about our progress and the way these trends indicate that more progress is at hand.

Mike shared with you the improvement in our operating net income per share versus the same quarter last year.

Mike shared with you the improvement in our operating net income per share versus the same quarter last year. We achieved this even with significantly higher catastrophe losses in the third quarter than we had in the same quarter a year ago. Our natural catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premiums for the third quarter, totaled $97 million or 4.1 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $31 million or 1.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. The 2.2-point improvement in our P&C combined ratio versus the same quarter last year was driven by improvements in the operating expense ratio, and Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.
As David mentioned, we provided several slides this quarter in addition to our normal materials. These slides are in response to the numerous requests from investors and analysts that we provide further clarity of our view of our ongoing business.
Slide 5 details the improvement in the third quarter 2016 earnings per share compared to last year. Slide 6 pictorially shows what we disclosed in our June 8-K on expenses. And if you could turn to Slide 7, we provide a normalized view of our 9-month operating ROE, excluding net unrealized investment gains that includes adjustments to reported results for timing differences and for naturally varying elements of our results.
We start with our operating ROE, excluding net unrealized investment gains. The first adjustment is to simply exclude integration costs which are nonrecurring. The next adjustment is to annualize our preferred dividends, most of which are incurred in the first and third quarters. The next 3 adjustments used the Street's consensus view at the beginning of 2016 for key areas of volatility.
We have chosen to normalize using The Street's consensus view to avoid making qualitative adjustments and to use information produced by the investment community. This is not an endorsement of The Street's consensus view. We simply obtained The Street's consensus for each column for the full year, multiplied it by 75% and then subtracted our actual 9-month results and then tax-effected it.
The adjustment to prior year development has been included to reflect that we conduct in-depth reviews of our reserves only twice each year, and as a result, our prior development does not emerge equally by quarter. The next 2 adjustments to our affiliate assets and catastrophes are an attempt to normalize for naturally volatile parts of our operations.
With these adjustments, our annualized ROE for the first 3 quarters of 2016 will be 8.6%. I know this slide has limitations, but I hope you'll find it responsive. 
Operating expenses improved compared to both the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2015 as our ongoing integration and synergy benefits take hold. Our estimates for operating expense levels for the rest of this year and next year remain in line with those provided in our 8-K filed in June, except for an estimated additional $10 million and onetime integration costs in the fourth quarter of this year due to the change in our insurance operating model.
As is our normal practice, during the first and third quarters, our reserving process is based on a review of our actual versus expected losses. Our semiannual full actuarial review will be included in next quarter's results. 
Prior year net development in the third quarter was a favorable $54 million or 2.3 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $28 million or 1.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $23 million in the Insurance segment and $31 million in the Reinsurance segment. 
As detailed in our financial supplement, our estimated operating tax rate, exclusive of discrete impacts, has declined to 8.5%, reflecting geographic distribution of our underwriting profits.
Fully diluted book value per share grew by 1.6% in the third quarter and by 9% in the 9 months ended September 30.
Turning to the investment portfolio. And as usual, my comments will exclude the life funds withheld assets. Net investment income was $171 million compared to $179 million for the prior year third quarter and $176 million in the second quarter, which, as I mentioned last quarter, was somewhat elevated for a few nonrecurring factors. 
Net investment income will continue to remain under pressure given the current low interest rate environment and from lower cash flow as a result of our share repurchase program. We have approximately $3.5 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the  third quarter, our average new money rate was 1.9%. And at the end of September, the gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio was 2.3%, and the duration of the total investment portfolio remained at 3.3 years.
Total affiliate income was $25 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year third quarter. All categories of affiliate holdings contributed positive earnings this quarter, although the absolute returns from our hedge fund portfolio remained disappointing. Despite that, we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns over time.
Unrealized net gains were $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Total return on investments was 0.7% for the quarter in original currency.
And with respect to capital management, we continue to execute share buybacks during the third quarter. During the quarter, we purchased 6.6 million shares for $222 million at an average price of $33.61 per share, leaving $594 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. For the 9 months, we have purchased 26.2 million shares for $905 million at an average price of $34.54.
As I've noted before, this rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April as well as an acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and expect to continue share buybacks at a more modest rate for the rest of the year.
And now I'll turn it over to Paul to discuss our Insurance segment results."

The segment produced a calendar quarter combined rat",697,"Thanks, Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management. 
First, the results. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.3% compared to 97.2% in Q3 2015 and 96.4% last quarter. Higher cat expense was $71 million, of which $28 million is related to prior quarter cats compared to $7 million in Q3 2015. It was more than offset by prior year reserve releases of $23 million, by material improvements and the underwriting expense ratio of 2 points and a reduction in the accident year x cat loss ratio of 1 point. On an accident quarter x cat basis, the combined ratio is 93.3% compared to 96.3% in Q3 2015. And if we look at the first 3 quarters we reported an accident year x cat combined ratio of 93.6% compared to 95.3% in 2015. At Q3, we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.4% compared to 13.2% in Q3 2015 and 13.7% reported last quarter. This continues to be in line with the guidance we provided in Q1. This slight increase in acquisition ratio is more than offset by a Q3 operating expense ratio of 18.3%, which was 2.2 points lower than Q3 2015, by a net accident year x cat loss ratio of 61.7%, which was 1 point lower than Q3 2015 and is the result of the reunderwriting work we started last year. 
Pricing was slightly better at minus 1.3% for the quarter and minus 2.6% for the full year. Our casualty lines were up 1%. Our specialty businesses were largely flat with the improvements in our accident and health lines, offset by continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines. 
Our professional businesses were down 2% and our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%, once again, driven by energy and North American property.
Insurance price premiums written in Q3 were down by 2% or $47 million on a reported basis year-over-year and when we normalize the foreign exchange, down less than 1% in the quarter.
However, when you also consider the portfolio-tuning activity that started in 2015, where decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses, we continue to see growth in the 3% range for the business we like on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth demonstrates that whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction and to finding new profitable opportunities. 
As Mike mentioned, we continue to see plenty of new business opportunities. Our submission flow is up 8%, and our quote ratio is up 5% with our top brokers. So we're seeing more business that we like. However our conversion rates are down nearly 4%, clearly reflecting over underwriting discipline given the market.
For the insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $538 million compared to $536 million in Q3 2015. This represents 25% of the GPW compared to 24.3% in Q3 2015.
As mentioned previously, the ceded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance programs and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing. And as a result, the written session ratios can and will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
As mentioned in the previous quarter, it is essential that we react to top line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter, we selectively exited another 15 positions for a total of nearly 90 positions so far this year as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across the segment. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will continue to flow through in subsequent quarters along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway.
In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continue to grow the underlying book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And as we finally -- finalized our business plans for 2017, we fully expect this momentum to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus. 
And now to Greg to discuss the Reinsurance results."

Today, I'll discuss the results for the quarter and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The Reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 86.5% compared with 91.2% in the third quarter of last year. The result for the quarter experienced favorable prior year development, lower accident quarter x cat loss ratio and an improved expense ratio.
Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $31 million compared to $35 million a year ago. As Pete noted, the third quarter is not a full valuation quarter, and reserve releases were driven by property classes of business. In particular, our loss from last year's Tianjin explosion reduced by $7 million, and estimates for a number of small catastrophe events were lower. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios.
The reinsurance limit produced an accident quarter x cat loss ratio of 54.9%, which compares to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by the Tianjin event last year, offset predominantly by a handful of medium size of 9 cat losses as well as a smaller impact from a change in mix of business and market conditions.
Catastrophe losses totaled $26 billion, net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter, compared to $23 million in the third quarter of last year.
The cat activity during the quarter resulted from a number of small events as well as developments from the Texas hailstorms in the second quarter. Offsetting these events reduced our estimates of the Fort McMurray fires and Japan earthquake from last quarter.
The expense ratio decreased 3.9 points to 32.1% in the third quarter compared to 36% for the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies continued to earn through. Further, we saw a 1 point drop in our acquisition expense ratio as the impact from purchase accounting continues to diminish.
Turning to top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $566 million, up from $459 million in the third quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by new business and share increases. As we have discussed in prior quarters, XL Catlin has received strong support from our clients and brokers. We are pleased to see that support show up in the top line. This growth was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we non-renewed or reduced shares on nearly $60 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms. On a year-to-date basis, for the combined portfolio, we have grown just over 7% after adjusting for foreign exchange and multiple year premiums. 
Shifting to market conditions. We found the pricing environment challenging, but rate decreases continued to decelerate in most lines and regions. And as noted last quarter, we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business.
During the quarter, rates across the segment were down approximately 2%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 4% this quarter and 5% for the year-to-date, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015.
The remainder of the Property Treaty book, rates were down 2.5%, and our casualty business remained flat over last year. The remainder of our classes were flat-to-down low single digits. U.S. short tail and global casualty treaty placements continue to struggle if terms and conditions were aggressively pushed at renewal.
In summary, the third quarter results were respectable for the Reinsurance segment. As the market reaches the bottom in many classes, we are well positioned to succeed as our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job growing profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline.
I'll now turn it back to Mike."

As you saw this morning, we announced a realignment of our P&C operating model, and I want to quickly walk you through this news. If you go back to when we brought the 2 companies together, we combined XL and Catlin into a classically matrix-ed insurance organization to take advantage of the best of both prior operating models. And we knew that when the time was right, we'd take a step back to adjust for what we were learning about the organization and to be able to even better respond to the marketplace.
Much of this now announced realignments started with observations from Paul Brand and Kelly Lyles earlier this year. And on top of their minds was to have a model that accelerated and deepened our innovation successes and responded better to the market by streamlining decision-making and getting the business as close to the customer as possible.
So as to innovation, Paul will be taking on the new roll as Director of Accelerate, the new internal innovation team. I'm extraordinarily excited to see what they will produce.
Then there are other changes to the operating model itself. The most obvious of which is that we are bringing together insurance and reinsurance into 1 P&C organization under Greg Hendrick's leadership. We will, of course, maintain all of the appropriate governance and separation required between the insurance and reinsurance operations, but we feel that by working together at a high level under the same span of control, we can harness the power of that adjacency for our customers' benefit. Solutions are clearly blending, and we want to be in a position to lead these developments on our client's behalf. Having led insurance and reinsurance and having been instrumental in developing our long-standing strategy, Greg is clearly ideally suited for this new role.
Then another key learning for us has been the instrumental role country and territorial leadership plays for us around the world. So you'll see that in the new model, our P&C business groups are supported by 4 key capabilities, one of which is client and country management. And Kelly Lyles, who, as you know, is currently our Chief Regional Officer for insurance, will become the Chief Executive Client and Country Management, who will be responsible for our global broker relationships and for ensuring that we have strong leadership in our key geographies. Kelly will report directly to me and to Greg and will continue to be a member of our group leadership team. 
You can find a much more detailed breakdown of the new structure and the names of who will lead within it in, in what we released this morning. We firmly believe that this realignment will create a more efficient, responsive and profitable business. While the announcement is new, this is something we have been contemplating for some time. And although there are people impacts, they will be very limited among a handful of senior positions. We will still have some people who we are really excited about move on as there just aren't as many roles in the new model. We are proud to work with -- to have worked with these people, and we wish them the very best. 
One more topic. You would have seen an 8-K this afternoon that I'm going to be selling some shares, and I can understand that this could be misinterpreted in 2 important ways: First, that I am somehow less committed to my job; or second, that I believe this is somehow a good price at which to be selling. The opposite isn't the case in both respects.
More than 2 years ago, I decided with my family that my commitment to XL was open-ended, that this wasn't going to be just some turnaround gig but a mission far greater and longer than that. As a result, I made some broader financial plans, the last part of which was to sell some shares, happily for XL, but not so happily for my personal plans. Before I acted on selling, the XL Catlin combination talks heated up. This is the first time since that I have felt comfortable taking this long-delayed action. That said, I fully expect to be kicking myself next year over the price I will have to accept. But I am simply past the point where I can wait given what I put in motion 2 long years ago. And I want to emphasize that even after these sales, XL shares will remain our family's largest single asset by far, as it should be.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A."

I think it's a relevant set of numbers. I think the mix is not that different through that time period. And we'd observed for Q3 anywhere between 49% and 58% for accident year x cat loss ratio, with a 54% average, right around 54% and a bit where we are this quarter. So I think we're in line. Those are driven by reinsurance's not heavily attrition-driven loss ratio. It's a number of small mid and sometimes large losses. I think we had a little bit more this quarter than we would normally expect but nothing outside. And I believe strongly, the new portfolio is a diversified reinsurance and able to withstand more of that activity."

You also asked, sort of taken as a whole, does this mean anything relative to our ambition to be delivering double-digit ROEs? And how would you get there? A couple of comments. Number one, I mentioned these 5 trends, the idea that we're getting more flow from our partners. And we're even seeing more business that we'd like to write, but at this point in the market, find it difficult to actually write more. So that flow is a very good sign of our position in the marketplace today. The second thing is we are finding some growth. As I mentioned for this quarter, in essence, the overall was 2%. If you then went back and normalize for some of the reunderwriting activities in insurance, we actually had growth there that was positive. And then third, I talked about the fact that the loss ratio year-over-year, that the underlying loss ratio has declined. And where there has been some higher large loss activity in this year, which the market's been talking about, we've been talking about, we've been largely, not entirely, but largely able to absorb that as we've gone along, which is a sign of the greater resilience of this book of business. Fourth, I talked about expenses and the fact that we're meeting those aggressive targets that we have laid out to The Street and we expect to continue to do so. And fifth, of course, I talked about capital management, which, of course, has been very significant in this year and continues to improve the E in which we work. If I take those 5 together, that is where some of the progress toward this objective comes from. But there's 2 additional things that come into play next year that isn't evident this year. Number one, we will have worked most of those larger reunderwriting actions through the book, and they will no longer have the same negative impact on our loss ratio that it continues to have today. Now we're always doing a little bit of reunderwriting, but those actions we took in '15 were a very significant dimension. And we finally get them largely through the book of business. And they won't have that same negative loss ratio drag. Second, we also will be away from the negative top line drag that those activities have created. And I would hope that then next year, we'll actually see the growth that our underwriters are able to find come through into the numbers. So those are 2 more accelerants that are added to those 5 trends as we get in 2017. Now I know you want me to conclude that was some table-pounding forecast. I'm not going to do that. Our budget is still in the works. The board has not yet adopted it. But I like what those trends imply about our ability to continue to expand margins. And as we finalize the budget, I'll have more to say about what that yields in totality. But it's clearly trends that work in favor of what we've said we will do."

First of all, we will likely exceed modestly what we've talked about so far. So it won't just reduce to kind of $50 million. It will moderate, but it will clearly exceed that for the balance of the year. With respect to next year, it's a bit premature, right? I mean, we haven't adopted the budget, as I mentioned a moment ago, and that work finalizes in early December and work with the board. And that's why historically, as you know, we have commented and given some directional intent around both share repurchases and around expenses and that end-of-year call kind of 3 months from now. That still when we will give you more guidance. Now on expenses, there's no more guidance to give. We've already talked about the expense levels we're going to achieve, and we're going to achieve them. And the only direction that could change is if somehow we forecast a lot lower revenue, then we would probably drive them even lower. But I don't, at this point, expect that. Second, with respect to share repurchases, a couple of thoughts. One, there's nothing going on that would indicate we would do any less than we originally intend to do last year. So I would find it very hard to imagine a circumstance where it would be lower than our initial guidance. And obviously, we continue to feel that this -- that XL is fundamentally underpriced. And as a result, we've been more opportunistic this year as we had opportunities to do so. I would like to think that somewhere between those 2 is, I would think, where we might come out, but it's just -- it's a bit premature to say. But I'm still bullish on how share repurchases fit into the entire story. And we'll give more precise directional observations when it comes to the end of your call."

And I'll start at the highest level. Given their history and given their scale, there is no way that the expense savings that have been achieved to date and will be achieved by the end of '17 could possibly have taken place without the combination. And given how the soft market playbook works as it were, expenses become more and more important as the soft market grinds on. So that is the first and most obvious and tangible benefit to shareholders. Second, we did not expect, as this combination was created, that the pricing environment would become so dire, especially in specialty lines. That took us off guard. There is, again, no way that the prior separate institutions could have thought through, with the success that they're having in creating, again, when you clean out the reunderwriting effects, some modest growth. That wouldn't have happened. Each franchise would have been weaker, you wouldn't have seen this lift in submissions. The opportunity to see more and to try and pick your way through this market was greatly enhanced by the combination that we have made. And I know and I say this every call, you have lots of contacts in the broker community, the market community. You know that, that's true. And we go to all of our meetings, and we hear it time and time again. A part of how we've been able to achieve that in a way that doesn't lose underwriting control is we've been able to up our relationships with existing clients with proven track records. That couldn't have been possible for each company independently before because it was only through bringing the firms together that we had both the greater capital base and the greater diversified capital base for those counterparties to trust our continuing growth with them. So in each of those cases, Josh, we are talking about things that were made possible by the combination. Now in a tougher market..."

So from my -- you caught me right toward the end. And by the way, that diversified balance sheet gave rise to a greater opportunity for capital management as well than independently, I think, you would have seen from either company. Moreover, we are able to better absorb patterns of larger losses as we had seen this year. So in every one of those respects, this firm is performing better than the separate companies would have performed in the same market conditions. We didn't foresee it, we didn't do it because we saw it coming, we did it because we thought it was the right thing to do. Greg has an expression that I quite like, and since this is a largely U.S. audience, I can use it. I find it difficult to recreate it around the world. But from an underwriting talent point of view, which was the key objective to aggregate that talent and to put it to work for our clients and for our shareholders, we've really got a lineup like the 1927 Yankees. I mean, this is the most powerful collection of this specialty and market-leading thinkers that you could get. But it's like we assembled that talent and then there was a player strike. I mean, that is the equivalent. They can't do everything they could do because the market conditions are what they are. And in the end, maintaining our discipline in this market, which the very statistics that Paul walked you through, is exactly what they should be doing. And I can't tell you how grateful I am for the work they're doing, because they do it in miserable conditions over and over and over. You get told, well, we'd love you, but you just didn't match this crazy price someone else gave you. And then they got to go, do it again and do it again.

One is we're seeing opportunity we would not have seen as independent firms in the reinsurance, and I'll let Paul talk to the insurance stuff. We just wouldn't have seen large participations with clients that don't go out to the broad market. You see it coming through in our Q3 growth. I want to make sure I point out. Remember, reinsurance is a lumpy business, so that's not to say that the growth we had in the third quarter is now embedded in there going forward. It's not the case. But we do see more and more of those, so you see that coming through in this quarter. We've got more focused on client management, so we're seeing more business from the clients we like and know than we used to do in the past when we where perhaps not quite as structured about it as independent firms. And I think Mike touched on the diversification point. You don't see it in the Fin Supp. But if I look just at the other line in reinsurance in the Fin Supp, you'll see a pretty good set of growth there. Well, that's because XL wasn't in credit and surety. XL and Catlin have build a good business around that. And Catlin wasn't in health reinsurance, and we were in health reinsurance at XL. And so as you bring these 2 books together, there's just a much better diversified, more stable business."

We faced 2 headwinds, all of us together, right? We faced the soft market headwind together, and that can be variable according to any particular mix of business, but that is common across the board theme. And we faced this interest rate environment in common together, which puts so much more demand on the underwriting result. So those -- both of those, I don't see huge change coming in either one. You never know, but I -- there's nothing that's happened that would forecast that. In -- so let me walk through kind of the pricing environments and our attitude toward -- across the 2 books. In reinsurance, as Greg said, we've seen a bottoming out. And if you've been following the news out of Button Bob [ph], for example, where there's a lot of reinsurance contracts being discussed, you're seeing a clear change in attitude from the market side of the equation, and you're just seeing a lot more prospect in terms and conditions, you're seeing no more, that's enough. I mean, you're just seeing a different attitude in very public display, and I think that's very encouraging. And I would carry that further to the large commercial marketplace. And we look at global program-type business. We even saw one of the leaders of one of the buyer associations in Germany publicly say that the conversation had to become more balanced in the interest of our carriers. When they start saying that, a community that usually is talking you down all the time, that just tells you there's something new and different going on in the marketplace. I don't think it portends a turn, but it's a change that is clearly going to moderate the downward pressure in some areas. Now there's some like energy, aviation, where it's just hard to understand what's going on. So I do believe that all competitors face that pressure in common. I don't know exactly how to translate that to an ROE headwind because it differs by how the companies respond to it. For us, we've been cutting back writings in those lines where our competition has gotten ridiculous. We don't have a broad one-size-fits-all attitude. We have a lot of sophistication in how we do pricing, and we're able to be very clear with our clients kind of where it just becomes something we can't do. So we do that client by client in conversation. But if we look at aviation, if we look at energy, if we look at some of the marine areas, those are clear areas where we're going to have less writings because our underwriters are at a point where they can't tolerate what's going on. There are other pockets where we can grow. And so I can't make it -- I can't translate it to an industry FX. I can tell you what we're doing. And so far, as you see by the improvement in the loss ratio year-over-year on a sustained basis, we are seeing that strategy play out to our benefit. We're fighting off these headwinds which were present last year and accelerated at the beginning of this year. So I feel okay about that. I really can't put myself in the other shoes because I don't know how their mix of activity and repurchasing and all that. I just know what our trends are. I can't speak to theirs."

Look, in our insurance operations, which is where -- if the reinsurance operating model is essentially the same, you take Greg out, you replace Greg and move on, and there's a lot of stability there, a lot of history there. But on the insurance operations, which is where the meat of this is, we're really talking about, at the very top level, a few people and at the next level, a couple of handfuls. And they aren't -- well, they are market-facing in the sense that they have presence in the marketplace. They are not the people conducting daily transactional business. And in fact, one of the primes of why we made this change and how it works is the daily transactional level is practically unaffected. So tomorrow, they're working for the same people, they are answering. It's just -- but what there is, is there is a simplified referral process in essence. There's less hands with different points of views injecting themselves into that process. That should speed up decision-making and make it simpler both for our people and for the market to know where to go when there's a little bit of hair on the risk as it were. And that -- in a soft market, that comes up more, frankly. So having that simplified should accelerate how we make decisions and should have a positive impact in the eyes of our broking community and partners. So we're already seeing greater submissions. This could enable us to work faster and better and maybe even see that stimulated more. The final bit is just that country management piece. In essence, if you stepped back, we had put in a pretty heavy regional structure. This lightens that regional structure some, but it empowers more that country level manager because that's where we saw the real lift. That's where we saw that work with the relationships. And so those people that were -- we were actually seeing some growth because of them. For example, in LatAm, our 2 operations there in Mexico City and in Brazil, I happened to have been in both offices over the last few weeks, they're off a small base, but they're winning awards for their responsiveness in the marketplace. And we're seeing kind of 80% type growth rates off those small bases because of this newer local presence. That we've enhanced by this and taken off some of the upstream requirements so we can make decisions faster. So no, I'm sorry for the long answer, but this is really important to us. No, we don't expect that at all."

But I walked through those 5 trends, all of which are meant to address the belief we have, the absolutely we have, that we can continue to expand margins in our insurance operation. And I mentioned 2 accelerants that come into play more next year that were not present this year. So we'll get a fuller benefit of the growth that our underwriters are able to create, and we'll get less of a drag as was just discussed on the loss ratio due to that reunderwriting activity. So those are meant to directly address that we believe the insurance combined ratio can improve from here and that we can fight our way through the obvious negative effects of the pricing environment. So first, that. Second, we have been very aggressive in -- on the ease side of things through our share repurchases in this year. As Pete mentioned, we're already at $950 million. And I think the way anyone reasonably listen to him would say, ""And that's going to go up."" And as I answered Kai, we see something certainly better than our initial expectation for this year and, perhaps, up to what we did do this year. So you're talking about a couple of levers that move things meaningfully in the equation it is you're trying to solve for. And we're starting from what is -- as Pete laboriously described in great detail, what is something like a normalized 8.6%. And let's see what the fourth quarter, ex-Matthew of course, produces. But -- so we see the -- so if you were looking at it from our shoes, if you believed that the combined ratio and insurance could continue to come down, if you believed that overall expenses, including corporate expenses, would continue to come down at the levels that we have described before, and if you believed you could get a modest bit of growth into that more efficient model, you would say to yourself, that's within range. Exactly how more to describe that -- I told you I'm not going to pound the table today. I'm not -- I haven't finished the budget. Pete's got a couple of thoughts to add. But we're getting there, and we're pretty pleased with our progress, so I don't know what else to tell you."

So the numbers that we put out in that slide were for the 9 months, and everyone knows that we had not a very good first quarter. And so the run rate the last 2 quarters are certainly better than the average for the 3 quarters. The second thing is I wouldn't just think about the corporate expenses. The way we think about it is we need to do better on, I will call it, the loss ratio and commission ratio to get to the technical ratio, right? And then we look at the overall expenses. If you look at what we said we were going to do, that's about a $70 million improvement year-on-year, right? So that's 0.7 of a percent right there. And then since our expenses are in essence locked at this point in time, right, you're talking about leverage, it's ultimate leverage, right. So for every dollar of premium, extra premium that we write, 1 minus technical ratio falls through the bottom line. So I do think that there are levers there, but again, this is not to try and walk you to a 10%."

Not everything in the reinsurance market is at a very low return level. You've seen cat experiences in a couple of countries around the year and in last year, and you're seeing rates respond to that. You're seeing casualty in general starting to flatten out and really renew same again year-over-year. So there isn't just one big, bad market out there. The general tone of it across it is not great, but there is pockets of opportunities. And I would say the folks on the ground have been going really hard at making sure they find those, focusing on the clients that we know because we trade with them already in other areas. I think that is the biggest thing as a regard to the -- as regards to who we're going after in the business there. The growth rate is going to be lumpy, right? It was 23% in the quarter on gross written. It's 7% for the year when you adjust for FX and multiyear. So there's just -- it's never -- we're not growing at 23% on a per annum basis. That's not going to happen, but we did have a couple of opportunities. In this quarter, one of them was to expand an existing relationship we have with a credit customer. Another couple were around motor or auto coverage, which have a slightly higher combined ratio but also a lower volatility and less downside to them. So it's that kind of -- they came up. They were offered to us. We believe because of our new presence in the marketplace, and we took advantage of them. There may not be any of them in the fourth quarter. We're trying hard to find them all the time and do it the right way, but they don't always come up in that same quarter-to-quarter fashion."

What we're able to do by piecing these opportunities together is we're able to maintain the margin that we have today, right? That's the way how I think about it. So in a particular example I gave you, our credit book runs at a -- it's a lower loss ratio business than the average. The motor's a little bit high. When you blend them together, you're coming back to this. That's why I cited the last kind of 5 years of third quarter accident year ex-cat. You're in that 50% to 58% or 54%. We're basically counteracting kind of what's tough market, some tough pricing by blending in these new pieces. So there isn't -- I wouldn't point you to there's going to be a dramatic improvement in accident year ex-cat as they seem to come online. If the market turns, and we have a lot of opportunity to lift and get that kind of growth in a major way, you would start to see a lower, I would believe, a lower accident year ex-cat loss ratio. But right -- I'm sorry, accident year ex-cat combined ratio on the expense side. But this is really the -- it's piece by piece. You don't have my budget.

So given that it's still -- I wouldn't call early days but relatively early.

So given that it's still -- I wouldn't call early days but relatively early. I think it's -- I think you're right to ask, and we need to give more thought to exactly how to present to you. But let me give you some examples. First of all, yes to your first question. Are we always hunting for more ASIs? Sure. We don't make a lot of those kinds of bets. But in those bets, we get a couple of benefits. Number one, we get, we believe, attractively priced reinsurance opportunities. Because of the strategic relationship, we're able to negotiate differently on the terms of reinsurance, and we find that a very attractive method to -- in this difficult market add to our reinsurance writings. And then you get the potential. That kind of -- that tends to lessen the risk of whatever investment might be associated, and then you get the potential upside if the investment proves wise as well. So we like both of those. And we don't take a lot. We're not a spread shooter. We're very targeted on things that are related to things where you have extra keys or things that we want to learn about, and we get that benefit. The second thing we get is we get eyes-on, hands-dirty experience with some of these new and potentially disruptive insurance models. We get to learn how the technology works. We get to learn whether it works. We get to learn whether the promised innovation is real, and we get to think about what application that might have for our businesses. And if -- and because of the way we negotiate these in some cases, we have even rights to increase our ownership or to use technology. There's different elements of how we negotiate each one of these. So that's the second benefit we get. The third one relates to our pricing insight. We have been actively, and I'd say, somewhat quietly building models to gain pricing advantages. We all know that when you are an early adopter in modeling, you get a double lift. You not only get the benefit of your model, assuming it's right, and ours have been uncannily effective, but you also get the benefit that those things that you turn away for reasons that others aren't able to analyze can actually lead to some adverse business-building for them. So we get a twofer for out of that. We are -- I'm not ready to talk about it. Others like to talk about this a lot. We actually kind of enjoy the quiet effectiveness. We have a number of these models up, running and adhered to across XL. And over the coming years, I think it would be right to put some metrics around that for you to understand better. So there, you get loss ratio lift, and we have a meaningful portion of the book now getting that lift from that activity. And then fourth, we -- also where we innovate, we get to invent markets where we are lonely in our competition, which is rare in our space, but I'll give you an explicit example. You've heard me talk about it before, but it's worth mentioning. That's new energy risk, where we've built an MGA/MGU, created an entirely new product for it. We're the first to market in it. We had much less cost to building that out because the brokers didn't have expertise to contribute and wound up in a weaker position in the transaction, and therefore, extracted less fees. And in the end, we're now writing about $75 million of that. And at this stage, I'm touching all the wood I can find, there has been no losses on that business, and it is growing. It's -- in fact, we're working on some adjacent products that we're hoping shortly to be rolling out. Whenever you're able to do something like that, you do so with less of this crazy competitive environment that we've all been talking about. You're doing it -- you have a lead position. You are able to run ahead. That's where, I think, what Paul is taking on, what we're doing with Oxbotica. All of that, that fits in that category. XL Innovate, a part of what they do is what I talked about first, but a part of what they do is this too, where they are entirely reinventing a business model and leading out with a new product that we think has -- is very hard to imitate. We run with -- obviously, people try, but they can't because they haven't spent several years deep into the science, which we do. So that's why the Oxbotica relationship is one I call out specifically because it is teaching us things that we know are coming and that we believe we can lead because of our deep understanding of the science behind it in creating the insurance products that people are going to need. That kind of thing really gives us a differential lift in the marketplace. So, yes, you're right. It's tough to measure externally, particularly at this point. I brought it up because it is now at a maturing point, and we believe we will need to get in front of you and give much more definition to this a way for you to think about it. But I think that those who are not -- there -- we aren't the only one doing some of these things. I think we're doing it with a coherence and a practicality that is starting to show up in our numbers, and I'm looking forward to talking about that in greater depth in the future, Ian."

If I look at your presentation, one of the biggest kind of deltas from the sell side to actual numbers this year has been affiliate income. And if I look at kind of the past 6 or 7 quarters since you guys sold ASI, it's kind of averaged around $20 million. And again, this quarter came in at $25 million. I guess, not looking for a run rate going forward, but is this $20 million to $25 million, does that seem right, the last 6 quarters post-ASI? Or is there something else that I'm missing there?"

I think we would hope that we could do a little bit better than the numbers you threw out, but that really is dependent on -- the biggest variable there are the investment affiliates, not the investment, the manager affiliates that we have that whose returns are really independent on how they grew on performance fees.

Today was an exciting day to announce the changes with respect to Paul and Greg and to start streamlining and making this place work even better. We're really excited about these changes. But I want to put it in a little more context. 
In a speech I remember from 2012, we talked about innovation and how you go about getting innovation in a existing industry, and we emphasized that you had to be willing to take your best minds and take them out of P&L process and put them on innovation, or else, you weren't going to get there. And the example I used then, of a decision we felt very heroic about and very good about was taking Greg Hendrick out of his highly profitable job running our cat book in Bermuda and putting him on the strategy for the company, the reinvention of this company. We felt that was a great decision then and it has led to subsequent successes that give us great confidence in his role as a leader of all of P&C. And you see us taking that playbook out again with respect to Paul, and the opportunity to take one of the sharpest underwriting minds any of us have ever met and set him loose on bringing these maturing activities to greater impact throughout our book of business and into the future. When we have a confident and great set of hands like Greg to lead the resulting P&C operation and a mind like Paul set loose on innovation, we see this as a day we will remember in future years as one of those moments when XL really took on the next level of opportunity. 
It's an exciting day for us. We look forward to the future. Thank you very much for the call and the questions on the call, and good night."
