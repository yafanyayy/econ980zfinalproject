Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings are above the high end of our guidance. I would now highlight 3 ke",1234,"Thanks, Lisa, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings are above the high end of our guidance. I would now highlight 3 key results. 
First, revenue was up over 6% on a core basis. Second, we delivered an operating margin increase of 200 basis points from a year ago to 20.2% adjusted for Keysight billings. Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.46 was up 12% over last year.
Our Q1 results are driven by continued strength in the pharma, clinical and diagnostics markets with the return to growth in academia and government. Market demand remained strong for our liquid chromatography, CrossLab services and consumables, and diagnostics and genomics offering. Geographically, all regions grew on a core basis with strong growth in China. Let me highlight the Q1 results by our 3 business group.
The life science applied markets group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. We see continued strong global Pharma demand, growth return in academia and government markets, and China government investments in environmental and food markets. All of this offset continued weaknesses for new equipment purchases in the chemical and engineering market space. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, up 210 basis points from 1 year ago. As a reminder, in November, we closed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Integration activities are in full swing with the team excited to be part of Agilent.
LSAG continued to strengthen its portfolio in Q1. We released 2 new refracted index detectors to 12 60 and 12 90 Infinity II RID. These detectors help expand the capabilities of modern new HPL state chromatography to make difficult measurements in certain chemical, biopharma and food application.
Agilent's innovation strength was recognized in the January edition of Analytical Science Magazine. We are honored with an innovation of work for our unique LC II needle technology. This is a breakthrough in the way samples are injected into Agilent's LC products. The unique design enables fast injection cycles, scalable injection volumes and ultralow carryover.
Next is the Agilent CrossLab Group. We continue to see consistently strong revenue results. Our core revenue growth was 10% in Q1. Strong pharma and chemical and energy market demand drove growth in our services and consumables offering.
Our operating margin was 22.1% for the quarter. This is up 140 basis points from 1 year ago. We continued bringing new chemistry to our market. For example, we released AdvanceBio SEC family of products. These innovative new products are designed for ad curate and precise site exclusion chromatography targeted at biopharma application. Early adopting customers are reporting significant economic and performance benefits over any current technologies offered by our competitors.
Finally, they Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued to demonstrate momentum. In Q1, the DGG delivered 12% core revenue growth with strength across all its businesses. The pathology business continued a steady trajectory to market growth rate. We see strong growth for Dako alumnus reagents and growing revenue PD-L1 diagnostics. The companion diagnostics business also continued to demonstrate momentum.
Double-digit growth in nucleic acids and genomics reflected strong demand from pharma and clinical markets in favorable compare. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%, that's up 910 basis points from 1 year ago. I want to remind you that last year, this business broke even Q1 fiscal 2015.
Last year, our Dako complementary diagnostic for Bristol-Myers Squibb up to was approved by the FDA for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. In January of this year, the FDA-approved to expand the use of this PD-L1 diagnostics to include patients with melanoma. Positive PD-L1 status in melanoma has been clearly able to treat the effectiveness of Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug treatment. Agilent's is the first company to provide FDA-approved test for lung cancer and melanoma for PD-L1 markets.
Now I'll take a brief look at Agilent's revenues by end market performance on a core basis. We saw strength in all our life sciences and diagnostics market, continued robust demand drove pharma revenue up 19%. Growth was fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake in aftermarket demand for services and consumables. Our clinical and diagnostics revenue was up 7%, and we experienced a return to growth in academia and government of 4%. This growth was sequentially driven by the authorization of larger research budgets in the U.S.
Line and market performance was generally soft except for environmental, which was up 9% driven by strength in China. Food declined 1%. Our food market strength in China was offset by soft demand developed countries. Chemical and energy declined 2% driven by the well-publicized macroeconomic concerns.
Let me provide an update on our operating margin proven initiatives. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. This is how we are driving the sustained performance. We are building a new company portfolio. We have exited unattractive businesses and are acquiring new ones to enable our growth strategy. Our multiyear Agilent program is simplifying our company, making it more nubile and lowering our costs. Finally, while we improve our execution capabilities, transforming our culture to work as one team across the entire company. We called of this One Agilent.
As we enter the second year of the new Agilent, here is what you expect as we move forward. We are building the new business, one that delivers above market growth. We will continue to target operating margin expansion. Finally, we are driving a balanced capital allocation policy that includes increased levels of the cash flow being returned to shareholders.
Going forward, we will continue to make composition to ensure our long-term competitiveness. For example, we have just froze our U.S. defined benefits retirement plan. This change is effective in the second half of fiscal 2016. I've also spoke with many of you about our multiple ERP systems and oversized IT environment. We continue to streamline our IT systems and infrastructure to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. While work remains, we are pleased with the start of the second year of the new Agilent and our progress in transforming the company. Let me share my view on the current market outlook.
The principle of new Agilent is be realistic and to closely monitor market conditions that could affect our business. Global macroeconomic concerns are pressuring some end markets in emerging economies. The good news is that we'll see solid market conditions to other end markets and geography. I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year core growth and operating margin goals. I am also confident that we will make course correction as market conditions dictate.
We are strengthening our portfolio, building on our prior year introductions. We have an exciting pipeline of compelling offering sets to launch this year. In tandem of these new offerings, we have created and you go-to-market capability. We have a focused, energized sales force, and we are overhauling our e-commerce environment to make it easier for customers to do business with us.
And most importantly, across the company, we have the organizational capability to execute and deliver. The Agilent team is aligned and highly energized, driven to in the marketplace. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our updated guidance. Didier?"

Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To summarize Q1 results, they are both the high end of our revenue and EPS guidance even as currency impacted revenue by $7 million and OP by $2 million.
The EPS beats was the result of the higher revenues, as well as favorable earnings. Our adjusted operating margin of 20.2% and operating cash flow of $106 million was strong. We bought back $200 million or 4.9 million shares in Q1. I'll turn out now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. We are confirming the coral run rate growth guidance of 4.0% to 4.5% we provided in November. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in our November guidance is expected to have a negative impact of about $50 million on reported revenues, $13 million on operating profit and 3.3 cents on EPS.
As a result, we now expect fiscal year '16 revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.12 billion, and EPS of $1.81 to $1.87. To note, in the last 2 weeks, we've seen the U.S. dollar weaken. If the weakening continues, we will reflect the positive impact in our May guidance.
Turning to our share buyback program. We remain committed to our plan of repurchasing another $280 million of shares before fiscal year-end. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. We're expecting Q2 revenues of $965 million and to $985 million, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality versus Q1.
The mid-point corresponds to a core revenue growth 4.0%. The sequential reduction revenues will translate into a sequential reduction in EPS. We expect Q2 EPS to branch between 39 -- excuse me, $0.37 to $0.39. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

And as I mentioned to you, in the past, the markets here are really being driven by strong investments in government and policy driven initiatives our product concerns whether the environment, drug and food safety. So all of our market with the exception of chemical energy really saw quite strong growth. And we're underpenetrated in DDG business compared to the rest of the company. We've talked about that in the past. And we -- we're under penetrated in growing market for cancer diagnostics, for example. And recently, we had office that I thought really quite amazing. There was a report by the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese medical science that said that every minute, an average of 6 people in the country were diagnosed with cancer. And 5 of those 6 would eventually die of the disease. But unfortunately, this would be a growing demand for cancer diagnostic as well. I'm going to wrap this all up by saying we remain quite comfortable with the mid- to high single-digit growth expectation we laid out for China. It was strong for us in the first quarter and we expect that to continue through the year."

Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings are above the high end of our guidance. I would now highlight 3 ke",1234,"Thanks, Lisa, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings are above the high end of our guidance. I would now highlight 3 key results. 
First, revenue was up over 6% on a core basis. Second, we delivered an operating margin increase of 200 basis points from a year ago to 20.2% adjusted for Keysight billings. Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.46 was up 12% over last year.
Our Q1 results are driven by continued strength in the pharma, clinical and diagnostics markets with the return to growth in academia and government. Market demand remained strong for our liquid chromatography, CrossLab services and consumables, and diagnostics and genomics offering. Geographically, all regions grew on a core basis with strong growth in China. Let me highlight the Q1 results by our 3 business groups.
The Life Science and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. We see continued strong global pharma demand, growth return in academia and government markets, and China government investments in environmental and food markets. All of this offset continued weaknesses for new equipment purchases in the chemical and engineering market space. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. As a reminder, in November, we closed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Integration activities are in full swing with the team excited to be part of Agilent.
LSAG continued to strengthen its portfolio in Q1. We released 2 new refractive index detectors, the 1260 and 1290 Infinity II RID. These detectors help expand the capabilities of modern UHPLC chromatography to make difficult measurements in certain chemical, biopharma and food application.
Agilent's innovation strength was recognized in the January edition of Analytical Scientist magazine. We were honored with an Innovation Award for our unique LC dual needle technology. This is a breakthrough in the way samples are injected into Agilent's LC products. The unique design enables fast injection cycles, scalable injection volumes and ultralow carryover.
Next is the Agilent CrossLab Group. We continue to see consistently strong revenue results. Our core revenue growth was 10% in Q1. Strong pharma and chemical and energy market demand drove growth in our services and consumables offering.
Our operating margin was 22.1% for the quarter. This is up 140 basis points from a year ago. We continued bringing novel, new chemistries to market. For example, we released the AdvanceBio SEC family of products. These innovative new products are designed for accurate and precise size exclusion chromatography targeted at biopharma applications. Early adopting customers are reporting significant economic and performance benefits over any current technologies offered by our competitors.
Finally, they Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued to demonstrate momentum. In Q1, DGG delivered 12% core revenue growth with strength across all of its businesses. The pathology business continued a steady trajectory to market growth rate. We see strong growth for Dako Omnis reagents and growing revenue, PD-L1 diagnostics. The companion diagnostics business also continued to demonstrate momentum.
Double-digit growth in nucleic acids and genomics reflected strong demand from pharma and clinical markets in the favorable compare. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%, that's up 910 basis points from a year ago. I want to remind you that last year, this business broke even in Q1 of fiscal 2015.
Last year, our Dako complementary diagnostic for Bristol-Myers Squibb's OPDIVO was approved by the FDA for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. In January of this year, the FDA approved to expand the use of this PD-L1 diagnostics to include patients with melanoma. Positive PD-L1 status in melanoma has been correlated with the treatment effectiveness of Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug treatment. Agilent is the first company to provide FDA-approved test for lung cancer and melanoma for PD-L1 markers.
Now I'll take a brief look at Agilent's revenues by end market performance on a core basis. We saw strength in all our life sciences and diagnostics market. Continued robust demand drove pharma revenue up 19%. Growth was fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and aftermarket demand for services and consumables. Our clinical and diagnostics revenue was up 7%, and we experienced a return to growth in academia and government of 4%. This growth was significantly driven by the authorization of larger research budgets in the U.S.
Applied end market performance was generally soft except for environmental, which was up 9%, driven by strength in China. Food declined 1%. Our food market strength in China was offset by soft demand in developed countries. Chemical and energy declined 2%, driven by the well-publicized macroeconomic concerns.
Let me provide an update on our operating margin-proven initiatives. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. This is how we are driving the sustained performance. We are building a new company portfolio. We have exited unattractive businesses and are acquiring new ones to enable our growth strategy. Our multiyear Agile Agilent program is simplifying our company, making it more nimble and lowering our costs. Finally, while we are improving our execution capabilities, transforming our culture to work as one team across the entire company, we called this One Agilent.
As we enter the second year of the new Agilent, here is what you can expect as we move forward. We are building a new business, one that delivers above-market growth. We will continue to target operating margin expansion. Finally, we are driving a balanced capital allocation policy that includes increased levels of free cash flow being returned to shareholders.
Going forward, we will continue to make tough decisions to ensure our long-term competitiveness. For example, we have just frozen our U.S.-defined benefits retirement plan. This change is effective in the second half of fiscal 2016. I've also spoke with many of you about our multiple ERP systems and oversized IT environment. We continue to streamline our IT systems and infrastructure to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. While work remains, we are pleased with the start to the second year of the new Agilent and our progress in transforming the company. Let me share my view on the current market outlook.
The principle of new Agilent is be realistic and to closely monitor market conditions that could affect our business. Global macroeconomic concerns are pressuring some end markets in emerging economies. The good news is that we'll see solid market conditions to other end markets and geography. I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year core growth and operating margin goals. I am also confident that we will make course correction as market conditions dictate.
We are strengthening our portfolio, building on our prior year introductions. We have an exciting pipeline of compelling new offerings set to launch this year. In tandem of these new offerings, we have created a new go-to-market capability. We have a focused, energized sales force, and we are overhauling our e-commerce environment to make it easier for customers to do business with us.
And most importantly, across the company, we have the organizational capability to execute and deliver. The Agilent team is aligned and highly energized, driven to win the marketplace. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our updated guidance. Didier?"

Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To summarize Q1 results, they are above the high end of our revenue and EPS guidance even as currency impacted revenue by $7 million and OP by $2 million.
The EPS beat was the result of the higher revenues as well as favorable mix. Our adjusted operating margin of 20.2% and operating cash flow of $106 million were strong. We bought back $200 million or 4.9 million shares in Q1. 
I'll turn now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. We are confirming the core revenue growth guidance of 4.0% to 4.5% we provided in November. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in our November guidance is expected to have a negative impact of about $50 million on reported revenues, $13 million on operating profit and $0.033 on EPS.
As a result, we now expect fiscal year '16 revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.12 billion, and EPS of $1.81 to $1.87. To note, in the last 2 weeks, we've seen the U.S. dollar weaken. If the weakening continues, we will reflect the positive impact in our May guidance.
Turning to our share buyback program. We remain committed to our plan of repurchasing another $280 million of shares before fiscal year-end. 
Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. We're expecting Q2 revenues of $965 million and to $985 million, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality versus Q1.
The mid-point corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0%. The sequential reduction in revenues will translate into a sequential reduction in EPS. We expect Q2 EPS to branch between 39 -- excuse me, $0.37 to $0.39. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

We knew that China was going to be strong, and we've been talking about China in our view of investments since Chinese government is making in places such as the environmental market and food safety. So -- but I will say that we were happy to see the growth in other segments because yes, the chemical and energy space has been under pressure. But what we're still seeing is that fracking is still going on. So the production -- while prices of oil are down, the production demand is stable. And in fact, you look at the oil production, I mean gasoline production in the U.S., for example, is perhaps going up. So we're seeing a continued need to do environmental testings. So that's been a nice reaffirmation, if you will, of our outlook for the year which call for low single-digit growth in environmental. We thought that China would carry the whole load for us, but I think we got a little help from the U.S. as well."

So although we remain focused on our organic growth opportunities, we got a lot of very exciting plans and new products coming out and working on the go-to-market capabilities. As I mentioned in my call, comments, we're really continuing to look for acquisitions that augment our current portfolio and add to our company capabilities. So I think you saw us with the Seahorse deal where we added capabilities in life science research, Cartagenia in the area of next-gen sequencing. We -- to build out our workflow there, and we'd still like to find ways to build out our workflow in next-gen sequencing. And so our stated strategies are really adding capabilities, expand our portfolio, building on our work flow solutions, close with a particular emphasis on life sciences research, next-gen sequencing workflows in the overall consumables and services place. They're our priorities. Well, that being said, most people still have the memories of their 52-week highs. So we'll see how this plays out. And what I will tell you is we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of how we think about M&A, and does it provide an attractive return to our shareholders?

So all the market except -- with the exception of chemical/energy, really saw quite strong growth. And we're underpenetrated in DDG business compared to the rest of the company. We've talked about that in the past. And we were under-penetrated in growing market for cancer diagnostics, for example. And I recently read -- saw some statistics that I thought were really quite amazing. There was a report by the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said that every minute, an average of 6 people in the country were diagnosed with cancer. And 5 of those 6 would eventually die of the disease. So unfortunately, there's going to be growing demand for cancer diagnostic as well. I'm going to wrap this all up by saying we remain quite comfortable with the mid- to high single-digit growth expectation we laid out for China.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings are above the high end of our guidance. I would now highlight 3",1232,"Thanks, Lisa, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings are above the high end of our guidance. 
I would now highlight 3 key results. First, revenue was up over 6% on a core basis. Second, we delivered an operating margin increase of 200 basis points from a year ago to 20.2% adjusted for Keysight billings. Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.46 was up 12% over last year.
Our Q1 results are driven by continued strength in the pharma, clinical and diagnostics markets with the return to growth in academia and government. Market demand remained strong for our liquid chromatography, CrossLab services and consumables, and diagnostics and genomics offerings. Geographically, all regions grew on a core basis with strong growth in China. 
Let me highlight the Q1 results by our 3 business groups.
The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered a core revenue growth of 2%. We see continued strong global pharma demand, growth return in academia and government markets, and China government investments in environmental and food markets. All of this offset continued weaknesses for new equipment purchases in the chemical and engineering market space. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. As a reminder, in November, we closed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Integration activities are in full swing with the team excited to be part of Agilent.
LSAG continued to strengthen its portfolio in Q1. We released 2 new refractive index detectors, the 1260 and 1290 Infinity II RID. These detectors help expand the capabilities of modern UHPLC chromatography to make difficult measurements in certain chemical, biopharma and food applications.
Agilent's innovation strength was recognized in the January edition of Analytical Scientist magazine. We were honored with an Innovation Award for our unique LC dual-needle technology. This is a breakthrough in the way samples are injected into Agilent's LC products. The unique design enables fast injection cycles, scalable injection volumes and ultralow carryover.
Next is the Agilent CrossLab Group. We continue to see consistently strong revenue results. Our core revenue growth was 10% in Q1. Strong pharma and chemical and energy market demand drove growth in our services and consumables offering.
Our operating margin was 22.1% for the quarter. This is up 140 basis points from a year ago. We continued bringing novel, new chemistries to market. For example, we released the AdvanceBio SEC family of products. These innovative new products are designed for accurate and precise size exclusion chromatography targeted at biopharma applications. Early adopting customers are reporting significant economic and performance benefits over any current technologies offered by our competitors.
Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued to demonstrate momentum. In Q1, DGG delivered 12% core revenue growth with strength across all of its businesses. The pathology business continued a steady trajectory to market growth rates. We see strong growth for Dako Omnis reagents and growing revenue, PD-L1 diagnostics. The companion diagnostics business also continued to demonstrate momentum.
Double-digit growth in nucleic acids and genomics reflected strong demand from pharma and clinical markets in the favorable compare. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%, that's up 910 basis points from a year ago. I want to remind you that last year, this business broke even in Q1 of fiscal 2015.
Last year, our Dako complementary diagnostic for Bristol-Myers Squibb's OPDIVO was approved by the FDA for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. In January of this year, the FDA approved expanded use of this PD-L1 diagnostic to include patients with melanoma. Positive PD-L1 status in melanoma has been correlated with the treatment effectiveness of Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug treatment. Agilent is the first company to provide FDA-approved tests for lung cancer and melanoma for PD-L1 markers.
Now I'll take a brief look at Agilent's revenues by end market performance on a core basis. We saw strength in all our life sciences and diagnostics markets. Continued robust demand drove pharma revenue up 19%. Growth was fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and aftermarket demand for services and consumables. Our clinical and diagnostics revenue was up 7%, and we experienced a return to growth in academia and government of 4%. This growth was significantly driven by the authorization of larger research budgets in the U.S.
Applied end market performance was generally soft except for environmental, which was up 9%, driven by strength in China. Food declined 1%. Our food market strength in China was offset by soft demand in developed countries. Chemical and energy declined 2%, driven by the well-publicized macroeconomic concerns.
Let me provide an update on our operating margin-proven initiatives. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. This is how we are driving the sustained performance. We are building a new company portfolio. We have exited unattractive businesses and are acquiring new ones to enable our growth strategy. Our multiyear Agile Agilent program is simplifying our company, making it more nimble and lowering our costs. Finally, while we are improving our execution capabilities, transforming our culture to work as one team across the entire company, we call this One Agilent.
As we enter the second year of the new Agilent, here is what you can expect as we move forward. We are building a new business, one that delivers above-market growth. We will continue to target operating margin expansion. Finally, we are driving a balanced capital allocation policy that includes increased levels of free cash flow being returned to shareholders.
Going forward, we will continue to make tough decisions to ensure our long-term competitiveness. For example, we have just frozen our U.S.-defined benefits retirement plan. This change is effective in the second half of fiscal 2016. I've also spoke with many of you about our multiple ERP systems and oversized IT environment. We continue to streamline our IT systems and infrastructure to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. While work remains, we are pleased with the start to the second year of the new Agilent and our progress in transforming the company. Let me share my view on the current market outlook.
The principle of new Agilent is be realistic and to closely monitor market conditions that could affect our business. Global macroeconomic concerns are pressuring some end markets in emerging economies. The good news is that we see solid market conditions in other end markets and geographies. I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year core growth and operating margin goals. I am also confident that we will make course correction as market conditions dictate.
We are strengthening our portfolio, building on our prior year introductions. We have an exciting pipeline of compelling new offerings set to launch this year. In tandem of these new offerings, we have created a new go-to-market capability. We have a focused, energized sales force, and we are overhauling our e-commerce environment to make it easier for customers to do business with us.
And most importantly, across the company, we have the organizational capability to execute and deliver. The Agilent team is aligned and highly energized, driven to win the marketplace. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our updated guidance. Didier?"

Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To summarize Q1 results, they are above the high end of our revenue and EPS guidance even as currency impacted revenue by $7 million and OP by $2 million.
The EPS beat was the result of the higher revenues as well as favorable mix. Our adjusted operating margin of 20.2% and operating cash flow of $106 million was strong. We bought back $200 million or 4.9 million shares in Q1. 
I'll turn now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. We are confirming the core revenue growth guidance of 4.0% to 4.5% we provided in November. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a negative impact of about $50 million on reported revenues, $13 million on operating profit and $0.033 on EPS.
As a result, we now expect fiscal year '16 revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.12 billion, and EPS of $1.81 to $1.87. To note, in the last 2 weeks, we've seen the U.S. dollar weaken. If the weakening continues, we will reflect the positive impact in our May guidance.
Turning to our share buyback program. We remain committed to our plan of repurchasing another $280 million of shares before our fiscal year-end. 
Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. We're expecting Q2 revenues of $965 million and to $985 million, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality versus Q1.
The mid-point corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0%. The sequential reduction in revenues will translate into a sequential reduction in EPS. We expect Q2 EPS to range between 39 -- excuse me, $0.37 to $0.39. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

So what they're doing is they are taking activities that historically have been done inside the company and are creating, if you will, a new set of services for vendors in our space to handle things such as asset management.

But you're also right that versus Q4, that we saw a bit of a decrease, and that was actually where we most expected. We sit in the DGG business with a pretty fixed cost space. So when you have a Q1 with a lower base than in Q4, you will see that our margins has also impacted accordingly. So you always see us coming out with a strong Q4 and a weaker Q1 under the gross margin and also on our operating margin. So this is kind of by the book and really as expected."

Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings are above the high end of our guidance. I would now highlight 3",1232,"Thanks, Lisa, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings are above the high end of our guidance. 
I would now highlight 3 key results. First, revenue was up over 6% on a core basis. Second, we delivered an operating margin increase of 200 basis points from a year ago to 20.2% adjusted for Keysight billings. Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.46 was up 12% over last year.
Our Q1 results are driven by continued strength in the pharma, clinical and diagnostics markets with the return to growth in academia and government. Market demand remained strong for our liquid chromatography, CrossLab services and consumables, and diagnostics and genomics offerings. Geographically, all regions grew on a core basis with strong growth in China. 
Let me highlight the Q1 results by our 3 business groups.
The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered a core revenue growth of 2%. We see continued strong global pharma demand, growth return in academia and government markets, and China government investments in environmental and food markets. All of this offset continued weaknesses for new equipment purchases in the chemical and engineering market space. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. As a reminder, in November, we closed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Integration activities are in full swing with the team excited to be part of Agilent.
LSAG continued to strengthen its portfolio in Q1. We released 2 new refractive index detectors, the 1260 and 1290 Infinity II RID. These detectors help expand the capabilities of modern UHPLC chromatography to make difficult measurements in certain chemical, biopharma and food applications.
Agilent's innovation strength was recognized in the January edition of Analytical Scientist magazine. We were honored with an Innovation Award for our unique LC dual-needle technology. This is a breakthrough in the way samples are injected into Agilent's LC products. The unique design enables fast injection cycles, scalable injection volumes and ultralow carryover.
Next is the Agilent CrossLab Group. We continue to see consistently strong revenue results. Our core revenue growth was 10% in Q1. Strong pharma and chemical and energy market demand drove growth in our services and consumables offering.
Our operating margin was 22.1% for the quarter. This is up 140 basis points from a year ago. We continued bringing novel, new chemistries to market. For example, we released the AdvanceBio SEC family of products. These innovative new products are designed for accurate and precise size exclusion chromatography targeted at biopharma applications. Early adopting customers are reporting significant economic and performance benefits over any current technologies offered by our competitors.
Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued to demonstrate momentum. In Q1, DGG delivered 12% core revenue growth with strength across all of its businesses. The pathology business continued a steady trajectory to market growth rates. We see strong growth for Dako Omnis reagents and growing revenue, PD-L1 diagnostics. The companion diagnostics business also continued to demonstrate momentum.
Double-digit growth in nucleic acids and genomics reflected strong demand from pharma and clinical markets in the favorable compare. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%, that's up 910 basis points from a year ago. I want to remind you that last year, this business broke even in Q1 of fiscal 2015.
Last year, our Dako complementary diagnostic for Bristol-Myers Squibb's OPDIVO was approved by the FDA for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. In January of this year, the FDA approved expanded use of this PD-L1 diagnostic to include patients with melanoma. Positive PD-L1 status in melanoma has been correlated with the treatment effectiveness of Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug treatment. Agilent is the first company to provide FDA-approved tests for lung cancer and melanoma for PD-L1 markers.
Now I'll take a brief look at Agilent's revenues by end market performance on a core basis. We saw strength in all our life sciences and diagnostics markets. Continued robust demand drove pharma revenue up 19%. Growth was fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and aftermarket demand for services and consumables. Our clinical and diagnostics revenue was up 7%, and we experienced a return to growth in academia and government of 4%. This growth was significantly driven by the authorization of larger research budgets in the U.S.
Applied end market performance was generally soft except for environmental, which was up 9%, driven by strength in China. Food declined 1%. Our food market strength in China was offset by soft demand in developed countries. Chemical and energy declined 2%, driven by the well-publicized macroeconomic concerns.
Let me provide an update on our operating margin-proven initiatives. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. This is how we are driving the sustained performance. We are building a new company portfolio. We have exited unattractive businesses and are acquiring new ones to enable our growth strategy. Our multiyear Agile Agilent program is simplifying our company, making it more nimble and lowering our costs. Finally, while we are improving our execution capabilities, transforming our culture to work as one team across the entire company, we call this One Agilent.
As we enter the second year of the new Agilent, here is what you can expect as we move forward. We are building a new business, one that delivers above-market growth. We will continue to target operating margin expansion. Finally, we are driving a balanced capital allocation policy that includes increased levels of free cash flow being returned to shareholders.
Going forward, we will continue to make tough decisions to ensure our long-term competitiveness. For example, we have just frozen our U.S.-defined benefits retirement plan. This change is effective in the second half of fiscal 2016. I've also spoke with many of you about our multiple ERP systems and oversized IT environment. We continue to streamline our IT systems and infrastructure to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. While work remains, we are pleased with the start to the second year of the new Agilent and our progress in transforming the company. Let me share my view on the current market outlook.
The principle of new Agilent is be realistic and to closely monitor market conditions that could affect our business. Global macroeconomic concerns are pressuring some end markets in emerging economies. The good news is that we see solid market conditions in other end markets and geographies. I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year core growth and operating margin goals. I am also confident that we will make course correction as market conditions dictate.
We are strengthening our portfolio, building on our prior year introductions. We have an exciting pipeline of compelling new offerings set to launch this year. In tandem of these new offerings, we have created a new go-to-market capability. We have a focused, energized sales force, and we are overhauling our e-commerce environment to make it easier for customers to do business with us.
And most importantly, across the company, we have the organizational capability to execute and deliver. The Agilent team is aligned and highly energized, driven to win the marketplace. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our updated guidance. Didier?"

Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To summarize Q1 results, they are above the high end of our revenue and EPS guidance even as currency impacted revenue by $7 million and OP by $2 million.
The EPS beat was the result of the higher revenues as well as favorable mix. Our adjusted operating margin of 20.2% and operating cash flow of $106 million was strong. We bought back $200 million or 4.9 million shares in Q1. 
I'll turn now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. We are confirming the core revenue growth guidance of 4.0% to 4.5% we provided in November. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a negative impact of about $50 million on reported revenues, $13 million on operating profit and $0.033 on EPS.
As a result, we now expect fiscal year '16 revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.12 billion, and EPS of $1.81 to $1.87. To note, in the last 2 weeks, we've seen the U.S. dollar weaken. If the weakening continues, we will reflect the positive impact in our May guidance.
Turning to our share buyback program. We remain committed to our plan of repurchasing another $280 million of shares before our fiscal year-end. 
Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. We're expecting Q2 revenues of $965 million and to $985 million, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality versus Q1.
The mid-point corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0%. The sequential reduction in revenues will translate into a sequential reduction in EPS. We expect Q2 EPS to range between 39 -- excuse me, $0.37 to $0.39. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

Also, customers responding quite positively to our biopharma solutions. And then across the board between biopharma and pharma, we're seeing strong demand for enterprise-wide services and consumables. 19% growth for the first quarter.

So what I would say is that the chemical/energy market is sort of playing out the way we had expected for the year. So we wish we had a different story here. But the price of -- oil price is low, as you know, but the product demand still remains pretty, pretty strong for our customers' products. So the refineries are running, the chemical plants are running and then we're really trying to sell to them new equipment based on a productivity message. But at the same point in time, recognize that if they use the equipment longer, it's a good opportunity for us on the services and consumables side. One thing I would ask you to reflect on is that Q1 '15, as you dig into some of the numbers, Q1 '15 really was our best quarter for the whole year. I think we grew 3% in the first quarter of last year on a core basis. We ended up growing, I think, 1% for the whole year. So that shows you we were in decline through the year.

I think probably, the only thing of note would be in the DDG side. We had, I think, 1 less day -- working day, I think, this year. So that does affect the genomics business in terms of how much revenue we can get in that quarter. But really, it was sort of businesses usual, if you will, through the first quarter."

Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong water, both Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight 3 key results. First, revenue growth wa",1570,"Thanks, Alicia and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong water, both Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight 3 key results. 
First, revenue growth was up more than 8% on a core basis. Second, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 19.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from 1 year ago. Finally, EPS of $0.44 was up 16% over last year. 
Before moving on to a review of our Q2 results, I do want to address our year-over-year quarterly comparisons, which reflect unusual event from last year. Now the 8% core growth that we're announcing today, about 1.5 percentage points is due to shift of revenue last year from Q2 '15 into Q3 '15. 
In the second quarter a year ago, we experienced $50 million of shipment delays due to start-up challenges with our new U.S. logistics center. In addition, were process of the efforts over the past few quarters to convert incoming orders more quickly to revenue have paid off. We have reduced our order to revenue cycle times, particularly in China. Consequently, some shipments initially forecast for Q3 of this year were delivered Q2. 
Agilent's strong Q2 results were led by double-digit core growth in pharma and food markets. We also experienced continued strength in academia and government, environmental and diagnostic and clinical markets. All end markets grew except chemical and energy. Growth was broad based across most of our portfolio. 
Geographically, all regions grew except Japan, led by very strong growth in China. Let me highlight our Q2 results for our business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 8%, led by strong demand in the pharma and food markets. About 3 percentage points of the 8% was thanks to a softer compare due to timing issue mentioned earlier from last year's U.S. logistics center startup. 
The combination of strong top line growth, expense management and gross margin improvements partially due to the NMR exit drove LSAG's operating margin to 19%, up 320 basis points from a year ago. LSAG continues to strengthen its portfolio. In Q2, Agilent introduced software. Disto software speeds up clinical research data analysis so scientists can more quickly understand the underlying causes of diseases such as cancer. This reflects trend since Agilent's leadership position in meta-belomics. Last week, we announced new Agilent 1216 Infinity II LC at the analytical tradeshow. This provides best-in-class lab efficiency and improves performance for the full backward compatibility. 
Next, the Agilent cost side group continues to deliver consistently strong revenue results. Core revenue growth in Q2 was 10%, led by strength in contract services, LC columns and lab supply. Expansion and penetration in Asia continued to be stronger contributors to our growth. Operating margin was flat versus a year go at 21.5%. 
CrossLab represents a strategic transformation of our services and consumables business. I'm pleased to report that Agilent's recognized with the 2016 Reviewers Choice Award for Customer Surveys. This award is from Select Science, an independent expert-led scientific review. This is the second year in a row that scientists in North America have judged Agilent's customer service to be the best in the laboratory products industry. 
Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 5% core growth in Q2 against a difficult compare. The pathology business continues on its ready trajectory back to market growth rates, highlighted by strong demand for our new PD-L1 companion and complementary diagnostic test. Genomics showed strong market performance, led by our SureSelect target enrichment and our array CGH offerings. DDG's operating margin was flat versus a year ago at 15%. 
In Q2, Agilent announced an $80 million investment in Lasergen, an emerging biotechnology company with innovative next-gen sequencing technology. Our two companies will collaborate on building and and adjust workflow for clinical applications. 
In Q2, Agilent also announced the commercial availability has expanded to the EU for a new PD-L1 diagnostic test for nonsquamous, nonsmall cell lung cancer. This diagnostic was developed in collaboration mover so my script, the maker of OPDIVO. 
Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent score revenue by end market. Life scientist and diagnostics markets saw a continuation of our first quarter performance would strength across all end markets. Pharma grew 14%, fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and sustained growth in the aftermarket. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than mid- to high double-digit growth in pharma. 
Academia and government grew 7%, driven by strong demand in China and an uptick in the U.S. Clinical and Diagnostics also grew 7% with strength in genomics, led by target enrichment and array CGH. Applied end market performance was mixed. Flu was up 25% with strong sales in China and the Americas. China also drove 6% worldwide growth in environmental forensics. Chemical energy declined 3%, reflecting continued macroeconomic concerns and the effects of lower oil prices. Now I'll turn on update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. 
Q2 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement delivered by the new Agilent team. This is a result of our ability to outgrow the market while driving operational efficiency improvements. Our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company making us more nimble and lowering our costs. Our execution and company-wide streamlined of organizations, processes and systems continue to be on track to deliver incremental savings in 2017. 
For example, in Q3, we would take a major step forward in simplifying the company systems infrastructure there that all of our financial systems now on SAP. 
On the capital deployment front, we paid $37 million in dividends, repurchased $24 million of Agilent stock and invested $80 million to enable our NGS workflow strategy. Finally, our One Agilent initiative is driving a well receive cultural transformation to improve cross company collaboration and delivery of results. Last year's analyst and Investor Day, described the shareholder value equation for Agilent to be driven by a growing the market, expanding operating margins and a balanced capital allocation policy. I'd like to take a minute to position Q2 results in the context of our longer-term goals. 
After delivering our highest annual core revenue growth since 2011 of 6.4% of 2015, we now have 2 strong quarters to start 2016, including this quarter's 8% core revenue growth. Since the new Agilent leadership team is put in place, the team have delivered year-over-year operating margin improvements every quarter. We had completely offset initial $40 million of synergies from the company split. 
In fiscal 2015, we returned $400 million to shareholders and $370 million year-to-date in 2016 through cash dividends and share repurchase. From 2015 onto now, we've also invested our $400 million in new business via M&A and equity investments. Didier will share more specifics later, but we are raising our full year 2016 outlook for core growth, operating margin, EPS and cash flow. Let me now talk about our second half '16 forecast in light of what we have already achieved in 2016 and what we plan to deliver in 2017. 
When we look at today's overall market environment, while we face increase leads of compares, we expect strength in the farmers to continue in the second half 2016 and into 2017. China is also expected to remain strong in second half 2016 and 2017. Taking a closer look at the chemical and energy market, we have been experiencing a more prolonged and steeper slowdown as initially anticipated. We are now forecast in overall low single-digit market declines for the year versus our not so flat guidance assumptions. The oil exploration segment of this market has been down significantly for some time with a recent well reported spill over into the refining segment. There are initial indicators, however, of a bottoming with increased deal activity in the large chemical segment of the market. 
We have projected an improved chemical energy market environment in 2017. We are assuming we will continue to face headwinds in this market for the remainder of 2016. We are currently modeling 2017 with an above market core revenue growth of 4.5% in the mid-point. This, in line with our projected full year 2016 core growth rates, but higher than our expected core growth rate in the second half of 2016. There are 2 reasons for this increase. 
First, we expect to have a very strong your product introduction in the second half of FY '16, which will drive revenue growth in FY '17. Second, on the end market front, we expect chemical energy to have bottomed out by year-end accompanied by continuing solid conditions in all of our other end markets and in China. 
Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margins at 22%. Looking inside the company, I can share with you today that our One Agilent team is working well together and is driven to win in the marketplace. I look forward to seeing many of you at our analyst and Investor Day, where I'll share our progress versus our commitments, how we will sustain or improve performance and the longer-term outlook for the company. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016.

As Mike stated, we delivered a strong performance this quarter again, 8% core revenue growth, 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and $256 million in operating cash flow. After addressing for last year's $15 million slippage in revenue from Q2 to Q3 as we launch our new U.S. logistics center, our core revenue growth of 6.5% remained well above markets. 
During the quarter, we brought back $94 million of stocks and paid $37 million in dividends. Finally, on May 3, we successfully moved all finance applications from Oracle to SAP, which is our main ERP. This will result in significant simplifications of our finance and IT operations. I'll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. 
We expect Q3 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.47. At mid-point, revenue will grow 1.3% on a core basis or close to 3% adjusting for last year's $50 million impact from the U.S. logistics center. And turning to share repurchase, we expect to buy back $93 million this Q3. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2016.
We are raising the mid-point of our revenue guidance by $60 million, including $50 million due to currency. As a result, we're increasing our core revenue growth guidance at mid-point from 4.25% to 4.50%. We're also raising the mid-point of our EPS guidance by $0.06, including $0.03 coming from currency and $0.03 from operational performance. 
And one important note, after further review, we and our auditors have concluded to account for the Lasergen investment using the cost method of accounting. This means that we'll not book our share of Lasergen losses as previously communicated. 
Finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance from $650 million to $740 million, and there's no chance to our CapEx guidance of $140 million. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

In central Europe, there's steadily strength in Germany almost around that. We still see some issues on the academia and government side, as well on the flat. But pharma, for example, is also very strong Europe. For your pharma question, overall, we are confident that we will continue to see pretty high growth in pharma for the remainder of this year, which we target low double-digit growth for pharma. And looking into 2017, we think the pharma market will be -- continue to be strong for us, driven by 2 factors. We see a continued demand in the replacement business. And as you probably know, we just launched the conference. We launched our new 1216 for entrails as an example together with the consumables and servicing. And we think that will drive, continue to drive a lot of good replacement to focus for us in pharma. And then, results of continued demand in the biopharma space that are looking for new solutions helping with more complex and molecules in terms of analysis, and we have a very comprehensive operating space as well."

What we looked at was with our growth rate that we've had over the first half of this year and as we look into Q3 and Q4. And what I point to is a couple of things, Jonathan. First of all, tough compares and this is inclusive of a few one-time moves between quarters, which actually were driven by improvements of raw operations. So as Didier mentioned, we had this $50 million shift in Q2 of last year into Q3, which when we had a start-up issue on the new logistics center. So you adjust for that, you catch up about 3% growth. The other thing we saw happen in Q2 was we're working really hard to improve the overall cycle time from the time a customer places order to actually install and we can recognize a revenue. In Q2, we actually exceeded our expectations and it got there a lot faster. Had thought and what that meant was we had significant amount of revenue, probably $20 million to $25 million that came from Q3 into Q2 or initially as forecasted into the second -- third quarter. All in all, you kind of take in account those things, you've got put more a consistent kind of a growth scenario between Q2 and Q3. 
I would tell you, though, the chemical energy is still looking for a bottom. And that's why we have -- that outlook for the year, which basically is down -- stay down for the rest of the year. There are some signs that it could be getting better. But we have -- we're not convinced yet. We've seen the bottom of that kind of energy. So I think the combination of those tough compares as well as our outlook and chemical energy is what's driving the overall guidance for the second half."

One is this higher conversion of orders revenue than forecast. So basically, what we've done is we reduced the cycle time and by our estimates, it happened a lot faster than we had thought. So I think it's good news from a standpoint of operational efficiency that it great some forecasting challenges but probably 20 million to 25 million came from Q3 into Q2. The other thing I think you should take a look at is the FX assumptions. So around $9 million or so DDA give some numbers. So FX added about another $9 million.

So I think you're going to see the changes paying off in terms of longer-term growth. So we're really happy with but the fact that we've got it all behind us and settle down and I think its starting to pay off on the initial benefits that we envision when we created that structure. 
Relative to gross margin ERP, just keep in mind that what we've been talking about is a -- the financial systems, which really go into the SG&A line. So it really won't affect the gross margin. That being said, we do think we can do more on gross margin as we move forward in '16 and '17. I'll talk a little bit about more about in detail next week in New York. But as you may know, our initial 400 basis points of improvement to when I came onboard, we said half would come through OpEx and other operational cost, and then others through growth.

And that was the assumption that we have made initial bonus, which makes our revenue results that much more -- really pleased results, given the fact that the chemical energy market is not developed the way that we initially thought. That being said, in '17, we actually think it will be improved, which means it won't be declining. And in fact, it will probably be flat or maybe low single-digits. And why do we believe that? If you look at how our business breaks down in that segment, we often talk about the oil side. But 50% of our business historically has been in the exploration, around 35% has been in the refining. The other half, which is by far the biggest individual segment, the chemical side.  They're benefiting by a lower feedstock costs. They've got pent op investment demands and we're starting to see increased deal activity. So it in fact, Patrick and I were talking about this morning it going of reminds me of a pro forma a few years ago basically it would have 2 years of shrinking performance in this marketplace, a lot of pent-up demand. So long story short, our growth assumption for next year assumes low single-digit chemical energy growth for the year. Again, we still believe we're surged for the bottom. So -- and it's still early in the year for 2016. But that's our basic assumption for '17, which is an improved environment, not dramatic, but improved from what we've seen over the last 24 months."

And maybe let me start with the last part of your question, which is the Takeaway here, we do believe there's a stable improvement. So in my mind, this is this is the new normal in terms of our ability to convert quarters to revenue. And so I would characterize this as new normal how are they going to operate. So how do we get here and why do they look us. So significantly different in China. So first of all, starts with the looking at the entire process from an end-to-end customer perspective from the time of order placement until shipment into customer installation a curse blunt, as you know, when I restructure the company, was really trying to break out the silos and we had very silent oriented approach to this end-to-end process from a customer perspective. In the company, we looked at each slice of the process but nobody's looking at the collective process for end-to-end. You start doing that heavy start seeing where the issues are. The opportunities are. So we found ways to improve our order linearity. We've improved the quality of booked orders, and this usually gets to your question about China. Often, you're dealing with letters of credit issues and other trade issues that in the past have delayed our ability to actually book them as clean orders and turned them into revenue, we call this delivery box. We've been working making sure we had material availability. I think we hit one of our best one is ever in terms of having maternal ready for all our shouldn't so we improved our ability to get an order duly your fashion make sure those orders are clean and not have a lot of rework, and then we've improve our delivery performance. And then spent a lot of time improving our efforts between shipment insulation, which sometimes can go on for several weeks. So I think it all starts to this looking at the whole process from an end-to-end perspective and the result has been a significant improvement in cycle time and noticed and turned into revenue more quickly than in the past. I do think this represents our newly up operating. And again, as I mentioned in my remarks, it did great some -- it did have invitations of how we guide the company for the second and third quarter. But I think we're delighted to be able to actually have ongoing strong operational efficiency improvement in place so that we know how to predict revenue even better in the future."

So it's not only from a biopharma. But we think that the biggest pushes actually right now, coming from pharma and biopharma and, and I would still say we are in the midst of the replacement cycle. We don't see that to be over -- in the next couple of quarters. So there's a healthy demand behind the negotiation across our customers on upcoming preplacement and how we place of the systems and how we plan it out for them so sound that."

Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter. Both Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight 3 key results. First, revenue growth",1569,"Thanks, Alicia and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter. Both Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight 3 key results. 
First, revenue growth was up more than 8% on a core basis. Second, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 19.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from a year ago. Finally, EPS of $0.44 was up 16% over last year. 
Before moving on to a review of our Q2 results, I do want to address our year-over-year quarterly comparisons, which reflect an unusual event from last year. Of the 8% core growth that we're announcing today, about 1.5 percentage points is due to a shift of revenue last year from Q2 '15 into Q3 '15. 
In the second quarter a year ago, we experienced $50 million of shipment delays due to start-up challenges with our new U.S. logistics center. In addition, our process-improvement efforts over the past few quarters to convert incoming orders more quickly to revenue have paid off. We have reduced our order to revenue cycle times, particularly in China. Consequently, some shipments initially forecast for Q3 of this year were delivered in Q2. 
Agilent's strong Q2 results were led by double-digit core growth in pharma and food markets. We also experienced continued strength in academia and government, environmental and diagnostic and clinical markets. All end markets grew except chemical and energy. Growth was broad based across most of our portfolio. 
Geographically, all regions grew except Japan, led by very strong growth in China. Let me highlight our Q2 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 8%, led by strong demand in the pharma and food markets. About 3 percentage points of the 8% increase was thanks to a softer compare due to the timing issues mentioned earlier from last year's U.S. logistics center startup. 
A combination of strong top line growth, expense management and gross margin improvements, partially due to the NMR exit, drove LSAG's operating margin to 19%, up 320 basis points from a year ago. LSAG continues to strengthen its portfolio. In Q2, Agilent introduced VistaFlux software. This new software speeds up clinical research data analysis, so scientists can more quickly understand the underlying causes of diseases such as cancer. VistaFlux strengthens Agilent's leadership position in metabolomics. Last week, we announced a new Agilent 1216 Infinity II LC at the analytical tradeshow. This instrument provides best-in-class lab efficiency and improves the performance of full backward compatibility. 
Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver consistently strong revenue results. Core revenue growth in Q2 was 10%, led by strength in contract services, LC columns and lab supplies. Expansion and penetration in Asia continued to be strong contributors to our growth. Operating margin was flat versus a year go at 21.5%. 
CrossLab represents a strategic transformation of our services and consumables business. I'm pleased to report that Agilent was recognized with the 2016 Reviewers' Choice Award for Customer Service. This award is from SelectScience, an independent expert-led scientific review. This is the second year in a row that scientists in North America have judged Agilent's customer service to be the best in the laboratory products industry. 
Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 5% core growth in Q2 against a difficult compare. The pathology business continues on a steady trajectory back to market growth rates, highlighted by strong demand for our new PD-L1 companion and complementary diagnostic tests. Genomics showed strong market performance, led by our SureSelect target enrichment and array CGH offerings. DGG's operating margin was flat versus a year ago at 15%. 
In Q2, Agilent announced an $80 million investment in Lasergen, an emerging biotechnology company with innovative next-gen sequencing technology. Our two companies will collaborate on building an NGS workflow for clinical applications. 
In Q2, Agilent also announced the commercial availability has expanded to the EU for a new PD-L1 diagnostic test for nonsquamous, nonsmall cell lung cancer. This diagnostic was developed through a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of OPDIVO. 
Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets saw a continuation of our first quarter performance, with strength across all end markets. Pharma grew 14%, fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and sustained growth in the aftermarket. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than mid- to high double-digit growth in pharma. 
Academia and government grew 7%, driven by strong demand in China and an uptick in the U.S. Clinical and diagnostics also grew 7% with strength in genomics, led by target enrichment and array CGH. Applied end market performance was mixed. Food was up 25% with strong sales in China and the Americas. China also drove 6% worldwide growth in environmental and forensics. Chemical energy declined 3%, reflecting continued macroeconomic concerns and the effects of lower oil prices. Now I'll turn to an update on our operating margin improvement initiative. 
Q2 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement delivered by the new Agilent team. This is a result of our ability to outgrow the market, while driving operational efficiency improvements. Our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company making us more nimble and lowering our cost. Our execution of company-wide streamlining organizations, processes and systems continue to be on track to deliver incremental savings in 2017. 
For example, in Q3, we would take a major step forward in simplifying the company's systems infrastructure with all of our financial systems now on SAP. 
On the capital deployment front, we paid $37 million in dividends, repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock and invested $80 million to enable our NGS workflow strategy. Finally, our One Agilent initiative is driving a well-received cultural transformation to improve cross-company collaboration and delivering of results. At last year's Analyst and Investor Day, I described a shareholder value creation model for Agilent to be driven by outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins and a balanced capital allocation policy. I'd like to take a minute to position the Q2 results in the context of our longer-term goals. 
After delivering our highest annual core revenue growth since 2011 of 6.4% in 2015, we've now had 2 strong quarters to start 2016, including this quarter's 8% core revenue growth. Since the new Agilent team -- leadership team was put in place, the team has delivered year-over-year operating margin improvements every quarter. We have completely offset the initial $40 million into synergies from the company split. 
In fiscal 2015, we returned $400 million to shareholders and $370 million year-to-date in 2016 through cash dividends and share repurchase. From 2015 onto now, we've also invested our $400 million in new business via M&A and equity investments. Didier will share more specifics later, but we are raising our full year 2016 outlook for core growth, operating margin, EPS and cash flow. Let me now talk about our second half  '16 forecast in light of what we have already achieved in 2016 and what we plan to deliver in 2017. 
When we look at today's overall market environment, while we face increasingly tough compares, we expect strength in pharma to continue in the second half 2016 and into 2017. China is also expected to remain strong in second half 2016 and 2017. Taking a closer look at the chemical and energy market, we have been experiencing a more prolonged and steeper slowdown than initially anticipated. We are now forecasting overall low single-digit market declines for the year versus our initial flat guidance assumptions. The oil exploration segment of this market has been down significantly for some time, with a recent well-reported spillover into the refining segment. There are initial indications, however, of a bottoming with increased deal activity in the large chemical segment of the market. 
We have projected an improved chemical energy market environment in 2017. We are assuming we will continue to face headwinds in this market for the remainder of 2016. We are currently modeling 2017 with an above-market core revenue growth of 4.5% of the midpoint. This is in line with our projected full year 2016 core growth rates, but higher than our expected core growth rate in the second half of 2016. There are 2 reasons for this increase. 
First, we expect to have a very strong new product introductions in the second half of FY '16, which will drive revenue growth in FY '17. Second, on the end market front, we expect chemical energy to have bottomed out by year-end accompanied by continuing solid conditions in all of our other end markets and in China. 
Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margins at 22%. Looking inside the company, I can share with you today that the One Agilent team is working well together and is driven to win in the marketplace. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst and Investor Day, where I'll share our progress versus our commitments, how we will sustain or improve performance and the longer-term outlook for the company. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016.

As Mike stated, we delivered a strong performance this quarter again, 8% core revenue growth, 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and $256 million in operating cash flow. After adjusting for last year's $15 million slippage in revenue from Q2 to Q3 as we launch our new U.S. logistics center, our core revenue growth of 6.5% remained well above market.
During the quarter, we brought back $94 million of stock and paid $37 million in dividends. Finally, on May 3, we successfully moved all finance applications from Oracle to SAP, which is our main ERP. This will result in significant simplifications of our finance and IT operations. I'll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. 
We expect Q3 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.47. At midpoint, revenue will grow 1.3% on a core basis or close to 3% adjusting for last year's $50 million impact from the U.S. logistics center. And turning to share repurchase, we expect to buy back $93 million this Q3. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2016.
We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $60 million, including $50 million due to currency. As a result, we're increasing our core revenue growth guidance at midpoint from 4.25% to 4.50%. We're also raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance by $0.06, including $0.03 coming from currency and $0.03 from operational performance. 
And one important note. After further review, we and our auditors have concluded to account for the Lasergen investment using the cost method of accounting. This means that we'll not book our share of Lasergen losses as previously communicated. 
Finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance from $650 million to $740 million, and there's no change to our CapEx guidance of $140 million. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

But pharma, for example, is also very strong Europe. For your pharma question, overall, we are confident that we will continue to see pretty high growth in pharma for the remainder of this year. We target low double-digit growth for pharma. And looking into 2017, we think the pharma market will be -- continue to be strong for us, driven by 2 vectors. We see a continued demand in the replacement business. And as you probably know, we just launched at the [indiscernible] conference. We launched our new 1260 Infinity LC as an example, together with the lab consumables and servicing. And we think that will drive -- continue to drive a lot of good replacement for us in pharma.

What we looked at was with our growth rate that we've had over the first half of this year and as we looked into Q3 and Q4, and what I point to is a couple of things, Jonathan. First of all, tough compares and this is inclusive of a few onetime moves between quarters, which actually were driven by improvements of raw operations. So as Didier mentioned, we had this $50 million shift in Q2 of last year into Q3, which when we had our start-up issues with our new logistics center. So if you adjust for that, it gets you at about 3% growth. The other thing we saw happen in Q2 was we've been working really hard to improve the overall cycle time from the time a customer places order to actually it's installed and we can recognize a revenue. In Q2, we actually exceeded our expectations and we got there a lot faster, we had thought, and what that meant was we had significant amount of revenue, probably $20 million to $25 million that came from Q3 into Q2 where initially we'd forecasted into the second -- third quarter. All in all, if you kind of take into account those things, you've got putting more of a consistent kind of a growth scenario between Q2 and Q3. 
I would tell you, though, the chemical energy is still looking for a bottom. And that's why we have that outlook for the year, which basically is down -- it's going to stay down for the rest of the year. There are some signs that it could be getting better. But we have -- we're not convinced yet we've seen the bottom in chemical energy. So I think the combination of those tough compares as well as our outlook and chemical energy is what's driving the overall guidance for the second half."

Just as a reminder, we have probably about 150,000 systems out there based on the 1100, 1200 platform, which over time will be up for replacement.

We saw good growth across entire portfolio led by pharma and food markets in China, as you heard early. But I'd ask you to look at 2 things. One is this higher conversion of orders to revenue than forecast. So basically, what we've done is we reduced the cycle time and by our estimates, it happened a lot faster than we had thought, which I think is good news from the standpoint of operational efficiency did create some forecasting challenges, but probably $20 million to $25 million came from Q3 into Q2. The other thing, I think, you should take a look at is the FX assumptions. So around $9 million or so, Didier, I think was the number. So FX added about another $9 million.

But in terms of the sales force integration and go-to-market -- we couldn't be happier. I mean, that was a major move we made last year, where we basically went from 5 sales force to the 2 sales force, one focused on the analytical laboratory marketplace and then the other one focused on the regulated diagnostic marketplace. At the time, I remember sharing with you, ""Hey, we're making a big change here and it could affect the top line and the short one. That didn't happen. In fact, I submit that as we go out into '16 and '17, we're now putting more resources of specialization in academia, in biopharma. So I think you're going to see the changes paying off in terms of longer-term growth. So we're really happy with both the fact that we've got it all behind us, it's settled down and I think it's starting to pay off on the initial benefits that we envisioned when we created that structure. 
Relative to gross margin ERP, I just keep in mind that what we've been talking about is a -- the financial systems, which really go into the SG&A line. So it really won't affect the gross margin. That being said, we do think we can do more on gross margins as we move forward in '16 and '17. I'll talk a little bit about -- more about in detail next week when we're in New York. But as you may know, on our initial 400 basis points of improvement when I came onboard, we said half would come through OpEx and other operational costs, and then others through growth. And the growth piece would be -- a lot would be driven by our ability to capture the gross margin improvements on increased volume. So we think we still have room to improve our material cost, and we think that we've got room to continue to bring down our logistics costs."

So let me try to clarify here. So what we said was in this year, we thought our performance will be flat for the entire year, while in fact, it's going to be down, we probably think in the range of 2.5% for the year, for the entire year. And that is a change from our assumptions coming into this year. And that was the assumption we made at the time of our initial guidance, which makes our revenue results even much more -- we're really pleased with the results, given the fact that the chemical energy market has not developed the way we initially had thought. That being said, in '17, we actually think it will be improved, which means it won't be declining. And in fact, it will probably be flat or maybe low single digits. And why do we believe that? If you look at how our business breaks down in that segment, we often talk about the oil side. But 50% of our business historically has been in the exploration and another 35% has been in the refining. The other half, which is by far the biggest individual segment, is the chemical side, and they're benefiting by lower feedstock costs. They've got pent-up investment demands, and we're starting to see increased deal activity. So in fact, Patrick and I were talking about this, this morning and it kind of reminds me of a pro forma a few years ago basically we're going to have 2 years of shrinking performance in this marketplace, a lot of pent-up demand. So long story short, our growth assumption for next year assumes low single-digit chemical energy growth for the year. Again, we still believe we're searching for the bottom. So -- and it's still early in the year 2016. But that's our basic assumption for '17, which is an improved environment, not dramatic, but improved from what we've seen over the last 24 months."

And maybe let me start with the last part of your question, which is the takeaway here, we do believe that there's a stable improvement. So in my mind or the language I use, this is the new normal in terms of our ability to convert orders to revenue. And so I would characterize this as new normal of how we're going to operate. So how did we get here and why do they look so significantly different in China? So first of all, it starts with looking at the entire process from an end-to-end customer perspective from the time of order placement till shipment until customer installation occurs and, as you know, when I restructured the company, I was really trying to break down the silos and we had a very silo'd [ph] oriented approach to this end-to-end process from a customer perspective. In the company, we looked at each slice of the process but nobody's looking at the collective process for end-to-end. You start doing that, then you start seeing where the issues are, the opportunities are. So we found ways to improve our order linearity. We've improved the quality of booked orders, and this really gets to your question about China. Often, you're dealing with letters of credit issues and other trade issues that in the past have delayed our ability to actually book them as clean orders and turned them into revenue. We call this delivery box. We've been working on making sure we had material availability. I think we hit one of our best quarters ever in terms of having material ready for all of our shipments. So we improved our ability to get orders in a linear fashion, make sure those orders are clean and not have lot of rework, and then we've improved our delivery performance. And then spent a lot of time improving our efforts between shipment installation, which sometimes can go on for several weeks. So I think it all starts with this looking at the whole process from an end-to-end perspective and the result has been a significant improvement in cycle time and orders turned into revenue more quickly than in the past. I do think this represents our new way of operating. And again, as I mentioned in my remarks, it did create some -- it did have implications of how we guide the company for the second and third quarter. But I think we're delighted to be able to actually have ongoing strong operational efficiency improvement in place so that we know how to predict revenue even better in the future."

We have a series of operational programs. We talked about one of those already, which is the implications of the ERP, and the continued focus on gross margin improvement specifically, material cost reductions and logistic savings. So I think the combination of those 3 factors plus with the overall quarter growth assumptions that we're currently modeling around 4.5 gets us to the 22%."

I've seen this before where the legislation is announced and there's a lot of fanfare about it. But we don't obviously are backed up by investments.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter. Both Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight 3 key results. First, revenue growth",1570,"Thanks, Alicia and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter. Both Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight 3 key results. 
First, revenue growth was up more than 8% on a core basis. Second, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 19.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from a year ago. Finally, EPS of $0.44 was up 15% over last year. 
Before moving on to a review of our Q2 results, I do want to address our year-over-year quarterly comparisons, which reflect an unusual event from last year. Of the 8% core growth that we're announcing today, about 1.5 percentage points is due to a shift of revenue last year from Q2 '15 into Q3 '15. 
In the second quarter a year ago, we experienced $50 million of shipment delays due to start-up challenges with our new U.S. logistics center. In addition, our process-improvement efforts over the past few quarters to convert incoming orders more quickly to revenue have paid off. We have reduced our order to revenue cycle times, particularly in China. Consequently, some shipments initially forecast for Q3 of this year were delivered in Q2. 
Agilent's strong Q2 results were led by double-digit core growth in pharma and food markets. We also experienced continued strength in academia and government, environmental and diagnostic and clinical markets. All end markets grew except chemical and energy. Growth was broad based across most of our portfolio. 
Geographically, all regions grew except Japan, led by very strong growth in China. Let me highlight our Q2 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 8%, led by strong demand in the pharma and food markets. About 3 percentage points of the 8% increase was thanks to a softer compare due to the timing issues mentioned earlier from last year's U.S. logistics center startup. 
The combination of strong top line growth, expense management and gross margin improvements, partially due to the NMR exit, drove LSAG's operating margin to 19%, up 320 basis points from a year ago. LSAG continues to strengthen its portfolio. In Q2, Agilent introduced VistaFlux software. This new software speeds up clinical research data analysis, so scientists can more quickly understand the underlying causes of diseases such as cancer. VistaFlux strengthens Agilent's leadership position in metabolomics. Last week, we announced a new Agilent 1216 Infinity II LC at the analytical tradeshow. This instrument provides best-in-class lab efficiency and improves performance with full backward compatibility. 
Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver consistently strong revenue results. Core revenue growth in Q2 was 10%, led by strength in contract services, LC columns and lab supplies. Expansion and penetration in Asia continued to be strong contributors to our growth. Operating margin was flat versus a year ago at 21.5%. 
CrossLab represents a strategic transformation of our services and consumables business. I'm pleased to report that Agilent was recognized with the 2016 Reviewers' Choice Award for Customer Service. This award is from SelectScience, an independent expert-led scientific review. This is the second year in a row that scientists in North America have judged Agilent's customer service to be the best in the laboratory products industry. 
Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 5% core growth in Q2 against a difficult compare. The pathology business continues on a steady trajectory back to market growth rates, highlighted by strong demand for our new PD-L1 companion and complementary diagnostic tests. Genomics showed strong market performance, led by our SureSelect target enrichment and array CGH offerings. DGG's operating margin was flat versus a year ago at 15%. 
In Q2, Agilent announced an $80 million investment in Lasergen, an emerging biotechnology company with innovative next-gen sequencing technology. Our two companies will collaborate on building an NGS workflow for clinical applications. 
In Q2, Agilent also announced that commercial availability has expanded to the EU for a new PD-L1 diagnostic test for nonsquamous, nonsmall cell lung cancer. This diagnostic was developed through a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of OPDIVO. 
Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets saw a continuation of our first quarter performance, with strength across all end markets. Pharma grew 14%, fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and sustained growth in the aftermarket. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than mid- to high double-digit growth in pharma. 
Academia and government grew 7%, driven by strong demand in China and an uptick in the U.S. Clinical and diagnostics also grew 7% with strength in genomics, led by target enrichment and array CGH. Applied end market performance was mixed. Food was up 25% with strong sales in China and the Americas. China also drove 6% worldwide growth in environmental and forensics. Chemical energy declined 3%, reflecting continued macroeconomic concerns and the effects of lower oil prices. Now I'll turn to an update on our operating margin improvement initiative. 
Q2 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement delivered by the new Agilent team. This is a result of our ability to outgrow the market, while driving operational efficiency improvements. Our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company making us more nimble and lowering our cost. Our execution of company-wide streamlining organizations, processes and systems continue to be on track to deliver incremental savings in 2017. 
For example, in Q3, we would take a major step forward in simplifying the company's systems infrastructure with all of our financial systems now on SAP. 
On the capital deployment front, we paid $37 million in dividends, repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock and invested $80 million to enable our NGS workflow strategy. Finally, our One Agilent initiative is driving a well-received cultural transformation to improve cross-company collaboration and delivery of results. At last year's Analyst and Investor Day, I described a shareholder value creation model for Agilent to be driven by outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins and a balanced capital allocation policy. I'd like to take a minute to position the Q2 results in the context of our longer-term goals. 
After delivering our highest annual core revenue growth since 2011 of 6.4% in 2015, we've now had 2 strong quarters to start 2016, including this quarter's 8% core revenue growth. Since the new Agilent team -- leadership team was put in place, the team has delivered year-over-year operating margin improvements every quarter. We have completely offset the initial $40 million into synergies from the company split. 
In fiscal 2015, we returned $400 million to shareholders and $370 million year-to-date in 2016 through cash dividends and share repurchase. From 2015 until now, we've also invested around $400 million in new business via M&A and equity investments. Didier will share more specifics later, but we are raising our full year 2016 outlook for core growth, operating margin, EPS and cash flow. Let me now talk about our second half '16 forecast in light of what we have already achieved in 2016 and what we plan to deliver in 2017. 
When we look at today's overall market environment, while we face increasingly tough compares, we expect strength in pharma to continue in the second half 2016 and into 2017. China is also expected to remain strong in the second half of 2016 and 2017. Taking a closer look at the chemical and energy market, we have been experiencing a more prolonged and steeper slowdown than initially anticipated. We are now forecasting overall low single-digit market declines for the year versus our initial flat guidance assumptions. The oil exploration segment of this market has been down significantly for some time, with a recent well-reported spillover into the refining segment. There are initial indications, however, of a bottoming, with increased deal activity in the large chemical segment of the market. 
We have projected an improved chemical energy market environment in 2017. We are assuming we will continue to face headwinds in this market for the remainder of 2016. We are currently modeling 2017 with an above-market core revenue growth of 4.5% at the midpoint. This is in line with our projected full year 2016 core growth rates, but higher than our expected core growth rate in the second half of 2016. There are 2 reasons for this increase. 
First, we expect to have a very strong new product introduction in the second half of FY '16, which will drive revenue growth in FY '17. Second, on the end market front, we expect chemical energy to have bottomed out by year-end, accompanied by continuing solid conditions in all of our other end markets and in China. 
Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margins of 22%. Looking inside the company, I can share with you today that the One Agilent team is working well together and is driven to win in the marketplace. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst and Investor Day, where I'll share our progress versus our commitments, how we will sustain or improve performance and the longer-term outlook for the company. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016.

As Mike stated, we delivered a strong performance this quarter again, 8% core revenue growth, 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and $256 million in operating cash flow. After adjusting for last year's $15 million slippage in revenue from Q2 to Q3 as we launch our new U.S. logistics center, our core revenue growth of 6.5% remained well above market.
During the quarter, we brought back $94 million of stock and paid $37 million in dividends. Finally, on May 3, we successfully moved all finance applications from Oracle to SAP, which is our main ERP. This will result in significant simplifications of our finance and IT operations. I'll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. 
We expect Q3 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.47. At midpoint, revenue will grow 1.3% on a core basis or close to 3% adjusting for last year's $50 million impact from the U.S. logistics center. And turning to share repurchase, we expect to buy back $93 million this Q3. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2016.
We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $60 million, including $50 million due to currency. As a result, we're increasing our core revenue growth guidance at midpoint from 4.25% to 4.50%. We're also raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance by $0.06, including $0.03 coming from currency and $0.03 from operational performance. 
And one important note. After further review, we and our auditors have concluded to account for the Lasergen investment using the cost method of accounting. This means that we'll not book our share of Lasergen losses as previously communicated. 
Finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance from $650 million to $740 million, and there's no change to our CapEx guidance of $140 million. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

We had seen some weakness on what we call the IDO, Eastern Europe and that's mainly driven by the chemical and energy market or the energy market on that side. In Central Europe, there's generally strength in Germany and other states around it. We still see some issues on the academia and government side that is rather flat. But pharma, for example, is also very strong in Europe. For your pharma question, overall, we are confident that we will continue to see pretty high growth in pharma for the remainder of this year. We target low double-digit growth for pharma. And looking into 2017, we think the pharma market will be -- continue to be strong for us, driven by 2 vectors. We see a continued demand in the replacement business. And as you probably know, we just launched -- at the analytical conference, we launched our new 1260 Infinity LC as an example, together with the Infinity lab consumables and servicing. And we think that will drive -- continue to drive a lot of good replacement for us in pharma. And then, we see also continued demand in the biopharma space that are looking for new solutions helping with these more complex molecules in terms of analysis, and we have a very comprehensive operating for that space as well."

What we looked at was with our growth rate that we've had over the first half of this year and as we looked into Q3 and Q4, and what I point to is a couple of things, Jonathan. First of all, tough compares and this is inclusive of a few onetime moves between quarters, which actually were driven by improvements of overall operations. So as Didier mentioned, we had this $50 million shift in Q2 of last year into Q3, which when we had our start-up issues with our new logistics center. So if you adjust for that, it gets you to about 3% growth. The other thing we saw happen in Q2 was we've been working really hard to improve the overall cycle time from the time a customer places order to actually it's installed and we can recognize the revenue. In Q2, we actually exceeded our expectations and we got there a lot faster than we had thought, and what that meant was we had a significant amount of revenue, probably $20 million to $25 million that came from Q3 into Q2 where initially we'd forecasted into the second -- third quarter. All in all, if you kind of take into account those things, you've got pretty -- more of a consistent kind of a growth scenario between Q2 and Q3. 
I would tell you, though, the chemical energy is still looking for a bottom. And that's why we have that outlook for the year, which basically is down -- it's going to stay down for the rest of the year. There are some signs that it could be getting better. But we have -- we're not convinced yet we've seen the bottom in chemical energy. So I think the combination of those tough compares as well as our outlook on chemical energy is what's driving the overall guidance for the second half."

We're now looking at low double-digit growth in China for the full year."

We've had improvement in our operating margin, as I pointed out in '15. But all the vectors really came together nicely in the second quarter. And I was particularly pleased on some of the more operational activities that we've been working on inside the company. And that may not always be so apparent initially on the outside world, but you start to see it in the results. And the fact that we're doing -- we've adjusted our logistic challenges. Yeah, I have to talk about it in the year-over-year compares, but it's fixed and actually now is contributing to improved results. Yes, we had to talk about the shortened cycle time for orders to revenue and it brought in some revenues that we initially had planned for the third quarter, but we made those operational improvements. The cycle times are shorter, and this is now the new normal. So I guess, that will be the closing comments, which -- yes, we're the new normal for the company.

We saw good growth across the entire portfolio led by pharma and food markets in China, as you heard early. But I'd ask you to look at 2 things. One is this higher conversion of orders to revenue than forecast. So basically, what we've done is we reduced the cycle time and by our estimates, it happened a lot faster than we had thought, which I think is good news from the standpoint of operational efficiency; did create some forecasting challenges, but probably $20 million to $25 million came from Q3 into Q2. The other thing, I think, you should take a look at is the FX assumptions. So around $9 million or so, Didier, I think was the number. So FX added about another $9 million. So between the cycle time improvements, the FX assumptions and just the fact that the market continues, we're getting our fair share of markets where they're growing.

I mean, that was a major move we made last year, where we basically went from 5 sales forces to the 2 sales forces, one focused on the analytical laboratory marketplace and then the other one focused on the regulated diagnostic marketplace. At the time, I remember sharing with you, ""Hey, we're making a big change here and it could affect the top line and the short one. That didn't happen. In fact, I submit that as we go out into '16 and '17, we're now putting more resources of specialization in academia, in biopharma. So I think you're going to see the changes paying off in terms of our longer-term growth. So we're really happy with both the fact that we've got it all behind us, it's settled down and I think it's starting to pay off on the initial benefits that we envisioned when we created that structure. 
Relative to gross margin ERP, just keep in mind that what we've been talking about is a -- the financial systems, which really go into the SG&A line. So it really won't affect the gross margin. That being said, we do think we can do more on gross margins as we move forward in '16 and '17. I'll talk a little bit about -- more about in detail next week when we're in New York. But as you may know, on our initial 400 basis points of improvement, when I came onboard, we said half would come through OpEx and other operational costs, and then others through growth. And the growth piece would be -- a lot would be driven by our ability to capture the gross margin improvements on increased volume.

So let me try to clarify here. So what we said was in this year, we thought our performance would be flat for the entire year, while in fact, it's going to be down, we probably think in the range of 2.5% for the year, for the entire year. And that is a change from our assumptions coming into this year. And that was the assumption we made at the time of our initial guidance, which makes our revenue results even much more -- we're really pleased with the results, given the fact that the chemical energy market has not developed the way we initially had thought. That being said, in '17, we actually think it will be improved, which means it won't be declining. And in fact, it will probably be flat or maybe low single digits. And why do we believe that? If you look at how our business breaks down in that segment, we often talk about the oil side. But 50% of our business historically has been in the exploration and another 35% has been in the refining. The other half, which is by far the biggest individual segment, is the chemical side, and they're benefiting by lower feedstock costs. They've got pent-up investment demands, and we're starting to see increased deal activity. So in fact, Patrick and I were talking about this, this morning and it kind of reminds me of pharma a few years ago where basically we were going to have 2 years of shrinking performance in this marketplace, a lot of pent-up demand. So long story short, our growth assumption for next year assumes low single-digit chemical energy growth for the year. Again, we still believe we're searching for the bottom. So -- and it's still early in the year of 2016. But that's our basic assumption for '17, which is an improved environment -- not dramatic, but improved from what we've seen over the last 24 months."

And maybe let me start with the last part of your question, which is the takeaway here, we do believe that there's a stable improvement. So in my mind or the language I use, this is the new normal in terms of our ability to convert orders to revenue. And so I would characterize this as new normal of how we're going to operate. So how did we get here and why do they look so significantly different in China? So first of all, it starts with looking at the entire process from an end-to-end customer perspective from the time of order placement till shipment until customer installation occurs -- and, as you know, when I restructured the company, I was really trying to break down the silos and we had a very silo-oriented approach to this end-to-end process from a customer perspective. In the company, we looked at each slice of the process but nobody was looking at the collective process for end-to-end. You start doing that, and then you start seeing where the issues are, the opportunities are. So we found ways to improve our order linearity. We've improved the quality of booked orders, and this really gets to your question about China. Often, you're dealing with letters of credit issues and other trade issues that in the past have delayed our ability to actually book them as clean orders and turn them into revenue. We call this delivery box. We've been working on making sure we had material availability. I think we hit one of our best quarters ever in terms of having material ready for all of our shipments. So we improved our ability to get in orders in a linear fashion, make sure those orders are clean and not have lot of rework, and then we've improved our delivery performance. And then spent a lot of time improving our efforts between shipment installation, which sometimes can go on for several weeks. So I think it all starts with this looking at the whole process from an end-to-end perspective, and the result has been a significant improvement in cycle time and orders turned into revenue more quickly than in the past. I do think this represents our new way of operating. And again, as I mentioned in my remarks, it did create some -- it did have implications of how we guide the company for the second and third quarter. But I think we're delighted to be able to actually have ongoing strong operational efficiency improvement in place so that we know how to predict revenue even better in the future."

So it's not only in pharma and biopharma. But we think the biggest push is actually right now, coming from pharma and biopharma, and I would still say we are in the midst of the replacement cycle. We don't see that to be over -- in the next couple of quarters. There's a healthy demand and we are in negotiation with a lot of our core customers on upcoming replacements and how we place these systems and how we plan it out for them so it works for them."

Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter. Both Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight 3 key results. First, revenue growth",1570,"Thanks, Alicia and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter. Both Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight 3 key results. 
First, revenue growth was up more than 8% on a core basis. Second, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 19.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from a year ago. Finally, EPS of $0.44 was up 16% over last year. 
Before moving on to a review of our Q2 results, I do want to address our year-over-year quarterly comparisons, which reflect an unusual event from last year. Of the 8% core growth that we're announcing today, about 1.5 percentage points is due to a shift of revenue last year from Q2 '15 into Q3 '15. 
In the second quarter a year ago, we experienced $50 million of shipment delays due to start-up challenges with our new U.S. logistics center. In addition, our process-improvement efforts over the past few quarters to convert incoming orders more quickly to revenue have paid off. We have reduced our order to revenue cycle times, particularly in China. Consequently, some shipments initially forecast for Q3 of this year were delivered in Q2. 
Agilent's strong Q2 results were led by double-digit core growth in pharma and food markets. We also experienced continued strength in academia and government, environmental and diagnostic and clinical markets. All end markets grew except chemical and energy. Growth was broad based across most of our portfolio. 
Geographically, all regions grew except Japan, led by very strong growth in China. Let me highlight our Q2 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 8%, led by strong demand in the pharma and food markets. About 3 percentage points of the 8% increase was thanks to a softer compare due to the timing issues mentioned earlier from last year's U.S. logistics center startup. 
The combination of strong top line growth, expense management and gross margin improvements, partially due to the NMR exit, drove LSAG's operating margin to 19%, up 320 basis points from a year ago. LSAG continues to strengthen its portfolio. In Q2, Agilent introduced VistaFlux software. This new software speeds up clinical research data analysis, so scientists can more quickly understand the underlying causes of diseases such as cancer. VistaFlux strengthens Agilent's leadership position in metabolomics. Last week, we announced a new Agilent 1216 Infinity II LC at the analytical tradeshow. This instrument provides best-in-class lab efficiency and improves performance with full backward compatibility. 
Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver consistently strong revenue results. Core revenue growth in Q2 was 10%, led by strength in contract services, LC columns and lab supplies. Expansion and penetration in Asia continued to be strong contributors to our growth. Operating margin was flat versus a year ago at 21.5%. 
CrossLab represents a strategic transformation of our services and consumables business. I'm pleased to report that Agilent was recognized with the 2016 Reviewers' Choice Award for Customer Service. This award is from SelectScience, an independent expert-led scientific review. This is the second year in a row that scientists in North America have judged Agilent's customer service to be the best in the laboratory products industry. 
Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 5% core growth in Q2 against a difficult compare. The pathology business continues on a steady trajectory back to market growth rates, highlighted by strong demand for our new PD-L1 companion and complementary diagnostic tests. Genomics showed strong market performance, led by our SureSelect target enrichment and array CGH offerings. DGG's operating margin was flat versus a year ago at 15%. 
In Q2, Agilent announced an $80 million investment in Lasergen, an emerging biotechnology company with innovative next-gen sequencing technology. Our two companies will collaborate on building an NGS workflow for clinical applications. 
In Q2, Agilent also announced that commercial availability has expanded to the EU for a new PD-L1 diagnostic test for nonsquamous, nonsmall cell lung cancer. This diagnostic was developed through a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of OPDIVO. 
Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets saw a continuation of our first quarter performance, with strength across all end markets. Pharma grew 14%, fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and sustained growth in the aftermarket. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than mid- to high double-digit growth in pharma. 
Academia and government grew 7%, driven by strong demand in China and an uptick in the U.S. Clinical and diagnostics also grew 7% with strength in genomics, led by target enrichment and array CGH. Applied end market performance was mixed. Food was up 25% with strong sales in China and the Americas. China also drove 6% worldwide growth in environmental and forensics. Chemical energy declined 3%, reflecting continued macroeconomic concerns and the effects of lower oil prices. Now I'll turn to an update on our operating margin improvement initiative. 
Q2 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement delivered by the new Agilent team. This is a result of our ability to outgrow the market, while driving operational efficiency improvements. Our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company making us more nimble and lowering our cost. Our execution of company-wide streamlining organizations, processes and systems continue to be on track to deliver incremental savings in 2017. 
For example, in Q3, we would take a major step forward in simplifying the company's systems infrastructure with all of our financial systems now on SAP. 
On the capital deployment front, we paid $37 million in dividends, repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock and invested $80 million to enable our NGS workflow strategy. Finally, our One Agilent initiative is driving a well-received cultural transformation to improve cross-company collaboration and delivery of results. At last year's Analyst and Investor Day, I described a shareholder value creation model for Agilent to be driven by outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins and a balanced capital allocation policy. I'd like to take a minute to position the Q2 results in the context of our longer-term goals. 
After delivering our highest annual core revenue growth since 2011 of 6.4% in 2015, we've now had 2 strong quarters to start 2016, including this quarter's 8% core revenue growth. Since the new Agilent team -- leadership team was put in place, the team has delivered year-over-year operating margin improvements every quarter. We have completely offset the initial $40 million into synergies from the company split. 
In fiscal 2015, we returned $400 million to shareholders and $370 million year-to-date in 2016 through cash dividends and share repurchase. From 2015 until now, we've also invested around $400 million in new business via M&A and equity investments. Didier will share more specifics later, but we are raising our full year 2016 outlook for core growth, operating margin, EPS and cash flow. Let me now talk about our second half '16 forecast in light of what we have already achieved in 2016 and what we plan to deliver in 2017. 
When we look at today's overall market environment, while we face increasingly tough compares, we expect strength in pharma to continue in the second half 2016 and into 2017. China is also expected to remain strong in the second half of 2016 and 2017. Taking a closer look at the chemical and energy market, we have been experiencing a more prolonged and steeper slowdown than initially anticipated. We are now forecasting overall low single-digit market declines for the year versus our initial flat guidance assumptions. The oil exploration segment of this market has been down significantly for some time, with a recent well-reported spillover into the refining segment. There are initial indications, however, of a bottoming, with increased deal activity in the large chemical segment of the market. 
We have projected an improved chemical energy market environment in 2017. We are assuming we will continue to face headwinds in this market for the remainder of 2016. We are currently modeling 2017 with an above-market core revenue growth of 4.5% at the midpoint. This is in line with our projected full year 2016 core growth rates, but higher than our expected core growth rate in the second half of 2016. There are 2 reasons for this increase. 
First, we expect to have a very strong new product introduction in the second half of FY '16, which will drive revenue growth in FY '17. Second, on the end market front, we expect chemical energy to have bottomed out by year-end, accompanied by continuing solid conditions in all of our other end markets and in China. 
Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margins of 22%. Looking inside the company, I can share with you today that the One Agilent team is working well together and is driven to win in the marketplace. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst and Investor Day, where I'll share our progress versus our commitments, how we will sustain or improve performance and the longer-term outlook for the company. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016.

As Mike stated, we delivered a strong performance this quarter again, 8% core revenue growth, 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and $256 million in operating cash flow. After adjusting for last year's $15 million slippage in revenue from Q2 to Q3 as we launch our new U.S. logistics center, our core revenue growth of 6.5% remained well above market.
During the quarter, we brought back $94 million of stock and paid $37 million in dividends. Finally, on May 3, we successfully moved all finance applications from Oracle to SAP, which is our main ERP. This will result in significant simplifications of our finance and IT operations. I'll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. 
We expect Q3 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.47. At midpoint, revenue will grow 1.3% on a core basis or close to 3% adjusting for last year's $50 million impact from the U.S. logistics center. And turning to share repurchase, we expect to buy back $93 million this Q3. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2016.
We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $60 million, including $50 million due to currency. As a result, we're increasing our core revenue growth guidance at midpoint from 4.25% to 4.50%. We're also raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance by $0.06, including $0.03 coming from currency and $0.03 from operational performance. 
And one important note. After further review, we and our auditors have concluded to account for the Lasergen investment using the cost method of accounting. This means that we'll not book our share of Lasergen losses as previously communicated. 
Finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance from $650 million to $740 million, and there's no change to our CapEx guidance of $140 million. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

But pharma, for example, is also very strong in Europe. For your pharma question, overall, we are confident that we will continue to see pretty high growth in pharma for the remainder of this year. We target low double-digit growth for pharma. And looking into 2017, we think the pharma market will be -- continue to be strong for us, driven by 2 vectors. We see a continued demand in the replacement business. And as you probably know, we just launched -- at the analytical conference, we launched our new 1260 Infinity LC as an example, together with the Infinity lab consumables and servicing. And we think that will drive -- continue to drive a lot of good replacement for us in pharma. And then, we see also continued demand in the biopharma space that are looking for new solutions helping with these more complex molecules in terms of analysis, and we have a very comprehensive operating for that space as well."

What we looked at was with our growth rate that we've had over the first half of this year and as we looked into Q3 and Q4, and what I point to is a couple of things, Jonathan. First of all, tough compares and this is inclusive of a few onetime moves between quarters, which actually were driven by improvements of overall operations. So as Didier mentioned, we had this $50 million shift in Q2 of last year into Q3, which when we had our start-up issues with our new logistics center. So if you adjust for that, it gets you to about 3% growth. The other thing we saw happen in Q2 was we've been working really hard to improve the overall cycle time from the time a customer places order to actually it's installed and we can recognize the revenue. In Q2, we actually exceeded our expectations and we got there a lot faster than we had thought, and what that meant was we had a significant amount of revenue, probably $20 million to $25 million that came from Q3 into Q2 where initially we'd forecasted into the second -- third quarter. All in all, if you kind of take into account those things, you've got pretty -- more of a consistent kind of a growth scenario between Q2 and Q3. 
I would tell you, though, the chemical energy is still looking for a bottom. And that's why we have that outlook for the year, which basically is down -- it's going to stay down for the rest of the year. There are some signs that it could be getting better. But we have -- we're not convinced yet we've seen the bottom in chemical energy. So I think the combination of those tough compares as well as our outlook on chemical energy is what's driving the overall guidance for the second half."

There's still a lot of replacement pending out there. Just as a reminder, we have probably about 150,000 systems out there based on the 1100, 1200 platform, which over time will be up for replacement. And we are positioned extremely well with our platforms because it's 100% backwards compatible and we're also able, for example, to emulate some of our competitors' systems on our platform with a technology we call ISET, intelligence system emulation technology.

We saw good growth across the entire portfolio led by pharma and food markets in China, as you heard early. But I'd ask you to look at 2 things. One is this higher conversion of orders to revenue than forecast. So basically, what we've done is we reduced the cycle time and by our estimates, it happened a lot faster than we had thought, which I think is good news from the standpoint of operational efficiency; did create some forecasting challenges, but probably $20 million to $25 million came from Q3 into Q2. The other thing, I think, you should take a look at is the FX assumptions. So around $9 million or so, Didier, I think was the number. So FX added about another $9 million.

But in terms of the sales force integration and go-to-market -- we couldn't be happier. I mean, that was a major move we made last year, where we basically went from 5 sales forces to the 2 sales forces, one focused on the analytical laboratory marketplace and then the other one focused on the regulated diagnostic marketplace. At the time, I remember sharing with you, ""Hey, we're making a big change here and it could affect the top line and the short one. That didn't happen. In fact, I submit that as we go out into '16 and '17, we're now putting more resources of specialization in academia, in biopharma. So I think you're going to see the changes paying off in terms of our longer-term growth. So we're really happy with both the fact that we've got it all behind us, it's settled down and I think it's starting to pay off on the initial benefits that we envisioned when we created that structure. 
Relative to gross margin ERP, just keep in mind that what we've been talking about is a -- the financial systems, which really go into the SG&A line. So it really won't affect the gross margin. That being said, we do think we can do more on gross margins as we move forward in '16 and '17. I'll talk a little bit about -- more about in detail next week when we're in New York. But as you may know, on our initial 400 basis points of improvement, when I came onboard, we said half would come through OpEx and other operational costs, and then others through growth. And the growth piece would be -- a lot would be driven by our ability to capture the gross margin improvements on increased volume. So we think we still have room to improve our material cost, and we think that we've got room to continue to bring down our logistics costs."

So let me try to clarify here. So what we said was in this year, we thought our performance would be flat for the entire year, while in fact, it's going to be down, we probably think in the range of 2.5% for the year, for the entire year. And that is a change from our assumptions coming into this year. And that was the assumption we made at the time of our initial guidance, which makes our revenue results even much more -- we're really pleased with the results, given the fact that the chemical energy market has not developed the way we initially had thought. That being said, in '17, we actually think it will be improved, which means it won't be declining. And in fact, it will probably be flat or maybe low single digits. And why do we believe that? If you look at how our business breaks down in that segment, we often talk about the oil side. But 50% of our business historically has been in the exploration and another 35% has been in the refining. The other half, which is by far the biggest individual segment, is the chemical side, and they're benefiting by lower feedstock costs. They've got pent-up investment demands, and we're starting to see increased deal activity. So in fact, Patrick and I were talking about this, this morning and it kind of reminds me of pharma a few years ago where basically we were going to have 2 years of shrinking performance in this marketplace, a lot of pent-up demand. So long story short, our growth assumption for next year assumes low single-digit chemical energy growth for the year. Again, we still believe we're searching for the bottom. So -- and it's still early in the year of 2016. But that's our basic assumption for '17, which is an improved environment -- not dramatic, but improved from what we've seen over the last 24 months."

And maybe let me start with the last part of your question, which is the takeaway here, we do believe that there's a stable improvement. So in my mind or the language I use, this is the new normal in terms of our ability to convert orders to revenue. And so I would characterize this as new normal of how we're going to operate. So how did we get here and why do they look so significantly different in China? So first of all, it starts with looking at the entire process from an end-to-end customer perspective from the time of order placement till shipment until customer installation occurs -- and, as you know, when I restructured the company, I was really trying to break down the silos and we had a very silo-oriented approach to this end-to-end process from a customer perspective. In the company, we looked at each slice of the process but nobody was looking at the collective process for end-to-end. You start doing that, and then you start seeing where the issues are, the opportunities are. So we found ways to improve our order linearity. We've improved the quality of booked orders, and this really gets to your question about China. Often, you're dealing with letters of credit issues and other trade issues that in the past have delayed our ability to actually book them as clean orders and turn them into revenue. We call this delivery box. We've been working on making sure we had material availability. I think we hit one of our best quarters ever in terms of having material ready for all of our shipments. So we improved our ability to get in orders in a linear fashion, make sure those orders are clean and not have lot of rework, and then we've improved our delivery performance. And then spent a lot of time improving our efforts between shipment installation, which sometimes can go on for several weeks. So I think it all starts with this looking at the whole process from an end-to-end perspective, and the result has been a significant improvement in cycle time and orders turned into revenue more quickly than in the past. I do think this represents our new way of operating. And again, as I mentioned in my remarks, it did create some -- it did have implications of how we guide the company for the second and third quarter. But I think we're delighted to be able to actually have ongoing strong operational efficiency improvement in place so that we know how to predict revenue even better in the future."

We have a series of operational programs. We talked about one of those already, which is the implications of the ERP, and the continued focus on gross margin improvement, specifically material cost reductions and logistic savings. So I think the combination of those 3 factors plus with the overall quarter growth assumptions that we're currently modeling around 4.5 gets us to the 22%."

I think I'd have to agree with the comment, which is, I think it really is too soon to get overall excited about this from a U.S. spending. I've seen this before where the legislation is announced and there's a lot of fanfare about it. But they don't always get backed up by investments.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. Now let me highlight 3 key results. First, core -- Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was ab",1425,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. Now let me highlight 3 key results. First, core -- Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was above the high end of our May guidance. Second, EPS of $0.49 was also above the high end of our guidance of $0.45 to $0.47. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 20.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from a year ago. As for the third quarter results echo many of the the same themes we saw last quarter. The pharma, food, clinical and diagnostics end markets remain strong. In the chemical engineering market while demand for services and consumables was strong, capital expenditures for new equipment purchases remain challenged. Geographically, Asia, led by China's double-digit growth, drove Agilent third quarter core growth with strength across all business segments. 
Let me highlight our Q3 results by business group. In line with our expectations, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group core revenues were down 2%. Our strong growth in pharma, environmental food markets was offset by continued weakness in chemical energy capital expenditures. Academia and government revenues were also down across regions. Despite this mixed market environment, LSAG operating margin for the quarter was 19.1%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Let me shift gears and talk about some of LSAG's new products. We are seeing very strong demand the new release 1260 and the 1290 Infinity II LC systems. The 1260 systems are part of the launch of the Infinity lab portfolio and analytica in May. Infinity lab portfolio consists of this new line of LC instruments along with columns, supplies and services. In Q3, LSAG also introduced the new -- 2 new 7000 Series Triple Quad DCMS analyzers, one for pesticides and another one for environmental pollutants. And we continue to strengthen our a leadership with a new Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system. This new system offers customers improved speed and accuracy of analysis.
Turning to the Agilent CrossLab Group. The business delivered another strong quarter with 8% [ph] core revenue growth. This growth is driven by strength in the food, pharma and environmental markets. ACGs operating margin over the quarter was 22.7%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. Portfolio expansion efforts also continued at ACG. In Q3, Agilent signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of iLab, and we just closed the transaction in early August. iLab is the market leader in cloud-based solutions for core laboratory management and provide services to leading universities, research hospitals and independent institutions around the world. This acquisition further strengthens Agilent's academia and government markets. iLab enables Agilent to deliver value in this market segment. We also see an opportunity to expand the iLab business both geographically and into the pharma market.
Finally, we saw a continued momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group where the business delivered 8% [ph] core growth in Q3. We saw strength across all DGG business, driven by growth in the pharma and clinical and diagnostics market. Our pathology business continues on a steady trajectory of improved growth. This was highlighted by demand for our new PD-L1 companion diagnostics. Growth in genomics reflect a strong market performance in the U.S. and China across our array CGH target enrichment and SureSelect products. We also saw healthy demand for new clinic asset solutions offering. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 18.8%, up 200 basis points from a year ago. Q3 highlights for DGG with the announcement of an expense of a intended use of our PD-L1 pharma test in Europe for patients with melanoma. This test was proven in the U.S. and available in Europe for patients with nonsquamous, nonsmall lung cancer in the U.S. and patients with melanoma. We also announced a $120 million investment over the next 3 years to expand production capacity for our new clinic asset solutions business. This includes the purchase of 20 acres of land in Colorado. We plan to build a factory in this land that will double our manufacturing capacity for nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients and grow our business.
Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. In our Life Sciences market, pharma saw sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with core revenue up 10%. Academia and government core revenues were down 5%, down across most geographies except China. Clinical diagnostics grew 4% with strength in North America and Asia and led by growth in pathology. Applied end market performance was mixed was up 11% with strong demand in China and Americas. These regions also drove growth in environmental market for both instruments and aftermarket products. This performance was offset by a continued challenge in the chemical and energy market, down 4% globally with only Asia posting growth on a regional basis. The overall result was due to prolonged effects of the macroeconomic concerns and lower oil prices. 
Now I'll turn an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Q3 marked a major step in simplifying our company's infrastructure. In May, we completed the migration of the company's financial systems on to a single SAP platform. This was a culmination of a 20-month cross-company effort and represents a major step in simplifying Agilent's systems infrastructure that will deliver income cost savings as planned in fiscal 2017. In summary, our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to solidify the company's business processes. This program is designed to make us more nimble and lower our cost. It will continue to deliver incremental savings in 2017.
On the capital deployment front, we purchased iLab paid $37 million in dividends and repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock. We continue to deliver on our strategy to drive sustainable growth while expanding operating margins and balancing deployment of our capital to drive shareholder value creation. 
At our recent Minneapolis meeting, I described a shareholder value creation model: outgrow the market, expand operating markets, balance capital deployment. Let's look at our Q3 results in the context of these longer-term goals and shareholder value creation model. In 2015, we delivered our highest annual growth rate in 4 years while increasing operating margin of 170 basis points and completely offsetting the $40 million of de-synergies from the company split. We have sustained this trajectory of improved operating results in fiscal 2016. In the first 3 quarters of 2016, the team had delivered strong growth and earnings above our initial expectation despite a challenging chemical energy market environment and global macroeconomic concerns.
We have continued to leverage our balance sheet and deploy capital in a balanced matter, buying companies that are bringing new capabilities to Agilent while repurchasing our stock and increasing cash dividends. The new leadership team continues to transform the business and deliver results. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver above-industry organic growth while expanding margins and leveraging our balance sheet strength. Our Q3 results in a challenging global economic environment reflect the strength of our team combined with the Agilent's scale and broad differentiated portfolio of products and services. Looking at today's overall market environment, we expect continued strength in pharma, along with growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets and in China on a regional basis. As I highlighted in our last call, we experienced a steeper and more prolonged slowdown in the chemical and energy market than initially projected entering fiscal 2016. We subsequently revise our forecast for this market segment last quarter to overall low single-digit market declines for the year. While there are some signs of an impending [indiscernible] end market, we remain cautious in our outlook and expect Q4 to be in the similar range as the past quarter. Against this market drop, we are well positioned to capture growth in these end market segments and geographies where growth is expected to remain strong. The combination of our expanding our customer channel reach and our continued strength in our portfolio positions us well to achieve our previously raised full year guidance of 2016 and our longer-term goals. Our one Agilent team continues to work well together and is energized to win in the market. Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margin to 22%. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of 2016. Didier?"

Earnings per share grew 11% in the quarter versus a year ago. We also generated $194 million in operating cash flow, more than double last year's amounts, which gives us increased confidence that we'll achieve our previously raised operating cash flow guidance for the full year. FX had a negative impact on revenue of about $10 million or 1% versus previous guidance and $7 million or 0.7% versus last year. It had a negative impact on operating profit of $3 million versus previous guidance and $1 million versus last year.
I'll now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion and earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 1.2% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is estimated to have a negative impact of $9 million on revenue and $2 million on operating profit. Our 21.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 70 basis points sequentially.
Now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 4.5% on a core basis, no change from the previous guidance. Our earnings per share guidance of $1.90 at midpoint is also unchanged from previous guidance and corresponds to a 9% year-over-year increase.
Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 20.4 basis points or 80 basis points higher than in fiscal year '15. And finally, FX is estimated to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis of $68 million of revenue, $10 million on operating profit related to currency translation and an additional $21 million related to currency hedging. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

We did not see any material impact from those events in our performance in the third quarter. What I will say though is it an increased level of uncertainty amongst our customers in Europe, and we've seen the questions around when will budgets be released. So it's more of an uncertainty of question right out there people are just sort of wait and see out there to see how it's going to develop. Again, no material effect on the third quarter results. But as we thought about our guidance for the fourth quarter, obviously, it has influenced us to think about how will Europe developed through the quarter.

But we've got more demand that we can handle in terms of long-term outlook from our customers. So we can't bring on this capacity fast enough to satisfy the customer demand.

So first of all, a reminder that the nuclear gas solutions division is providing API that constitute any type of drugs with significant potential. These drugs are primarily right now opportunities within genetic diseases that today there's been no treatment and have devastating outcomes. And these drugs have the opportunity to change the expectancy all, you could say, the survival and also the quality of life for such patients. And we are working with the leaders in pharma the drugs again and again due to a deep technical experience to optimize all those performance and consistency combined with our ability to scale in GMP. We have seen a significant demand accelerated over the last few years. And as Mike mentioned, we're current expanding our current site to actually take up double capacity. But we also see that, that will run out -- that opportunity is really limited and will run out in a few years from now and that by the new investment in the new site will allow us to further double our capacity and even double again if we choose to do so. We have decided and based on a deep dive into the strategy and so on to place the site in close proximity to the other site approximately 20 minutes drive away from the highly-experienced staff that we already have an capabilities and processes. The overall market is in the hundreds of million dollar business right now, and it's growing somewhere between 20% to 30%.

And in fact, I -- perhaps will build on some of the comments that I made in my prepared remarks. But we're still -- we are still seeing ourselves in the same path that we talked about just a month or so ago in New York. It's actually 2 months ago when I think about it. But our position remains the same. We are still confident that we are going to be able to achieve the overall projected core growth of 4.5%. And there's some new -- there really are some new factors that support this level of growth. First of all, we've -- we have a rich pipeline of new product introductions coming in Q4 and in FY '17 on top of what we've already introduced this year. Now we think our customers are going to be real excited about what we're bringing to market, and that's going to help drive share. So we know we've got going through on the system right now with releases coming up in the several [ph] quarters on top of what will be done. The second thing, we also have recognized the fact that the Agilent business model has really changed a lot over the last 18 months or so. We have a lot more recurring revenue. And if you look at the ACG and DGG business, which now represent over half -- I think it's 52%, last time I did the math, of Agilent's revenue. These are just inherently much more predictable revenue streams and then you sign our Q3 results how both groups delivered high single-digit growth, and they're not subject the same types of issues we're seeing in the capital-intensive chemical energy market, for example. And then the third thing I'd say is when you think about our LSAG instrument business, in addition to the impact of the impacts I mentioned, we do expect that pharma and China market is going to remain significant growth drivers, although I think they will be below these double-digit levels we've seen in 2016. And as mentioned in our last call, we still expect that the chemical energy will have bottomed to by the end of calendar year 2017. We're not ready to -- sorry, excuse me, I got my ears confused there -- by the end of calendar year 2016, we're not ready to call bottom, but we do see in 2017 that we're forecasting that we could be in low single digits growth. In our markets, we just had 18 to 24 months of pent-up demand for equipment that supports the production process. So there are 3 factors that's going into our thinking as we have thought about the 2017's growth rate. Honestly, we'll give you the official guidance at our next call. But I would just reinforce our view today is that we're still on track to what we told you in May in New York."

And listen, we realized by not raising our core guidance for this year that this question could arise. But the way we look at it was, so listen, there was a raised level of uncertainty in the markets centered around Europe. And we saw some weak European government budgets in the third quarter. Is this going to continue? We've seen some downward revisions in terms of market overall economic forecast for Europe. So we're not really sure exactly how it's going to develop. So we just thought it's prudent to reflect some of this uncertainty by not raising it again the full year guidance. So that's how we thought about the process.

So what we've been focusing on our really 3 dimensions around what we call our value engineering programs, our logistics model and also our strategic procurement approach with our suppliers. And as I look at the results in '16, the program that is driving across this company is the biggest thing we've reached out so far in our improved logistics model. And you recall we talked about logistic cost as being problematic in 2015. That's no longer the case. In fact, we've benchmarked ourselves and we caught ourselves down to the best in our space. And there actually is more to come, which is the other 2 elements of the program are having a little bit more longer tail end terms of payoff, which is value reengineering when you're reengineer product platforms to ensure both the continuation of the high performance at a lower cost and then as we also continued to transform our supplier engagement model and how we leverage the scale of Agilent. So I think those -- of the latter 2 parts of the program carry us forward in the '17 and '18 beyond. So that's really how we work in the gross margin side. And by the way, this while your comments have been focused on the LSAG a lot of the logistics costs and and ACG business as well. And then relative to the SG&A, couple of things that you may recall I highlighted I would just emphasize again major focus on our systems infrastructure. So as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're now on one SAP systems a lot of our work on the financial team and taking a lot of our cost of the system. The next big wave will be when we move the company in 2017 where we can really start to leverage the scale and take out costs and have improved customer experience there. So there's a couple of big initiatives as well when we look at -- we're looking at other aspects of our benefit structures. We've made some changes. You may note earlier the U.S. pension plan and that the Agile Agilent program that I mentioned is live and we have a lot of initiatives underway to ensure that we can continue to take cost out while signifying the company. Didier, anything else you that?"

Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations.

I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. 
Now let me highlight 3 key results: First, core -- Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was above the high end of our May guidance. Second, EPS of $0.49 was also above the high end of our guidance of $0.45 to $0.47. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 20.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from a year ago. As the third quarter results echo many of the same themes that we saw last quarter, the pharma, food, clinical and diagnostics end markets remain strong. In the chemical engineering market, while demand for our services and consumables was strong, capital expenditures for new equipment purchases remain challenged. Geographically, Asia, led by China's double-digit growth, drove Agilent third quarter core growth with strength across all business segments. 
Let me highlight our Q3 results by business group. In line with our expectations, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group core revenues were down 2%. Our strong growth in pharma, environmental and food markets was offset by continued weakness in chemical and energy capital expenditures. Academia and government revenues were also down across most regions. Despite this mixed market environment, LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.1%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. 
Let me shift gears and talk about some of LSAG's new products. We are seeing very strong demand, the newly released 1260 and the 1290 Infinity II LC systems. The 1260 systems are part of the launch of the InfinityLab portfolio at Analytica in May. The InfinityLab portfolio consists of this new line of LC instruments along with columns, supplies and services. In Q3, LSAG also introduced the new -- 2 new 7000 Series Triple Quad GC/MS analyzers, one for pesticides and another  for environmental pollutants. And we continue to strengthen our ICP-MS market leadership with the new Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system. This new system offers customers improved speed and accuracy of analysis.
Turning to the Agilent CrossLab Group. The business delivered another strong quarter with 8% core revenue growth. This growth is driven by strength in the food, pharma and environmental markets. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. 
Portfolio expansion efforts also continued at ACG. In Q3, Agilent signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of iLab, and we just closed the transaction in early August. iLab is the market leader in cloud-based solutions for core laboratory management and provide services to leading universities, research hospitals and independent institutions around the world. This acquisition further expands Agilent's portfolio in the academia and government market. iLab enables Agilent to deliver broader value for our customers in this market segment. We also see an opportunity to expand the iLab business both geographically and into the pharma market.
Finally, we saw a continued momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group where the business delivered 8% core growth in Q3. We saw strength across all DGG businesses, driven by growth in the pharma and clinical and diagnostics market. Our pathology business continues on a steady trajectory of improved growth. This was highlighted by demand for our new PD-L1 companion diagnostics. Growth in genomics reflect a strong market performance in the U.S. and China across our Array CGH, Target Enrichment and SureSelect products. We also saw healthy demand for our new clinic assets solutions offering. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 18.8%, up 200 basis points from a year ago. 
Q3 highlights for DGG with the announcement of an expansion of the intended use of our PD-L1 pharmDX test in Europe for patients with melanoma. This test was previously proven in the U.S. and available in Europe for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer and in the U.S. with patients with melanoma. We also announced a $120 million investment over the next 3 years to expand production capacity for our new clinic assets solutions business. This includes the purchase of 20 acres of land in Colorado. We plan to build our factory on this land that will double our manufacturing capacity for nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients and grow our business.
Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. In our life sciences market, pharma saw its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with core revenue up 10%. Academia and government core revenues were down 5%, down across most geographies except China. Clinical and diagnostics grew 4% with strength in North America and Asia and led by growth in pathology. Applied end market performance was mixed. Food was up 11% with strong demand in China and the Americas. These regions also drove growth in environmental market for both instruments and aftermarket products. This performance was offset by continued challenges in the chemical and energy market, down 4% globally, with only Asia posting growth on a regional basis. The overall result was due to prolonged effects of the macroeconomic concerns and lower oil prices. 
Now I'll turn an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Q3 marked a major step forward in simplifying our company's infrastructure. In May, we completed the migration of the company's financial systems onto a single SAP platform. This was a culmination of a 20-month cross-company effort and represents a major step in simplifying Agilent's systems infrastructure that will deliver incremental cost savings as planned in fiscal 2017. 
In summary, our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company's business processes. This program is designed to make us more nimble and lower our costs. It will continue to deliver incremental savings in 2017.
On the capital deployment front, we purchased iLab, paid $37 million in dividends and repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock. We continue to deliver on our strategy to drive sustainable growth while expanding operating margins and balancing deployment of our capital to drive shareholder value creation. 
At our recent May Analyst Meeting, I described our shareholder value creation model: outgrow the market, expand operating margins, balance capital deployment. Let's look at our Q3 results in the context of these longer-term goals and shareholder value creation model. 
In 2015, we delivered our highest annual growth rate in 4 years while increasing adjusted operating margin of 170 basis points and completely offsetting the $40 million of dyssynergies from the company split. We have sustained this trajectory of improved operating results in fiscal 2016. In the first 3 quarters of 2016, the team had delivered strong growth and earnings above our initial expectation despite a challenging chemical and energy market environment and global macroeconomic concerns.
We have continued to leverage our balance sheet and deployed capital in a balanced manner, buying companies that are bringing new capabilities to Agilent while repurchasing our stock and increasing cash dividends. The new leadership team continues to transform the business and deliver results. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver above-industry organic growth while expanding margins and leveraging our balance sheet strength. Our Q3 results in a challenging global economic environment reflect the strength of our team combined with Agilent's scale and broad differentiated portfolio of products and services. Looking at today's overall market environment, we expect continued strength in pharma, along with growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets and in China on a regional basis. 
As I highlighted in our last call, we are experiencing a steeper and more prolonged slowdown in the chemical and energy market than initially projected entering fiscal 2016. We subsequently revised our forecast for this market segment last quarter to overall low single-digit market declines for the year. While there are some signs of an impending bottoming end market, we remain cautious in our outlook and expect Q4 to be in a similar range as the past quarter. Against this market drop, we are well positioned to capture growth in these end market segments and geographies where growth is expected to remain strong. The combination of our expanding our customer channel reach and continual strengthening of our portfolio positions us well to achieve our previously raised full year guidance of 2016 and our longer-term goals. Our One Agilent team continues to work well together and is energized to win in the market. Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margin to 22%. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of 2016. Didier?"

Earnings per share grew 11% in the quarter versus a year ago. We also generated $194 million in operating cash flow, more than double last year's amount, which gives us increased confidence that we'll achieve our previously raised operating cash flow guidance for the full year. FX had a negative impact on revenue of about $10 million or 1% versus previous guidance and $7 million or 0.7% versus last year. It had a negative impact on operating profit of $3 million versus previous guidance and $1 million versus last year.
I'll now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion and earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 1.2% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is estimated to have a negative impact of $9 million on revenue and $2 million on operating profit. Our 21.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 70 basis points sequentially.
Now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 4.5% on a core basis, no change from the previous guidance. Our earnings per share guidance of $1.90 at midpoint is also unchanged from previous guidance and corresponds to a 9% year-over-year increase. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 20.4 basis points or 80 basis points higher than in fiscal year '15. And finally, FX is estimated to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis of $68 million on revenue, $10 million on operating profit related to currency translation and an additional $21 million related to currency hedging. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

We did not see any material impact from those events in our performance in the third quarter. What I will say, though, it -- is -- raised an increased level of uncertainty amongst our customers in Europe, and we've seen the questions around when will budgets be released. So it's more of an uncertainty question right out there. People are just sort of wait and see how it's going to develop. Again, no material effect on the third quarter results. But as we thought about our guidance for the fourth quarter, obviously, it's influenced us to think about how will Europe develop through the quarter.

We still have capacity at the current site, but we've got a -- more demand than we can handle in terms of long-term outlook from our customers. So we can't bring on this capacity fast enough to satisfy the customer demand. We think this will be a bigger part of our growth story as we talk to you about 2017 and 2018.

So first of all, a reminder that the Nucleic Acid Solutions Division business out in Boulder is providing oligo APIs that constitute a new type of drugs with a significant potential. These drugs are primarily, right now, opportunities within orphan genetic diseases that today there has been no treatment and have devastating outcomes. And these drugs have actually the opportunity to change the expectancy of -- you could say the survival and also the quality of life for such patients. We are working with the leaders in pharma within these new type of drugs, and Agilent is chosen again and again due to our deep technical experience to optimize oligos for performance and consistency, combined with our ability to scale in DNP. We have seen a significant demand accelerated over the last few years. And as Mike mentioned, we're currently expanding our current site to actually take up double capacity. But we also see that, that will run out -- that opportunity is really limited and will run out in a few years from now; and thereby, the new investment in the new site will allow us to further double our capacity and even double again if we choose to do so. We have decided, and based on a deep dive into the strategy and so on, to place the site in close proximity to the other Boulder site at approximately 20 minutes drive away so we can releverage [ph] critical mass, high -- the highly experienced staff we already have and capabilities and processes. The overall market is in the hundreds of million dollar business right now, and it's growing somewhere between 20% to 30%. However, when you commercialize drugs -- when you get the commercialized drugs, this might be a significant step-ups, but we see a lot of demand right now just in the clinical trial studies."

And in fact, I, perhaps, will build on some of the comments I made in my prepared remarks. But we're still -- we are still seeing ourselves in the same path that we talked about just a month or so ago in New York. It actually was 2 months ago when I think about it, but our position remains the same. We are still confident we're going to be able to achieve the overall projected core growth of 4.5%. And there's some new -- there really are some new factors that, we think, support this level of growth. First of all, we've -- we have a rich pipeline of new product introductions coming in Q4 and in FY '17 on top of what we've already introduced this year. Now we think our customers are going to be really excited about what we're bringing to market, and that's going to help drive share. So we know we got this NPI [indiscernible] going through the system right now with releases coming up in several quarters on top of what we've done. The second thing, I -- we also have recognized the fact that the Agilent business model has really changed a lot over the last 18 months or so. We have a lot more recurring revenue. And if you look at the ACG and DGG business, which now represent over half -- I think it's 52% the last time I did the math, of Agilent's revenue. These are just inherently much more predictable revenue streams, and you saw in our Q3 results how both groups delivered high single-digit growth. And they're not subject to the same types of issues we're seeing in the capital-intensive chemical and energy market, for example. And then the third thing I'd say is when you think about our LSAG instrument business, in addition to the impact of these new product introductions I mentioned, we do expect that pharma and China market is going to remain significant growth drivers, although I think they will be below these double-digit levels we've seen in 2016.

As Mike mentioned earlier in his remarks, we definitely see very strong growth right now in the liquid chromatography business, which has been, for the entire year, double digits.

And now this year with the 1260 series with another big round of instrumentation and solutions in liquid chromatography, that is very well received by the end markets. We see very healthy replacement business as well, and it's driven by the fact that these solutions are 100% backwards compatible and also compatible with some of our competitors' instrumentations, which makes method transfer very simple and seamless for our customers. So -- and we project this cycle to continue for several more quarters. We don't see yet a loss of momentum. What we see, of course, is that they're getting now into quarters with tougher compare because we have double-digit growth for several quarters now. On the gas chromatography side, again, very strong portfolio as well. The issue we're seeing there is that the core market of one of the big markets for gas chromatography is the energy space. And that, of course, pull some of our results down at this point in time. If the market comes back, we think we are in an exceptional position to pick up this pent-up demand [indiscernible]."

I think we've got this increased confidence to achieve our previously raised core growth guidance for the year. And listen, we realized by not raising our core guidance for this year that this question could arise. But the way we look at that, so listen, there's a raised level uncertainty in the markets centered around Europe. And we saw some weak European government budgets in the third quarter. Is this going to continue? We've seen some downward revisions in terms of market overall economic forecast for Europe so really not sure exactly how it's going to develop. So we just thought it's prudent to reflect some of this uncertainty by not raising again the full year guidance. So that's how we thought about the process.

And you have to take into account, as Mike said, that this is based on only 1.2% top line growth. So a slight reduction in operating margin still very significant increase sequentially but slight reduction related to the one -- the assumption that we'd made on the top line growth of only 1.2%."

If we think about this by end market, it -- you actually have an easier compare in environmental forensics, academic, environment and food relative to certainly what you had in fiscal Q3. Diagnostics is a little tougher, but you have some real momentum there. So if we just kind of to make it simple assume all those end markets grow 3% to 5% and that chemical and energy is down mid-singles, it would imply that you guys are thinking pharma is only going to grow low single digits maybe at best in Q4. It's a tough compare in pharma in the quarter, but you've talked about continued strength in pharma in fiscal '17 in response to an earlier question. Again, recognizing the uncertainty you talked about in Europe, this is -- I guess some of this is hard to reconcile. Can you help out a little bit? And specifically again What, are you assuming for pharma in the quarter? Is that because of the compare? And what's your assumption growth for Europe growth in the quarter?"

So what we've been focusing on are really 3 dimensions around what we call our value-engineering program, our logistics model and also our strategic procurement approach with our suppliers. And as I look at the results in '16, the program that Henrik is driving across this company, I think we probably have seen the biggest impact so far in our improved logistics model. And you may recall we talked about logistics costs as being problematic in 2015. That's no longer the case. In fact, we've benchmarked ourselves, and we've got ourselves down to the best in our space. And there actually is more to come, which is the other 2 elements of the program have a little bit more longer tail in terms of payoff, which is value engineering when you're reengineering product platforms to ensure both the continuation of a high performance but a lower cost and then as we also continue to transform our supplier engagement model and how we leverage the scale of Agilent. So I think those latter 2 parts of the program are going to carry us forward into '17 and '18 beyond, so I think that's how we're really working the gross margin side. And by the way, I also -- one of your comments were focused on LSAG. A lot of logistics costs and some of these other factors I mentioned, procurement, show up as impacts on the DDG and ACG business as well. And then relative to the SG&A, couple of things that you may recall I highlighted in the Europe and I just reemphasize again, major focus on our systems infrastructure. So as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're now on one SAP instance, simplifying a lot of our work for our financial team and taking a lot of cost out of the system. The next big wave will be when we move the former Dako company into the Agilent environment in 2017 where we can really start to leverage the scale and take out costs and have improved customer experience there. So there's a couple of big initiatives as well as we look at -- we're looking at other aspects of our benefit structures. We've made some changes. You may know earlier that's where our U.S. pension plan and that the Agile Agilent program I mentioned is live. And we have a lot of initiatives underway to ensure that we can continue to take costs out while simplifying the company. Didier, anything else you would add to that?"

We think as they go through their budget justification processes and their budgets start in calendar 2017 that this is why we can say, ""Listen, the decline in this business after 18 to 24 months will start to turn,"" and we could see low single digits by the end of 2017 for the chemical and energy market.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. Now let me highlight 3 key results: First, core -- Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was",1442,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. 
Now let me highlight 3 key results: First, core -- Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was above the high end of our May guidance. Second, EPS of $0.49 was also above the high end of our guidance of $0.45 to $0.47. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 20.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from a year ago. 
Agilent's third quarter results echo many of the same themes that we saw last quarter. The pharma, food, clinical and diagnostics end markets remain strong. In the chemical and energy market, while demand for our services and consumables was strong, capital expenditures for new equipment purchases remain challenged. Geographically, Asia, led by China's double-digit growth, drove Agilent third quarter core growth with strength across all business segments. 
Let me highlight our Q3 results by business group. In line with our expectations, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group core revenues were down 2%. Our strong growth in pharma, environmental and food markets was offset by continued weakness in chemical and energy capital expenditures. Academia and government revenues were also down across most regions. Despite this mixed market environment, LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.1%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. 
Let me shift gears and talk about some of LSAG's new products. We are seeing very strong demand for the newly released 1260 and the 1290 Infinity II LC systems. The 1260 systems are part of the launch of the InfinityLab portfolio at Analytica in May. The InfinityLab portfolio consists of this new line of LC instruments along with columns, supplies and services. In Q3, LSAG also introduced the new -- 2 new 7000 Series Triple Quad GC/MS analyzers, one for pesticides and another for environmental pollutants. And we continued to strengthen our ICP-MS market leadership with the new Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system. This new system offers customers improved speed and accuracy of analysis.
Turning to the Agilent CrossLab Group. The business delivered another strong quarter with 8% core revenue growth. This growth is driven by strength in the food, pharma and environmental markets. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. 
Portfolio expansion efforts also continued in ACG. In Q3, Agilent signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of iLab, and we just closed the transaction in early August. iLab is the market leader in cloud-based solutions for core laboratory management and provide services to leading universities, research hospitals and independent institutions around the world. This acquisition further expands Agilent's portfolio in the academia and government market. iLab enables Agilent to deliver broader value for our customers in this market segment. We also see an opportunity to expand the iLab business both geographically and into the pharma market.
Finally, we saw a continued momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group where the business delivered 8% core growth in Q3. We saw strength across all DGG businesses, driven by growth in the pharma and clinical and diagnostics markets. Our pathology business continues on its steady trajectory of improved growth. This was highlighted by demand for our new PD-L1 companion diagnostics. Growth in Genomics reflect a strong market performance in the U.S. and China across our array CGH, Target Enrichment and SureSelect products. We also saw healthy demand for our Nucleic Acid Solutions offering. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 18.8%, up 200 basis points from a year ago. 
Q3 highlights for DGG include the announcement of an expansion of the intended use of our PD-L1 pharmDX test in Europe for patients with melanoma. This test was previously proven in the U.S. and available in Europe for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer and in the U.S. with patients -- for patients with melanoma. We also announced a $120 million investment over the next 3 years to expand production capacity for our Nucleic Acid Solutions business. This includes the purchase of 20 acres of land in Colorado. We plan to build our factory on this land that will double our manufacturing capacity for nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients and grow our business.
Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. In our life sciences market, pharma saw its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with core revenue up 10%. Academia and government core revenues were down 5%, down across most geographies except China. Clinical and diagnostics grew 4% with strength in North America and Asia and led by growth in pathology. 
Applied end-market performance was mixed. Food was up 11% with strong demand in China and the Americas. These regions also drove growth in the environmental market for both instruments and aftermarket products. 
This performance was offset by continued challenges in the chemical and energy market, down 4% globally, with only Asia posting growth on a regional basis. The overall result was due to prolonged effects of the macroeconomic concerns and lower oil prices. 
Now I'll turn an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Q3 marked a major step forward in simplifying our company's infrastructure. In May, we completed the migration of the company's financial systems onto a single SAP platform. This was a culmination of a 20-month cross-company effort and represents a major step in simplifying Agilent's systems infrastructure that will deliver incremental cost savings as planned in fiscal 2017. 
In summary, our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company's business processes. This program is designed to make us more nimble and lower our costs. It will continue to deliver incremental savings in 2017.
On the capital deployment front, we purchased iLab, paid $37 million in dividends and repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock. We continue to deliver on our strategy to drive sustainable growth while expanding operating margins and balancing deployment of our capital to drive shareholder value creation. 
At our recent May Analyst Meeting, I described our shareholder value creation model: outgrow the market; expand operating margins; balance capital deployment. Let's look at our Q3 results in the context of these longer-term goals and shareholder value creation model. 
In 2015, we delivered our highest annual growth rate in 4 years while increasing adjusted operating margin 170 basis points and completely offsetting the $40 million of dissynergies from the company split. We have sustained this trajectory of improved operating results in fiscal 2016. In the first 3 quarters of 2016, the team has delivered strong growth and earnings above our initial expectations despite a challenging chemical and energy market environment and global macroeconomic concerns.
We have continued to leverage our balance sheet and deployed capital in a balanced manner, buying companies that bring new capabilities to Agilent while repurchasing our stock and increasing cash dividends. 
The new leadership team continues to transform the business and deliver results. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver above-industry organic growth while expanding margins and leveraging our balance sheet strength. Our Q3 results in a challenging global economic environment reflect the strength of our team combined with Agilent's scale and broad differentiated portfolio of products and services. 
Looking at today's overall market environment, we expect continued strength in pharma, along with growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets and in China on a regional basis. 
As I highlighted in our last call, we are experiencing a steeper and more prolonged slowdown in the chemical and energy market than initially projected entering fiscal 2016. We subsequently revised our forecast for this market segment last quarter to overall low single-digit market declines for the year. While there are some signs of an impending bottom in the market, we remain cautious in our outlook and expect Q4 to be in a similar range as the past quarter. 
Against this market drop (sic) [backdrop], we are well positioned to capture growth in these end-market segments and geographies where growth is expected to remain strong. The combination of our expanding our customer channel reach and continual strengthening of our portfolio positions us well to achieve our previously raised full year guidance of 2016 and our longer-term goals. Our One Agilent team continues to work well together and is energized to win in the market. Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margin to 22%. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of 2016. Didier?"

I'll now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion and earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52. At the midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 1.2% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is estimated to have a negative impact of $9 million on revenue and $2 million on operating profit. Our 21.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 70 basis points sequentially.
Now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 4.5% on a core basis, no change from the previous guidance. Our earnings per share guidance of $1.90 at midpoint is also unchanged from previous guidance and corresponds to a 9% year-over-year increase. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 20.4 basis points or 80 basis points higher than in fiscal year '15. And finally, FX is estimated to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis of $68 million on revenue, $10 million on operating profit related to currency translation and an additional $21 million related to currency hedging. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

We did not see any material impact from those events in our performance in the third quarter. What I will say, though, it is raising an increased level of uncertainty amongst our customers in Europe, and we've seen the questions around when will budgets be released. So it's more of an uncertainty question right out there. People are just sort of waiting to see how it's going to develop. Again, no material effect on the third quarter results. But as we thought about our guidance for the fourth quarter, obviously, it's influenced us to think about how will Europe develop through the quarter.

We still have capacity at the current site, but we've got a -- more demand than we can handle in terms of long-term outlook from our customers. So we can't bring on this capacity fast enough to satisfy the customer demand. We think this will be a bigger part of our growth story as we talk to you about 2017 and 2018.

So first of all, a reminder that the Nucleic Acid Solutions Division business out in Boulder is providing oligo APIs that constitute a new type of drugs with a significant potential. These drugs are, primarily, right now, opportunities within orphan genetic diseases that today there has been no treatment and have devastating outcomes. And these drugs have actually the opportunity to change the expectancy of, you could say, the survival and also the quality of life for such patients. We are working with the leaders in pharma within these new type of drugs, and Agilent is chosen again and again due to our deep technical experience to optimize oligos for performance and consistency, combined with our ability to scale in DNP. We have seen a significant demand accelerated over the last few years. And as Mike mentioned, we're currently expanding our current site to actually take up double capacity. But we also see that, that will run out. That opportunity is really limited and will run out in a few years from now; and thereby, the new investment in the new site will allow us to further double our capacity and even double again if we choose to do so. We have decided, and based on a deep dive into the strategy and so on, to place the site in close proximity to the other Boulder site at approximately 20 minutes' drive away so we can releverage critical mass, high -- the highly experienced staff we already have and capabilities and processes. The overall market is in the hundreds of million dollar business right now, and it's growing something between 20% to 30%. However, when you commercialize drugs -- when you get the commercialized drugs, this might be a significant step-ups, but we see a lot of demand right now just in the clinical trial studies."

And in fact, I, perhaps, will build on some of the comments I made in my prepared remarks. But we're still -- we are still seeing ourselves on the same path that we talked about just a month or so ago in New York. I think it actually was 2 months ago when I think about it, but our position remains the same. We are still confident we're going to be able to achieve the overall projected core growth of 4.5%. And there's some new -- there really are some new factors that we think support this level of growth. First of all, we've -- we have a rich pipeline of new product introductions coming in Q4 and in FY '17, on top of what we've already introduced this year. We think our customers are going to be really excited about what we're bringing to market, and that's going to help drive share. So we know we got this NPI pipe going through the system right now with releases coming up in the several quarters on top of what we've done. The second thing, I -- we also have recognized the fact that the Agilent business model has really changed a lot over the last 18 months or so. We have a lot more recurring revenue. And if you look at the ACG and DGG business, which now represent over half, I think it's 52% the last time I did the math, of Agilent's revenue. These are just inherently much more predictable revenue streams, and you saw in our Q3 results how both groups delivered high single-digit growth. And they're not subject to the same types of issues we're seeing in the capital-intensive chemical and energy market, for example. And then the third thing I'd say is when you think about our LSAG instrument business, in addition to the impact of these new product introductions I mentioned, we do expect that pharma and China market is going to remain significant growth drivers, although I think they will be below these double-digit levels we've seen in 2016.

And now this year with the 1260 series with another big round of instrumentation and solutions in liquid chromatography, that is very well received by the end markets. We see very healthy replacement business as well, and it's driven by the fact that these solutions are 100% backwards compatible and also compatible with some of our competitors' instrumentations, which makes method transfer very simple and seamless for our customers. So -- and we project this cycle to continue for several more quarters. We don't see yet a loss of momentum. What we see, of course, is that we're getting now into quarters with tougher compare because we have double-digit growth for several quarters now. On the gas chromatography side, again, very strong portfolio as well. The issue we're seeing there is that the core market or one of the big markets for gas chromatography is the energy space.

As you heard on our call, first of all, we're quite pleased with the higher-than-guided core revenue growth that we delivered for Q3 after having raised last -- in last call. And I think we've got this increased confidence to achieve our previously raised core growth guidance for the year. And listen, we realize by not raising our core guidance for this year that this question could arise. But the way we looked at it, we said, listen, there's a raised level uncertainty in the markets centered around Europe. And we saw some weak European government budgets in the third quarter. Is this going to continue? We've seen some downward revisions in terms of market overall economic forecasts for Europe, so we're really not sure exactly how it's going to develop. So we just thought it's prudent to reflect some of this uncertainty by not raising again the full year guidance. So that's how we thought about the process. We really didn't look over the years sequentially. We do know that last year, though, I said I don't like the tough compare argument, we did have a blowout fourth quarter last year.

Now, you are absolutely correct that, that would mean that 50 basis points reduction from the significant operating margin we had in Q4 of last year of 21.5%, still a significant 70 basis point sequential improvement.

So what we've been focusing on are really 3 dimensions around what we call our value-engineering program, our logistics model and also our strategic procurement approach with our suppliers. And as I look at the results in '16, the program that Henrik is driving across this company, I think we probably have seen the biggest impact so far in our improved logistics model. And you may recall we talked about logistics costs as being problematic in 2015. That's no longer the case. In fact, we've benchmarked ourselves, and we've got ourselves down to the best in our space. And there actually is more to come, which is the other 2 elements of the program have a little bit more longer tail in terms of payoff, which is value engineering, when you're reengineering product platforms to ensure both the continuation of the high performance but at a lower cost. And then as we also continue to transform our supplier engagement model and how we leverage the scale of Agilent. So I think those latter 2 parts of the program are going to carry us forward into '17 and '18 beyond, so I think that's how we're really working the gross margin side. And by the way, I also [indiscernible] of your comments were focused on LSAG. A lot of logistics costs and some of these other factors I mentioned, procurement, show up as impacts on the DDG and ACG business as well. And then relative to the SG&A, a couple of things that you may recall I highlighted in New York and I just reemphasize again, major focus on our systems infrastructure. So as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're now on one SAP instance, simplifying a lot of our work for our financial team and taking a lot of cost out of the system. The next big wave will be when we move the former Dako company into the Agilent environment in 2017 where we can really start to leverage the scale and take out costs and have an improved customer experience there. So there's a couple of big initiatives as well as we look at -- we're looking at other aspects of our benefit structure as we made some change, as you may know, earlier to our U.S. pension plan and the Agile Agilent program I mentioned is live. And we have a lot of initiatives underway to ensure that we can continue to take costs out while simplifying the company. Didier, anything else you would add to that?"

I'm not sure why that may be the case, but -- and that really will be the next big step to move the former Dako company into the Agilent environment. And it will take a little bit of while to get the cost out, but as you go -- as you think about exiting '17, you're going to have a much lower SG&A spend than you started the year.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations.

I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. 
Now let me highlight 3 key results: First, core -- Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was above the high end of our May guidance. Second, EPS of $0.49 was also above the high end of our guidance of $0.45 to $0.47. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 20.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from a year ago. 
Agilent's third quarter results echo many of the same themes that we saw last quarter. The pharma, food, clinical and diagnostics end markets remain strong. In the chemical and energy market, while demand for our services and consumables was strong, capital expenditures for new equipment purchases remain challenged. Geographically, Asia, led by China's double-digit growth, drove Agilent third quarter core growth with strength across all business segments. 
Let me highlight our Q3 results by business group. In line with our expectations, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group core revenues were down 2%. Our strong growth in pharma, environmental and food markets was offset by continued weakness in chemical and energy capital expenditures. Academia and government revenues were also down across most regions. Despite this mixed market environment, LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.1%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. 
Let me shift gears and talk about some of LSAG's new products. We are seeing very strong demand for the newly released 1260 and the 1290 Infinity II LC systems. The 1260 systems are part of the launch of the InfinityLab portfolio at Analytica in May. The InfinityLab portfolio consists of this new line of LC instruments along with columns, supplies and services. In Q3, LSAG also introduced the new -- 2 new 7000 Series Triple Quad GC/MS analyzers, one for pesticides and another for environmental pollutants. And we continued to strengthen our ICP-MS market leadership with the new Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system. This new system offers customers improved speed and accuracy of analysis.
Turning to the Agilent CrossLab Group. The business delivered another strong quarter with 8% core revenue growth. This growth is driven by strength in the food, pharma and environmental markets. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. 
Portfolio expansion efforts also continued in ACG. In Q3, Agilent signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of iLab, and we just closed the transaction in early August. iLab is the market leader in cloud-based solutions for core laboratory management and provide services to leading universities, research hospitals and independent institutions around the world. This acquisition further expands Agilent's portfolio in the academia and government market. iLab enables Agilent to deliver broader value for our customers in this market segment. We also see an opportunity to expand the iLab business both geographically and into the pharma market.
Finally, we saw a continued momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group where the business delivered 8% core growth in Q3. We saw strength across all DGG businesses, driven by growth in the pharma and clinical and diagnostics markets. Our pathology business continues on its steady trajectory of improved growth. This was highlighted by demand for our new PD-L1 companion diagnostics. Growth in Genomics reflect a strong market performance in the U.S. and China across our array CGH, Target Enrichment and SureSelect products. We also saw healthy demand for our Nucleic Acid Solutions offering. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 18.8%, up 200 basis points from a year ago. 
Q3 highlights for DGG include the announcement of an expansion of the intended use of our PD-L1 pharmDX test in Europe for patients with melanoma. This test was previously proven in the U.S. and available in Europe for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer and in the U.S. with patients -- for patients with melanoma. We also announced a $120 million investment over the next 3 years to expand production capacity for our Nucleic Acid Solutions business. This includes the purchase of 20 acres of land in Colorado. We plan to build our factory on this land that will double our manufacturing capacity for nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients and grow our business.
Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. In our life sciences market, pharma saw its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with core revenue up 10%. Academia and government core revenues were down 5%, down across most geographies except China. Clinical and diagnostics grew 4% with strength in North America and Asia and led by growth in pathology. 
Applied end-market performance was mixed. Food was up 11% with strong demand in China and the Americas. These regions also drove growth in the environmental market for both instruments and aftermarket products. 
This performance was offset by continued challenges in the chemical and energy market, down 4% globally, with only Asia posting growth on a regional basis. The overall result was due to prolonged effects of the macroeconomic concerns and lower oil prices. 
Now I'll turn an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Q3 marked a major step forward in simplifying our company's infrastructure. In May, we completed the migration of the company's financial systems onto a single SAP platform. This was a culmination of a 20-month cross-company effort and represents a major step in simplifying Agilent's systems infrastructure that will deliver incremental cost savings as planned in fiscal 2017. 
In summary, our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company's business processes. This program is designed to make us more nimble and lower our costs. It will continue to deliver incremental savings in 2017.
On the capital deployment front, we purchased iLab, paid $37 million in dividends and repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock. We continue to deliver on our strategy to drive sustainable growth while expanding operating margins and balancing deployment of our capital to drive shareholder value creation. 
At our recent May Analyst Meeting, I described our shareholder value creation model: outgrow the market; expand operating margins; balance capital deployment. Let's look at our Q3 results in the context of these longer-term goals and shareholder value creation model. 
In 2015, we delivered our highest annual growth rate in 4 years while increasing adjusted operating margin 170 basis points and completely offsetting the $40 million of dissynergies from the company split. We have sustained this trajectory of improved operating results in fiscal 2016. In the first 3 quarters of 2016, the team has delivered strong growth and earnings above our initial expectations despite a challenging chemical and energy market environment and global macroeconomic concerns.
We have continued to leverage our balance sheet and deployed capital in a balanced manner, buying companies that bring new capabilities to Agilent while repurchasing our stock and increasing cash dividends. 
The new leadership team continues to transform the business and deliver results. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver above-industry organic growth while expanding margins and leveraging our balance sheet strength. Our Q3 results in a challenging global economic environment reflect the strength of our team combined with Agilent's scale and broad differentiated portfolio of products and services. 
Looking at today's overall market environment, we expect continued strength in pharma, along with growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets and in China on a regional basis. 
As I highlighted in our last call, we are experiencing a steeper and more prolonged slowdown in the chemical and energy market than initially projected entering fiscal 2016. We subsequently revised our forecast for this market segment last quarter to overall low single-digit market declines for the year. While there are some signs of an impending bottom in the market, we remain cautious in our outlook and expect Q4 to be in a similar range as the past quarter. 
Against this market drop (sic) [backdrop], we are well positioned to capture growth in these end-market segments and geographies where growth is expected to remain strong. The combination of our expanding our customer channel reach and continual strengthening of our portfolio positions us well to achieve our previously raised full year guidance of 2016 and our longer-term goals. Our One Agilent team continues to work well together and is energized to win in the market. Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margin to 22%. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of 2016. Didier?"

Earnings per share grew 11% in the quarter versus a year ago. We also generated $194 million in operating cash flow, more than double last year's amount, which gives us increased confidence that we will achieve our previously raised operating cash flow guidance for the full year. FX had a negative impact on revenue of about $10 million or 1% versus previous guidance and $7 million or 0.7% versus last year. It had a negative impact on operating profit of $3 million versus previous guidance and $1 million versus last year.
I'll now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion and earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52. At the midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 1.2% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is estimated to have a negative impact of $9 million on revenue and $2 million on operating profit. Our 21.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 70 basis points sequentially.
Now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 4.5% on a core basis, no change from the previous guidance. Our earnings per share guidance of $1.90 at midpoint is also unchanged from previous guidance and corresponds to a 9% year-over-year increase. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 20.4 basis points or 80 basis points higher than in fiscal year '15. And finally, FX is estimated to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis of $68 million on revenue, $10 million on operating profit related to currency translation and an additional $21 million related to currency hedging. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

So it's more of an uncertainty question right out there. People are just sort of waiting to see how it's going to develop. Again, no material effect on the third quarter results.

We still have capacity at the current site, but we've got a -- more demand than we can handle in terms of long-term outlook from our customers. So we can't bring on this capacity fast enough to satisfy the customer demand. We think this will be a bigger part of our growth story as we talk to you about 2017 and 2018.

These drugs are, p",317,"Yes, let me try to provide a little more color there. So first of all, a reminder that the Nucleic Acid Solutions Division business out in Boulder is providing oligo APIs that constitute a new type of drugs with a significant potential. These drugs are, primarily, right now, opportunities within orphan genetic diseases that today there has been no treatment and have devastating outcomes. And these drugs have actually the opportunity to change the expectancy of, you could say, the survival and also the quality of life for such patients. We are working with the leaders in pharma within these new type of drugs, and Agilent is chosen again and again due to our deep technical experience to optimize oligos for performance and consistency, combined with our ability to scale in DNP. We have seen a significant demand accelerated over the last few years. And as Mike mentioned, we're currently expanding our current site to actually take up double capacity. But we also see that, that will run out. That opportunity is really limited and will run out in a few years from now; and thereby, the new investment in the new site will allow us to further double our capacity and even double again if we choose to do so. We have decided, and based on a deep dive into the strategy and so on, to place the site in close proximity to the other Boulder site at approximately 20 minutes' drive away so we can releverage critical mass, high -- the highly experienced staff we already have and capabilities and processes. The overall market is in the hundreds of million dollar business right now, and it's growing something between 20% to 30%. However, when you commercialize drugs -- when you get the commercialized drugs, this might be a significant step-ups, but we see a lot of demand right now just in the clinical trial studies."

Jonathan, I'd be happy to share my thoughts here. And in fact, I, perhaps, will build on some of the comments I made in my prepared remarks. But we're still -- we are still seeing ourselves on the same path that we talked about just a month or so ago",386,"Yes. Jonathan, I'd be happy to share my thoughts here. And in fact, I, perhaps, will build on some of the comments I made in my prepared remarks. But we're still -- we are still seeing ourselves on the same path that we talked about just a month or so ago in New York. I think it actually was 2 months ago when I think about it, but our position remains the same. We are still confident we're going to be able to achieve the overall projected core growth of 4.5%. And there's some new -- there really are some new factors that we think support this level of growth. First of all, we've -- we have a rich pipeline of new product introductions coming in Q4 and in FY '17, on top of what we've already introduced this year. We think our customers are going to be really excited about what we're bringing to market, and that's going to help drive share. So we know we got this NPI pipe going through the system right now with releases coming up in the several quarters on top of what we've done. The second thing, I -- we also have recognized the fact that the Agilent business model has really changed a lot over the last 18 months or so. We have a lot more recurring revenue. And if you look at the ACG and DGG business, which now represent over half, I think it's 52% the last time I did the math, of Agilent's revenue. These are just inherently much more predictable revenue streams, and you saw in our Q3 results how both groups delivered high single-digit growth. And they're not subject to the same types of issues we're seeing in the capital-intensive chemical and energy market, for example. And then the third thing I'd say is when you think about our LSAG instrument business, in addition to the impact of these new product introductions I mentioned, we do expect that pharma and China market is going to remain significant growth drivers, although I think they will be below these double-digit levels we've seen in 2016.

As Mike mentioned earlier in his remarks, we definitely see very strong growth right now in the liquid chromatography business, which has been, for the entire year, double digits.

And now this year with the 1260 series with another big round of instrumentation and solutions in liquid chromatography, that is very well received by the end markets. We see very healthy replacement business as well, and it's driven by the fact that these solutions are 100% backwards compatible and also compatible with some of our competitors' instrumentations, which makes method transfer very simple and seamless for our customers. So -- and we project this cycle to continue for several more quarters. We don't see yet a loss of momentum. What we see, of course, is that we're getting now into quarters with tougher compare because we have double-digit growth for several quarters now. On the gas chromatography side, again, very strong portfolio as well. The issue we're seeing there is that the core market or one of the big markets for gas chromatography is the energy space.

So we maintain our core revenue growth assumption of 4.5% and our operating margin assumption of 20.4%. Now, you are absolutely correct that, that would mean that 50 basis points reduction from the significant operating margin we had in Q4 of last year of 21.5%, still a significant 70 basis point sequential improvement. And you have to take into account, as Mike said, that this is based on only 1.2% top line growth.

Diagnostics is a little tougher, but you have some real momentum there. So if we just, kind of to make it simple, assume all those end markets grow 3% to 5% and that chemical and energy is down mid-singles, it would imply that you guys are thinking pharma is only going to grow low single digits maybe at best in Q4. It's a tough compare in pharma in the quarter, but you've talked about continued strength in pharma in fiscal '17 in response to an earlier question. Again, recognizing the uncertainty you talked about in Europe, this is -- I guess some of this is hard to reconcile. Can you help out a little bit?

So what we've been focusing on are really 3 dimensions around what we call our value-engineering program, our logistics model and also our strategic procurement approach with our suppliers. And as I look at the results in '16, the program that Henrik is driving across this company, I think we probably have seen the biggest impact so far in our improved logistics model. And you may recall we talked about logistics costs as being problematic in 2015. That's no longer the case. In fact, we've benchmarked ourselves, and we've got ourselves down to the best in our space. And there actually is more to come, which is the other 2 elements of the program have a little bit more longer tail in terms of payoff, which is value engineering, when you're reengineering product platforms to ensure both the continuation of the high performance but at a lower cost. And then as we also continue to transform our supplier engagement model and how we leverage the scale of Agilent. So I think those latter 2 parts of the program are going to carry us forward into '17 and '18 beyond, so I think that's how we're really working the gross margin side. And by the way, I also [indiscernible] of your comments were focused on LSAG. A lot of logistics costs and some of these other factors I mentioned, procurement, show up as impacts on the DDG and ACG business as well. And then relative to the SG&A, a couple of things that you may recall I highlighted in New York and I just reemphasize again, major focus on our systems infrastructure. So as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're now on one SAP instance, simplifying a lot of our work for our financial team and taking a lot of cost out of the system. The next big wave will be when we move the former Dako company into the Agilent environment in 2017 where we can really start to leverage the scale and take out costs and have an improved customer experience there. So there's a couple of big initiatives as well as we look at -- we're looking at other aspects of our benefit structure as we made some change, as you may know, earlier to our U.S. pension plan and the Agile Agilent program I mentioned is live. And we have a lot of initiatives underway to ensure that we can continue to take costs out while simplifying the company. Didier, anything else you would add to that?"

So that's why I made a few comments about it earlier because as we said, if we can be in a 4.5%, 5% kind of growth range, perhaps even low 4%, it makes it a little bit more challenging. But we can see -- we see the path to 22%. It's not just around margins. I mean, especially not just around margin improvement from volume. But there are specific real programs. It's something we review once a month, then we have active programs, and the costs will continue to come out on some of these big programs. Actually, I must say I'm really pleased with the team because we've -- we went through and did the -- we call project Nunu [ph] is the finance program we just finished up. And then right on the heels of that, we're going to go live in early '17 with our integration of Dako. So the teams are still energized and working hard, and I think these are going to have a material impact on our results in '17. And that's why we have confidence about the -- assuming no major change in terms of the macro environment that we can reach what we think are pretty challenging goals, but they're -- we've got a path to get there."

And chemical and energy has got to turn at some point in time because the market requires these tools to support production. Our thinking is when we look at chemical and energy is we know our customers are looking for productivity improvements to help improve their company profitability. We think that's a value proposition that Agilent has. We think as they go through their budget justification processes and their budgets start in calendar 2017, that this is why we can say, ""Listen, the decline in this business after 18 to 24 months will start to turn,"" and we could see low single digits by the end of 2017 for the chemical and energy market.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. Now let me highlight 3 key results: First, core -- Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was",1444,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. 
Now let me highlight 3 key results: First, core -- Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was above the high end of our May guidance. Second, EPS of $0.49 was also above the high end of our guidance of $0.45 to $0.47. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 20.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from a year ago. 
As for the third quarter results echo many of the same themes that we saw last quarter, the pharma, food, clinical and diagnostics end markets remain strong. In the chemical and energy market, while demand for our services and consumables was strong, capital expenditures for new equipment purchases remain challenged. Geographically, Asia, led by China's double-digit growth, drove Agilent third quarter core growth with strength across all business segments. 
Let me highlight our Q3 results by business group. In line with our expectations, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group core revenues were down 2%. Our strong growth in pharma, environmental and food markets was offset by continued weakness in chemical and energy capital expenditures. Academia and government revenues were also down across most regions. Despite this mixed market environment, LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.1%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. 
Let me shift gears and talk about some of LSAG's new products. We are seeing very strong demand, the newly released 1260 and the 1290 Infinity II LC systems. The 1260 systems are part of the launch of the InfinityLab portfolio at Analytica in May. The InfinityLab portfolio consists of this new line of LC instruments along with columns, supplies and services. In Q3, LSAG also introduced the new -- 2 new 7000 Series Triple Quad GC/MS analyzers, one for pesticides and another for environmental pollutants. And we continue to strengthen our ICP-MS market leadership with the new Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system. This new system offers customers improved speed and accuracy of analysis.
Turning to the Agilent CrossLab Group. The business delivered another strong quarter with 8% core revenue growth. This growth is driven by strength in the food, pharma and environmental markets. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. 
Portfolio expansion efforts also continued in ACG. In Q3, Agilent signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of iLab, and we just closed the transaction in early August. iLab is the market leader in cloud-based solutions for core laboratory management and provide services to leading universities, research hospitals and independent institutions around the world. This acquisition further expands Agilent's portfolio in the academia and government market. iLab enables Agilent to deliver broader value for our customers in this market segment. We also see an opportunity to expand the iLab business both geographically and into the pharma market.
Finally, we saw a continued momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group where the business delivered 8% core growth in Q3. We saw strength across all DGG businesses, driven by growth in the pharma and clinical and diagnostics market. Our pathology business continues on a steady trajectory of improved growth. This was highlighted by demand for our new PD-L1 companion diagnostics. Growth in genomics reflect a strong market performance in the U.S. and China across our Array CGH, Target Enrichment and SureSelect products. We also saw healthy demand for our Nucleic Acid Solutions offering. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 18.8%, up 200 basis points from a year ago. 
Q3 highlights for DGG include the announcement of an expansion of the intended use of our PD-L1 pharmDX test in Europe for patients with melanoma. This test was previously proven in the U.S. and available in Europe for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer and in the U.S. with patients -- for patients with melanoma. We also announced a $120 million investment over the next 3 years to expand production capacity for our Nucleic Acid Solutions business. This includes the purchase of 20 acres of land in Colorado. We plan to build our factory on this land that will double our manufacturing capacity for nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients and grow our business.
Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. In our life sciences market, pharma saw its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with core revenue up 10%. Academia and government core revenues were down 5%, down across most geographies except China. Clinical and diagnostics grew 4% with strength in North America and Asia and led by growth in pathology. 
Applied end-market performance was mixed. Food was up 11% with strong demand in China and the Americas. These regions also drove growth in environmental market for both instruments and aftermarket products. 
This performance was offset by continued challenges in the chemical and energy market, down 4% globally, with only Asia posting growth on a regional basis. The overall result was due to prolonged effects of the macroeconomic concerns and lower oil prices. 
Now I'll turn an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Q3 marked a major step forward in simplifying our company's infrastructure. In May, we completed the migration of the company's financial systems onto a single SAP platform. This was a culmination of a 20-month cross-company effort and represents a major step in simplifying Agilent's systems infrastructure that will deliver incremental cost savings as planned in fiscal 2017. 
In summary, our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company's business processes. This program is designed to make us more nimble and lower our costs. It will continue to deliver incremental savings in 2017.
On the capital deployment front, we purchased iLab, paid $37 million in dividends and repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock. We continue to deliver on our strategy to drive sustainable growth while expanding operating margins and balancing deployment of our capital to drive shareholder value creation. 
At our recent May Analyst Meeting, I described our shareholder value creation model: outgrow the market, expand operating margins, balance capital deployment. Let's look at our Q3 results in the context of these longer-term goals and shareholder value creation model. 
In 2015, we delivered our highest annual growth rate in 4 years while increasing adjusted operating margin 170 basis points and completely offsetting the $40 million of dissynergies from the company split. We have sustained this trajectory of improved operating results in fiscal 2016. In the first 3 quarters of 2016, the team has delivered strong growth and earnings above our initial expectation despite a challenging chemical and energy market environment and global macroeconomic concerns.
We have continued to leverage our balance sheet and deployed capital in a balanced manner, buying companies that bring new capabilities to Agilent while repurchasing our stock and increasing cash dividends. 
The new leadership team continues to transform the business and deliver results. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver above-industry organic growth while expanding margins and leveraging our balance sheet strength. Our Q3 results in a challenging global economic environment reflect the strength of our team combined with Agilent's scale and broad differentiated portfolio of products and services. 
Looking at today's overall market environment, we expect continued strength in pharma, along with growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets and in China on a regional basis. 
As I highlighted in our last call, we are experiencing a steeper and more prolonged slowdown in the chemical and energy market than initially projected entering fiscal 2016. We subsequently revised our forecast for this market segment last quarter to overall low single-digit market declines for the year. While there are some signs of an impending bottom in the market, we remain cautious in our outlook and expect Q4 to be in a similar range as the past quarter. 
Against this market drop (sic) [ backdrop ], we are well positioned to capture growth in these end-market segments and geographies where growth is expected to remain strong. The combination of our expanding our customer channel reach and continual strengthening of our portfolio positions us well to achieve our previously raised full year guidance of 2016 and our longer-term goals. Our One Agilent team continues to work well together and is energized to win in the market. Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margin to 22%. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of 2016. Didier?"

Earnings per share grew 11% in the quarter versus a year ago. We also generated $194 million in operating cash flow, more than double last year's amount, which gives us increased confidence that we will achieve our previously raised operating cash flow guidance for the full year. FX had a negative impact on revenue of about $10 million or 1% versus previous guidance and $7 million or 0.7% versus last year. It had a negative impact on operating profit of $3 million versus previous guidance and $1 million versus last year.
I'll now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion and earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 1.2% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is estimated to have a negative impact of $9 million on revenue and $2 million on operating profit. Our 21.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 70 basis points sequentially.
Now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 4.5% on a core basis, no change from the previous guidance. Our earnings per share guidance of $1.90 at midpoint is also unchanged from previous guidance and corresponds to a 9% year-over-year increase. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 20.4 basis points or 80 basis points higher than in fiscal year '15. And finally, FX is estimated to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis of $68 million on revenue, $10 million on operating profit related to currency translation and an additional $21 million related to currency hedging. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

We did not see any material impact from those events in our performance in the third quarter. What I will say, though, it is raising an increased level of uncertainty amongst our customers in Europe, and we've seen the questions around when will budgets be released. So it's more of an uncertainty question right out there. People are just sort of waiting to see how it's going to develop. Again, no material effect on the third quarter results. But as we thought about our guidance for the fourth quarter, obviously, it's influenced us to think about how will Europe develop through the quarter. And Patrick, I know you had a pretty deep conversation about this yesterday. So any additional thoughts you'd like to add?"

We still have capacity at the current site, but we've got a -- more demand than we can handle in terms of long-term outlook from our customers. So we can't bring on this capacity fast enough to satisfy the customer demand. We think this will be a bigger part of our growth story as we talk to you about 2017 and 2018.

So first of all, a reminder that the Nucleic Acid Solutions Division business out in Boulder is providing oligo APIs that constitute a new type of drugs with a significant potential. These drugs are primarily, right now, opportunities within orphan genetic diseases that today there has been no treatment and have devastating outcomes. And these drugs have actually the opportunity to change the expectancy of, you could say the survival and also the quality of life for such patients. We are working with the leaders in pharma within these new type of drugs, and Agilent is chosen again and again due to our deep technical experience to optimize oligos for performance and consistency, combined with our ability to scale in DNP. We have seen a significant demand accelerated over the last few years. And as Mike mentioned, we're currently expanding our current site to actually take up double capacity. But we also see that, that will run out. That opportunity is really limited and will run out in a few years from now; and thereby, the new investment in the new site will allow us to further double our capacity and even double again if we choose to do so. We have decided, and based on a deep dive into the strategy and so on, to place the site in close proximity to the other Boulder site at approximately 20 minutes' drive away so we can releverage critical mass, high -- the highly experienced staff we already have and capabilities and processes. The overall market is in the hundreds of million dollar business right now, and it's growing something between 20% to 30%. However, when you commercialize drugs -- when you get the commercialized drugs, this might be a significant step-ups, but we see a lot of demand right now just in the clinical trial studies."

And in fact, I, perhaps, will build on some of the comments I made in my prepared remarks. But we're still -- we are still seeing ourselves on the same path that we talked about just a month or so ago in New York. I think it actually was 2 months ago when I think about it, but our position remains the same. We are still confident we're going to be able to achieve the overall projected core growth of 4.5%. And there's some new -- there really are some new factors that we think support this level of growth. First of all, we've -- we have a rich pipeline of new product introductions coming in Q4 and in FY '17 on top of what we've already introduced this year. We think our customers are going to be really excited about what we're bringing to market, and that's going to help drive share. So we know we got this NPI pipe going through the system right now with releases coming up in the several quarters on top of what we've done. The second thing, I -- we also have recognized the fact that the Agilent business model has really changed a lot over the last 18 months or so. We have a lot more recurring revenue. And if you look at the ACG and DGG business, which now represent over half, I think it's 52% the last time I did the math, of Agilent's revenue. These are just inherently much more predictable revenue streams, and you saw in our Q3 results how both groups delivered high single-digit growth. And they're not subject to the same types of issues we're seeing in the capital-intensive chemical and energy market, for example. And then the third thing I'd say is when you think about our LSAG instrument business, in addition to the impact of these new product introductions I mentioned, we do expect that pharma and China market is going to remain significant growth drivers, although I think they will be below these double-digit levels we've seen in 2016.

And now this year with the 1260 series with another big round of instrumentation and solutions in liquid chromatography, that is very well received by the end markets. We see very healthy replacement business as well, and it's driven by the fact that these solutions are 100% backwards compatible and also compatible with some of our competitors' instrumentations, which makes method transfer very simple and seamless for our customers. So -- and we project this cycle to continue for several more quarters. We don't see yet a loss of momentum. What we see, of course, is that we're getting now into quarters with tougher compare because we have double-digit growth for several quarters now. On the gas chromatography side, again, very strong portfolio as well. The issue we're seeing there is that the core market or one of the big markets for gas chromatography is the energy space.

I also think you may be hearing a more positive spin on the U.S. environment because of many of our competitors have much more business coming from NIH. So there's a lot of positive view of the NIH budget, but we pick up a relatively small piece of that overall budget. The agencies where we do a lot of our business in the U.S. government, we know the money is coming in the fourth quarter. Anything else you'd add to that, Patrick?"

And I think we've got this increased confidence to achieve our previously raised core growth guidance for the year. And listen, we realize by not raising our core guidance for this year that this question could arise. But the way we looked at it, we said, listen, there's a raised level uncertainty in the markets centered around Europe. And we saw some weak European government budgets in the third quarter. Is this going to continue? We've seen some downward revisions in terms of market overall economic forecasts for Europe, so we're really not sure exactly how it's going to develop. So we just thought it's prudent to reflect some of this uncertainty by not raising again the full year guidance. So that's how we thought about the process.

So what we've been focusing on are really 3 dimensions around what we call our value-engineering program, our logistics model and also our strategic procurement approach with our suppliers. And as I look at the results in '16, the program that Henrik is driving across this company, I think we probably have seen the biggest impact so far in our improved logistics model. And you may recall we talked about logistics costs as being problematic in 2015. That's no longer the case. In fact, we've benchmarked ourselves, and we've got ourselves down to the best in our space. And there actually is more to come, which is the other 2 elements of the program have a little bit more longer tail in terms of payoff, which is value engineering, when you're reengineering product platforms to ensure both the continuation of the high performance but at a lower cost. And then as we also continue to transform our supplier engagement model and how we leverage the scale of Agilent. So I think those latter 2 parts of the program are going to carry us forward into '17 and '18 beyond, so I think that's how we're really working the gross margin side. And by the way, I also [indiscernible] of your comments were focused on LSAG. A lot of logistics costs and some of these other factors I mentioned, procurement, show up as impacts on the DDG and ACG business as well. And then relative to the SG&A, a couple of things that you may recall I highlighted in New York and I just reemphasize again, major focus on our systems infrastructure. So as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're now on one SAP instance, simplifying a lot of our work for our financial team and taking a lot of cost out of the system. The next big wave will be when we move the former Dako company into the Agilent environment in 2017 where we can really start to leverage the scale and take out costs and have an improved customer experience there. So there's a couple of big initiatives as well as we look at -- we're looking at other aspects of our benefit structure as we made some change, as you may know, earlier to our U.S. pension plan and the Agile Agilent program I mentioned is live. And we have a lot of initiatives underway to ensure that we can continue to take costs out while simplifying the company. Didier, anything else you would add to that?"

I'm very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. First, we continue to deliver above market",2022,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. 
First, we continue to deliver above market growth. Revenues of $1.1 billion exceeded the high end of the guidance by a size [ph] of $41 million and were up 6.3% on a core basis. We were then [ph] first surprised by the strength of our instrument business in pharma, China and Europe, which far exceeded our expectations. 
Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.59 was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. Finally, we continued our track record of improving profitability as we delivered another quarter of operating margin expansion. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% was up 60 basis points from Q4 of fiscal 2015. 
Turning to our full year results. Core revenue continued to outperform the market, growing 5.9%. We increased operating margins 110 basis points to 20.7% from 2015. These results drove a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year. We are capping off the second year of our company transformation with stellar performance by the Agilent team. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our continued ability to win in the market. 
We are outgrowing the market while expanding margins and fully leveraging our strong balance sheet. In the past year, we distributed $150 million in cash dividends, repurchased $434 million of our shares and invested $480 million directly into the business through M&A, strategic transactions and capital expenditures. Let me now address what happened in our end markets and business groups. I'll start with the end markets.
Our Q4 trends were similar to what we experienced last quarter with pharma and academia and government being the exceptions. We had expected [ph] continued strength in pharma, but our 16% growth on a difficult compare exceeded our expectations. Growth is being driven by strong customer acceptance of our new products and enterprise service offerings. Academia and government's decline of 2% was less than expected. European spending is holding up better than projected while our U.S. government vestments [ph] continue to lag 2015 spending levels. Clinical diagnostics grew 8% over last year, led by continued growth in reagents.
Within our applied end markets, food is up 10% with strong demand in China and Americas. China also drove growth in environmental market up [ph] 3%. Chemical energy declined 3% in line with expectations due to continued effect of crude oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect this market to remain challenging for the rest of calendar year 2016 and into 2017 with no significant downward or upward movements.
Geographically, Asia, led by China and Europe, was stronger than forecast. Our Asia business, excluding Japan, grew double digit, driven by greater than 25% growth in China. While the overall European market remains challenged, we delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. European pharma and food markets were strong and academia and government funding was stable with Q3. Japan and Americas were flat with growth strained [ph] by continued chemical energy market weakness and specific to the U.S., slow U.S. government funding. 
Moving on to the business groups. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. Better-than-expected revenues from our analytical lab instrument business was driven by an attractive combination of introducing new products into growing markets. This applied in particular to our new lineup of chromatography and mass spectrometry products targeted [ph] to pharma in applied food, environmental and forensics markets. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.8%, up 280 basis points from a year ago.
We are building for the future. In August, we introduced a transformational Intuvo 9000 GC system. Building on our recognized GC leadership, the Intuvo system revolutionized the way user perform gas chromatography. Industry experts recognize unique innovation being delivered by Agilent with press coverage at 100% positive. Intuvo is featured this month on the cover LCGC magazine and major trade publication. Customer response is also very positive introduction, confirming our undisputed market leadership in gas chromatography. We anticipate a measured uptick in revenue. Limited international shipments are expected in Q1 of fiscal 2017 with [indiscernible] expected to increase over subsequent quarters.
Another industry unique product, the Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system, which we just introduced in Q3, is also being well received in the market. This instrument is rapidly becoming the solution of choice in lab to [ph] demand the highest standards of performance. 
Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continue to deliver strong, sustained growth with core revenue up [ph] 8%. Growth is healthy in both services and consumables. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, down 240 basis points from a year ago and in line with expectations.
ACG result was driven by strong pharma, food, clinical and diagnostic markets, where our CrossLab customer value proposition is being well received. Unlike our instrument business, ACG also grew in the chemical and energy markets. Laboratory supporting strong production levels drove demand for consumables. There is also continued demand for services as customers focus on keeping their older instruments operational.
We are investing for the future in ACG. We just introduced a new range of innovative and differentiated supplies. These new offerings enable the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC to be the most efficient and cost-effective premium GC to own and operate. We continue to successfully integrate the recently acquired iLab business, which brings differentiated capabilities to core lab managers. 
Last but certainly, not least in terms of impact, the momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued with delivery of 8% core growth. Our laser focused on improving the previously acquired dock [ph] of business is paying off before. The pathology business continues its steady climb back to market growth rates with strong through a [ph] strength in reagent and companion diagnostics.
Our nucleic acid solutions business for which we recently announced a significant production capacity grew double digit. This growth reflects the increase in demand for oligonucleotides for RNA-based drugs. DDG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.6%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. 
In October, there were some exciting news from Merck for lung cancer patients and for Agilent. Merck's KEYTRUDA is now approved by the FDA for first-line treatment for metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer for patients with high rates of PD-L1 expression. In conjunction, Agilent's pharma DS [ph] companion diagnostics, PD-L1 test, is now approved for expanded use. This is the first time an Agilent's PD-L1 companion diagnostic is approved for first-line testing.
The female requesting [ph] for our future is also evident in DDG. We launched a comprehensive offering of pool crystal [ph] libraries for functional genomics. This will help accelerate research into complex diseases and drug discovery. We signed an agreement with the [indiscernible] of the world cancer diagnostics [ph] in China based on Agilent SureSelect solutions. And we broke ground, initiated construction on the previously announced $120 million investment in a new factory in Colorado to expand nucleic acid production capacity.
Turning now to operating margin. We remain focused on operating margin improvement. Since the new Agilent leadership team was appointed, we have delivered 7 consecutive quarters of improved operating margin and strong growth. Despite continued challenges in the chemical and energy business, we have improved adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points in the first 2 years of the company's transformation. We have completely absorbed and offset the $40 million of the synergy costs due to the spill-off [ph] of key site.
On the operations front, our Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company and lower operating costs. This program is designed to keep us nimble, improve our interaction with customers and lower our cost.
It is having [ph] an impact and will continue to deliver savings in 2017 and beyond. In the coming year, we will realize cost savings from the completion of the integration of doctrine [ph] in early 2017, a simplified enterprise IT systems environment and other cost savings initiatives.
Turning to our FY '17 market and company outlook.
As a reminder, our shareholder value creation model [ph] for superior earnings growth is to outgrow the market and expand operating margins with a balanced deployment of our capital. Didier will go to the specifics of our Q1 '17 and full year guidance. I want to share our thinking about end markets and our initial guidance philosophy, given an environment of increased uncertainty.
This is a change in our last call and in May 2016 Analyst Investor Day. In our end markets, we expect continued strength in pharma, accompanied by continued solid growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets. Geographically, China and India are expected to grow at significantly higher rates than other countries. There remains considerable uncertainty about European markets. We are forecasting moderate growth in the United States with the U.S. government policies and spending and chemical energy markets being the wildcards.
Chemical and energy, while [ph] it appear an easier compares and improved oil prices has not yet returned the growth. We expect a continued subdued academic and government research market in the coming year until uncertainties resulting from Brexit and the U.S. elections play out. We are also keeping a watchful eye on how potential new U.S. government driven trade and currency evaluation discussions could impact our business.
We finished 2016 very strongly and we are well positioned for future growth with a pipeline of new offerings. In our initial revenue guidance for 2017, however, we want to be on the cautious side. We want to see some more clarity on U.S. and European government actions and have better indicators on when we will return to growth in our industrial end markets. 
Predicting end market growth in today's uncertain political and economic environment is challenging. However, I can predict quite confidently that we will continue our track record of outgrowing the market whatever market environment we encounter. We continue to expand our customer channel reach and fortify our portfolio, which strengthen us well for the coming year and beyond. 
The transformation of asset we discuss of the May Analyst and Investor Day is a full force. The new leadership team, put in place in early 2015 continued to deliver strong operating results each and every quarter. We are building momentum for future growth. We have improved our adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points over the past 2 years and our march to improve operating margins will continue in 2017.
However, in our initial operating margin and earnings per share guidance for 2017, we want to be on the cautious side. Since our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting, change in exchange rate, pension expenses and the recent iLab acquisition are having a short-term dilutive impact in our operating margins of 0.5%. The Agilent team, however, is laser-focused on improving another 130 basis points of operating margin. We have an internal action plan, in line with achieving a 22% operating margin goal in fiscal 2017 excluding M&A impact. This is the primary goal for our executive team's compensation. We continue to hold ourselves to a higher level of performance, expectations than reflected in our initial full year earnings guidance.
As you assess our future possibilities, I will leave you with a few thoughts. We are expanding our product portfolio and extended into adjacent markets. We're improving the customer experience by streamlining processes and modernizing the systems, making the company more efficient and customer friendly. Our Agile Agilent program has and will continue to deliver incremental improvements and operating margin. The One Agilent team continues to work well together and is determined to win in the market. We believe we are well positioned in staying [ph] our strong operational performance and achieve our long-term goals. The entire Agilent team is energized and committed to deliver future growth. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide initial insights on our financial results and initial guidance for our fiscal Q1 and full year 2017. Didier?"

As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high end of our guidance. We delivered above [ph] market core revenue growth of 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively, and our operating margin adjusted for income from key site was up 60 basis points, 110 basis points, respectively. 
Our full year EPS at $1.98 is 14% higher than the previous year. Please note that we have reduced our pro forma tax rate by 1 percentage points, which had a $0.02 impact on our EPS. Our operating cash flow for the full year at $793 million reflects our strong overall performance. And turning to capital returns.
For the first -- for the year, we returned $584 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or 89% of our free cash flow. I'll now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2017. 
As Mike stated, our initial guidance, like last year, assumes that what we believe to be appropriate caution. Our fiscal year '17 revenue guidance of $4.35 billion to $4.37 billion corresponds to core revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. It is based on October 31 [indiscernible] rates and currency had a 0.6 percentage foreign impact, negative impact on revenues.
We project fiscal year '17 adjusted operating margin of 21% to 21.5% and fiscal year '17 EPS of $2.10 to $2.16, growing 8% at mid-point. As you update your models for fiscal year '17, please consider the following 10 points. First, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2016. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $59 million and as we front end the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $23 million. Third, the reduction in bond yields is negatively impacting our annual pension expenses by about $12 million.
Fourth, depreciation is projected to be $104 million for the fiscal year. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 19%. Sixth, we plan to return approximately $600 million in capital to shareholders, including $170 million in dividends and $430 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Seventh, we plan to buy [ph] $250 million in the second half to fund a portion of our capital returns. Eighth, net interest expense is forecasted at $71 million and other income at $11 million. Ninth, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 324 million shares, 5 million shares less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year '16. And finally, tenth, we expect operating cash flow of $825 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, about $60 million over fiscal year '16, mostly due to the investment in the second nucleic acid facility.
Now finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. First, please note that lunar new year falls in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year. Meaning, about $15 million of revenue shifting from Q1 to Q2. 
We expect Q1 revenues of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion and EPS of $0.48 to $0.50. At mid-point, revenue will grow 2.2% on a core basis and EPS will grow 7%.
And as customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, front loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

That being said, I think if you go beyond the theory, I assume -- of those caveats, I think what you'd expect us to do is handle the return to cash very much along the lines of how we're managing our current use of capital. So we would want to use it for U.S. based M&A, and we'd like to use that in situation where we've been using debt, such as our share repurchases so we would able to finance our share repurchases. And then we might look at our debt structure. But I think what we want to do is, for several, understand what are the restrictions that could be tied to it. Also remind the group that some of the cash does need to remain permanently investment overseas.

But we don't yet have a position on these issues. What we do know is there's a multitude of factors that we need to pay attention to. Regulated markets, what's going to happen to other customers in the food markets, environmental markets, the drug -- the FDA regulatory markets. So we know there could be a custom impact. What's going to happen with the U.S. government-funded? A lot of our business is driven by U.S. government funding. What's going to happen with trade agreements.

And that's one of the reasons why we took what we believe to be a prudent, cautious initial guide to FY '17. 
If I look at the end markets, I mean, pharma's going to continue to be strong. But we don't believe that it continued to grow double digits throughout all of FY '17. So we tapered down our expectations a bit about the pharma. We also think that China has been this fantastic for us. I think our number for the U.S. Senate percent growth for the year to come down that back a bit to double digit. So what we're doing is really just trying to moderate our view of growth for next year based on what you've seen to be some pretty difficult comparisons in some markets that really have been driving the business.

We will see a bigger demand for U.S, Europe and in other  regions. In the market itself is very difficult to size, as you know, that both been a companion with one drug and then has been the complementary with another drug, and those have very different sizes at this point of time. I still believe that the overall PD-L1 market might end up in the same size after that market. But the difference is that too is only one. One, basically one drug together with as one diagnostics by the PD-L1 will be up to 5 different drugs, maybe more in 5 different diagnostic, maybe even more and a lot of indications also. So this is as close as I can get to right now. The market we place in is -- the 2 companion diagnostics that we had today continued to grow strongly. I won't say that that's the overall margin driver for the 8%. Basically, all of our businesses today have a very nice growth performance but it's definitely contributing."

If there's any good news to that story is the fundamental industries are still out there in terms of gasoline as being produced. We've seen record levels of production in the United States, for example. The plants are running. There's a lot of discussion. There's a lot of reports externally about a turn. Oil prices have been inching up. But our history here is that it's really hard to know exactly when it's going to turn. What I can say is that if you have a profitability productivity message associated with something you can bring to the laboratory, then they might listen to you. And we're hopeful that some of our new product introductions will hit the mark there. But in terms of our overall market assumption and growth assumption for the company, we're assuming flat for '17.

So there's a couple of things going on, which is in terms of the overall fundamental end markets growth rates, we think bio pharma and the small molecule side of pharma both growing quite strongly.
Small molecule side is really being driven by a conversion to the new technology and a good chromatography in particular. Also, an increasing interest in enterprise service, what we have to offer for ACG. So I think what's been going on here for Agilent, you've got the combination of really strong and market growth. There's a new market that has and will continue to develop in this services side, and we're doing well there, along with our new instruments in the pharma. When I look at '17, we think that the bio pharma side of that market is going to continue to go quite strongly. It's been an area of prioritization for us in terms of new solutions.

I'm very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. First, we continued to deliver above-market",2002,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. 
First, we continued to deliver above-market growth. Revenues of $1.1 billion exceeded the high end of the guidance by a sizeable $41 million, and were up 6.3% on a core basis. We were the first surprised by the strength of our instrument business in pharma, China and Europe, which far exceeded our expectations. 
Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.59 was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. Finally, we continued our track record of improving profitability as we delivered another quarter of operating margin expansion. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% was up 60 basis points from Q4 of fiscal 2015. 
Turning to our full year results. Core revenue continued to outperform the market, growing 5.9%. We increased operating margins 110 basis points to 20.7% from 2015. These results drove a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year. We are capping off the second year of our company transformation with stellar performance by the Agilent team. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our continued ability to win in the market. 
We are outgrowing the market while expanding margins and fully leveraging our strong balance sheet. In the past year, we distributed $150 million in cash dividends, repurchased $434 million of our shares and invested $480 million directly into the business through M&A, strategic transactions and capital expenditures. Let me now address what's happening in our end markets and business groups. I'll start with the end markets.
Our Q4 trends were similar to what we experienced last quarter with pharma and academia and government being the exceptions. We had expected continued strength in pharma, but our 16% growth on a difficult compare exceeded our expectations. Growth is being driven by strong customer acceptance of our new products and enterprise service offerings. Academia and government's decline of 2% was less than expected. European spending is holding up better than projected while our U.S. government investments continue to lag 2015 spending levels. Clinical and diagnostics grew 8% over last year, led by continued growth in reagents.
Within our applied end markets, food is up 10% with strong demand in China and Americas. China also drove growth in environmental market, up 3%. Chemical energy declined 3% in line with expectations due to continued effect of crude oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect this market to remain challenging for the rest of calendar year 2016 and into 2017 with no significant downward or upward movements.
Geographically, Asia, led by China and Europe, was stronger than forecast. Our Asia business, excluding Japan, grew double digit, driven by greater than 25% growth in China. While the overall European market remains challenged, we delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. European pharma and food markets were strong and academia and government funding was stable with Q3. Japan and Americas were flat with growth constrained by continued chemical and energy market weakness and specific to the U.S., slow U.S. government funding. 
Moving on to the business groups. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. Better-than-expected revenues from our analytical lab instrument business was driven by an attractive combination of introducing new products into growing markets. This applied in particular to our new lineup of chromatography and mass spectrometry products targeted at the pharma in applied food, environmental and forensics markets. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.8%, up 280 basis points from a year ago.
We are building for the future. In August, we introduced the transformational Intuvo 9000 GC system. Building on our recognized GC leadership, the Intuvo system revolutionized the way users perform gas chromatography. Industry experts recognize unique innovation being delivered by Agilent with press coverage at 100% positive. Intuvo is featured this month on the cover LCGC magazine, a major trade publication. 
Customer response is also very positive to this introduction, confirming our undisputed market leadership in gas chromatography. We anticipate a measured uptake in revenue. Limited international shipments are expected in Q1 of fiscal 2017, with volumes expected to increase over subsequent quarters.
Another industry-unique product, the Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system, which we just introduced in Q3, is also being well received in the market. This instrument is rapidly becoming the solution of choice in labs that demand the highest standards of performance. 
Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continue to deliver strong, sustained growth with core revenue up 8%. Growth is healthy in both services and consumables. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, down 240 basis points from a year ago and in line with expectations.
ACG results were driven by strong pharma, food, clinical and diagnostic markets, where our CrossLab customer value proposition is being well received. Unlike our instrument business, ACG also grew in the chemical and energy markets. Laboratories supporting strong production levels drove demand for consumables. There is also continued demand for services, as customers focus on keeping their older instruments operational.
We are investing for the future in ACG. We just introduced a new range of innovative and differentiated supplies. These new offerings enable the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC to be the most efficient and cost-effective premium GC to own and operate. We continue to successfully integrate the recently acquired iLab business, which brings differentiated capabilities to core lab managers. 
Last but certainly not least in terms of impact, the momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued, with delivery of 8% core growth. Our laser focus on improving the previously acquired Dako business is paying off before. The pathology business continues its steady climb back to market growth rates, with strong -- with strength in reagents and companion diagnostics.
Our nucleic acid solutions business, for which we recently announced a significant production capacity, grew double digits. This growth reflects the increasing demand for oligonucleotides for RNA-based drugs. DDG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.6%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. 
In October, there were some exciting news from Merck for lung cancer patients and for Agilent. Merck's KEYTRUDA is now approved by the FDA for first-line treatment for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer for patients with high rates of PD-L1 expression. In conjunction, Agilent's pharmDx companion diagnostics PD-L1 test is now approved for expanded use. This is the first time an Agilent's PD-L1 companion diagnostic is approved for first-line testing.
The theme of investing for our future is also evident in DDG. We launched a comprehensive offering of pooled CRISPR libraries for functional genomics. This will help accelerate research into complex diseases and drug discovery. We signed an agreement with the Burning Rock Biotech to develop cancer diagnostics in China based on Agilent SureSelect solutions. And we broke ground and initiated construction on the previously announced $120 million investment in a new factory in Colorado to expand nucleic acid production capacity.
Turning now to operating margin. We remain focused on operating margin improvement. Since the new Agilent leadership team was appointed, we have delivered 7 consecutive quarters of improved operating margin and strong growth. Despite continued challenges in the chemical and energy business, we have improved adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points in the first 2 years of the company's transformation. We have completely absorbed and offset the $40 million of the synergy costs due to the spin-off of Keysight.
On the operations front, our Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company and lower operating costs. This program is designed to keep us nimble, improve our interaction with customers and lower our costs.
It is having an impact and will continue to deliver savings in 2017 and beyond. In the coming year, we will realize cost savings from the completion of the integration of Dako in early 2017, a simplified enterprise IT systems environment and other cost savings initiatives.
Turning to our FY '17 market and company outlook.
As a reminder, our shareholder value creation model for superior earnings growth is to outgrow the market and expand operating margins with a balanced deployment of our capital. Didier will go through the specifics of our Q1 '17 and full year guidance. I want to share our thinking about end markets and our initial guidance philosophy, given an environment of increased uncertainty.
This is a change in our last call and the May 2016 Analyst Investor Day. In our end markets, we expect continued strength in pharma, accompanied by continued solid growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets. Geographically, China and India are expected to grow at significantly higher rates than other countries. There remains considerable uncertainty about European markets. We are forecasting moderate growth in the United States with the U.S. government policies and spending and chemical and energy markets being the wildcards.
Chemical and energy, while entering a period of easier compares and improved oil prices has not yet returned to growth. We expect a continued subdued academic and government research market in the coming year until uncertainties resulting from Brexit and the U.S. elections play out. We are also keeping a watchful eye on how potential new U.S. government driven trade and currency evaluation discussions could impact our business.
We finished 2016 very strongly, and we are well positioned for future growth with a pipeline of new offerings. In our initial revenue guidance for 2017, however, we want to be on the cautious side. We want to see some more clarity on U.S. and European government actions and have better indicators on when we will return to growth in our industrial end markets. 
Predicting end market growth in today's uncertain political and economic environment is challenging. However, I can predict quite confidently that we will continue our track record of outgrowing the market whatever market environment we encounter. We continue to expand our customer channel reach and fortify our portfolio, which strengthen us well for the coming year and beyond. 
The transformation of Agilent we discussed at the May Analyst and Investor Day is in full force. The new leadership team, put in place in early 2015 continued to deliver strong operating results each and every quarter. We are building momentum for future growth. We have improved our adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points over the past 2 years and our march to improved operating margins will continue in 2017.
However, in our initial operating margin and earnings per share guidance for 2017, we want to be on the cautious side. Since our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting, changes in exchange rate, pension expenses and the recent iLab acquisition are having a short-term dilutive impact on our operating margins of 0.5%. The Agilent team, however, is laser-focused on improving another 130 basis points of operating margin. We have an internal action plan aligned with achieving a 22% operating margin goal in fiscal 2017, excluding M&A impact. 
This is the primary goal for our executive team's compensation. We continue to hold ourselves to a higher level of performance, expectations than reflected in our initial full year earnings guidance.
As you assess our future possibilities, I will leave you with a few thoughts. We are expanding our product portfolio and extending into adjacent markets. We're improving the customer experience by streamlining processes and modernizing the systems, making the company more efficient and customer friendly. Our Agile Agilent program has and will continue to deliver incremental improvements in operating margin. The One Agilent team continues to work well together and is determined to win in the market. We believe we are well positioned to sustain our strong operational performance and achieve our long-term goals. The entire Agilent team is energized and committed to deliver future growth. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide initial insights on our financial results and initial guidance for our fiscal Q1 and full year 2017. Didier?"

As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high end of our guidance. We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively; and our operating margin, adjusted for income from Keysight, was up 60 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. 
Our full year EPS at $1.98 is 14% higher than the previous year. Please note that we have reduced our pro forma tax rate by 1 percentage points, which had a $0.02 impact on our EPS. Our operating cash flow for the full year, at $793 million, reflects our strong overall performance. 
And turning to capital returns. For the first -- for the year, we returned $584 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or 89% of our free cash flow. 
I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2017. As Mike stated, our initial guidance, like last year, assumes that what we believe to be appropriate caution. Our fiscal year '17 revenue guidance of $4.35 billion to $4.37 billion corresponds to core revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. It is based on October 31 exchange rates and currency had a 0.6 percentage foreign impact -- negative impact on revenues. We project fiscal year '17 adjusted operating margin of 21% to 21.5% and fiscal year '17 EPS of $2.10 to $2.16, growing 8% at midpoint. 
As you update your models for fiscal year '17, please consider the following 10 points: First, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2016. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $59 million. And as we front end the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $23 million. Third, the reduction in bond yields is negatively impacting our annual pension expenses by about $12 million. Fourth, depreciation is projected to be $104 million for the fiscal year. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 19%. Sixth, we plan to return approximately $600 million in capital to shareholders, including $170 million in dividends and $430 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Seventh, we plan to borrow $250 million in the second half to fund a portion of our capital returns. Eighth, net interest expense is forecasted at $71 million and other income at $11 million. Ninth, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 324 million shares, 5 million shares less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year '16. And finally, tenth, we expect operating cash flow of $825 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, about $60 million over fiscal year '16, mostly due to the investment in the second nucleic acid facility.
Now finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. First, please note that Lunar New Year falls in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year. Meaning, about $15 million of revenue shifting from Q1 to Q2. 
We expect Q1 revenues of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion and EPS of $0.48 to $0.50. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% on a core basis and EPS will grow 7%.
And as customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, front loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

That being said, I think if you go beyond the theory, I assume those caveats, I think what you'd expect us to do is handle the return to cash very much along the lines of how we're managing our current use of capital. So we would want to use it for U.S.-based M&A, and we'd like to use that in situation where we've been using debt, such as our share repurchases so we would able to finance our share repurchases. And then we might look at our debt structure. But I think what we want to do is, first of all, obviously, understand what are the restrictions that could be tied to it. Also remind the group that some of the cash does need to remain permanently investment overseas. But we were -- if that particular situation will develop, we would likely will bring it back and use the cash pretty much along the lines how we've been using cash with the exception is I won't need to borrow money like I've done in the past for U.S.-based M&A or stock repurchases. I guess you might be okay with that, Didier. You haven't said anything else. Okay."

So great question, Jon, and thanks for that and obviously, we've spent a lot of time talking about this as a team and I mentioned to Alicia before the call, I think we may be the first company in our space that had to do guidance after the U.S. election. So what I'm going to tell you is kind of factors we're thinking about. And then also give you maybe some a little bit more thinking about why we guided the growth rate we did as a company. But we don't yet have a position on these issues. What we do know is there's a multitude of factors that we need to pay attention to. Regulated markets, what's going to happen to other customers in the food markets, environmental markets, the drug -- the FDA regulatory markets. So we know there could be a custom impact. What's going to happen with the U.S. government funding? A lot of our business is driven by U.S. government funding. What's going to happen with trade agreements. There's been a lot of noise about Chinese currency. We just talked about the tax, and will the M&A environment change in terms of -- so I can say right now, Jonathan, is perhaps, like everybody else on this call, we kind of -- at a sense of the issues, but we don't know which ways these things are going to go yet, so we're not going to call them. And that's one of the reasons why we took what we believe to be a prudent, cautious initial guide to FY '17. If I look at the end markets, I mean, pharma's going to continue to be strong. But we don't believe that it continue to grow in double digits throughout all of FY '17. So we've tapered down our expectations a bit about pharma. We also think that China has been just a -- just fantastic for us. I think our number for the year was 21% growth for the year, I'm dialing that back a bit to double digit. So what we're doing is really just trying to moderate our view of growth for next year based on what we've seen to be some pretty difficult comparisons in some markets that really have been driving the business. As I mentioned to you, the wildcard is the turn on energy. One of the things that you pointed out, Jonathan, and what I'm really delighted is we've had 6%, close to 6% growth, 2 years in a row with our #2 market declining for 8 quarters. When that market turns, that obviously will help us in the growth.  So -- but I've learned over the first 2 years in this job, it's really hard to call in terms of a major market. So I'm not going to. And we'll just kind of keep an eye on it, and we'll update you as we go through the year, but that's our thinking about how we're viewing the U.S. election and the thought behind our end market guidance for next year."

We will see a bigger demand for here in U.S., in Europe and in other regions. The market itself is very difficult to size, as you know, that both been the companion with one drug and then has been the complementary with another drug, and those have very different sizes at this point of time. I still believe that the overall PD-L1 market might end up in the same size as the HER2 market. But the difference is that HER2 is only one. One. Basically one drug, or one class of drug, together with one diagnostics whether the PD-L1 will be up to 5 different drugs, maybe more in 5 different diagnostic, maybe even for a lot of indications also. So this is as close as I can get to right now. And the market we place in is -- or the 2 companion diagnostics that we have today continues to grow strongly. I won't say that that's the overall, I think, driver for the 8%. Basically, all our businesses today have a very nice growth performance, but it's definitely contributing."

And then maybe a longer-term question, Mike, regarding management incentives, you guys have spent a lot of time over the last couple of years talking about the emphasis on hitting your margin goals and you guys have done that pretty well. So as you move pass that 22% number, I was wondering how you think about evolving instead of structure for the management team? And should we assume that the types of incentives you have in place is same place maybe with slightly different targets? Or could the overall composition evolve a little bit here?"

And I would point back to what we discussed back at the May AID, where we really say -- what this is all about is generating superior earnings growth, right? So if you think about what we're trying to do here is we're trying to outgrow the market, extend the operation margins to keep driving up our adjusted earnings per share growth. So what we like to be able to do is really that should be the focus of the team as we move forward. Operating margin expansion and capital deployment and your growth and market are all ways to get there. So we'd like to really be that, become the cornerstone of our long-term focus. And we want Agilent viewed as a company who grows their earnings faster than revenue. But as I mentioned in the AID is, I really want to also make sure that we don't get so focused on continuing to drive up the operating margin year in and year out that you pass on things that immediately you say accretive, maybe their dilutive on your margins but with good M&A additions to the business. So I think the way we're going to talk about the company post '17 is very consistent with what we had talked about back in the spring in New York City."

We're not expecting the governments there to do anything in terms of more stimulus. In fact, one of things we're watching is what are they going to do as a result of Brexit for those of things. So we expect a strong China, academia and government. We expect the continuation of this current environment in Europe. In the United States, the academia side is not bad. It's what we've seen more has been more on the U.S. government side. The U.S. government -- our U.S. government business is down in 2016 relative to '15.

I'm very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. First, we continued to deliver above-market",1998,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. 
I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. First, we continued to deliver above-market growth. Revenues of $1.1 billion exceeded the high end of the guidance by a sizeable $41 million and were up 6.3% on a core basis. We were the first surprised by the strength of our instrument business in pharma, China and Europe, which far exceeded our expectations. 
Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.59 was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. 
Finally, we continued our track record of improving profitability as we delivered another quarter of operating margin expansion. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% was up 60 basis points from Q4 of fiscal 2015. 
Turning to our full year results. Core revenue continued to outperform the market, growing 5.9%. We increased operating margins 110 basis points to 20.7% from 2015. These results drove a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year. 
We are capping off the second year of our company transformation with stellar performance by the Agilent team. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our continued ability to win in the market. We are outgrowing the market while expanding margins and fully leveraging our strong balance sheet. 
In the past year, we distributed $150 million in cash dividends, repurchased $434 million of our shares and invested $480 million directly into the business through M&A, strategic transactions and capital expenditures. 
Let me now address what's happening in our end markets and business groups. I'll start with the end markets. Our Q4 trends were similar to what we experienced last quarter with pharma and academia and government being the exceptions. We had expected continued strength in pharma, but our 16% growth on a difficult compare exceeded our expectations. Growth is being driven by strong customer acceptance of our new products and enterprise service offerings. Academia and government's decline of 2% was less than expected. European spending is holding up better than projected, while our U.S. government investments continue to lag 2015 spending levels. 
Clinical and diagnostics grew 8% over last year, led by continued growth in reagents.
Within our applied end markets, food is up 10% with strong demand in China and Americas. China also drove growth in environmental market, up 3%. 
Chemical and energy declined 3% in line with expectations due to continued effect of crude oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect this market to remain challenging for the rest of calendar year 2016 and into 2017, with no significant downward or upward movements.
Geographically, Asia, led by China, and Europe were stronger than forecast. Our Asia business, excluding Japan, grew double digit, driven by greater than 25% growth in China. While the overall European market remains challenged, we delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. European pharma and food markets were strong and academia and government funding was stable with Q3. Japan and Americas were flat with growth constrained by continued chemical and energy market weakness and specific to the U.S., slow U.S. government funding. 
Moving on to the business groups. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. Better-than-expected revenues from our analytical lab instruments business was driven by an attractive combination of introducing new products into growing markets. This applied in particular to our new lineup of chromatography and mass spectrometry products targeted at the pharma in applied food, environmental and forensics markets. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.8%, up 280 basis points from a year ago.
We are building for the future. In August, we introduced the transformational Intuvo 9000 GC system. Building on our recognized GC leadership, the Intuvo system revolutionized the way users perform gas chromatography. Industry experts recognize unique innovation being delivered by Agilent with press coverage at 100% positive. Intuvo is featured this month on the cover LCGC magazine, a major trade publication. 
Customer response is also very positive to this introduction, confirming our undisputed market leadership in gas chromatography. We anticipate a measured uptake in revenue. Limited international shipments are expected in Q1 of fiscal 2017, with volumes expected to increase over subsequent quarters.
Another industry-unique product, the Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system, which we just introduced in Q3, is also being well received in the market. This instrument is rapidly becoming the solution of choice in labs that demand the highest standards of performance. 
Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver strong, sustained growth with core revenue up 8%. Growth is healthy in both services and consumables. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, down 240 basis points from a year ago and in line with expectations.
ACG results were driven by strong pharma, food, clinical and diagnostic markets, where our CrossLab customer value proposition is being well received. Unlike our instrument business, ACG also grew in the chemical and energy markets. Laboratories supporting strong production levels drove demand for consumables. There is also continued demand for services, as customers focus on keeping their older instruments operational.
We are investing for the future in ACG. We just introduced a new range of innovative and differentiated supplies. These new offerings enable the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC to be the most efficient and cost-effective premium GC to own and operate. We continue to successfully integrate the recently acquired iLab business, which brings differentiated capabilities to core lab managers. 
Last, but certainly not least in terms of impact, the momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued, with delivery of 8% core growth. Our laser focus on improving the previously acquired Dako business is paying off. The pathology business continues its steady climb back to market growth rates, with strong -- with strength in reagents and companion diagnostics.
Our nucleic acid solutions business, for which we recently announced a significant production capacity, grew double digits. This growth reflects the increasing demand for oligonucleotides for RNA-based drugs. DDG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.6%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. 
In October, there was some exciting news from Merck for lung cancer patients and for Agilent. Merck's KEYTRUDA is now approved by the FDA for first-line treatment for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer for patients with high rates of PD-L1 expression. In conjunction, Agilent's pharmDx companion diagnostics PD-L1 test is now approved for expanded use. This is the first time an Agilent's PD-L1 companion diagnostic is approved for first-line testing.
The theme of investing for our future is also evident in DDG. We launched a comprehensive offering of pooled CRISPR libraries for functional genomics. This will help accelerate research into complex diseases and drug discovery. We signed an agreement with the Burning Rock Biotech to develop cancer diagnostics in China based on Agilent SureSelect solutions. And we broke ground and initiated construction on the previously announced $120 million investment in a new factory in Colorado to expand nucleic acid production capacity.
Turning now to operating margin. We remain focused on operating margin improvement. Since the new Agilent leadership team was appointed, we have delivered 7 consecutive quarters of improved operating margin and strong growth. Despite continued challenges in the chemical and energy business, we have improved adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points in the first 2 years of the company's transformation. We have completely absorbed and offset the $40 million of dis-synergy costs due to the spin-off of Keysight.
On the operations front, our Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company and lower operating costs. This program is designed to keep us nimble, improve our interaction with customers and lower our costs. It is having an impact and will continue to deliver savings in 2017 and beyond. 
In the coming year, we will realize cost savings from the completion of the integration of Dako in early 2017, a simplified enterprise IT systems environment and other cost-savings initiatives.
Turning to our FY '17 market and company outlook. As a reminder, our shareholder value creation model for superior earnings growth is to outgrow the market and expand operating margins with a balanced deployment of our capital. Didier will go through the specifics of our Q1 '17 and full year guidance. I want to share our thinking about end markets and our initial guidance philosophy, given an environment of increased uncertainty. This is a change since our last call and the May 2016 Analyst Investor Day. 
In our end markets, we expect continued strength in pharma, accompanied by continued solid growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets. Geographically, China and India are expected to grow at significantly higher rates than other countries. There remains considerable uncertainty about European markets. We are forecasting moderate growth in the United States with the U.S. government policies and spending and chemical and energy markets being the wildcards.
Chemical and energy, while entering a period of easier compares and improved oil prices, has not yet returned to growth. We expect a continued subdued academic and government research market in the coming year until uncertainties resulting from Brexit and the U.S. elections play out. We are also keeping a watchful eye on how potential new U.S. government driven trade and currency evaluation discussions could impact our business.
We finished 2016 very strongly, and we are well positioned for future growth with a pipeline of new offerings. In our initial revenue guidance for 2017, however, we want to be on the cautious side. We want to see some more clarity on U.S. and European government actions and have better indicators of when we will return to growth in our industrial end markets. 
Predicting end-market growth in today's uncertain political and economic environment is challenging. However, I can predict quite confidently that we will continue our track record of outgrowing the market whatever market environment we encounter. We continue to expand our customer channel reach and fortify our portfolio, which strengthens us well for the coming year and beyond. 
The transformation of Agilent we discussed at the May Analyst and Investor Day is in full force. The new leadership team, put in place in early 2015, continues to deliver strong operating results each and every quarter. We are building momentum for future growth. 
We have improved our adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points over the past 2 years and our march to improved operating margins will continue in 2017. However, in our initial operating margin and earnings per share guidance for 2017, we want to be on the cautious side. Since our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting, changes in exchange rate, pension expenses and the recent iLab acquisition are having a short-term dilutive impact on our operating margins of 0.5%. The Agilent team, however, is laser-focused on improving another 130 basis points of operating margin. We have an internal action plan aligned with achieving a 22% operating margin goal in fiscal 2017, excluding M&A impact. This is the primary goal for our executive team's compensation. We continue to hold ourselves to a higher level of performance, expectations than reflected in our initial full year earnings guidance.
As you assess our future possibilities, I will leave you with a few thoughts. We are expanding our product portfolio and extending into adjacent markets. We're improving the customer experience by streamlining processes and modernizing systems, making the company more efficient and customer friendly. Our Agile Agilent program has and will continue to deliver incremental improvements in operating margin. The One Agilent team continues to work well together and is determined to win in the market. We believe we are well positioned to sustain our strong operational performance and achieve our long-term goals. The entire Agilent team is energized and committed to deliver future growth. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide initial insights on our financial results and initial guidance for our fiscal Q1 and full year 2017. Didier?"

As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high end of our guidance. We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively; and our operating",577,"Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high end of our guidance. 
We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively; and our operating margin, adjusted for income from Keysight, was up 60 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. 
Our full year EPS at $1.98 is 14% higher than the previous year. Please note that we have reduced our pro forma tax rate by 1 percentage points, which had a $0.02 impact on our EPS. Our operating cash flow for the full year, at $793 million, reflects our strong overall performance. 
And turning to capital returns. For the first -- for the year, we returned $584 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or 89% of our free cash flow. 
I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2017. As Mike stated, our initial guidance, like last year, assumes that -- what we believe to be appropriate caution. Our fiscal year '17 revenue guidance of $4.35 billion to $4.37 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. It is based on October 31 exchange rates and currency had a 0.6 percentage point impact -- negative impact on revenues. We project fiscal year '17 adjusted operating margin of 21% to 21.5% and fiscal year '17 EPS of $2.10 to $2.16, growing 8% at midpoint. 
As you update your models for fiscal year '17, please consider the following 10 points: First, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2016. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $59 million. And as we front end the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $23 million. Third, the reduction in bond yields is negatively impacting our annual pension expenses by about $12 million. Fourth, depreciation is projected to be $104 million for the fiscal year. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 19%. Sixth, we plan to return approximately $600 million in capital to shareholders, including $170 million in dividends and $430 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Seventh, we plan to borrow $250 million in the second half to fund a portion of our capital returns. Eighth, net interest expense is forecasted at $71 million and other income at $11 million. Ninth, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 324 million shares, 5 million shares less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year '16. And finally, tenth, we expect operating cash flow of $825 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, about $60 million over fiscal year '16, mostly due to the investment in the second nucleic acid facility.
Now finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. First, please note that Lunar New Year falls in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year, meaning about $15 million of revenue shifting from Q1 to Q2. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion and EPS of $0.48 to $0.50. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% on a core basis and EPS will grow 7%. And as customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, front loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

That being said, I think if you go beyond the theory, I assume with those caveats, I think what you'd expect us to do is handle the return to cash very much along the lines of how we're managing our current use of capital. So we would want to use it for U.S.-based M&A, and we'd like to use that in situation where we've been using debt, such as our share repurchases so we would able to finance our share repurchases. And then we might look at our debt structure. But I think what we want to do is, first of all, obviously, understand what are the restrictions that could be tied to it. Also remind the group that some of the cash does need to remain permanently investment overseas. But we were -- if that particular situation would develop, we would like -- we would bring it back and use the cash very much along the lines how we've been using cash with the exception is I won't need to borrow money like I've done in the past for U.S.-based M&A or stock repurchases.

So what I'm going to tell you is the kind of factors we're thinking about. And then also give you maybe some little bit more thinking about why we guided the growth rate we did as a company. But we don't yet have a position on these issues. What we do know is there's a multitude of factors that we need to pay attention to. Regulated markets, what's going to happen to other customers in the food markets, the environmental markets, the drug -- the FDA regulatory markets? So we know there's going to be a customer impact. What's going to happen with U.S. government funding? A lot of our business is driven by U.S. government funding. What's going to happen with trade agreements? There's been a lot of noise about Chinese currency. We just talked about the tax. And will the M&A environment change in terms of -- so all I can say right now, Jonathan, is perhaps, like everybody else on this call, we kind of had a sense of the issues, but we don't know which ways these things are going to go yet, so we're not going to call them. And we're just going to -- and that's one of the reasons why we took what we believe to be a prudent, cautious initial guide to FY '17. If I look at the end markets, I mean, pharma's going to continue to be strong. But we don't believe that it can continue to grow in double digits throughout all of FY '17. So we've tapered down our expectations a bit about pharma. We also think that China has been just a -- just fantastic for us. I think our number for the year was 21% growth for the year; I'm dialing that back a bit to double digit. So what we're doing is really just trying to moderate our view of growth for next year based on what we've seen to be some pretty difficult comparisons in some markets that really have been driving the business. As I mentioned to you, the wildcard is the turn on energy. One of the things that you pointed out, Jonathan, and what I'm really delighted is, we've had 6%, close to 6% growth, 2 years in a row with our #2 market declining for 8 quarters. When that market turns, that obviously will help us in the growth.  So -- but I've learned over the first 2 years in this job, it's really hard to call in terms of major markets. So I'm not going to. And we'll just kind of keep an eye on it, and we'll update you as we go through the year, but that's our thinking about how we're viewing the U.S. election and the thought behind our end-market guidance for next year."

And obviously, now with our companion diagnostic, we will see a bigger demand for it here in U.S., in Europe and in other regions. The market itself is very difficult to size. As you know, there's both been the companion with 1 drug and then there has been the complementary with another drug, and those have very different sizes at this point of time. I still believe that the overall PD-L1 market might end up in the same size as the HER2 market. But the difference is that HER2 is the only one -- one -- basically, one drug, one class of drug, together with one diagnostics, where the PD-L1 will be up to 5 different drugs, maybe more and 5 different diagnostic, maybe even for a lot of indications also. So this is as close as I can get to right now. The market we place in is -- or the 2 companion diagnostics that we have today continues to grow strongly. I won't say that that's the overall arching driver for the 8%. Basically, all our businesses today have a very nice growth performance, but it's definitely contributing."

Operating margin expansion and capital deployment and your growth and market are all ways to get there. So we'd like to really be that have become the cornerstone of our long-term focus. And we want Agilent viewed as a company who grows their earnings faster than revenue. But as I mentioned in the AID is, I really want to also make sure that we don't get so focused on continuing to drive up the operating margin year in and year out that you pass on things that are immediately, say, accretive, maybe they're dilutive on your margins, but with good M&A additions to the business.

Revenues of $1.1 billion exceeded the high end of the guidance by a sizeable $41 million and were up 6.3% on a core basis. We were the first surprised by the strength of our instrument business in pharma, China and Europe, which far exceeded our expectations. 
Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.59 was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. 
Finally, we continued our track record of improving profitability as we delivered another quarter of operating margin expansion. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% was up 60 basis points from Q4 of fiscal 2015. 
Turning to our full year results. Core revenue continued to outperform the market, growing 5.9%. We increased operating margins 110 basis points to 20.7% from 2015. These results drove a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year. 
We are capping off the second year of our company transformation with stellar performance by the Agilent team. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our continued ability to win in the market. We are outgrowing the market while expanding margins and fully leveraging our strong balance sheet. 
In the past year, we distributed $150 million in cash dividends, repurchased $434 million of our shares and invested $480 million directly into the business through M&A, strategic transactions and capital expenditures. 
Let me now address what's happening in our end markets and business groups. I'll start with the end markets. Our Q4 trends were similar to what we experienced last quarter with pharma and academia and government being the exceptions. We had expected continued strength in pharma, but our 16% growth on a difficult compare exceeded our expectations. Growth is being driven by strong customer acceptance of our new products and enterprise service offerings. Academia and government's decline of 2% was less than expected. European spending is holding up better than projected, while our U.S. government investments continue to lag 2015 spending levels. 
Clinical and diagnostics grew 8% over last year, led by continued growth in reagents.
Within our applied end markets, food is up 10% with strong demand in China and Americas. China also drove growth in environmental market, up 3%. 
Chemical and energy declined 3% in line with expectations due to continued effect of crude oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect this market to remain challenging for the rest of calendar year 2016 and into 2017, with no significant downward or upward movements.
Geographically, Asia, led by China, and Europe were stronger than forecast. Our Asia business, excluding Japan, grew double digit, driven by greater than 25% growth in China. While the overall European market remains challenged, we delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. European pharma and food markets were strong and academia and government funding was stable with Q3. Japan and Americas were flat with growth constrained by continued chemical and energy market weakness and specific to the U.S., slow U.S. government funding. 
Moving on to the business groups. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. Better-than-expected revenues from our analytical lab instruments business was driven by an attractive combination of introducing new products into growing markets. This applied in particular to our new lineup of chromatography and mass spectrometry products targeted at the pharma in applied food, environmental and forensics markets. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.8%, up 280 basis points from a year ago.
We are building for the future. In August, we introduced the transformational Intuvo 9000 GC system. Building on our recognized GC leadership, the Intuvo system revolutionized the way users perform gas chromatography. Industry experts recognize unique innovation being delivered by Agilent with press coverage at 100% positive. Intuvo is featured this month on the cover LCGC magazine, a major trade publication. 
Customer response is also very positive to this introduction, confirming our undisputed market leadership in gas chromatography. We anticipate a measured uptake in revenue. Limited international shipments are expected in Q1 of fiscal 2017, with volumes expected to increase over subsequent quarters.
Another industry-unique product, the Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system, which we just introduced in Q3, is also being well received in the market. This instrument is rapidly becoming the solution of choice in labs that demand the highest standards of performance. 
Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver strong, sustained growth with core revenue up 8%. Growth is healthy in both services and consumables. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, down 240 basis points from a year ago and in line with expectations.
ACG results were driven by strong pharma, food, clinical and diagnostic markets, where our CrossLab customer value proposition is being well received. Unlike our instrument business, ACG also grew in the chemical and energy markets. Laboratories supporting strong production levels drove demand for consumables. There is also continued demand for services, as customers focus on keeping their older instruments operational.
We are investing for the future in ACG. We just introduced a new range of innovative and differentiated supplies. These new offerings enable the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC to be the most efficient and cost-effective premium GC to own and operate. We continue to successfully integrate the recently acquired iLab business, which brings differentiated capabilities to core lab managers. 
Last, but certainly not least in terms of impact, the momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued, with delivery of 8% core growth. Our laser focus on improving the previously acquired Dako business is paying off. The pathology business continues its steady climb back to market growth rates, with strong -- with strength in reagents and companion diagnostics.
Our nucleic acid solutions business, for which we recently announced a significant production capacity, grew double digits. This growth reflects the increasing demand for oligonucleotides for RNA-based drugs. DDG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.6%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. 
In October, there was some exciting news from Merck for lung cancer patients and for Agilent. Merck's KEYTRUDA is now approved by the FDA for first-line treatment for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer for patients with high rates of PD-L1 expression. In conjunction, Agilent's pharmDx companion diagnostics PD-L1 test is now approved for expanded use. This is the first time an Agilent's PD-L1 companion diagnostic is approved for first-line testing.
The theme of investing for our future is also evident in DDG. We launched a comprehensive offering of pooled CRISPR libraries for functional genomics. This will help accelerate research into complex diseases and drug discovery. We signed an agreement with the Burning Rock Biotech to develop cancer diagnostics in China based on Agilent SureSelect solutions. And we broke ground and initiated construction on the previously announced $120 million investment in a new factory in Colorado to expand nucleic acid production capacity.
Turning now to operating margin. We remain focused on operating margin improvement. Since the new Agilent leadership team was appointed, we have delivered 7 consecutive quarters of improved operating margin and strong growth. Despite continued challenges in the chemical and energy business, we have improved adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points in the first 2 years of the company's transformation. We have completely absorbed and offset the $40 million of dis-synergy costs due to the spin-off of Keysight.
On the operations front, our Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company and lower operating costs. This program is designed to keep us nimble, improve our interaction with customers and lower our costs. It is having an impact and will continue to deliver savings in 2017 and beyond. 
In the coming year, we will realize cost savings from the completion of the integration of Dako in early 2017, a simplified enterprise IT systems environment and other cost-savings initiatives.
Turning to our FY '17 market and company outlook. As a reminder, our shareholder value creation model for superior earnings growth is to outgrow the market and expand operating margins with a balanced deployment of our capital. Didier will go through the specifics of our Q1 '17 and full year guidance. I want to share our thinking about end markets and our initial guidance philosophy, given an environment of increased uncertainty. This is a change since our last call and the May 2016 Analyst Investor Day. 
In our end markets, we expect continued strength in pharma, accompanied by continued solid growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets. Geographically, China and India are expected to grow at significantly higher rates than other countries. There remains considerable uncertainty about European markets. We are forecasting moderate growth in the United States with the U.S. government policies and spending and chemical and energy markets being the wildcards.
Chemical and energy, while entering a period of easier compares and improved oil prices, has not yet returned to growth. We expect a continued subdued academic and government research market in the coming year until uncertainties resulting from Brexit and the U.S. elections play out. We are also keeping a watchful eye on how potential new U.S. government driven trade and currency evaluation discussions could impact our business.
We finished 2016 very strongly, and we are well positioned for future growth with a pipeline of new offerings. In our initial revenue guidance for 2017, however, we want to be on the cautious side. We want to see some more clarity on U.S. and European government actions and have better indicators of when we will return to growth in our industrial end markets. 
Predicting end-market growth in today's uncertain political and economic environment is challenging. However, I can predict quite confidently that we will continue our track record of outgrowing the market whatever market environment we encounter. We continue to expand our customer channel reach and fortify our portfolio, which strengthens us well for the coming year and beyond. 
The transformation of Agilent we discussed at the May Analyst and Investor Day is in full force. The new leadership team, put in place in early 2015, continues to deliver strong operating results each and every quarter. We are building momentum for future growth. 
We have improved our adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points over the past 2 years and our march to improved operating margins will continue in 2017. However, in our initial operating margin and earnings per share guidance for 2017, we want to be on the cautious side. Since our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting, changes in exchange rate, pension expenses and the recent iLab acquisition are having a short-term dilutive impact on our operating margins of 0.5%. The Agilent team, however, is laser-focused on improving another 130 basis points of operating margin. We have an internal action plan aligned with achieving a 22% operating margin goal in fiscal 2017, excluding M&A impact. This is the primary goal for our executive team's compensation. We continue to hold ourselves to a higher level of performance, expectations than reflected in our initial full year earnings guidance.
As you assess our future possibilities, I will leave you with a few thoughts. We are expanding our product portfolio and extending into adjacent markets. We're improving the customer experience by streamlining processes and modernizing systems, making the company more efficient and customer friendly. Our Agile Agilent program has and will continue to deliver incremental improvements in operating margin. The One Agilent team continues to work well together and is determined to win in the market. We believe we are well positioned to sustain our strong operational performance and achieve our long-term goals. The entire Agilent team is energized and committed to deliver future growth. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide initial insights on our financial results and initial guidance for our fiscal Q1 and full year 2017. Didier?"

As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high end of our guidance. 
We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively; and our operating margin, adjusted for income from Keysight, was up 60 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. 
Our full year EPS at $1.98 is 14% higher than the previous year. Please note that we have reduced our pro forma tax rate by 1 percentage points, which had a $0.02 impact on our EPS. Our operating cash flow for the full year, at $793 million, reflects our strong overall performance. 
And turning to capital returns. For the first -- for the year, we returned $584 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or 89% of our free cash flow. 
I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2017. As Mike stated, our initial guidance, like last year, assumes that -- what we believe to be appropriate caution. Our fiscal year '17 revenue guidance of $4.35 billion to $4.37 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. It is based on October 31 exchange rates and currency had a 0.6 percentage point impact -- negative impact on revenues. We project fiscal year '17 adjusted operating margin of 21% to 21.5% and fiscal year '17 EPS of $2.10 to $2.16, growing 8% at midpoint. 
As you update your models for fiscal year '17, please consider the following 10 points: First, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2016. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $59 million. And as we front end the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $23 million. Third, the reduction in bond yields is negatively impacting our annual pension expenses by about $12 million. Fourth, depreciation is projected to be $104 million for the fiscal year. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 19%. Sixth, we plan to return approximately $600 million in capital to shareholders, including $170 million in dividends and $430 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Seventh, we plan to borrow $250 million in the second half to fund a portion of our capital returns. Eighth, net interest expense is forecasted at $71 million and other income at $11 million. Ninth, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 324 million shares, 5 million shares less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year '16. And finally, tenth, we expect operating cash flow of $825 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, about $60 million over fiscal year '16, mostly due to the investment in the second nucleic acid facility.
Now finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. First, please note that Lunar New Year falls in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year, meaning about $15 million of revenue shifting from Q1 to Q2. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion and EPS of $0.48 to $0.50. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% on a core basis and EPS will grow 7%. And as customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, front loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

So our overall contributions to our worldwide pension plan was $24 million. We intend to fund our U.S. pension plan more in '17 and the contribution to the pension plan will move to $45 million.

That being said, I think if you go beyond the theory, I assume with those caveats, I think what you'd expect us to do is handle the return to cash very much along the lines of how we're managing our current use of capital. So we would want to use it for U.S.-based M&A, and we'd like to use that in situation where we've been using debt, such as our share repurchases so we would able to finance our share repurchases. And then we might look at our debt structure. But I think what we want to do is, first of all, obviously, understand what are the restrictions that could be tied to it. Also remind the group that some of the cash does need to remain permanently investment overseas. But we were -- if that particular situation would develop, we would like -- we would bring it back and use the cash very much along the lines how we've been using cash with the exception is I won't need to borrow money like I've done in the past for U.S.-based M&A or stock repurchases.

So what I'm going to tell you is the kind of factors we're thinking about. And then also give you maybe some little bit more thinking about why we guided the growth rate we did as a company. But we don't yet have a position on these issues. What we do know is there's a multitude of factors that we need to pay attention to. Regulated markets, what's going to happen to other customers in the food markets, the environmental markets, the drug -- the FDA regulatory markets? So we know there's going to be a customer impact. What's going to happen with U.S. government funding? A lot of our business is driven by U.S. government funding. What's going to happen with trade agreements? There's been a lot of noise about Chinese currency. We just talked about the tax. And will the M&A environment change in terms of -- so all I can say right now, Jonathan, is perhaps, like everybody else on this call, we kind of had a sense of the issues, but we don't know which ways these things are going to go yet, so we're not going to call them. And we're just going to -- and that's one of the reasons why we took what we believe to be a prudent, cautious initial guide to FY '17. If I look at the end markets, I mean, pharma's going to continue to be strong. But we don't believe that it can continue to grow in double digits throughout all of FY '17. So we've tapered down our expectations a bit about pharma. We also think that China has been just a -- just fantastic for us. I think our number for the year was 21% growth for the year; I'm dialing that back a bit to double digit. So what we're doing is really just trying to moderate our view of growth for next year based on what we've seen to be some pretty difficult comparisons in some markets that really have been driving the business. As I mentioned to you, the wildcard is the turn on energy. One of the things that you pointed out, Jonathan, and what I'm really delighted is, we've had 6%, close to 6% growth, 2 years in a row with our #2 market declining for 8 quarters. When that market turns, that obviously will help us in the growth.  So -- but I've learned over the first 2 years in this job, it's really hard to call in terms of major markets. So I'm not going to. And we'll just kind of keep an eye on it, and we'll update you as we go through the year, but that's our thinking about how we're viewing the U.S. election and the thought behind our end-market guidance for next year."

And obviously, now with our companion diagnostic, we will see a bigger demand for it here in U.S., in Europe and in other regions. The market itself is very difficult to size. As you know, there's both been the companion with 1 drug and then there has been the complementary with another drug, and those have very different sizes at this point of time. I still believe that the overall PD-L1 market might end up in the same size as the HER2 market. But the difference is that HER2 is the only one -- one -- basically, one drug, one class of drug, together with one diagnostics, where the PD-L1 will be up to 5 different drugs, maybe more and 5 different diagnostic, maybe even for a lot of indications also. So this is as close as I can get to right now. The market we place in is -- or the 2 companion diagnostics that we have today continues to grow strongly. I won't say that that's the overall arching driver for the 8%. Basically, all our businesses today have a very nice growth performance, but it's definitely contributing."

I have to say it really was across the board with one exception, which is the chemical and energy market. So all the other markets were up quite substantially for us. And I think this is consistent with what we had talked about in prior calls, which is really there's going to be a level of investment in China relative to quality of life issues and in environmental, in food, lined up directly with their 5-year plan that they're in the midst of a major improvement in their overall pharma industry and that there's a lot of money going on to research. So -- and then I think the reason Agilent has been able to do so well here is we've got this combination of we've been working the organizational structure, the -- our channel model in the country. We've had a lot of stability over the last 18 months. So we've got a really strong team there. And that combination of the team, our historical strength in China and the new products we have, it's all coming together in terms of growth. And I guess, I maybe just add one thing and, Mark, perhaps, you can comment here. We often talk about the strength of end markets and the new products going to these end markets, but I think there's something going on relative to your business there and the move to services, I think, is worth a comment on as well."

To add a little color to that is we've seen a fundamental shift in buying behaviors in China, largely shifting from the core areas and around Shanghai, Beijing, to some of the more Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, where services now is viewed as the commonplace purchasing item in China, and it's certainly driving the growth. But the breadth of services, I think, in China, as well as the consumables business now, is the rest of the story, where they have reached the size and scale that they have the same interest that we'd find in the Western markets around enterprise services and consumables all coming together. So starting, as you've mentioned, Mike, with our extraordinarily strong position to start with, the installed base of China has just allowed us to build the business and truly outgrow our expectations in the second half around this, too."

What they're doing right now is in they're right in the midst of their capital budgeting process. So what I can tell you is I've had a couple conversations with customers over the last 2 or 3 weeks on this exact topic. And what they described for me is, hey, our end -- these are -- one customer was somebody who provides services into -- and equipment into the energy market. So listen, we're starting to get interest in quotes, but we're not sure whether it's going to hit in '17 or '18. When we had our VIP launch for the Intuvo 9000 GC, a lot our customers were in the chemical and energy space. And it's, ""Listen, we love this productivity message you have here. I think there's a real economic ROI. I'm now right in the midst of my budgeting process inside the company. Maybe I'll be able to get this thing through this year or maybe the following year."" Because there still seems to be the sentiment, particularly with the larger companies that they want to hold on to the equipment as long as they can before they have to replace it. So -- and again, that's why I pointed to the fact that it's not all negative because of the fact that we do have a strong service and consumables offerings into that space. But again, we just don't -- I don't think our customers know yet as well what's going to happen. We do know it's going to happen. History will repeat itself. There will be a replenishment of aged equipment. But again, we're just not confident enough right now to say when that's going to occur."

I'm very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. First, we continued to deliver above-market",1998,"Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. 
I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. First, we continued to deliver above-market growth. Revenues of $1.1 billion exceeded the high end of the guidance by a sizeable $41 million and were up 6.3% on a core basis. We were the first surprised by the strength of our instrument business in pharma, China and Europe, which far exceeded our expectations. 
Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.59 was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. 
Finally, we continued our track record of improving profitability as we delivered another quarter of operating margin expansion. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% was up 60 basis points from Q4 of fiscal 2015. 
Turning to our full year results. Core revenue continued to outperform the market, growing 5.9%. We increased operating margins 110 basis points to 20.7% from 2015. These results drove a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year. 
We are capping off the second year of our company transformation with stellar performance by the Agilent team. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our continued ability to win in the market. We are outgrowing the market while expanding margins and fully leveraging our strong balance sheet. 
In the past year, we distributed $150 million in cash dividends, repurchased $434 million of our shares and invested $480 million directly into the business through M&A, strategic transactions and capital expenditures. 
Let me now address what's happening in our end markets and business groups. I'll start with the end markets. Our Q4 trends were similar to what we experienced last quarter with pharma and academia and government being the exceptions. We had expected continued strength in pharma, but our 16% growth on a difficult compare exceeded our expectations. Growth is being driven by strong customer acceptance of our new products and enterprise service offerings. Academia and government's decline of 2% was less than expected. European spending is holding up better than projected, while our U.S. government investments continue to lag 2015 spending levels. 
Clinical and diagnostics grew 8% over last year, led by continued growth in reagents.
Within our applied end markets, food is up 10% with strong demand in China and Americas. China also drove growth in environmental market, up 3%. 
Chemical and energy declined 3% in line with expectations due to continued effect of crude oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect this market to remain challenging for the rest of calendar year 2016 and into 2017, with no significant downward or upward movements.
Geographically, Asia, led by China, and Europe were stronger than forecast. Our Asia business, excluding Japan, grew double digit, driven by greater than 25% growth in China. While the overall European market remains challenged, we delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. European pharma and food markets were strong and academia and government funding was stable with Q3. Japan and Americas were flat with growth constrained by continued chemical and energy market weakness and specific to the U.S., slow U.S. government funding. 
Moving on to the business groups. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. Better-than-expected revenues from our analytical lab instruments business was driven by an attractive combination of introducing new products into growing markets. This applied in particular to our new lineup of chromatography and mass spectrometry products targeted at the pharma in applied food, environmental and forensics markets. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.8%, up 280 basis points from a year ago.
We are building for the future. In August, we introduced the transformational Intuvo 9000 GC system. Building on our recognized GC leadership, the Intuvo system revolutionized the way users perform gas chromatography. Industry experts recognize unique innovation being delivered by Agilent with press coverage at 100% positive. Intuvo is featured this month on the cover LCGC magazine, a major trade publication. 
Customer response is also very positive to this introduction, confirming our undisputed market leadership in gas chromatography. We anticipate a measured uptake in revenue. Limited international shipments are expected in Q1 of fiscal 2017, with volumes expected to increase over subsequent quarters.
Another industry-unique product, the Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system, which we just introduced in Q3, is also being well received in the market. This instrument is rapidly becoming the solution of choice in labs that demand the highest standards of performance. 
Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver strong, sustained growth with core revenue up 8%. Growth is healthy in both services and consumables. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, down 240 basis points from a year ago and in line with expectations.
ACG results were driven by strong pharma, food, clinical and diagnostic markets, where our CrossLab customer value proposition is being well received. Unlike our instrument business, ACG also grew in the chemical and energy markets. Laboratories supporting strong production levels drove demand for consumables. There is also continued demand for services, as customers focus on keeping their older instruments operational.
We are investing for the future in ACG. We just introduced a new range of innovative and differentiated supplies. These new offerings enable the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC to be the most efficient and cost-effective premium GC to own and operate. We continue to successfully integrate the recently acquired iLab business, which brings differentiated capabilities to core lab managers. 
Last, but certainly not least in terms of impact, the momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued, with delivery of 8% core growth. Our laser focus on improving the previously acquired Dako business is paying off. The pathology business continues its steady climb back to market growth rates, with strong -- with strength in reagents and companion diagnostics.
Our nucleic acid solutions business, for which we recently announced a significant production capacity, grew double digits. This growth reflects the increasing demand for oligonucleotides for RNA-based drugs. DDG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.6%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. 
In October, there was some exciting news from Merck for lung cancer patients and for Agilent. Merck's KEYTRUDA is now approved by the FDA for first-line treatment for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer for patients with high rates of PD-L1 expression. In conjunction, Agilent's pharmDx companion diagnostics PD-L1 test is now approved for expanded use. This is the first time an Agilent's PD-L1 companion diagnostic is approved for first-line testing.
The theme of investing for our future is also evident in DDG. We launched a comprehensive offering of pooled CRISPR libraries for functional genomics. This will help accelerate research into complex diseases and drug discovery. We signed an agreement with the Burning Rock Biotech to develop cancer diagnostics in China based on Agilent SureSelect solutions. And we broke ground and initiated construction on the previously announced $120 million investment in a new factory in Colorado to expand nucleic acid production capacity.
Turning now to operating margin. We remain focused on operating margin improvement. Since the new Agilent leadership team was appointed, we have delivered 7 consecutive quarters of improved operating margin and strong growth. Despite continued challenges in the chemical and energy business, we have improved adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points in the first 2 years of the company's transformation. We have completely absorbed and offset the $40 million of dis-synergy costs due to the spin-off of Keysight.
On the operations front, our Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company and lower operating costs. This program is designed to keep us nimble, improve our interaction with customers and lower our costs. It is having an impact and will continue to deliver savings in 2017 and beyond. 
In the coming year, we will realize cost savings from the completion of the integration of Dako in early 2017, a simplified enterprise IT systems environment and other cost-savings initiatives.
Turning to our FY '17 market and company outlook. As a reminder, our shareholder value creation model for superior earnings growth is to outgrow the market and expand operating margins with a balanced deployment of our capital. Didier will go through the specifics of our Q1 '17 and full year guidance. I want to share our thinking about end markets and our initial guidance philosophy, given an environment of increased uncertainty. This is a change since our last call and the May 2016 Analyst Investor Day. 
In our end markets, we expect continued strength in pharma, accompanied by continued solid growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets. Geographically, China and India are expected to grow at significantly higher rates than other countries. There remains considerable uncertainty about European markets. We are forecasting moderate growth in the United States with the U.S. government policies and spending and chemical and energy markets being the wildcards.
Chemical and energy, while entering a period of easier compares and improved oil prices, has not yet returned to growth. We expect a continued subdued academic and government research market in the coming year until uncertainties resulting from Brexit and the U.S. elections play out. We are also keeping a watchful eye on how potential new U.S. government driven trade and currency evaluation discussions could impact our business.
We finished 2016 very strongly, and we are well positioned for future growth with a pipeline of new offerings. In our initial revenue guidance for 2017, however, we want to be on the cautious side. We want to see some more clarity on U.S. and European government actions and have better indicators of when we will return to growth in our industrial end markets. 
Predicting end-market growth in today's uncertain political and economic environment is challenging. However, I can predict quite confidently that we will continue our track record of outgrowing the market whatever market environment we encounter. We continue to expand our customer channel reach and fortify our portfolio, which strengthens us well for the coming year and beyond. 
The transformation of Agilent we discussed at the May Analyst and Investor Day is in full force. The new leadership team, put in place in early 2015, continues to deliver strong operating results each and every quarter. We are building momentum for future growth. 
We have improved our adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points over the past 2 years and our march to improved operating margins will continue in 2017. However, in our initial operating margin and earnings per share guidance for 2017, we want to be on the cautious side. Since our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting, changes in exchange rate, pension expenses and the recent iLab acquisition are having a short-term dilutive impact on our operating margins of 0.5%. The Agilent team, however, is laser-focused on improving another 130 basis points of operating margin. We have an internal action plan aligned with achieving a 22% operating margin goal in fiscal 2017, excluding M&A impact. This is the primary goal for our executive team's compensation. We continue to hold ourselves to a higher level of performance, expectations than reflected in our initial full year earnings guidance.
As you assess our future possibilities, I will leave you with a few thoughts. We are expanding our product portfolio and extending into adjacent markets. We're improving the customer experience by streamlining processes and modernizing systems, making the company more efficient and customer friendly. Our Agile Agilent program has and will continue to deliver incremental improvements in operating margin. The One Agilent team continues to work well together and is determined to win in the market. We believe we are well positioned to sustain our strong operational performance and achieve our long-term goals. The entire Agilent team is energized and committed to deliver future growth. 
Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide initial insights on our financial results and initial guidance for our fiscal Q1 and full year 2017. Didier?"

As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high end of our guidance. 
We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively; and our operating margin, adjusted for income from Keysight, was up 60 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. 
Our full year EPS at $1.98 is 14% higher than the previous year. Please note that we have reduced our pro forma tax rate by 1 percentage points, which had a $0.02 impact on our EPS. Our operating cash flow for the full year, at $793 million, reflects our strong overall performance. 
And turning to capital returns. For the first -- for the year, we returned $584 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or 89% of our free cash flow. 
I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2017. As Mike stated, our initial guidance, like last year, assumes that -- what we believe to be appropriate caution. Our fiscal year '17 revenue guidance of $4.35 billion to $4.37 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. It is based on October 31 exchange rates and currency had a 0.6 percentage point impact -- negative impact on revenues. We project fiscal year '17 adjusted operating margin of 21% to 21.5% and fiscal year '17 EPS of $2.10 to $2.16, growing 8% at midpoint. 
As you update your models for fiscal year '17, please consider the following 10 points: First, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2016. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $59 million. And as we front end the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $23 million. Third, the reduction in bond yields is negatively impacting our annual pension expenses by about $12 million. Fourth, depreciation is projected to be $104 million for the fiscal year. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 19%. Sixth, we plan to return approximately $600 million in capital to shareholders, including $170 million in dividends and $430 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Seventh, we plan to borrow $250 million in the second half to fund a portion of our capital returns. Eighth, net interest expense is forecasted at $71 million and other income at $11 million. Ninth, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 324 million shares, 5 million shares less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year '16. And finally, tenth, we expect operating cash flow of $825 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, about $60 million over fiscal year '16, mostly due to the investment in the second nucleic acid facility.
Now finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. First, please note that Lunar New Year falls in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year, meaning about $15 million of revenue shifting from Q1 to Q2. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion and EPS of $0.48 to $0.50. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% on a core basis and EPS will grow 7%. And as customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, front loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A."

We know there's a lot of interest from customers. But we also recognize the reality of constraints they may have in their capital budgets. I know they're working with their own management teams internally of these companies about what they may get in terms of funding in 2017. What are your thoughts, Patrick, on that as well?"

Looking at the GC market, we definitely are positioned very well to capture any growth opportunity there. We have launched the Intuvo, which is a strong message to all our customers that we are standing behind them when it comes to drive for lower cost of measurement, when it comes to lower cost of ownership, when it comes to increased productivity and it positions us clearly as the market leader in gas chromatography. So we are in a lot of discussions with them, not only on Intuvo, but I think what the Intuvo launch did for us, we also -- it also spread a lot of discussion again about other -- of our other part of portfolio to 7890 and other products, which are market-leading products. And again, the discussion with the customers in the suppressed market is all about how can we help them increasing their productivity, driving their cost of analysis down and this is where we are exceptionally well positioned with this portfolio."

That being said, I think if you go beyond the theory, I assume with those caveats, I think what you'd expect us to do is handle the return to cash very much along the lines of how we're managing our current use of capital. So we would want to use it for U.S.-based M&A, and we'd like to use that in situation where we've been using debt, such as our share repurchases so we would able to finance our share repurchases. And then we might look at our debt structure. But I think what we want to do is, first of all, obviously, understand what are the restrictions that could be tied to it. Also remind the group that some of the cash does need to remain permanently investment overseas. But we were -- if that particular situation would develop, we would like -- we would bring it back and use the cash very much along the lines how we've been using cash with the exception is I won't need to borrow money like I've done in the past for U.S.-based M&A or stock repurchases.

So what I'm going to tell you is the kind of factors we're thinking about. And then also give you maybe some little bit more thinking about why we guided the growth rate we did as a company. But we don't yet have a position on these issues. What we do know is there's a multitude of factors that we need to pay attention to. Regulated markets, what's going to happen to other customers in the food markets, the environmental markets, the drug -- the FDA regulatory markets? So we know there's going to be a customer impact. What's going to happen with U.S. government funding? A lot of our business is driven by U.S. government funding. What's going to happen with trade agreements? There's been a lot of noise about Chinese currency. We just talked about the tax. And will the M&A environment change in terms of -- so all I can say right now, Jonathan, is perhaps, like everybody else on this call, we kind of had a sense of the issues, but we don't know which ways these things are going to go yet, so we're not going to call them. And we're just going to -- and that's one of the reasons why we took what we believe to be a prudent, cautious initial guide to FY '17. If I look at the end markets, I mean, pharma's going to continue to be strong. But we don't believe that it can continue to grow in double digits throughout all of FY '17. So we've tapered down our expectations a bit about pharma. We also think that China has been just a -- just fantastic for us. I think our number for the year was 21% growth for the year; I'm dialing that back a bit to double digit. So what we're doing is really just trying to moderate our view of growth for next year based on what we've seen to be some pretty difficult comparisons in some markets that really have been driving the business. As I mentioned to you, the wildcard is the turn on energy. One of the things that you pointed out, Jonathan, and what I'm really delighted is, we've had 6%, close to 6% growth, 2 years in a row with our #2 market declining for 8 quarters. When that market turns, that obviously will help us in the growth.  So -- but I've learned over the first 2 years in this job, it's really hard to call in terms of major markets. So I'm not going to. And we'll just kind of keep an eye on it, and we'll update you as we go through the year, but that's our thinking about how we're viewing the U.S. election and the thought behind our end-market guidance for next year."

As you know, there's both been the companion with 1 drug and then there has been the complementary with another drug, and those have very different sizes at this point of time. I still believe that the overall PD-L1 market might end up in the same size as the HER2 market. But the difference is that HER2 is the only one -- one -- basically, one drug, one class of drug, together with one diagnostics, where the PD-L1 will be up to 5 different drugs, maybe more and 5 different diagnostic, maybe even for a lot of indications also. So this is as close as I can get to right now. The market we place in is -- or the 2 companion diagnostics that we have today continues to grow strongly. I won't say that that's the overall arching driver for the 8%. Basically, all our businesses today have a very nice growth performance, but it's definitely contributing."

And then maybe just to go back to the M&A and the margin comments. As we sort of think about the moving parts on the op margin guidance and just what you might look to do this year, how at risk is the current op margin outlook from additional M&A? I mean, obviously, it's tough to discuss these things in the abstract. But are you open to further dilution if the right asset comes along? Or do you kind of think you hold the line with the current forecasts?"

No, I think what we've said, and I'm really trying to be -- have actions that are consistent with our prior communication. We said we would look at acquisitions that could be short-term dilutive in nature, and we did one the latter part of '16. And we just love having iLab part of the portfolio. It's going to be -- it's a great addition to the business. But right now, it's not at the corporate average. We'll move it up. So if we saw other opportunities like that, we would pursue them. But I think if you want to look at the type of the deals and the size and other things, just look at what we've done so far to give you kind of a sense of the things that we're looking at going forward. We like accretive deals, and we like ones that can move up -- move the margins up."

So there's a couple of things going on, which is in terms of the overall fundamental end-market growth rates, we think biopharma and the small molecule side of pharma are both growing quite strongly. The small molecule side is really being driven by a conversion to the new technology, the liquid chromatography in particular. Also, an increasing interest in enterprise service, what we have to offer from ACG. So I think what's been going on here for Agilent, we've had a combination of really strong end-market growth. There's a new market that has and will continue to develop in the services side, and we're doing well there, along with our new instruments in the pharma. When I look at '17, we think that the biopharma side of that market is going to continue to go quite strongly. It's been an area of prioritization for us in terms of new solutions. But we do think that over time, that the small molecule stuff will start to move back towards more of its long-term growth rates. And, Patrick, I think what do we kind of think about our long-term growth rates in the small molecule side?"

What they're doing right now is in they're right in the midst of their capital budgeting process. So what I can tell you is I've had a couple conversations with customers over the last 2 or 3 weeks on this exact topic. And what they described for me is, hey, our end -- these are -- one customer was somebody who provides services into -- and equipment into the energy market. So listen, we're starting to get interest in quotes, but we're not sure whether it's going to hit in '17 or '18. When we had our VIP launch for the Intuvo 9000 GC, a lot our customers were in the chemical and energy space. And it's, ""Listen, we love this productivity message you have here. I think there's a real economic ROI. I'm now right in the midst of my budgeting process inside the company. Maybe I'll be able to get this thing through this year or maybe the following year."" Because there still seems to be the sentiment, particularly with the larger companies that they want to hold on to the equipment as long as they can before they have to replace it. So -- and again, that's why I pointed to the fact that it's not all negative because of the fact that we do have a strong service and consumables offerings into that space. But again, we just don't -- I don't think our customers know yet as well what's going to happen. We do know it's going to happen. History will repeat itself. There will be a replenishment of aged equipment. But again, we're just not confident enough right now to say when that's going to occur."
