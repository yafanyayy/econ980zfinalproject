I want to start by congratulating the entire Northrop Grumman team on another outstanding year. In addition to excellent financial results, we took some major steps to position the company for the future. We look forward to building on 2015's successes as we continue our focus on performance, portfolio and capital deployment and as we take on new opportunities in 2016.
Strong operational performance and effective cash deployment supported another year of value creation for shareholders, customers and employees. Solid margin rates from all 4 of our businesses combined to generate a segment operating margin rate of 12.4% and earnings per share of $10.39, a 7% increase. 
Free cash flow before pension contributions was $2 billion, and we returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders. In total, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $3.2 billion this year, reduced our weighted average share count by approximately 10% and completed our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015. 
At year-end, $4.3 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. Continued strong cash generation also supported our 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. We raised the quarterly dividend by 14% and paid shareholders $603 million in dividends in 2015. Total shareholder return for the year was slightly more than 30%.
The first priority of our capital deployment strategy is to invest in our businesses. 2015 capital spending totaled $471 million, and we increased our IRAD investment by 25% to $712 million or 3% of sales as we foresee significant opportunities ahead. 
In addition to strong financial results, we captured several important awards that position us well going forward. While LRSB was our most high-profile competitive win in 2015, we had several other key strategic awards. Global Hawk solidified its position as the nation's next-generation high-altitude ISR platform with a $3.2 billion ID/IQ award for development, modernization, retrofit and sustainment activities. Congressional notification was completed for Japan's purchase of Global Hawks. And we received $437 million in FMS contracts for E-2Ds for Japan. 
In the mid-altitude long endurance unmanned domain, we were selected for Phase 3 of TERN, which is a joint effort between DARPA and the Office of Naval Research to demonstrate a next-generation unmanned system for maritime ISR and strike from small deck naval vessels. This important win builds on the unique naval unmanned capabilities that we've demonstrated through programs like UCAS, Fire Scout and Triton. And as many of you know, UCAS demonstrated fully autonomous unmanned aerial refueling last year, building on prior milestones of autonomous unmanned aircraft carrier takeoffs and landings. 
Electronic Systems won important U.S. competitions like SEWIP Block 3 and CIRCM. Both wins demonstrate our success in expanding into market adjacencies. SEWIP represents our entry into next-generation sea-based electronic warfare, and CIRCM expands our infrared countermeasures presence into rotary-winged aircraft protection. These wins are domestic programs, but they have long-term potential for international sales. 
Also in Electronic Systems, SABR radars were selected for Taiwan's upgrade of its F-16 fleet. And we continue to work with Lockheed Martin on other international F-16 upgrade opportunities.
Information Systems won the Navy's award and will provide software programmable jammers to protect the war fighter from device-triggered IEDs. These systems will provide important capabilities to both the Navy and the Air Force. IS was also competitively awarded a 7-year ID/IQ contract by the U.K. government to develop and deliver cybersecurity solutions in support of data security and information assurance. 
And in Technical Services, Saudi Arabia awarded one of our joint ventures, which is consolidated by TS an approximately $950 million contract for the Ministry of National Guard training support. 
Year-end total backlog was $35.9 billion. New awards in 2015 totaled $21.3 billion. Book-to-bill was strong in IS, TS and ES. Awards in AS are generally lumpy and did not include LRS-B. And AS and ES awards did not include F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 other than long lead items. 
We continue to capture international opportunities, and at year-end, international awards represented 16% of our total backlog. As we look ahead, we have more stability on the budget front and a better budget environment we've had in several years. The Bipartisan Budget Act passed in November raised the statutory limit on the debt ceiling until March 2017 and provided much-needed relief on the BCA sequester caps in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided an increase in the procurement accounts and provides welcome funding stability for our customers. Our programs continue to be well supported, with a number of them receiving plus-ups [ph] While we have improved budgetary stability in FY 2016, the Department of Defense faces a shortfall in funding for fiscal 2017. We look forward to learning more about how this will be addressed when the DoD introduces its FY 2017 budget in the coming weeks.
Turning to guidance for 2016. We expect sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with earnings per share of $9.90 to $10.20 and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion after capital expenditures of $700 million to $1 billion. 
Our 2016 guidance is indicative of another year of strong operating performance. This year, we're beginning work on some major new development programs as we transition from a number of legacy production programs in aerospace and electronics systems to new production programs in aerospace and mission systems. 
And our restricted portfolio continues to grow, validating our technology leadership in several domains. I would note that our guidance assumes that the stop work order on LRS-B will be lifted in February, and that we will begin the ramp-up in performance on this program over the course of the year. 
So in summary, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company and for our shareholders. Going forward, our priorities remain the same: drive strong sustainable performance, generate strong cash and effectively deploy that cash and continue to optimize our portfolio to ensure our alignment with global security priorities. We continue to build on our solid track record, and we look forward to continued long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of results and our guidance. Ken?"
97199,321861868,922528,"Northrop Grumman Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Northrop Grumman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to our team on their continued outstanding work. Today, I'll briefly review 2015 results and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 2015 sales totaled $23.5 billion, slightly below our",1132,"Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to our team on their continued outstanding work. Today, I'll briefly review 2015 results and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 
2015 sales totaled $23.5 billion, slightly below our expectations, primarily due to a reduction in lower-margin material sales at Information Systems, some of which slipped into 2016. International sales increased to 14% of sales in 2015, an increase of approximately 10% over 2014 even with negative foreign exchange impacts. We expect stable international sales in 2016 as our NATO AGS program ramps down and other international programs ramp up. However, we expect international opportunities to be an important source of growth for the company over the next several years. 
Our businesses performed well and ended the year with a 12.4% segment operating margin rate. Operating performance this year is comparable to last year, considering that 2014 margin included $75 million in legal settlements and about $45 million in nonrecurring HATFA benefit. The year-over-year trends reflect strong performance by all 4 sectors, with particularly strong performance by Information Systems where margin rate increased 70 basis points over last year. 
Total operating margin rate for 2015 was 13.1% comparable to 2014. Higher net FAS/CAS adjustment was offset by an increase in unallocated corporate expenses. You'll recall that last quarter, we mentioned fourth quarter unallocated corporate expenses would be higher than last year due to the adoption of a tax method change and other state tax items. We had strong full year EPS of $10.39, which includes the benefit of the R&D credit.
Turning to cash, 2015 was another good year both in absolute dollars and on a per share basis. Free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions totaled $2 billion, and we returned $3.8 billion or $19.75 per share to shareholders through repurchases and dividends so was an outstanding year in terms of creating value for our shareholders. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect consolidated sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with a segment operating margin rate in the high 11% range.
Turning to sector guidance. We expect sales at Aerospace Systems to increase to the low $10 billion range. This reflects a low single-digit growth rate and includes higher volume for space and unmanned programs. In manned military aircraft, we will continue to see higher volume for programs like E-2D and F-35, which will be partially offset by lower volume for the F/A-18. 
Our 2016 revenue guidance for Aerospace Systems also contemplates modest LRS-B sales, assuming the customer issues a Notice to Proceed in February. It also assumes a gradual month-by-month step-up in headcount as engineering on the program gets underway. We expect a mid- to high 11% margin rate for Aerospace in 2016.
In addition to continued strong performance on our current portfolio of programs, our 2016 AS margin rate guidance reflects a booking rate approach on LRS-B that we believe is appropriate for the start of this incentive-based development contract. We will review our booking rate over time, including for potential increases as we work to retire risk and realize incentive fee milestones.
For Mission Systems, we expect 2016 revenue in the high $10 billion range, which is a stable top line. Our MS sales guidance includes international growth, modest declines in some mature production programs and some impact from in-theater force reductions. We expect MS operating margin rate in the mid- to high 12% range. 
For Technology Services, we expect sales in the mid-$4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Our 2016 sales guidance represents a low single-digit sales decline. Most of that decline is expected in our short cycle and services programs, including ICBM program rampdown. We expect the decline will be partially offset by international growth. Consolidated segment operating margin rate is expected to be in the high 11% range, reflecting a portfolio of changing business mix with less mature fixed price production revenue.
We expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12% after net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $200 million. Based on 2015 return on plan assets of negative 1%, a discount rate of 4.53% and expected 2016 return on plan assets of 8%, 2016 FAS is estimated at $585 million and CAS at $860 million. 
For 2017 and 2018, we currently expect CAS expense of approximately 1.1 -- I'm sorry, approximately $1 billion and $1.1 billion for 2018. For FAS expense, we currently expect $470 million and $400 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
And for your modeling purposes, holding all other assumptions constant, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate results in a change of approximately $70 million in FAS expense, and a 100 basis point change in plan asset returns versus our expected rate of return results in a $50 million change in FAS expense, while CAS is less sensitive to both. 
In aggregate on a GAAP basis, the funded status of our plans was 82% at the end of 2015, reflecting the impact of our higher discount rate, discretionary contributions in 2015 and actual plan asset returns. Our qualified plans are 86% funded. Our acquired contributions remain minimal, about $80 million in 2016 and 2017, increasing to about $125 million in 2018, given our current assumptions. We expect a tax rate of approximately 30% in 2016, which includes the now permanent R&D credit.
Our 2016 earnings per share guidance of $9.90 to $10.20 assumes our weighted average shares are reduced by approximately 6% to about 181 million shares. We expect 2016 free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions to range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 were lower than originally expected as we actively managed our capital spending to support requirements that slipped into 2016. In addition, for some of our 2015 spending moving into 2016, CapEx will be elevated this year due to increased programmatic requirements as well as the planned purchase of several buildings. We have leased some of these buildings for many years and now have the opportunity to purchase them. We expect these purchases to total about $300 million and to support our continued focus on cost reduction, affordability and competitiveness. 
Our guidance reflects another year of strong operating performance and strong cash generation, supportive of continued investment in our businesses and distribution of cash to our shareholders. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to note that due to the classified nature of the LRS-B program, we won't be providing any information beyond what we've said in our prepared remarks. So we will not be taking any questions on that program. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?"

When we think about the pace of technology and also quite frankly, the pace of the threats that our nation faces, we've all been frustrated over the last -- gosh, it's more than a decade now, at sort of the general slowing that we seem to see and the ability to take good ideas and turn them into reality. So part of our overall technology and development focus in the company is focused around speed because speed does matter. Speed matters to support the war fighter. Obviously, it matters as we're addressing a lot of these emerging threats that we're seeing around the globe. And we don't have to wait for a procurement program to come out for us to jump into things and to demonstrate that we can move it along a bit more quickly. We can do it that oftentimes ourselves through our internal investments. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've been increasing those internal investments. You pointed out the particular category of what we've been doing on the aircraft side. And we are especially proud of that. And we have the ability within the company to quite rapidly go from conceptual thinking to prototyping and to flying those prototypes so that we can get good early engineering information and turn that around back into the design approach that we're utilizing to bring actual products to offer to our customer community. And our scale composites organization is a really important part of that process that we utilize in our company, a really innovative and capable group at scale and have a long track record of demonstrating the speed to  product, if you will, in terms of our ability to prototype. But that's one example of a broader perspective that we have in the company, the work that we're doing to support our customers' needs for the long term needs to not only be at the high end of the technology.

And we were delighted to see that outcome and to -- be ready to go and execute that when the time comes. That will represent a meaningful opportunity, a very meaningful opportunity for the company over time. The -- but I would not want to overlook many of the other things that happened last year that are so critically important for our long-term positioning in enterprise. While Triton was not a win, if you will, last year. Last year was such a notable year in terms of its programmatic progress that I think it's important to lay that out. It's a program that we've been in development on for a number of years. And the progress that we made last year with the articles that we have flying and the testing that was being done really puts that program in a good place as we move forward this year to be ready to enter into LRIP. I think that's a really important milestone as we think about these next steps in unmanned capability, Triton representing the natural evolution from Global Hawk. And we see that as an important capability not only for our Navy customer, direct Navy customer, but I think it represents the high-altitude, long-endurance solution that's going to be sought after by many customers, including many of our allies around the globe. So that is sort of the unmanned demand, I think, is -- representative program big steps. The work that was done last year in Electronic Systems to break into some new adjacencies, I also would point out as really important work, notably the wins on SEWIP and CIRCM. The SEWIP win was one that for us was a long reach into a domain that we think is going to be incredibly important for the future, which is all the work that's being done by the Navy for advanced electronic warfare. And while over the years in the past, we've held a few smaller positions in that regard, SEWIP really does position us in that space in a new way. And we're excited about what that represents and the opportunities that will come with it. And in CIRCM, this was a move into the rotary wing adjacency for aircraft protection. We've had a long and successful run and have a great future in the fixed-wing side of things. But to move into the rotary wing side of it as well was another big step forward for us. So I'll stop there. I could keep going but I would just point those out as some of the clearly significant milestones that we encountered last year, that as we go through the course of this year, but I would say it's really more into next year as we really begin to ramp up on these things that we'll see an impact on our trajectory."

We're guiding for '16 so I don't want to get too far out in front of that. But I would go back to a point I made when Howard asked a similar question, which is if you look back over the history of the way that changes in defense spending translate into changes in the industry, I'll just say it broadly, the industry's revenue cycle, there's generally a delay. If you look back at the downturn cycle, our most recent experience in that, I think the investment accounts peaked right around 2010. And you saw the related sales industry peak a couple of years later. And I think it's just that is just a reflection of sort of the natural cycle. And if you look back in history at the up cycles, you'll see a similar situation where it simply takes a little bit of time for the decisions that the department makes on the new things that it needs to translate all the way from the appropriation cycle through to the outcome cycle. So I think this is just going to be another one of those situations everyone likes to talk about, where are we in the trough. And I think it's important to remember that the trough has a rearview mirror, which was a steep down cycle, hopefully in our rearview mirror, and it takes a little bit of time for that transition to come into effect as we climb out of that."

I think there has been a lot more attention of late into -- from a DoD perspective into where all of the sources of R&D investment that they can tap into because quite front amount of R&D appropriations that the department has had available to it to go and make its own investments has declined over the last number of years. And in many respects, is declining in exactly the wrong time, while potential adversaries are owned the globe are investing much more aggressively in R&D. So that DoD very appropriately looks to the router ecosystem that supports it and is in need of those investments being made for the long term. And I do think that it pays off. If you do it smart. If you're applying that investment in areas that turn out to be the right ones for our customers and if you can support those investments and capabilities into competitive offerings that really meet the customers' needs. So I think the model makes sense, but it requires that very high degree of engagement with our customer committee to make sure we keep that alignment."

Well, I want to start by congratulating the entire Northrop Grumman team on another outstanding year. In addition to excellent financial results, we took some major steps to position the company for the future. We look forward to building on 2015's successes as we continue our focus on performance, portfolio and capital deployment and as we take on new opportunities in 2016.
Strong operational performance and effective cash deployment supported another year of value creation for shareholders, customers and employees. Solid margin rates from all 4 of our businesses combined to generate a segment operating margin rate of 12.4% and earnings per share of $10.39, a 7% increase. Free cash flow before pension contributions was $2 billion, and we returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders. In total, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $3.2 billion this year, reduced our weighted average share count by approximately 10% and completed our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015. 
At year-end, $4.3 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. Continued strong cash generation also supported our 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. We raised the quarterly dividend by 14% and paid shareholders $603 million in dividends in 2015. Total shareholder return for the year was slightly more than 30%.
The first priority of our capital deployment strategy is to invest in our businesses. 2015 capital spending totaled $471 million, and we increased our IRAD investment by 25% to $712 million or 3% of sales as we foresee significant opportunities ahead. 
In addition to strong financial results, we captured several important awards that position us well going forward. While LRSB was our most high-profile competitive win in 2015, we had several other key strategic awards. Global Hawk solidified its position as the nation's next-generation high-altitude ISR platform with a $3.2 billion ID/IQ award for development, modernization, retrofit and sustainment activities. Congressional notification was completed for Japan's purchase of Global Hawks, and we received $437 million in FMS contracts for E-2Ds for Japan. 
In the mid-altitude, long-endurance unmanned domain, we were selected for Phase 3 of Tern, which is a joint effort between DARPA and the Office of Naval Research to demonstrate a next-generation unmanned system for maritime ISR and strike from small-deck naval vessels. This important win builds on the unique naval unmanned capabilities that we've demonstrated through programs like UCAS, Fire Scout and Triton. And as many of you know, UCAS demonstrated fully autonomous, unmanned aerial refueling last year, building on prior milestones of autonomous, unmanned aircraft carrier takeoffs and landings. 
Electronic Systems won important U.S. competitions like SEWIP Block 3 and CIRCM. Both wins demonstrate our success in expanding into market adjacencies. SEWIP represents our entry into next-generation, sea-based electronic warfare, and CIRCM expands our infrared countermeasures presence into rotary-winged aircraft protection. These wins are domestic programs, but they have long-term potential for international sales. 
Also in Electronic Systems, SABR radars were selected for Taiwan's upgrade of its F-16 fleet, and we continue to work with Lockheed Martin on other international F-16 upgrade opportunities.
Information Systems won the Navy's JCREW award and will provide software-programmable jammers to protect the war fighter from device-triggered IEDs. These systems will provide important capabilities to both the Navy and the Air Force. IS was also competitively awarded a 7-year ID/IQ contract by the U.K. government to develop and deliver cybersecurity solutions in support of data security and information assurance. 
And in Technical Services, Saudi Arabia awarded one of our joint ventures, which is consolidated by TS, an approximately $950 million contract for the Ministry of National Guard training support. 
Year-end total backlog was $35.9 billion. New awards in 2015 totaled $21.3 billion. Book-to-bill was strong in IS, TS and ES. Awards in AS are generally lumpy and did not include LRS-B. And AS and ES awards did not include F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10, other than long lead items. We continue to capture international opportunities. And at year-end, international awards represented 16% of our total backlog. 
As we look ahead, we have more stability on the budget front and a better budget environment we've had in several years. The Bipartisan Budget Act passed in November raised the statutory limit on the debt ceiling until March 2017 and provided much-needed relief on the BCA sequester caps in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided an increase in the procurement accounts and provides welcome funding stability for our customers. Our programs continue to be well supported, with a number of them receiving plus-ups. 
While we have improved budgetary stability in FY 2016, the Department of Defense faces a shortfall in funding for fiscal 2017. We look forward to learning more about how this will be addressed when the DoD introduces its FY 2017 budget in the coming weeks.
Turning to guidance for 2016. We expect sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with earnings per share of $9.90 to $10.20 and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion after capital expenditures of $700 million to $1 billion. 
Our 2016 guidance is indicative of another year of strong operating performance. This year, we're beginning work on some major new development programs as we transition from a number of legacy production programs in Aerospace and Electronic Systems to new production programs in Aerospace and Mission Systems. And our restricted portfolio continues to grow, validating our technology leadership in several domains. I would note that our guidance assumes that the stop-work order on LRS-B will be lifted in February, and that we will begin the ramp-up in performance on this program over the course of the year. 
So in summary, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company and for our shareholders. Going forward, our priorities remain the same: drive strong sustainable performance; generate strong cash and effectively deploy that cash; and continue to optimize our portfolio to ensure our alignment with global security priorities. We continue to build on our solid track record, and we look forward to continued long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of results and our guidance. Ken?"
97199,321861868,922777,"Northrop Grumman Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Northrop Grumman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to our team for their continued outstanding work. Today, I'll briefly review 2015 results, and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 2015 sales totaled $23.5 billion, slightly below o",1129,"Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to our team for their continued outstanding work. Today, I'll briefly review 2015 results, and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 
2015 sales totaled $23.5 billion, slightly below our expectations, primarily due to a reduction in lower-margin material sales at Information Systems, some of which slipped into 2016. International sales increased to 14% of sales in 2015, an increase of approximately 10% over 2014, even with negative foreign exchange impacts. We expect stable international sales in 2016 as our NATO AGS program ramps down and other international programs ramp up. However, we expect international opportunities to be an important source of growth for the company over the next several years. 
Our businesses performed well and ended the year with a 12.4% segment operating margin rate. Operating performance this year is comparable to last year, considering that 2014 margin included $75 million in legal settlements and about $45 million in nonrecurring HATFA benefit. The year-over-year trends reflect strong performance by all 4 sectors, with particularly strong performance by Information Systems where margin rate increased 70 basis points over last year. 
Total operating margin rate for 2015 was 13.1% comparable to 2014. Higher net FAS/CAS adjustment was offset by an increase in unallocated corporate expenses. You'll recall that last quarter, we mentioned fourth quarter unallocated corporate expenses would be higher than last year due to the adoption of a tax method change and other state tax items. We had strong full year EPS of $10.39, which includes the benefit of the R&D credit.
Turning to cash, 2015 was another good year, both in absolute dollars and on a per share basis. Free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions totaled $2 billion, and we returned $3.8 billion or $19.75 per share to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. So it was an outstanding year in terms of creating value for our shareholders. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we expect consolidated sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with a segment operating margin rate in the high 11% range.
Turning to sector guidance. We expect sales at Aerospace Systems to increase to the low $10 billion range. This reflects a low single-digit growth rate and includes higher volume for space and unmanned programs. In manned military aircraft, we will continue to see higher volume for programs like E-2D and F-35, which will be partially offset by lower volume for the F/A-18. 
Our 2016 revenue guidance for Aerospace Systems also contemplates modest LRS-B sales, assuming the customer issues a notice to proceed in February. It also assumes a gradual month-by-month step-up in headcounts as engineering on the program gets underway. We expect a mid- to high 11% margin rate for Aerospace in 2016.
In addition to continued strong performance on our current portfolio of programs, our 2016 AS margin rate guidance reflects a booking rate approach on LRS-B that we believe is appropriate for the start of this incentive-based development contract. We will review our booking rate over time, including for potential increases, as we work to retire risk and realize incentive fee milestones.
For Mission Systems, we expect 2016 revenue in the high $10 billion range, which is a stable top line. Our MS sales guidance includes international growth, modest declines in some mature production programs and some impact from in-theater force reductions. We expect MS operating margin rate in the mid- to high 12% range. 
For Technology Services, we expect sales in the mid-$4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Our 2016 sales guidance represents a low single-digit sales decline. Most of that decline is expected in our short cycle and services programs, including ICBM program ramp down. We expect the decline will be partially offset by international growth. Consolidated segment operating margin rate is expected to be in the high 11% range, reflecting a portfolio of changing business mix with less mature fixed-price production revenue.
We expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12% after net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $200 million. Based on 2015 return on plan assets of negative 1%, a discount rate of 4.53% and expected 2016 return on plan assets of 8%, 2016 FAS is estimated at $585 million and CAS at $860 million. 
For 2017 and 2018, we currently expect CAS expense of approximately 1.1 -- I'm sorry, approximately $1 billion and $1.1 billion for 2018. For FAS expense, we currently expect $470 million and $400 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
And for your modeling purposes, holding all other assumptions constant, a 25-basis-point change in the discount rate results in a change of approximately $70 million in FAS expense and a 100-basis-point change in plan asset returns versus our expected rate of return results in a $50 million change in FAS expense, while CAS is less sensitive to both. 
In aggregate, on a GAAP basis, the funded status of our plans was 82% at the end of 2015, reflecting the impact of our higher discount rate, discretionary contributions in 2015 and actual plan asset returns. Our qualified plans are 86% funded. Our acquired contributions remain minimal, about $80 million in 2016 and 2017, increasing to about $125 million in 2018, given our current assumptions. We expect a tax rate of approximately 30% in 2016, which includes the now-permanent R&D credit.
Our 2016 earnings per share guidance of $9.90 to $10.20 assumes our weighted average shares are reduced by approximately 6% to about 181 million shares. We expect 2016 free cash flow, before discretionary pension contributions, to range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 were lower than originally expected as we actively managed our capital spending to support requirements that slipped into 2016. In addition to some of our 2015 spending moving into 2016, CapEx will be elevated this year due to increased programmatic requirements as well as the planned purchase of several buildings. We have leased some of these buildings for many years and now have the opportunity to purchase them. We expect these purchases to total about $300 million and to support our continued focus on cost reduction, affordability and competitiveness. 
Our guidance reflects another year of strong operating performance and strong cash generation, supportive of the continued investment in our businesses and distribution of cash to our shareholders. 
Before we start the Q&A, I just want to note that due to the classified nature of the LRS-B program, we won't be providing any information beyond what we've said in our prepared remarks so we will not be taking any questions on that program. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?"

When we think about the pace of technology and also, quite frankly, the pace of the threats that our nation faces, we've all been frustrated over the last -- gosh, it's more than a decade now, at sort of the general slowing that we seem to see and the ability to take good ideas and turn them into reality. So part of our overall technology and development focus in the company is focused around speed because speed does matter. Speed matters to support the war fighter. Obviously, it matters as we're addressing a lot of these emerging threats that we're seeing around the globe. And we don't have to wait for a procurement program to come out for us to jump into things and to demonstrate that we can move it along a bit more quickly. We can deal with that, oftentimes, ourselves through our internal investments. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've been increasing those internal investments. You pointed out the particular category of what we've been doing on the aircraft side, and we are especially proud of that. We have the ability within the company to quite rapidly go from conceptual thinking to prototyping and to flying those prototypes so that we can get good, early engineering information and turn that around back into the design approach that we're utilizing to bring actual products to offer to our customer community. And our scale composites organization is a really important part of that process that we utilize in our company, a really innovative and capable group at scale and have a long track record of demonstrating the speed to product, if you will, in terms of our ability to prototype. But that's one example of a broader perspective that we have in the company. That the work that we're doing to support our customers' needs for the long term needs to not only be at the high-end of the technology, they need to be able to access it quickly and utilize it in a very effective manner."

Last year was phenomenal in terms of our positioning with some of these wins. And as I noted earlier, clearly, LRS-B, which is currently under protest so we're having to wait for that process to work its way through. But just in terms of the win itself, it was a very nice win, one that we've worked hard on for a number of years. And we were delighted to see that outcome, and to be ready to go and execute that when the time comes. That will represent a meaningful opportunity, a very meaningful opportunity for the company over time. The -- but I would not want to overlook many of the other things that happened last year that are so critically important for our long-term positioning in the enterprise. While Triton was not a win, if you will, last year, last year was such a notable year in terms of its programmatic progress, that I think it's important to lay that out. It's a program that we've been in development on for a number of years. And the progress that we made last year with the articles that we have flying and the testing that was being done really puts that program in a good place as we move forward this year to be ready to enter into LRIP. I think that's a really important milestone as we think about these next steps in unmanned capability, Triton representing the natural evolution from Global Hawk. And we see that as an important capability, not only for our Navy customer -- direct Navy customer on this, but I think it represents the high-altitude, long-endurance solution that's going to be sought after by many customers, including many of our allies around the globe. So that is sort of in the unmanned domain, I think, is representative program of the big steps. The work that was done last year in Electronic Systems to break into some new adjacencies, I also would point out, as really important work. Notably, the wins on SEWIP and CIRCM. The SEWIP win was one that, for us, was a long reach into a domain that we think is going to be incredibly important for the future, which is all the work that's being done by the Navy for advanced electronic warfare. And while over the years, in the past, we've held a few smaller positions in that regard. SEWIP really does position us in that space in a new way. And we're excited about what that represents and the opportunities that will come with it. And in CIRCM, this was a move into the rotary wing adjacency for aircraft protection. We've had a long and successful run and have a great future in the fixed-wing side of things. But to move into the rotary wing side of it as well was another big step forward for us. So I'll stop there. I could keep going. But I would just point those out as some of the clearly significant milestones that we encountered last year. That, as we go through the course of this year, but I would say it's really more into next year as we really begin to ramp up on these things, that we'll see an impact on our trajectory."

But I would go back to a point I made when Howard asked a similar question, which is if you look back over the history of the way that changes in defense spending translate into changes in the industry, I'll just say it broadly, the industry's revenue cycle, there's generally a delay. If you look back at the downturn cycle, I mean, our most recent experience in that, I think the investment accounts peaked right around 2010. And you saw the related sales and industry peak a couple of years later. And I think it's just -- that is just a reflection of sort of a natural cycle. And if you look back in history at the up cycles, you'll see a similar situation, where it simply takes a little bit of time for the decisions that the department makes on the new things that it needs to translate all the way from the appropriation cycle through to the outcome cycle. So I think this is just going to be another one of those situations. Everyone likes to talk about where are we in the trough, and I think it's important to remember that the trough has, pardon, a rearview mirror, which was a steep down cycle, hopefully in a rearview mirror.

And that represents our investing in the business for a robust set of opportunities that we see ahead of us. And I wouldn't want to give CapEx guidance beyond 2016. But in terms of the level of elevation, certainly, I wouldn't consider the $300 million and where you look at it. I do think those are more of a one-off in 2016. But certainly, we look really hard at every investment we make, and we do believe firmly these are worthwhile investments."

So I wouldn't necessarily want to put a target out there on where we are, but we certainly actively manage that. And in terms of cash guidance, I would say from a working capital perspective, I think we're looking at it as relatively stable. A lot of moving parts in working capital this year, particularly some changes in accruals and mostly timing-type items. But cash taxes, I would say that we saw a really good year for cash taxes in 2015. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be able to repeat that in 2016. So I would say a relatively higher level of cash taxes in 2016. But I would say net working capital could be a bit better than it was in 2015."

And that's really the way we think about this equation, that by investing smartly for R&D, we're going to have the products and capabilities in place that our customers need over time. This is, in many respects, is the story of our industry over a decade of cycles. That we have to be engaging with our customer community in a way that we can have insight into what their future needs are going to be because you can't just wake up one morning and say, ""I need a different class of performance than I had yesterday."" It takes time to get those capabilities in place. And we do rely on the DoD having followed through from its stated needs to actually acquiring things because that's how we get a return on those investments. We go in, and we compete. And once successfully, we win and we perform on those programs. So I don't think there's any significant difference that I would site in terms of the way that the overall model is working. I think there has been a lot more attention of late into -- from a DoD perspective, into where all of the sources of R&D investment that they can tap into because, quite frankly, the amount of R&D appropriations that the department has had available to it, to go and make its own investments, has declined over the last number of years. And in many respects, it's declining in exactly the wrong, time, while our potential adversaries around the globe are investing much more aggressively in R&D. So the DoD very appropriately looks to the broader ecosystem that supports it, and is in need of those investments being made for the long term. And I do think that it pays off if you do it smart. If you're applying that investment in areas that turn out to be the right ones for our customers, and if you can convert those investments and capabilities into competitive offerings that really meet the customers' needs. So I think the model makes sense, but it requires that very high degree of engagement with our customer committee to make sure we keep that alignment."

Well, I want to start by congratulating the entire Northrop Grumman team on another outstanding year. In addition to excellent financial results, we took some major steps to position the company for the future. We look forward to building on 2015's successes as we continue our focus on performance, portfolio and capital deployment and as we take on new opportunities in 2016.
Strong operational performance and effective cash deployment supported another year of value creation for shareholders, customers and employees. Solid margin rates from all 4 of our businesses combined to generate a segment operating margin rate of 12.4% and earnings per share of $10.39, a 7% increase. Free cash flow before pension contributions was $2 billion, and we returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders. In total, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $3.2 billion this year, reduced our weighted average share count by approximately 10% and completed our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015. 
At year-end, $4.3 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. Continued strong cash generation also supported our 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. We raised the quarterly dividend by 14% and paid shareholders $603 million in dividends in 2015. Total shareholder return for the year was slightly more than 30%.
The first priority of our capital deployment strategy is to invest in our businesses. 2015 capital spending totaled $471 million, and we increased our IRAD investment by 25% to $712 million or 3% of sales as we foresee significant opportunities ahead. 
In addition to strong financial results, we captured several important awards that position us well going forward. While LRSB was our most high-profile competitive win in 2015, we had several other key strategic awards. Global Hawk solidified its position as the nation's next-generation high-altitude ISR platform with a $3.2 billion ID/IQ award for development, modernization, retrofit and sustainment activities. Congressional notification was completed for Japan's purchase of Global Hawks, and we received $437 million in FMS contracts for E-2Ds for Japan. 
In the mid-altitude, long-endurance unmanned domain, we were selected for Phase 3 of Tern, which is a joint effort between DARPA and the Office of Naval Research to demonstrate a next-generation unmanned system for maritime ISR and strike from small-deck naval vessels. This important win builds on the unique naval unmanned capabilities that we've demonstrated through programs like UCAS, Fire Scout and Triton. And as many of you know, UCAS demonstrated fully autonomous, unmanned aerial refueling last year, building on prior milestones of autonomous, unmanned aircraft carrier takeoffs and landings. 
Electronic Systems won important U.S. competitions like SEWIP Block 3 and CIRCM. Both wins demonstrate our success in expanding into market adjacencies. SEWIP represents our entry into next-generation, sea-based electronic warfare, and CIRCM expands our infrared countermeasures presence into rotary-winged aircraft protection. These wins are domestic programs, but they have long-term potential for international sales. 
Also in Electronic Systems, SABR radars were selected for Taiwan's upgrade of its F-16 fleet, and we continue to work with Lockheed Martin on other international F-16 upgrade opportunities.
Information Systems won the Navy's JCREW award and will provide software-programmable jammers to protect the war fighter from device-triggered IEDs. These systems will provide important capabilities to both the Navy and the Air Force. IS was also competitively awarded a 7-year ID/IQ contract by the U.K. government to develop and deliver cybersecurity solutions in support of data security and information assurance. 
And in Technical Services, Saudi Arabia awarded one of our joint ventures, which is consolidated by TS, an approximately $950 million contract for the Ministry of National Guard training support. 
Year-end total backlog was $35.9 billion. New awards in 2015 totaled $21.3 billion. Book-to-bill was strong in IS, TS and ES. Awards in AS are generally lumpy and did not include LRS-B. And AS and ES awards did not include F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10, other than long lead items. We continue to capture international opportunities. And at year-end, international awards represented 16% of our total backlog. 
As we look ahead, we have more stability on the budget front and a better budget environment we've had in several years. The Bipartisan Budget Act passed in November raised the statutory limit on the debt ceiling until March 2017 and provided much-needed relief on the BCA sequester caps in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided an increase in the procurement accounts and provides welcome funding stability for our customers. Our programs continue to be well supported, with a number of them receiving plus-ups. 
While we have improved budgetary stability in FY 2016, the Department of Defense faces a shortfall in funding for fiscal 2017. We look forward to learning more about how this will be addressed when the DoD introduces its FY 2017 budget in the coming weeks.
Turning to guidance for 2016. We expect sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with earnings per share of $9.90 to $10.20 and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion after capital expenditures of $700 million to $1 billion. 
Our 2016 guidance is indicative of another year of strong operating performance. This year, we're beginning work on some major new development programs as we transition from a number of legacy production programs in Aerospace and Electronic Systems to new production programs in Aerospace and Mission Systems. And our restricted portfolio continues to grow, validating our technology leadership in several domains. I would note that our guidance assumes that the stop-work order on LRS-B will be lifted in February, and that we will begin the ramp-up in performance on this program over the course of the year. 
So in summary, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company and for our shareholders. Going forward, our priorities remain the same: drive strong sustainable performance; generate strong cash and effectively deploy that cash; and continue to optimize our portfolio to ensure our alignment with global security priorities. We continue to build on our solid track record, and we look forward to continued long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of results and our guidance. Ken?"
97199,321861868,923100,"Northrop Grumman Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Northrop Grumman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to our team for their continued outstanding work. Today, I'll briefly review 2015 results, and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 2015 sales totaled $23.5 billion, slightly below o",1129,"Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to our team for their continued outstanding work. Today, I'll briefly review 2015 results, and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 
2015 sales totaled $23.5 billion, slightly below our expectations, primarily due to a reduction in lower-margin material sales at Information Systems, some of which slipped into 2016. International sales increased to 14% of sales in 2015, an increase of approximately 10% over 2014, even with negative foreign exchange impacts. We expect stable international sales in 2016 as our NATO AGS program ramps down and other international programs ramp up. However, we expect international opportunities to be an important source of growth for the company over the next several years. 
Our businesses performed well and ended the year with a 12.4% segment operating margin rate. Operating performance this year is comparable to last year, considering that 2014 margins included $75 million in legal settlements and about $45 million in nonrecurring HATFA benefit. The year-over-year trends reflect strong performance by all 4 sectors, with particularly strong performance by Information Systems where margin rate increased 70 basis points over last year. 
Total operating margin rate for 2015 was 13.1% comparable to 2014. Higher net FAS/CAS adjustment was offset by an increase in unallocated corporate expenses. You'll recall that last quarter, we mentioned fourth quarter unallocated corporate expenses would be higher than last year due to the adoption of a tax method change and other state tax items. We had strong full year EPS of $10.39, which includes the benefit of the R&D credit.
Turning to cash, 2015 was another good year, both in absolute dollars and on a per share basis. Free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions totaled $2 billion, and we returned $3.8 billion or $19.75 per share to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. So it was an outstanding year in terms of creating value for our shareholders. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we expect consolidated sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with a segment operating margin rate in the high 11% range.
Turning to sector guidance. We expect sales at Aerospace Systems to increase to the low $10 billion range. This reflects a low single-digit growth rate and includes higher volume for space and unmanned programs. In manned military aircraft, we will continue to see higher volume for programs like E-2D and F-35, which will be partially offset by lower volume for the F/A-18. 
Our 2016 revenue guidance for Aerospace Systems also contemplates modest LRS-B sales, assuming the customer issues a notice to proceed in February. It also assumes a gradual month-by-month step-up in headcounts as engineering on the program gets underway. We expect a mid- to high 11% margin rate for Aerospace in 2016.
In addition to continued strong performance on our current portfolio of programs, our 2016 AS margin rate guidance reflects a booking rate approach on LRS-B that we believe is appropriate for the start of this incentive-based development contract. We will review our booking rate over time, including for potential increases, as we work to retire risk and realize incentive fee milestones.
For Mission Systems, we expect 2016 revenue in the high $10 billion range, which is a stable top line. Our MS sales guidance includes international growth, modest declines in some mature production programs and some impact from in-theater force reductions. We expect MS operating margin rate in the mid- to high 12% range. 
For Technology Services, we expect sales in the mid-$4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Our 2016 sales guidance represents a low single-digit sales decline. Most of that decline is expected in our short cycle and services programs, including ICBM program ramp down. We expect the decline will be partially offset by international growth. Consolidated segment operating margin rate is expected to be in the high 11% range, reflecting a portfolio of changing business mix with less mature fixed-price production revenue.
We expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12% after net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $200 million. Based on 2015 return on plan assets of negative 1%, a discount rate of 4.53% and expected 2016 return on plan assets of 8%, 2016 FAS is estimated at $585 million and CAS at $860 million. 
For 2017 and 2018, we currently expect CAS expense of approximately 1.1 -- I'm sorry, approximately $1 billion and $1.1 billion for 2018. For FAS expense, we currently expect $470 million and $400 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
And for your modeling purposes, holding all other assumptions constant, a 25-basis-point change in the discount rate results in a change of approximately $70 million in FAS expense and a 100-basis-point change in plan asset returns versus our expected rate of return results in a $50 million change in FAS expense, while CAS is less sensitive to both. 
In aggregate, on a GAAP basis, the funded status of our plans was 82% at the end of 2015, reflecting the impact of our higher discount rate, discretionary contributions in 2015 and actual plan asset returns. Our qualified plans are 86% funded. Our required contributions remain minimal, about $80 million in 2016 and 2017, increasing to about $125 million in 2018, given our current assumptions. We expect a tax rate of approximately 30% in 2016, which includes the now-permanent R&D credit.
Our 2016 earnings per share guidance of $9.90 to $10.20 assumes our weighted average shares are reduced by approximately 6% to about 181 million shares. We expect 2016 free cash flow, before discretionary pension contributions, to range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 were lower than originally expected as we actively managed our capital spending to support requirements that slipped into 2016. In addition to some of our 2015 spending moving into 2016, CapEx will be elevated this year due to increased programmatic requirements as well as the planned purchase of several buildings. We have leased some of these buildings for many years and now have the opportunity to purchase them. We expect these purchases to total about $300 million and to support our continued focus on cost reduction, affordability and competitiveness.

When we think about the pace of technology and also, quite frankly, the pace of the threats that our nation faces, we've all been frustrated over the last -- gosh, it's more than a decade now, at sort of the general slowing that we seem to see and the ability to take good ideas and turn them into reality. So part of our overall technology and development focus in the company is focused around speed because speed does matter. Speed matters to support the war fighter. Obviously, it matters as we're addressing a lot of these emerging threats that we're seeing around the globe. And we don't have to wait for a procurement program to come out for us to jump into things and to demonstrate that we can move it along a bit more quickly. We can deal with that, oftentimes, ourselves through our internal investments. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've been increasing those internal investments. You pointed out the particular category of what we've been doing on the aircraft side, and we are especially proud of that. We have the ability within the company to quite rapidly go from conceptual thinking to prototyping and to flying those prototypes so that we can get good, early engineering information and turn that around back into the design approach that we're utilizing to bring actual products to offer to our customer community. And our scale composites organization is a really important part of that process that we utilize in our company, a really innovative and capable group at scale and have a long track record of demonstrating the speed to product, if you will, in terms of our ability to prototype. But that's one example of a broader perspective that we have in the company. That the work that we're doing to support our customers' needs for the long term needs to not only be at the high-end of the technology, they need to be able to access it quickly and utilize it in a very effective manner."

Last year was phenomenal in terms of our positioning with some of these wins. And as I noted earlier, clearly, LRS-B, which is currently under protest so we're having to wait for that process to work its way through. But just in terms of the win itself, it was a very nice win, one that we've worked hard on for a number of years. And we were delighted to see that outcome, and to be ready to go and execute that when the time comes. That will represent a meaningful opportunity, a very meaningful opportunity for the company over time. The -- but I would not want to overlook many of the other things that happened last year that are so critically important for our long-term positioning in the enterprise. While Triton was not a win, if you will, last year, last year was such a notable year in terms of its programmatic progress, that I think it's important to lay that out. It's a program that we've been in development on for a number of years. And the progress that we made last year with the articles that we have flying and the testing that was being done really puts that program in a good place as we move forward this year to be ready to enter into LRIP. I think that's a really important milestone as we think about these next steps in unmanned capability, Triton representing the natural evolution from Global Hawk. And we see that as an important capability, not only for our Navy customer -- our direct Navy customer on this, but I think it represents the high-altitude, long-endurance solution that's going to be sought after by many customers, including many of our allies around the globe. So that is sort of in the unmanned domain, I think, is representative program of the big steps. The work that was done last year in Electronic Systems to break into some new adjacencies, I also would point out, as really important work. Notably, the wins on SEWIP and CIRCM. The SEWIP win was one that, for us, was a long reach into a domain that we think is going to be incredibly important for the future, which is all the work that's being done by the Navy for advanced electronic warfare. And while over the years, in the past, we've held a few smaller positions in that regard. SEWIP really does position us in that space in a new way. And we're excited about what that represents and the opportunities that will come with it. And in CIRCM, this was a move into the rotary wing adjacency for aircraft protection. We've had a long and successful run and have a great future in the fixed-wing side of things. But to move into the rotary wing side of it as well was another big step forward for us. So I'll stop there. I could keep going. But I would just point those out as some of the clearly significant milestones that we encountered last year. That, as we go through the course of this year, but I would say it's really more into next year as we really begin to ramp up on these things, that we'll see an impact on our trajectory."

We're guiding for '16 so I don't want to get too far out in front of that. But I would go back to a point I made when Howard asked a similar question, which is if you look back over the history of the way that changes in defense spending translate into changes in the industry, I'll just say it broadly, the industry's revenue cycle, there's generally a delay. If you look back at the downturn cycle, I mean, our most recent experience in that, I think the investment accounts peaked right around 2010. And you saw the related sales and industry peak a couple of years later. And I think it's just -- that is just a reflection of sort of a natural cycle. And if you look back in history at the up cycles, you'll see a similar situation, where it simply takes a little bit of time for the decisions that the department makes on the new things that it needs to translate all the way from the appropriation cycle through to the outcome cycle. So I think this is just going to be another one of those situations. Everyone likes to talk about where are we in the trough, and I think it's important to remember that the trough has, pardon, a rearview mirror, which was a steep down cycle, hopefully in a rearview mirror. And it takes a little bit of time for that transition to come into effect as we climb out of that."

First of all, great performance by the team. We also saw some, as I mentioned, of the lower level of the material sales would have a lower-than-average margin in that business. So that certainly helped contribute. In terms of looking forward for the new Technology Services sector and its strong margin rate at 10%, it did pick up a number of services business from IS that have actually above-margin rates as you look at the legacy IS business, particularly the civil and health businesses that were in IS. So as we look forward, we see Technology Services as having a strong 10% margin rate."

And then it really comes back to continuing to focus on working capital and improve our working capital position from here."

And that's really the way we think about this equation, that by investing smartly for R&D, we're going to have the products and capabilities in place that our customers need over time. This is, in many respects, is the story of our industry over a decade of cycles. That we have to be engaging with our customer community in a way that we can have insight into what their future needs are going to be because you can't just wake up one morning and say, ""I need a different class of performance than I had yesterday."" It takes time to get those capabilities in place. And we do rely on the DoD having followed through from its stated needs to actually acquiring things because that's how we get a return on those investments. We go in, and we compete. And when successful, we win and we perform on those programs. So I don't think there's any significant difference that I would site in terms of the way that the overall model is working. I think there has been a lot more attention of late into -- from a DoD perspective, into where all of the sources of R&D investment that they can tap into because, quite frankly, the amount of R&D appropriations that the department has had available to it, to go and make its own investments, has declined over the last number of years. And in many respects, it's declining in exactly the wrong, time, while our potential adversaries around the globe are investing much more aggressively in R&D. So the DoD very appropriately looks to the broader ecosystem that supports it, and is in need of those investments being made for the long term. And I do think that it pays off if you do it smart. If you're applying that investment in areas that turn out to be the right ones for our customers, and if you can convert those investments and capabilities into competitive offerings that really meet the customers' needs. So I think the model makes sense, but it requires that very high degree of engagement with our customer community to make sure we keep that alignment."

This was a good quarter and a strong start to the year, so I want to thank our employees for their unwavering focus on performance. Our team continues to execute well and position the company to achieve profitable growth over the long term. 
In the first quarter, under our realigned structure, all 3 businesses delivered strong results. To remind everyone, we undertook this realignment to better focus our innovation and affordability efforts to provide our customers enhanced mission capability at a reduced cost. By more effectively aligning and aggregating our product and services businesses, we enable greater operational synergy and enhanced our ability to develop, produce, sustain and upgrade our products over their entire life cycle. 
Sales for the quarter were comparable to last year at $6 billion. First quarter segment operating margin rate was 11.8% and supports our outlook for the year. Before the tax benefit, first quarter earnings per share would have been $2.59, a 7.5% increase over last year's first quarter. Including the tax benefit, earnings per share totaled $3.03. 
Cash from operations was a use of $60 million, substantially better than last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was a use of $358 million and includes capital spending of $298 million. The first priority of our capital deployment strategy continues to be investing our businesses to position the company for the future. 
We continue to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares. This quarter's share repurchase supports our guidance of a 6% reduction in weighted average diluted share count this year. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $4 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.
For the year, we continue to expect sales will range between $23.5 billion and $24 billion, with free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which reflects strong cash from operations and investments for the future. As a result of the tax benefit and first quarter performance, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.40 to $10.70 versus our prior guidance range of $9.90 to $10.20. 
In addition to this quarter's solid financial results, I'd also like to highlight some operational achievements. At Mission Systems, our SABR radar started flight testing for the U.S. F-16 modernization program. SABR brings fifth-generation radar capabilities to the F-16 by leveraging hardware and software commonality between our F-22 and F-35 AESA readers. MS will begin delivering SABR for international F-16 customers later this year. 
Also during the quarter, our BACN High-altitude Airborne Communications Gateway achieved 100,000 combat flight-hours and continues to provide critical communications capabilities by translating and distributing imagery, video, voice and data to enhance communications and awareness on the ground and in the air. 
At Aerospace Systems, we successfully flew a SYERS-2 sensor on a Global Hawk, the first time this sensor has been demonstrated on a high-altitude unmanned aircraft. Later this year, we expect to fly additional sensors on Global Hawk, and we expect that Global Hawk will demonstrate its flexibility for supporting a wide variety of U.S. Air Force operational requirements. 
Triton, the maritime variant of Global Hawk, continued to make good progress in its operational assessments this quarter. We look forward to a positive milestone decision that will transition Triton to low rate initial production later this year.
The highlight during the quarter was getting back to work on the B-21 program. We're pleased that the GAO confirmed that the Air Force conducted an extremely thorough selection process and chose the most capable and affordable solution. The next-generation bomber is critical to national security. It will allow significant force projection anywhere in the world and an anti-access aerial environment. We are absolutely committed to outstanding execution on this program and we are off to a strong start.
Northrop Grumman is a technology-driven company. Our team is pursuing innovation and breakthrough technologies to support the world's most technologically advanced military. A successful partnership with our customers helps to ensure military superiority. This partnership requires innovation, affordability, investment and performance. 
Investment on our part through IRAD and capital spending is critical, and performance on our part is equally important. We are increasing investments through IRAD and capital expenditures as our opportunity set has grown. And we are committed to delivering very good returns on these investments. 
Over the past several years, we've demonstrated that as a company, we can perform during a challenging down cycle. That focus is even more important as we began work on important new development programs and continue to position the company for profitable growth over the long term.
So to conclude, it was a good quarter and a solid start to 2016. Our value proposition remains the same: drive strong sustainable performance, generate cash and effectively deploy that cash. We continue to believe this is the right strategy and that it positions us for continued long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and guidance. Ken?"

Today, I'll briefly review first quarter results and provide a little more detail on our 2016 guidance. But before I do, let me provide some more detail on our realignment. 
I'll start with Aerospace Systems. The Azusa-based military and civil space business, formally in heritage ES, is now part of AS, and the Electronic Attack business formerly in AS is now part of Mission Systems. AS continues to focus on demand aircraft, autonomous systems and space business areas. 
At Mission Systems, elements of our former Information Systems portfolio that were focused on sophisticated systems architecture and engineering, including both advanced software and hardware capabilities, are now combined with our former Electronic Systems portfolio. This creates a more integrated business to support development of new capabilities for our military and intelligence customers around the globe. 
Within Mission Systems, we offer products and services in 3 major business areas: sensors and processing, cyber and ISR and advanced capabilities. Sensors and processing is the largest of the 3 and is focused on land and airborne radar, EW, C2 and efforts. Cyber and ISR encompasses a combination of work from the 2 legacy sectors, including full-spectrum cyber systems and ISR collection, processing and exploitation. 
Advanced capabilities provides integration and interoperability of net-enabled battle management, sensors, targeting and surveillance systems, air and missile defense, C2 and global battle space awareness. 
Technology Services combines the service elements of our former Information Systems sector with the former Technical Services. The new TS includes our health IT work and a majority of our civil work. Technology Services' primary focus is on life cycle support and modernization of systems and platforms as well as advanced training. The business areas within TS are global logistics and modernization, advanced defense services and system modernization services.
Turning to our financial results. Our first quarter EPS included an $80 million or $0.44 per share tax benefit. We early adopted an accounting standard update that requires recognition of excess tax benefits and efficiencies related to share-based payments as either income tax expense or benefit in the P&L, depending on whether the stock compensation awards vest at, above or below the grand price. In addition, the update requires these items now be presented in operating cash flow rather than as a financing item. Even before the benefit of the accounting update, we had a solid quarter.
Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 3% to approximately $2.6 billion due to higher volume for manned aircraft and autonomous systems. In manned aircraft, we continue to ramp up on the E-2D program, including production for Japan's first aircraft. Higher F-35 sales also contributed as we delivered 13 units this quarter versus 9 in last year's first quarter. 
Increases on these programs were partially offset by lower volume for the B-2 as well as fewer F/A-18 deliveries than in the prior period. As expected, we delivered 7 F/A-18s this quarter versus 9 in last year's first quarter. Higher revenue autonomous systems included higher volume for Global Hawk and Triton. Global Hawk volume reflects the upgrade activities Wes mentioned earlier as well as production activity on Korea's Global Hawk. Triton volume continues to increase as we progress towards low-rate initial production.
Space sales were comparable to the prior year period. Aerospace Systems's operating income declined compared to last year's first quarter and operating margin rate was 11.1%. First quarter operating income reflects lower margins on several manned aircraft programs, with the primary driver being the timing of risk reductions. 
For 2016, we continue to expect Aerospace sales in the low $10 billion range, with a mid- to high 11% margin rate, no change from prior guidance. 
Mission Systems first quarter sales were comparable to the prior year at approximately $2.7 billion. Operating income increased 3%, and operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Sales reflect lower volume for cyber and ISR programs, partially offset by higher volume for sensors and processing and advanced capabilities programs. For 2016, we continue to expect Mission System sales in the high $10 billion range, with an operating margin rate in the mid- to high 12% range, no change from prior guidance.
Technology Services sales declined 4% principally due to continued rampdown on the ICBM program as well as lower volume for restricted programs. Operating income declined in line with sales, and operating margin rate was comparable to last year at 10.4%. For 2016, we continue to expect sales in the $4 billion range -- excuse me, mid-$4 billion range, with the margin rate of approximately 10%, no change from prior guidance.
As Wes mentioned, our segment operating margin rate for the quarter was 11.8%, which is a good start towards our full year guidance of high 11% for the year. Total operating margin rate of 12.4% was strong, and we continue to expect total operating margin rate of about 12% for the full year. Our net FAS/CAS adjustment is unchanged at $275 million for the year, and we continue to expect unallocated corporate expenses of about $200 million. As a result of the $80 million tax benefit, our effective tax rate declined to 17.8% for the quarter, and for the full year, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27%.
Our updated 2016 earnings per share guidance of $10.40 to $10.70 reflects a $0.50 increase to the top and bottom of the range and continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to about 181 million shares. 
We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $298 million and includes $159 million for the purchase of a building previously leased by Mission Systems. In addition to the building we purchased in the first quarter, we expect to close on another facility in the second quarter.
I'll conclude my remarks with a discussion on awards and backlog. During the first quarter of 2016, the company's total backlog increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems and a modest decline in backlog at Technology Services. 
The company recorded various awards during the quarter, including a portion of the B-21 Long-range Strike Bomber program. We intend to report backlog and awards on a full year basis for the company and each sector in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. We also intend to provide qualitative information on a quarterly basis, similar to this quarter's disclosure until year-end. 
Before we begin Q&A, I would also remind everyone that beyond the statements in our prepared remarks, we have no additional information to share on the B-21 award or the program in general. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?"

But we get a lot of questions from investors about -- we've seen all the new business wins, and we think the top line can grow, but we hear concerned that margins will go down because of all of that new business. And when I map it out, I see -- it seems pretty likely your F-35 business margins will improve. When I map out your unmanned business, it looks like margin's going to improve pretty significantly there because there's such a big mix shift to procurement from development and to international. And so I think people kind of get concerned that the bomber being a new large development program will be pretty dilutive to the margin. But when I look at it, because Bomber stays so much smaller than those other programs, total unmanned, F-35 and some others for a while, I actually arrive at the total company having segment margin expansion pretty much every year for the next kind of 3 to 5 years. I know you probably don't want to give specific annual guidance, but just directionally, is that in a scenario analysis? Am I missing anything with the margin trajectory?"

And I would say that I wouldn't say that you're missing anything in terms of analysis of the fact that we've got a lot of moving parts. We do have a well-diversified portfolio and we've got some business that, you're right, should be driving towards some higher margins. We have been realizing margins on F-35 that are below what we expect for a program at that level of maturity. And we certainly expect as we move towards more mature production that we would realize higher margins in that area. Autonomous Systems, we do see some international business that's moving into production as well as Triton hopefully moving out of development and into LRIP. So we would expect to see the potential for some higher margins there. Now that being said, we do have a fair amount of development work that we're taking on, whether that's B-21 or some of the other strategic items that Wes mentioned, whether that's SABR or SEWIP or G/ATOR or others. And in some respects, the question is what's going to move first and at what velocity among those various moving parts? And I would say that overall, certainly some pressures on margin rates as development programs grow. But as you mentioned, we do have a more mature production that's also going to be growing in terms of dollars. The other one I probably should have mentioned is E-2 that's now into multiyear production. So we'll continue to work on it. I see it as being kind of range-bound into a reasonable range. We have the opportunity to continue to perform. And we also need to work to try to offset the pressure that'll come from the development margins."

Let me just give you a sense on how I see things with respect to our Mission Systems business. So our strategy in putting the parts of the legacy Electronic Systems and legacy Information Systems business together that we combined to create MS was precisely around, I think, what you're getting to, which is growth. There's opportunity in that market space over the longer term by integrating those capabilities together in innovative ways that I think will help position us quite nicely to do exactly what our customer needs us to do, which is to give them more capability at lower cost. And when I think about the core product lines in there, the areas that I see as having really good growth opportunities clearly communications. The work that we do in creating software-defined capabilities for communications is extensive, and we're continuing to see great demand in that area. Certainly, combat avionics is a big part of the growth equation in MS. Cyber, as we've talked about for some time, is another area that's growing well. And I think you're all familiar with the fact that we have not only had a good IRCM business for some time, but last year, with our capture of the CIRCM contract, that added to our portfolio of opportunity in that countermeasures business. So all of those areas are, I think, examples of the types of businesses where we see really good growth prospects going forward in MS. Ken, was there anything you like to add on?"

We do historically review our dividend for whether there'll be an increase at the May meeting of the board so that is upcoming. I would say that we've had a history of dividend increases for a number of years, and we will consider that between now and that meeting. I would just comment that in terms of chasing dividend yield, we're not -- we don't make a practice of chasing yield. I would note that our yield is lower than some of our peers primarily because of stock price performance as opposed to dividend historical increases. We tend to think of dividend in terms of a payout ratio, and that payout ratio being pension adjusted net earnings. And we believe if you look at our dividend in that light, you'll see that we're in a competitive range within our peer group. And that's the light in which we'll continue to analyze this for the foreseeable future."

We've got the material in what we have released that we're going to be able to disclose on it. I really appreciate your question on growth and performance because it is a topic that we've been spending quite a bit of time on within our company and not just recently having won a number of activities or something that we've been working hard and prepared for, for a long period of time. And the actions that we've taken over the last several years with respect to our focus on execution performance on our programs, I think, is serving us very well in that regard. I know a lot of folks sort of looked at the margin expansion that we had over the last few years and thought, ""Well, that's just cost reduction."" Well, clearly, cost discipline is an important part of it, but I will tell you the big driver for all of those margin expansions was actually better performance, better program execution. And that discipline in the company has steadily been increasing. And it is the focal point for just about every engagement we have with our leadership team in terms of the actions that we need to be taking collectively to further enhance our ability to execute. So when we look at our new programs, the programs that we're taking on, we approach each of them from the perspective our how do we manage the inherent risk that goes with a new development activity. And first and foremost, that means being very clear about what all those risks really are, getting them out in the table as transparently as possible for all of us to focus on. And then secondly, ensuring that we have very strong risk management capabilities and practices baked in for everything that we take on. That's the discipline that we're driving in our execution. In addition to our work in terms of being able to execute more effectively, I would say that there are some very positive trends in our customer community that are helping in this regard. And one of the ones that I would point out is requirement stability. There's a lot of work that's been done over the last few years as a result of the efforts both at the OSD level and in each of the services to enhance the acquisition team's ability to hold the requirements stable, because we all know when it comes to these development programs, a major source of cost growth and schedule extension historically has been requirements instability. And we simply as a nation can't afford that anymore. In order to execute well, we need to be able to keep the requirements stable. We need to, of course, drive the execution with great discipline from the companies. And I have to give the services and OSD a lot of credit for their attention to requirement stability. I think that's going to help a lot. Now there's a third component to this that is also really important and that is funding stability. And given the volatility that we've seen in the budgeting process over the last few years, this is an area where we need Congress to help as well. We need that stability to be able to execute well. And when we get funding volatility on programs, that too can ripple the outcomes. So this is a matter of focus across the board. It requires all the players, both the industry, the customer community and the Congress to play their role in making this program successful. And we're certainly determined to do our part. And I've been encouraged by what I've seen both in the Pentagon and on the Hill with respect to the various defense committees recognizing the importance of all of these aspects to ensure we can execute well. But it's clearly right at the very top of the list of actions that we have within our company to drive good solid execution."

In terms of your -- the second part of the question on pluses and minuses in revenues at Aerospace, I would say again, a fair number of moving parts in terms of what's declining. Probably the biggest piece of decline would be F-18. As that program ramps down, I think we're down to a 2 per month sort of delivery schedule. The other areas where we've seen a bit of decline in 2016 versus last year would be nonrestricted space, particularly AEHF and James Webb Space Telescope. In terms of adds to volume, we do expect that F-35 will start to ramp here at some point and we're looking forward to when that occurs.

It's kind of a reflection of the way we think about motivating our team. Clearly, if you look at the budgets that have been approved, '16 in terms of the investment accounts domestically here, were up about 14% over '15. And '17, while not quite as robust in terms of the present budget relative to '16 is still up and noticeably from where we've been in '15. Some question obviously about whether or not Congress can move beyond this 2-year process of getting past the Budget Control Act or the sequester and get us into a more stable long-term effect. But if you do look at the present budget, it puts the investment accounts in a more robust position. I think you might argue whether or not it's robust enough, given what's going on around the globe. Given that, from a company perspective, we see our portfolio as being very well positioned to take advantage of that healthier environment to better support our customers with the products and services they really need to address that tough threat environment that's out there. And so we are looking at that aspect of our incentive plan. Even though it's stated on an annual basis as something that we are integrating more into the thinking in the company and the way that we're going to incentivize ourselves over time to make sure that we're translating this improved market opportunity space into actual increases in net income over a period of years. So we tend to use our annual incentive plan as a way of ensuring alignment within the company around the way we're thinking about what we need to get done. You might recall a few years ago when we were taking on this initial thrust to change our outcomes on operating margin rates, we stepped that up incrementally over the course of several years, but it was a very strong communication within the company around this is our area of focus and this is the outcome we need to achieve. And it was very effective. And I expect that as we go forward and focus on this transition in the market environment, that we'll be able to generate a very positive outcome by ensuring that our team is focused on growing the bottom line, not just the top line. We need to make sure we bring the bottom line with us as we're growing over time. I would not describe this as an either/or on capital deployment or net income growth. We do anticipate maintaining a very strong focus on returning cash to shareholders. How we do that over the course of time always varies a little bit. But as I think you've heard both Ken and I say on our recent calls, share repurchase will continue to be a very important part of our strategy as well as having a competitive dividend from a payout ratio perspective. So we look at all of these elements of value creation as being very important. But I think you put your finger on it the right way in your question. As we look at the change in market conditions, it will be important for us to incentivize our team to make sure that we are growing the bottom line as well as the top line."

We've got the center fuselage, the radar, distributed aperture system and the CNI, communications navigation identification suite. And various aspects of those are in negotiation with Lockheed Martin, but I would say that on the -- what folks tend to think of as our main stepping the center fuselage, which is our single-largest contract, we are negotiated through LRIP 8, continuing to work hard to get LRIPs 9 and 10 negotiated, just working through the details with those with our customer. In terms of the question on the rev rec standard, very good question. We are on units of delivery for all 4 of our contracts on F-35. And we also have other units of delivery contracts. F-18 is one and some others within Mission Systems. We do expect that when we adopt a new rev rec standard, which should be in the first quarter of 2018, we would transition from units of delivery on each of those contracts to a cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition. That being said, we do not expect, and looking at the profile of those contracts that are on units of delivery and where they're going to be in their life cycle, we don't expect that the revenue recognized in that period should be significantly different from what would be recognized on a units of delivery basis. That being -- the reason for that is that the cost throughput ultimately is pretty consistent with the unit flow that we see. So there could be some impact and there certainly will be some impact, but we have not, at this point, seen that as particularly significant for the adoption of that new standard in 2018."

So I would say that some of it is the buildings that we've talked about, and some of it is just kind of continued spend on the existing projects, much of which is either centers of excellence or program-related. But for the most part, if they're program, they support multiple programs and not just a single. In terms of depreciation, what I would say is that we don't look at our indirect rates on a piece-by-piece or line-by-line basis. We manage our as a piece of our total cost. And just because depreciation may be going up doesn't mean that we have an excuse to let our indirect rates increase. So we'll manage and we'll continue to manage this as we have as a component of total cost. And to the extent depreciation is up, we'll have to find other areas where we'll realize cost savings. I think a great example of that is just if you look within the capital itself, the capital for the building we purchased in the first quarter and the capital for the building that we intend to purchase in the second quarter will result in depreciation charges that are significantly less than the rent expense on those buildings. So there will be direct savings in the -- I shouldn't say direct. There will be savings in the indirect pools right there that would be a component of how we would offset those increases in depreciation charges going forward. But we certainly see that as something we'll be able to manage as we have in the past, aggressively looking at holding our indirect rates. And then in terms of the range for CapEx, we certainly looked hard at that here as we're giving guidance for the first quarter. We believe it's appropriate to hold our range where it is. Still a number of moving parts and a fair amount of time between now and the end of the year. But if we see some additional clarity on that between now and the end of the second quarter call, we'll certainly update that range as appropriate."

I think the thing to keep in mind with IRAD, these are decisions that each company has to make on how it invests to position itself for the longer term. And that really is the framework that we look at when we think about IRAD. We want us to -- we drive the process internally to really test, are we making smart investments that really have the opportunity, not just tomorrow or if you -- sometimes, even just within a couple of years, but over the long term, are these investments that are going to really generate the opportunity to enhance our ability to support our customer and result in profitable growth for the enterprise? So there's a lot of judgment that goes into making those investments. We look across the full array of customer needs. And in response to the second part of your question, I would say all of our customers are looking at a threat environment that is going to require that they bring more innovation to the game to their -- the products that they're out acquiring, they're going to need more innovation to ensure that we're going to be able to put forward a military capability that truly is differentiated technologically. So it isn't just one area. There are -- probably all of the areas you mentioned plus many more are representative of our customers' needs today to really enhance their capability to address their very difficult and challenging missions, particularly as we look around the globe and see many other countries investing on the technology front as well in that regard. So this is a core part of what we do, our fundamental business model. We invest, we bring brilliant scientists and engineers, mathematicians together to figure out how to help our customers stay ahead. We don't want there ever to be a case where our servicemen and women have to go into a fair fight when it comes to the technology capabilities. We want to be way ahead. So these are fundamental investment decisions that we make. And given this growth and complexity that our customers are facing, I think it is incumbent on us collectively across our industry to be investing appropriately. You saw us take our IRAD investments up over the last couple of years up into the 3% range. And I anticipate going forward, we'll be at that higher level of investment because we see the business imperative, both through our customers' eyes and through the eyes of generating returns on those investments. So long as we can make smart investments, apply those funds in the right direction and bring together the right human capital, we should be in a really good position to support our customers' needs. So that's the lens through which we see it. I know that there has been a fair amount of public discourse about the need for both industry, and quite frankly, government to be spending more on investment. But I think it's just a reflection of the reality of the threat environment. So we're stepping up. We certainly need government to step up in terms of this investment in fundamental R&D and product development. But I think this is something that's just a clear imperative and supports getting the right types of returns on those investments over time."

As we look at the underlying capabilities that will be required to support essentially any meaningful unmanned operation off the deck of an aircraft carrier, we're absolutely delighted with the groundwork that's been laid by the X-47B program, taking off the deck of an aircraft carrier. That's -- without a human in the loop is a neat trick unto itself. But landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier is a really neat trick. And we're the only company that's done that. It's something magnitude of capability. So we see ourselves as well positioned to support whatever the mission requirement that the Navy derives for unmanned operations on and off the deck of aircraft carriers, and we're going to continue to work hard to support the Navy on this. Clearly, there are some differences that go with the variability of whatever the mission might be. Strike, as I think about it from a long-term perspective, is going to continue to be really, really important. The Navy is concerned as well about surveillance and reconnaissance with carrier asset. And they've chosen to focus this next round of activity on refueling, which is also a really important mission for the Navy. So in all of those cases, they are mission variance, but the underlying technology, the capability to design and build and reliably operate an autonomous, a truly autonomous system in that type of environment, that's something that we've made a lot of progress on. X-47B was important for the Navy in terms of demonstrating that this really could be done. And I think C bars and future variants of that type of unmanned capability are going to be really important opportunities for Northrop Grumman."

This was a good quarter and a strong start to the year, so I want to thank our employees for their unwavering focus on performance. Our team continues to execute well and position the company to achieve profitable growth over the long term.
In the first quarter, under our realigned structure, all 3 businesses delivered strong results. To remind everyone, we undertook this realignment to better focus our innovation and affordability efforts to provide our customers enhanced mission capability at a reduced cost. By more effectively aligning and aggregating our product and services businesses, we enabled greater operational synergy; and enhanced our ability to develop, produce, sustain and upgrade our products over their entire life cycle.
Sales for the quarter were comparable to last year at $6 billion. First quarter segment operating margin rate was 11.8% and supports our outlook for the year. Before the tax benefit, first quarter earnings per share would have been $2.59, a 7.5% increase over last year's first quarter. Including the tax benefit, earnings per share totaled $3.03. Cash from operations was a use of $60 million, substantially better than last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was a use of $358 million and includes capital spending of $298 million. The first priority of our capital deployment strategy continues to be investing in our businesses to position the company for the future.
We continued to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares. This quarter's share repurchase pace supports our guidance of a 6% reduction in weighted average diluted share count this year. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $4 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.
For the year, we continue to expect sales will range between $23.5 billion and $24 billion, with free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which reflects strong cash from operations and investments for the future. As a result of the tax benefit and first quarter performance, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.40 to $10.70 versus our prior guidance range of $9.90 to $10.20.
In addition to this quarter's solid financial results, I'd also like to highlight some operational achievements. At Mission Systems, our SABR radar started flight testing for the U.S. F-16 modernization program. SABR brings fifth-generation radar capabilities to the F-16 by leveraging hardware and software commonality between our F-22 and F-35 AESA radars. MS will begin delivering SABR for international F-16 customers later this year. Also during the quarter, our BACN high-altitude airborne communications gateway achieved 100,000 combat flight hours; and continues to provide critical communications capabilities by translating and distributing imagery, video, voice and data to enhance communications and awareness on the ground and in the air.
At Aerospace Systems, we successfully flew a SYERS-2 sensor on a Global Hawk, the first time this sensor has been demonstrated on a high-altitude unmanned aircraft. Later this year, we expect to fly additional sensors on Global Hawk. And we expect that Global Hawk will demonstrate its flexibility for supporting a wide variety of U.S. Air Force operational requirements. Triton, the maritime variant of Global Hawk, continued to make good progress in its operational assessments this quarter. We look forward to a positive milestone C decision that will transition Triton to low-rate initial production later this year.
The highlight during the quarter was getting back to work on the B-21 program. We're pleased that the GAO confirmed that the Air Force conducted an extremely thorough selection process and chose the most capable and affordable solution. The next-generation bomber is critical to national security. It will allow significant force projection anywhere in the world and an anti-access aerial environment. We are absolutely committed to outstanding execution on this program, and we are off to a strong start.
Northrop Grumman is a technology-driven company. Our team is pursuing innovation and breakthrough technologies to support the world's most technologically advanced military. A successful partnership with our customers helps to ensure military superiority. This partnership requires innovation, affordability, investment and performance. Investment on our part through IRAD and capital spending is critical, and performance on our part is equally important. We are increasing investments through IRAD and capital expenditures, as our opportunity set has grown. And we are committed to delivering very good returns on these investments. Over the past several years, we've demonstrated that as a company we can perform during a challenging down cycle. That focus is even more important, as we began work on important new development programs and continue to position the company for profitable growth over the long term.
So to conclude. It was a good quarter and a solid start to 2016. Our value proposition remains the same: drive strong, sustainable performance; generate cash; and effectively deploy that cash. We continue to believe this is the right strategy; and that it positions us for continued long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.
So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and guidance. Ken?"

And good afternoon, everyone.
I want to add my thanks to our team on their continued outstanding work.
Today, I'll briefly review the first quarter results and provide a little more detail on our 2016 guidance, but before I do, let me provide some more detail on our realignment.
And I'll start with Aerospace Systems. The Azusa-based military and civil space business, formally in heritage ES, is now part of AS. And the electronic attack business formerly in AS is now part of Mission Systems. AS continues to focus on demand aircraft, autonomous systems and space business areas.
At Mission Systems, elements of our former Information Systems portfolio that were focused on sophisticated systems architecture and engineering, including both advanced software and hardware capabilities, are now combined with our former Electronic Systems portfolio. This creates a more integrated business to support development of new capabilities for our military and intelligence customers around the globe. Within Mission Systems, we offer products and services in 3 major business areas: Sensors and Processing, Cyber and ISR and Advanced Capabilities. Sensors and Processing is the largest of the 3; and is focused on land and airborne radar, EW, C2 and SIGINT efforts. Cyber and ISR encompasses a combination of work from the 2 legacy sectors, including full-spectrum cyber systems and ISR collection, processing and exploitation. Advanced Capabilities provides integration and interoperability of net-enabled battle management, sensors, targeting and surveillance systems, air and missile defense C2 and global battle space awareness.
Technology Services combines the service elements of our former Information Systems sector with the former Technical Services. The new TS includes our health IT work and a majority of our civil work. Technology Services' primary focus is on life cycle support and modernization of systems and platforms as well as advanced training. The business areas within TS are Global Logistics and Modernization, Advanced Defense Services and System Modernization and Services.
Turning to our financial results.
Our first quarter EPS included an $80 million or a $0.44 per share tax benefit. We early adopted an accounting standard update that requires recognition of excess tax benefits and efficiencies related to share-based payments as either income tax expense or benefit in the P&L, depending on whether the stock compensation awards vest at, above or below the grand price. In addition, the update requires these items now be presented in operating cash flow rather than as a financing item. Even before the benefit of the accounting update, we had a solid quarter.
Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 3% to approximately $2.6 billion due to higher volume for Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems. In Manned Aircraft, we continued to ramp up on the E-2D program, including production for Japan's first aircraft. Higher F-35 sales also contributed, as we delivered 13 units this quarter versus 9 in last year's first quarter. Increases on these programs were partially offset by lower volume for the B-2 as well as fewer F/A-18 deliveries than in the prior period. As expected, we delivered 7 F/A-18s this quarter versus 9 in last year's first quarter. Higher revenue in Autonomous Systems included higher volume for Global Hawk and Triton. Global Hawk volume reflects the upgrade activities Wes mentioned earlier as well as production activity on Korea's Global Hawk. Triton volume continues to increase as we progress toward low-rate initial production. Space sales were comparable to the prior year period.
Aerospace Systems' operating income declined compared to last year's first quarter, and operating margin rate was 11.1%. First quarter operating income reflects lower margins on several Manned Aircraft programs, with the primary driver being the timing of risk reductions. For 2016, we continue to expect aerospace sales in the low $10 billion range, with a mid- to high-11% margin rate, no change from prior guidance.
Mission Systems first quarter sales were comparable to the prior year at approximately $2.7 billion. Operating income increased 3%, and operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Sales reflect lower volume for Cyber and ISR programs, partially offset by higher volume for Sensors and Processing and Advanced Capabilities programs. For 2016, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, with an operating margin rate in the mid- to high-12% range, no change from prior guidance.
Technology Services sales declined 4% principally due to continued ramp-down on the ICBM program as well as lower volume for restricted programs. Operating income declined in line with sales, and operating margin rate was comparable to last year at 10.4%. For 2016, we continue to expect sales in the $4 billion range -- excuse me, mid-$4 billion range, with a margin rate of approximately 10%, no change from prior guidance.
As Wes mentioned, our segment operating margin rate for the quarter was 11.8%, which is a good start towards our full year guidance of high 11% for the year. Total operating margin rate of 12.4% was strong, and we continue to expect total operating margin rate of about 12% for the full year. Our net FAS/CAS adjustment is unchanged at $275 million for the year, and we continue to expect unallocated corporate expenses of about $200 million. As a result of the $80 million tax benefit, our effective tax rate declined to 17.8% for the quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27%.
Our updated 2016 earnings per share guidance of $10.40 to $10.70 reflects a $0.50 increase to the top and bottom of the range and continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to about 181 million shares.
We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016.
First quarter capital expenditures totaled $298 million and includes $159 million for the purchase of a building previously leased by Mission Systems. In addition to the building we purchased in the first quarter, we expect to close on another facility in the second quarter.
I'll conclude my remarks with a discussion on awards and backlog. During the first quarter of 2016, the company's total backlog increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems and a modest decline in backlog at Technology Services. The company recorded various awards during the quarter, including a portion of the B-21 long-range strike bomber program. We intend to report backlog and awards on a full year basis for the company and each sector in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. We also intend to provide qualitative information on a quarterly basis, similar to this quarter's disclosure, until year-end.
Before we begin Q&A, I would also remind everyone that, beyond the statements and our prepared remarks, we have no additional information to share on the B-21 award or the program in general.
I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?"

And so I think people kind of get concerned that the bomber being a new large development program will be pretty dilutive to the margin, but when I look at it, because bomber stays so much smaller than those other programs, total unmanned and F-35 and some others, for a while, I actually arrive at the total company having segment margin expansion pretty much every year for the next kind of 3 to 5 years. I know you probably don't want to give specific annual guidance, but just directionally, is that in a scenario analysis? Am I missing anything with the margin trajectory?"

And I would say that I wouldn't say that you're missing anything in terms of analysis of the fact that we've got a lot of moving parts. We do have a well-diversified portfolio. And we've got some business that, you're right, should be driving towards some higher margins. We have been realizing margins on F-35 that are below what we expect for a program at that level of maturity. And we certainly expect as we move towards more mature production that we would realize higher margins in that area. Autonomous Systems, we do see some international business that's moving into production; as well as Triton, hopefully, moving out of development and into LRIP, so we would expect to see the potential for some higher margins there. Now that being said, we do have a fair amount of development work that we're taking on, whether that's B-21 or some of the other strategic items that Wes mentioned, whether that's SABR or SEWIP or G/ATOR or others. And in some respects, the question is what's going to move first and at what velocity, among those various moving parts? And I would say that, overall, certainly some pressures on margin rates as development programs grow, but as you mentioned, we do have more mature production that's also going to be growing in terms of dollars. The other one I probably should have mentioned is E-2. That's now into multiyear production. So we'll continue to work on it. I see it as being kind of range bound into a reasonable range. We have the opportunity to continue to perform. And we also need to work to try to offset the pressure that'll come from the development margins."

Let me just give you kind of a sense on how I see things with respect to our Mission Systems business. So our strategy in putting the parts of the legacy Electronic Systems and legacy Information Systems business together that we combined to create MS was precisely around, I think, what you're getting to, which is growth. There's opportunity in that market space over the longer term by integrating those capabilities together in innovative ways that I think will help position us quite nicely to do exactly what our customer needs us to do, which is to give them more capability at lower cost. And when I think about the core product lines in there, the areas that I see as having really good growth opportunities: clearly, communications. The work that we do in creating software-defined capabilities for communications is extensive, and we're continuing to see a great demand in that area. Certainly, combat avionics is a big part of the growth equation in MS. Cyber, as we've talked about for some time, is another area that's growing well. And I think you're all familiar with the fact that we have not only had a good IRCM business for some time, but last year, with our capture of the CIRCM contract, that added to our portfolio of opportunity in that countermeasures business. So all of those areas are, I think, examples of the types of businesses where we see really good growth prospects going forward in MS. Ken, was there anything you'd like to add on that?"

We've got the material in what we have released that we're going to be able to disclose on it. I really appreciate your question on growth and performance because it is a topic that we've been spending quite a bit of time on within our company and not just recently having won a number of activities or something that we've been working hard to be prepared for, for a long period of time. And the actions that we've taken over the last several years with respect to our focus on execution performance on our programs, I think, is serving us very well in that regard. I know a lot of folks sort of looked at the margin expansion that we had over the last few years and thought, ""Well, that's just cost reduction."" Well, clearly, cost discipline is an important part of it, but I will tell you the big driver for all of those margin expansions was actually better performance, better program execution. And that discipline in the company has steadily been increasing, and it is the focal point for just about every engagement we have with our leadership team in terms of the actions that we need to be taking collectively to further enhance our ability to execute. So when we look at our new programs, the programs that we're taking on, we approach each of them from the perspective of how do we manage the inherent risk that goes with a new development activity. And first and foremost, that means being very clear about what all those risks really are, getting them out on the table as transparently as possible for all of us to focus on; and then secondly, ensuring that we have very strong risk management capabilities and practices baked in for everything that we take on. That's the discipline that we're driving in our execution. In addition to our work in terms of being able to execute more effectively, I will say that there are some very positive trends in our customer community that are helping in this regard. And one of the ones that I would point out is requirement stability. There's a lot of work that's been done over the last few years as a result of the efforts both at the OSD level and in each of the services to enhance the acquisition team's ability to hold the requirements stable. Because we all know, when it comes to these development programs, a major source of cost growth and schedule extension historically has been requirements instability, and we simply as a nation can't afford that anymore. In order to execute well, we need to be able to keep the requirements stable. We need to, of course, drive the execution with great discipline from the companies. And I have to give their services in OSD a lot of credit for their attention to requirement stability. I think that's going to help a lot. Now there's a third component to this that is also really important, and that is funding stability. And given the volatility that we've seen in the budgeting process over the last few years, this is an area where we need Congress to help as well. We need that stability to be able to execute well. And when we get funding volatility on programs, that too can ripple the outcomes, so this is a matter of focus across-the-board. It requires all the players, both the industry, the customer community and the Congress, to play their role in making this program successful. And we're certainly determined to do our part. And I've been encouraged by what I've seen both in the Pentagon and on the Hill with respect to the various defense committees recognizing the importance of all of these aspects to ensure we can execute well. But it's clearly right at the very top of the list of actions that we have within our company: to drive good, solid execution."

And in terms of your -- the second part of the question, on pluses and minuses in revenues at aerospace, it's I would say again a fair number of moving parts in terms of what's declining. Probably the biggest piece of decline would be F-18. As that program ramps down, I think we're down to a 2-per-month sort of delivery schedule. The other areas where we've seen a bit of decline in 2016 versus last year would be nonrestricted space, particularly AEHF and James Webb Space Telescope. And in terms of adds to volume, we do expect that F-35 will start to ramp here at some point, and we're looking forward to when that occurs.

It's kind of a reflection of the way we think about motivating our team. Clearly, if you look at the budgets that have been approved, '16 were -- in terms of the investment accounts domestically here, were up about 14% over '15. And '17, while not quite as robust in terms of the president's budget relative to '16, is still up noticeably from where we have been in '15. Some question obviously about whether or not Congress can move beyond this 2-year process of getting past the Budget Control Act or the sequester and get us into a more stable long-term factor, but if you do look at the president's budget, it puts the investment accounts in a more robust position. I think you might argue whether or not it's robust enough given what's going on around the globe. Given that, from a company perspective, we see our portfolio as being very well positioned to take advantage of that healthier environment to better support our customers with the products and services they really need to address that tough threat environment that's out there. And so we are looking at the -- that aspect of our incentive plan, even though it's stated on an annual basis, as something that we are integrating more into the thinking in the company and the way that we're going to incentivize ourselves over time to make sure that we're translating this improved market opportunity space into actual increases in net income over a period of years. So we tend to use our annual incentive plan as a way of ensuring alignment within the company around the way we're thinking about what we need to get done. You might recall a few years ago, when we were taking on this initial thrust to change our outcomes on operating margin rates, we stepped that up incrementally over a course of several years but it was a very strong communication within the company around this is our area of focus and this is the outcome we need to achieve. And it was very effective. And I expect that -- as we go forward and focus on this transition in the market environment, that we'll be able to generate a very positive outcome by ensuring that our team is focused on growing the bottom line, not just the top line. We need to make sure we bring the bottom line with us as we're growing over time. I would not describe this as an either/or on capital deployment or net income growth. We do anticipate maintaining a very strong focus on returning cash to shareholders. How we do that over the course of time always varies a little bit, but as I think you've heard both Ken and I say on our recent calls, share repurchase will continue to be a very important part of our strategy as well as having a competitive dividend from a payout ratio perspective. So we look at all of these elements of value creation as being very important, but I think you put your finger on it the right way in your question. As we look at changing market conditions, it will be important for us to incentivize our team to make sure that we are growing the bottom line as well as the top line."

Thanks, David, for the question. I would say a couple things. I guess, first, to answer your question on where we stand on contracts, just a reminder, we do have 4 main contracts on F-35 with Lockheed Martin. We've got the center fuselage; the radar, distributed aperture system; and the CNI, communications, navigation and identification, suite. And various aspects of those are in negotiation with Lockheed Martin, but I would say that, on the -- what folks tend to think of as our main piece is having the center fuselage, which is our single largest contract. We are negotiated through LRIP 8, continuing to work hard to get LRIPs 9 and 10 negotiated, just working through the details with those with our customer. In terms of the question on the rev rec standard, very good question, we are on units of delivery for all 4 of our contracts on F-35. And we also have other units-of-delivery contracts. F-18 is one, and some others within Mission Systems. We do expect that, when we adopt the new rev rec standard, which should be in the first quarter of 2018, we would transition from units of delivery on each of those contracts to a cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition. That being said, we do not expect -- and looking at the profile of those contracts that are on units of delivery and where they're going to be in their life cycle, we don't expect that the revenue recognized in that period should be significantly different from what would be recognized on a units-of-delivery basis. That being -- the reason for that is that the cost throughput ultimately is pretty consistent with the unit flow that we see. So there could be some impact, and there certainly will be some impact, but we have not at this point seen that as particularly significant for the adoption of that new standard in 2018."

And what I would say is, yes, that the building certainly was a significant piece of that. The other piece of it, I think, is just continued projects that we've been working through in 2015. And you can think of those as generally being related to either some of the centers of excellence work that we've been undertaking here in the last couple years; as well as some that are programmatic in nature in general, supporting multiple programs, whether it's programs that are in production. And we're seeing some relatively solid production numbers in front of us where we determine we can invest. A great example of that would be the St. Augustine aircraft integration center, where we invested ahead of the E-2D multiyear program because we saw that there was a relatively stable base of production for a relative long period of time. So I would say that some of it is the buildings that we've talked about. And some of it is just kind of continued spend on the existing projects, much of which is either centers of excellence or program related, but for the most part, if they're program, they support multiple programs and not just a single. In terms of depreciation, what I would say is that we don't look at our indirect rates on a piece-by-piece or a line-by-line basis. We manage our indirects as a piece of our total cost. And just because depreciation may be going up doesn't mean that we have an excuse to let our indirect rates increase, so we'll manage and we'll continue to manage this as we have as a component of total cost. And to the extent depreciation is up, we'll have to find other areas where we'll realize cost savings. I think a great example of that is just, if you look within the capital itself, the capital for the building we purchased in the first quarter and the capital for the building that we intend to purchase in the second quarter will result in depreciation charges that are significantly less than the rent expense on those buildings, so there will be direct savings in the -- I shouldn't say direct. There will be savings in the indirect pools right there that would be a component of how we would offset those increases in depreciation charges going forward. But we certainly see that as something we'll be able to manage as we have in the past, aggressively looking at holding our indirect rates. And then in terms of the range for CapEx, we certainly looked hard at that here as we were giving guidance for the first quarter. We believe it's appropriate to hold our range where it is. Still a number of moving parts and a fair amount of time between now and the end of the year, but if we see some additional clarity on that between now and the end of the Second Quarter Call, we'll certainly update that range as appropriate."

I think, the thing to keep in mind with IRAD, these are decisions that each company has to make on how it invests to position itself for the longer term. And that really is the framework that we look at when we think about IRAD. We want us to -- we drive the process internally to really test are we making smart investments that really have the opportunity not just tomorrow or if you -- sometimes even just within a couple years, but over the long term, are these investments that are going to really generate the opportunity to enhance our ability to support our customer and result in profitable growth for the enterprise? So there's a lot of judgment that goes into making those investments. We look across the full array of customer needs. And in response to the second part of your question, I would say all of our customers are looking at a threat environment that is going to require that they bring more innovation to the game, to their -- the products that they're out acquiring. They're going to need more innovation to ensure that we're going to be able to put forward a military capability that truly is differentiated technologically. So it isn't just one area. There -- probably all of the areas you mentioned, plus many more, are representative of our customers' needs today to really enhance their capability to address their very difficult and challenging missions, particularly as we look around the globe and see many other countries investing on the technology front as well in that regard. So this is a core part of what we do, our fundamental business model. We invest. We bring brilliant scientists and engineers, mathematicians together to figure out how to help our customers stay ahead. We don't want there ever to be a case where our servicemen and women have to go into a fair fight when it comes to the technology capabilities. We want to be way ahead. So these are fundamental investment decisions that we make, and given this growth in complexity that our customers are facing, I think it is incumbent on us collectively across our industry to be investing appropriately. You saw us take our IRAD investments up over the last couple of years, up into the 3% range. And I anticipate, going forward, we'll be at that higher level of investment because we see the business imperative both through our customers' eyes and through the eyes of generating returns on those investments. So long as we can make smart investments, apply those funds in the right direction and bring together the right human capital, we should be in a really good position to support our customers' needs. So that's the lens through which we see it. I know that there has been a fair amount of public discourse about the need for both industry and, quite frankly, government to be spending more on investment, but I think it's just a reflection of the reality of the threat environment. So we're stepping up. We certainly need government to step up in terms of this investment in fundamental R&D and in product development, but I think this is something that's just a clear imperative and supports getting the right types of returns on those investments over time."

As we look at the underlying capabilities that will be required to support essentially any meaningful unmanned operation off the deck of an aircraft carrier, we're absolutely delighted with the groundwork that's been laid by the X-47B program. Taking off the deck of an aircraft carrier, that's from a -- without a human in the loop, is a neat trick unto itself, but landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier is a really neat trick. And we're the only company that's done that, so it's something of magnitude of capability. So we see ourselves as well positioned to support whatever the mission requirement that the Navy derives for unmanned operations on and off the deck of aircraft carriers, and we're going to continue to work hard to support the Navy on this. Clearly, there are some differences that go with the variability of whatever the mission might be. Strike, as I think about it from a long-term perspective, is going to continue to be really, really important. The Navy is concerned as well about surveillance and reconnaissance with kind of visions carrier asset. And they've chosen to focus this next round of activity on refueling, which is also a really important mission for the Navy. So in all of those cases, they are mission variants, but the underlying technology, the capability to design and build and reliably operate an autonomous, a truly autonomous, system in that type of environment, that's something that we've made a lot of progress on. X-47B was important for the Navy in terms of demonstrating that this really could be done. And I think C bars and future variants of that type of unmanned capability are going to be really important opportunities for Northrop Grumman."

This was a good quarter and a strong start to the year, so I want to thank our employees for their unwavering focus on performance. Our team continues to execute well and position the company to achieve profitable growth over the long term.
In the first quarter, under our realigned structure, all 3 businesses delivered strong results. To remind everyone, we undertook this realignment to better focus our innovation and affordability efforts to provide our customers enhanced mission capability at a reduced cost. By more effectively aligning and aggregating our product and services businesses, we enabled greater operational synergy and enhanced our ability to develop, produce, sustain and upgrade our products over their entire life cycle.
Sales for the quarter were comparable to last year at $6 billion. First quarter segment operating margin rate was 11.8% and supports our outlook for the year. Before the tax benefit, first quarter earnings per share would have been $2.59, a 7.5% increase over last year's first quarter. Including the tax benefit, earnings per share totaled $3.03. Cash from operations was a use of $60 million, substantially better than last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was a use of $358 million and includes capital spending of $298 million. The first priority of our capital deployment strategy continues to be investing in our businesses to position the company for the future.
We continued to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares. This quarter's share repurchase pace supports our guidance of a 6% reduction in weighted average diluted share count this year. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $4 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. For the year, we continue to expect sales will range between $23.5 billion and $24 billion, with free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which reflects strong cash from operations and investments for the future. As a result of the tax benefit and first quarter performance, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.40 to $10.70 versus our prior guidance range of $9.90 to $10.20.
In addition to this quarter's solid financial results, I'd also like to highlight some operational achievements. At Mission Systems, our SABR radar started flight testing for the U.S. F-16 modernization program. SABR brings fifth-generation radar capabilities to the F-16 by leveraging hardware and software commonality between our F-22 and F-35 AESA radars. MS will begin delivering SABR for international F-16 customers later this year. Also during the quarter, our BACN high-altitude airborne communications gateway achieved 100,000 combat flight hours; and continues to provide critical communications capabilities by translating and distributing imagery, video, voice and data to enhance communications and awareness on the ground and in the air.
At Aerospace Systems, we successfully flew a SYERS-2 sensor on a Global Hawk, the first time this sensor has been demonstrated on a high-altitude unmanned aircraft. Later this year, we expect to fly additional sensors on Global Hawk. And we expect that Global Hawk will demonstrate its flexibility for supporting a wide variety of U.S. Air Force operational requirements. Triton, the maritime variant of Global Hawk, continued to make good progress in its operational assessments this quarter. We look forward to a positive milestone C decision that will transition Triton to low-rate initial production later this year.
The highlight during the quarter was getting back to work on the B-21 program. We're pleased that the GAO confirmed that the Air Force conducted an extremely thorough selection process and chose the most capable and affordable solution. The next-generation bomber is critical to national security. It will allow significant force projection anywhere in the world in an anti-access aerial denial environment. We are absolutely committed to outstanding execution on this program, and we are off to a strong start.
Northrop Grumman is a technology-driven company. Our team is pursuing innovation and breakthrough technologies to support the world's most technologically advanced military. A successful partnership with our customers helps to ensure military superiority. This partnership requires innovation, affordability, investment and performance. Investment on our part through IRAD and capital spending is critical, and performance on our part is equally important. We are increasing investment through IRAD and capital expenditures, as our opportunity set has grown. And we are committed to delivering very good returns on these investments. Over the past several years, we've demonstrated that as a company we can perform during a challenging down cycle. That focus is even more important, as we began work on important new development programs and continue to position the company for profitable growth over the long term.
So to conclude, it was a good quarter and a solid start to 2016. Our value proposition remains the same: drive strong, sustainable performance; generate cash; and effectively deploy that cash. We continue to believe this is the right strategy; and that it positions us for continued long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.
So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and guidance. Ken?"

Within Mission Systems, we offer products and services in 3 major business areas: Sensors and Processing, Cyber and ISR and Advanced Capabilities. Sensors and Processing is the largest of the 3; and is focused on land and airborne radar, EW, C2 and SIGINT efforts. Cyber and ISR encompasses a combination of work from the 2 legacy sectors, including full-spectrum cyber systems and ISR collection, processing and exploitation. Advanced Capabilities provides integration and interoperability of net-enabled battle management, sensors, targeting and surveillance systems, air and missile defense C2 and global battle space awareness.
Technology Services combines the service elements of our former Information Systems sector with the former Technical Services. The new TS includes our health IT work and a majority of our civil work. Technology Services' primary focus is on life cycle support and modernization of systems and platforms as well as advanced training. The business areas within TS are Global Logistics and Modernization, Advanced Defense Services and System Modernization and Services.
Turning to our financial results. Our first quarter EPS included an $80 million or $0.44 per share tax benefit. We early adopted an accounting standard update that requires recognition of excess tax benefits and efficiencies related to share-based payments as either income tax expense or benefit in the P&L, depending on whether the stock compensation awards vest at, above or below the grant price. In addition, the update requires these items now be presented in operating cash flow rather than as a financing item. Even before the benefit of the accounting update, we had a solid quarter.
Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 3% to approximately $2.6 billion due to higher volume for Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems. In Manned Aircraft, we continued to ramp up on the E-2D program, including production for Japan's first aircraft. Higher F-35 sales also contributed, as we delivered 13 units this quarter versus 9 in last year's first quarter. Increases on these programs were partially offset by lower volume for the B-2 as well as fewer F/A-18 deliveries than in the prior period. As expected, we delivered 7 F/A-18s this quarter versus 9 in last year's first quarter. Higher revenue in Autonomous Systems included higher volume for Global Hawk and Triton. Global Hawk volume reflects the upgrade activities Wes mentioned earlier as well as production activity on Korea's Global Hawk. Triton volume continues to increase as we progress toward low-rate initial production. Space sales were comparable to the prior year period.
Aerospace Systems' operating income declined compared to last year's first quarter, and operating margin rate was 11.1%. First quarter operating income reflects lower margins on several Manned Aircraft programs, with the primary driver being the timing of risk reductions. For 2016, we continue to expect aerospace sales in the low $10 billion range, with a mid- to high-11% margin rate, no change from prior guidance.
Mission Systems first quarter sales were comparable to the prior year at approximately $2.7 billion. Operating income increased 3%, and operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Sales reflect lower volume for Cyber and ISR programs, partially offset by higher volume for Sensors and Processing and Advanced Capabilities programs. For 2016, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, with an operating margin rate in the mid- to high-12% range, no change from prior guidance.
Technology Services sales declined 4% principally due to continued ramp-down on the ICBM program as well as lower volume for restricted programs. Operating income declined in line with sales, and operating margin rate was comparable to last year at 10.4%. For 2016, we continue to expect sales in the $4 billion range -- excuse me, mid-$4 billion range, with a margin rate of approximately 10%, no change from prior guidance.
As Wes mentioned, our segment operating margin rate for the quarter was 11.8%, which is a good start towards our full year guidance of high 11% for the year. Total operating margin rate of 12.4% was strong, and we continue to expect total operating margin rate of about 12% for the full year. Our net FAS/CAS adjustment is unchanged at $275 million for the year, and we continue to expect unallocated corporate expenses of about $200 million. As a result of the $80 million tax benefit, our effective tax rate declined to 17.8% for the quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27%.
Our updated 2016 earnings per share guidance of $10.40 to $10.70 reflects a $0.50 increase to the top and bottom of the range and continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to about 181 million shares. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $298 million and includes $159 million for the purchase of a building previously leased by Mission Systems. In addition to the building we purchased in the first quarter, we expect to close on another facility in the second quarter.
I'll conclude my remarks with a discussion on awards and backlog. During the first quarter of 2016, the company's total backlog increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems and a modest decline in backlog at Technology Services. The company recorded various awards during the quarter, including a portion of the B-21 long-range strike bomber program. We intend to report backlog and awards on a full year basis for the company and each sector in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. We also intend to provide qualitative information on a quarterly basis, similar to this quarter's disclosure, until year-end.
Before we begin Q&A, I would also remind everyone that, beyond the statements and our prepared remarks, we have no additional information to share on the B-21 award or the program in general.
I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?"

But we get a lot of questions from investors about, we've seen all the new business wins, and we think the top line can grow, but we hear concern that margins will go down because of all that new business. And when I map it out, I see it seems pretty likely your F-35 business margins will improve. When I map out your unmanned business, it looks like margin is going to improve pretty significantly there because there's such a big mix shift to procurement from development and to international. And so I think people kind of get concerned that the bomber being a new large development program will be pretty dilutive to the margin. But when I look at it, because bomber stays so much smaller than those other programs, total unmanned and F-35 and some others, for a while, I actually arrive at the total company having segment margin expansion pretty much every year for the next kind of 3 to 5 years. I know you probably don't want to give specific annual guidance, but just directionally, is that in a scenario analysis? Am I missing anything with the margin trajectory?"

And we've got some business that, you're right, should be driving towards some higher margins. We have been realizing margins on F-35 that are below what we expect for a program at that level of maturity. And we certainly expect as we move towards more mature production that we would realize higher margins in that area. Autonomous Systems, we do see some international business that's moving into production; as well as Triton, hopefully, moving out of development and into LRIP, so we would expect to see the potential for some higher margins there. Now that being said, we do have a fair amount of development work that we're taking on, whether that's B-21 or some of the other strategic items that Wes mentioned, whether that's SABR or SEWIP or G/ATOR or others. And in some respects, the question is what's going to move first and at what velocity, among those various moving parts? And I would say that, overall, certainly some pressures on margin rates as development programs grow, but as you mentioned, we do have more mature production that's also going to be growing in terms of dollars. The other one I probably should have mentioned is E-2. That's now into multiyear production. So we'll continue to work on it. I see it as being kind of range bound into a reasonable range. We have the opportunity to continue to perform. And we also need to work to try to offset the pressure that'll come from the development margins."

Let me just give you kind of a sense of how I see things with respect to our Mission Systems business. So our strategy in putting the parts of the legacy Electronic Systems and legacy Information Systems business together that we combined to create MS was precisely around, I think, what you're getting to, which is growth. There's opportunity in that market space over the longer term by integrating those capabilities together in innovative ways that I think will help position us quite nicely to do exactly what our customer needs us to do, which is to give them more capability at lower cost. And when I think about the core product lines in there, the areas that I see as having really good growth opportunities: clearly, communications. The work that we do in creating software-defined capabilities for communications is extensive, and we're continuing to see a great demand in that area. Certainly, combat avionics is a big part of the growth equation in MS. Cyber, as we've talked about for some time, is another area that's growing well. And I think you're all familiar with the fact that we have not only had a good IRCM business for some time, but last year, with our capture of the CIRCM contract, that added to our portfolio of opportunity in that countermeasures business. So all of those areas are, I think, examples of the types of businesses where we see really good growth prospects going forward in MS. Ken, was there anything you'd like to add on that?"

We've got the material in what we have released that we're going to be able to disclose on it. I really appreciate your question on growth and performance because it is a topic that we've been spending quite a bit of time on within our company. And not just recently having won a number of activities, it's something that we've been working hard to be prepared for, for a long period of time. And the actions that we've taken over the last several years with respect to our focus on execution performance on our programs, I think, is serving us very well in that regard. I know a lot of folks sort of looked at the margin expansion that we had over the last few years and thought, ""Well, that's just cost reduction."" Well, clearly, cost discipline is an important part of it. But I will tell you the big driver for all of those margin expansions was actually better performance, better program execution. And that discipline in the company has steadily been increasing, and it is the focal point for just about every engagement we have with our leadership team in terms of the actions that we need to be taking collectively to further enhance our ability to execute. So when we look at our new programs, the programs that we're taking on, we approach each of them from the perspective of how do we manage the inherent risk that goes with a new development activity. And first and foremost, that means being very clear about what all those risks really are, getting them out on the table as transparently as possible for all of us to focus on; and then secondly, ensuring that we have very strong risk management capabilities and practices baked in for everything that we take on. That's the discipline that we're driving in our execution. In addition to our work in terms of being able to execute more effectively, I would say that there are some very positive trends in our customer community that are helping in this regard. And one of the ones that I would point out is requirement stability. There's a lot of work that's been done over the last few years as a result of the efforts both at the OSD level and in each of the services to enhance the acquisition team's ability to hold the requirements stable. Because we all know, when it comes to these development programs, a major source of cost growth and schedule extension historically has been requirements instability, and we simply as a nation can't afford that anymore. In order to execute well, we need to be able to keep the requirements stable. We need to, of course, drive the execution with great discipline from the companies. And I have to give their services in OSD a lot of credit for their attention to requirement stability. I think that's going to help a lot. Now there's a third component to this that is also really important, and that is funding stability. And given the volatility that we've seen in the budgeting process over the last few years, this is an area where we need Congress to help as well. We need that stability to be able to execute well. And when we get funding volatility on programs, that too can ripple the outcomes. So this is a matter of focus across-the-board. It requires all the players, both the industry, the customer community and the Congress, to play their role in making this program successful. And we're certainly determined to do our part. And I've been encouraged by what I've seen both in the Pentagon and on the Hill with respect to the various defense committees recognizing the importance of all of these aspects to ensure we can execute well. But it's clearly right at the very top of the list of actions that we have within our company: to drive good, solid execution."

We do manage this business for the long term, and no concerns about the B-2 or where it is. I would say overall we expect B-2 volume to be relatively consistent, in 2016, with where it was in 2015, somewhere in the $700 million range in terms of sales volume. In terms of your -- the second part of the question, on pluses and minuses in revenues at aerospace, it's I would say again a fair number of moving parts in terms of what's declining. Probably the biggest piece of decline would be F-18. As that program ramps down, I think we're down to a 2-per-month sort of delivery schedule. The other areas where we've seen a bit of decline in 2016 versus last year would be non-restricted space, particularly AEHF and James Webb Space Telescope. In terms of adds to volume, we do expect that F-35 will start to ramp here at some point, and we're looking forward to when that occurs. The B-21 long-range strike bomber is certainly something that we would see as ramping here; and as I mentioned, the E-2D program that is now into the multiyear production. We talked about Triton moving into LRIP. And then I would say, a number of restricted activities."

It's kind of a reflection of the way we think about motivating our team. Clearly, if you look at the budgets that have been approved, '16 in terms of the investment accounts domestically here, were up about 14% over '15. And '17, while not quite as robust in terms of the President's budget relative to '16, is still up noticeably from where we've been in '15. Some question obviously about whether or not Congress can move beyond this 2-year process of getting past the Budget Control Act or the sequester and get us into a more stable long-term factor, but if you do look at the President's budget, it puts the investment accounts in a more robust position. I think you might argue whether or not it's robust enough given what's going on around the globe. Given that, from a company perspective, we see our portfolio as being very well positioned to take advantage of that healthier environment to better support our customers with the products and services they really need to address that tough threat environment that's out there. And so we are looking at the -- that aspect of our incentive plan, even though it's stated on an annual basis, as something that we are integrating more into the thinking in the company and the way that we're going to incentivize ourselves over time to make sure that we're translating this improved market opportunity space into actual increases in net income over a period of years. So we tend to use our annual incentive plan as a way of ensuring alignment within the company around the way we're thinking about what we need to get done. You might recall a few years ago, when we were taking on this initial thrust to change our outcomes on operating margin rates, we stepped that up incrementally over a course of several years. But it was a very strong communication within the company around this is our area of focus and this is the outcome we need to achieve. And it was very effective. And I expect that -- as we go forward and focus on this transition in the market environment, that we'll be able to generate a very positive outcome by ensuring that our team is focused on growing the bottom line, not just the top line. We need to make sure we bring the bottom line with us as we're growing over time. I would not describe this as an either/or on capital deployment or net income growth. We do anticipate maintaining a very strong focus on returning cash to shareholders. How we do that over the course of time always varies a little bit. But as I think you've heard both Ken and I say on our recent calls, share repurchase will continue to be a very important part of our strategy as well as having a competitive dividend from a payout ratio perspective. So we look at all of these elements of value creation as being very important. But I think you put your finger on it the right way in your question, as we look at changing market conditions, it will be important for us to incentivize our team to make sure that we are growing the bottom line as well as the top line."

Thanks, David, for the question. I would say a couple things. I guess, first, to answer your question on where we stand on contracts, just a reminder, we do have 4 main contracts on F-35 with Lockheed Martin. We've got the center fuselage; the radar; distributed aperture system; and the CNI, communications, navigation and identification, suite. And various aspects of those are in negotiation with Lockheed Martin, but I would say that on the -- what folks tend to think of as our main piece, that being the center fuselage, which is our single largest contract. We are negotiated through LRIP 8, continuing to work hard to get LRIPs 9 and 10 negotiated, just working through the details with those with our customer. In terms of the question on the rev rec standard, very good question. We are on units of delivery for all 4 of our contracts on F-35. And we also have other units-of-delivery contracts. F-18 is one, and some others within Mission Systems. We do expect that when we adopt the new rev rec standard, which should be in the first quarter of 2018, we would transition from units of delivery on each of those contracts to a cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition. That being said, we do not expect -- in looking at the profile of those contracts that are on units of delivery and where they're going to be in their life cycle, we don't expect that the revenue recognized in that period should be significantly different from what would be recognized on a units-of-delivery basis. That being -- the reason for that is that the cost throughput ultimately is pretty consistent with the unit flow that we see. So there could be some impact, and there certainly will be some impact, but we have not at this point seen that as particularly significant for the adoption of that new standard in 2018."

And what I would say is, yes, the building certainly was a significant piece of that. The other piece of it, I think, is just continued projects that we've been working through in 2015. And you can think of those as generally being related to either some of the centers of excellence work that we've been undertaking here in the last couple years; as well as some that are programmatic in nature, in general, supporting multiple programs, whether it's programs that are in production. And we're seeing some relatively solid production numbers in front of us where we determine we can invest. A great example of that would be the St. Augustine aircraft integration center, where we invested ahead of the E-2D multiyear program because we saw that there was a relatively stable base of production for a relative long period of time. So I would say that some of it is the buildings that we've talked about. And some of it is just kind of continued spend on the existing projects, much of which is either centers of excellence or program related, but for the most part, if they're program, they support multiple programs and not just a single. In terms of depreciation, what I would say is that we don't look at our indirect rates on a piece-by-piece or line-by-line basis. We manage our indirects as a piece of our total cost. And just because depreciation may be going up doesn't mean that we have an excuse to let our indirect rates increase, so we'll manage and we'll continue to manage this as we have as a component of total cost. And to the extent depreciation is up, we'll have to find other areas where we'll realize cost savings. I think a great example of that is just, if you look within the capital itself, the capital for the building we purchased in the first quarter and the capital for the building that we intend to purchase in the second quarter will result in depreciation charges that are significantly less than the rent expense on those buildings, so there will be direct savings in the -- I shouldn't say direct. There will be savings in the indirect pools right there that would be a component of how we would offset those increases in depreciation charges going forward. But we certainly see that as something we'll be able to manage as we have in the past, aggressively looking at holding our indirect rates. And then in terms of the range for CapEx, we certainly looked hard at that here as we were giving guidance for the first quarter. We believe it's appropriate to hold our range where it is. Still a number of moving parts and a fair amount of time between now and the end of the year, but if we see some additional clarity on that between now and the end of the Second Quarter Call, we'll certainly update that range as appropriate."

I think, the thing to keep in mind with IRAD, these are decisions that each company has to make on how it invests to position itself for the longer term. And that really is the framework that we look at when we think about IRAD. We want us to -- we drive the process internally to really test are we making smart investments that really have the opportunity not just tomorrow or if you -- sometimes even just within a couple years, but over the long term, are these investments that are going to really generate the opportunity to enhance our ability to support our customer and to result in profitable growth for the enterprise? So there's a lot of judgment that goes into making those investments. We look across the full array of customer needs. And in response to the second part of your question, I would say all of our customers are looking at a threat environment that is going to require that they bring more innovation to the game, to their -- the products that they're out acquiring. They're going to need more innovation to ensure that we're going to be able to put forward a military capability that truly is differentiated technologically. So it isn't just one area. There -- probably all of the areas you mentioned, plus many more, are representative of our customers' needs today to really enhance their capability to address their very difficult and challenging missions, particularly as we look around the globe and see many other countries investing on the technology front as well in that regard. So this is a core part of what we do, our fundamental business model. We invest. We bring brilliant scientists and engineers, mathematicians together to figure out how to help our customers stay ahead. We don't want there ever to be a case where our servicemen and women have to go into a fair fight when it comes to the technology capabilities. We want to be way ahead. So these are fundamental investment decisions that we make. And given this growth in complexity that our customers are facing, I think it is incumbent on us collectively across our industry to be investing appropriately. You saw us take our IRAD investments up over the last couple of years, up into the 3% range. And I anticipate, going forward, we'll be at that higher level of investment because we see the business imperative both through our customers' eyes and through the eyes of generating returns on those investments. So long as we can make smart investments, apply those funds in the right direction and bring together the right human capital, we should be in a really good position to support our customers' needs. So that's the lens through which we see it. I know that there has been a fair amount of public discourse about the need for both industry and, quite frankly, government to be spending more on investment, but I think it's just a reflection of the reality of the threat environment. So we're stepping up. We certainly need government to step up in terms of this investment in fundamental R&D and in product development, but I think this is something that's just a clear imperative and supports getting the right types of returns on those investments over time."

As we look at the underlying capabilities that will be required to support essentially any meaningful unmanned operation off the deck of an aircraft carrier, we're absolutely delighted with the groundwork that's been laid by the X-47B program. Taking off the deck of an aircraft carrier, that's from a -- without a human in the loop, is a neat trick unto itself. But landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier is a really neat trick. And we're the only company that's done that, so it's something of magnitude of capability. So we see ourselves as well positioned to support whatever the mission requirement that the Navy derives for unmanned operations on and off the deck of aircraft carriers, and we're going to continue to work hard to support the Navy on this. Clearly, there are some differences that go with the variability of whatever the mission might be. Strike, as I think about it from a long-term perspective, is going to continue to be really, really important. The Navy is concerned as well about surveillance and reconnaissance with a munitions carrier asset. And they've chosen to focus this next round of activity on refueling, which is also a really important mission for the Navy. So in all of those cases, they are mission variants, but the underlying technology, the capability to design and build and reliably operate an autonomous, a truly autonomous, system in that type of environment. That's something that we've made a lot of progress on. X-47B was important for the Navy in terms of demonstrating that this really could be done. And I think C bars and future variants of that type of unmanned capability are going to be really important opportunities for Northrop Grumman."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a very strong second quarter, driven by solid operational execution and effective cash deployment. I want to thank our team for their unwavering focus on performance.",775,"All right. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a very strong second quarter, driven by solid operational execution and effective cash deployment. I want to thank our team for their unwavering focus on performance. 
Second quarter sales totaled $6 billion, 2% higher than last year's second quarter, driven by growth at both Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. At Aerospace Systems, we're reaching an inflection point where new programs and the planned ramp-ups on production programs are beginning to outpace declines on mature legacy programs. 
While we may see some variability in that trend going forward, the growth in manned and autonomous systems drove a 4% second quarter sales increase. The programs driving sales include our restricted programs, the production ramp-up on F-35, Triton and volume Global Hawk as we begin production for international customers. These growing programs are more than offsetting the expected declines in AS programs such as NATO ATS, F/A-18, Advanced EHF and James Webb Space Telescope. 
Sales at Mission Systems grew in the second quarter, driven by higher volume for restricted programs and ramp-ups on programs like F-35, G/ATOR, SEWIP Block 3, JCREW and CIRCM. We delivered our first CIRCM systems in June, and we expect this program to continue ramping up. 
The reorganization at Technology Services at the beginning of this year has enabled us to sharpen our focus on reshaping its portfolio to better align with our strategy of providing differentiated services and capabilities in this market space. We see this as an important business for our company. And while these portfolio actions may impact sales growth at TS in the near term, we see this restructuring process as key to aligning our investments and capabilities at TS with our longer-term growth objectives for this business.
Enterprise-wide, as we continue to add new programs and shape our portfolio, we remain focused on sustaining strong performance and operational excellence. This focus enabled all 3 of our businesses to contribute to a solid 12.2% segment operating margin rate in the second quarter and a 12% rate year-to-date. 
Second quarter EPS increased 4% to $2.85, and based on our year-to-date results and a tax benefit that we will record in the third quarter, we are increasing 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.75 to $11 versus our prior guidance of $10.40 to $10.70.
Second quarter cash from operations was approximately $600 million, consistent with last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $173 million and free cash flow totaled $431 million. As we mentioned on previous calls, our capital spending plans contemplate the purchase of several buildings this year. And during the first half of the year, we implemented those plans, with facilities purchases totaling approximately $240 million. This includes a facility purchase for $80 million in the second quarter.
At the midpoint of the year, capital spending was $471 million, and we now expect our 2016 capital spending will range between $800 million and $1 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. 
In addition to investing in our businesses, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend 12.5% to an annual rate of $3.60, our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase and our fifth consecutive double-digit increase. We also continue to repurchase our shares. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 3.4 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $3.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.
We do not yet have an FY '17 Defense Appropriations Bill, and as Congress is adjourned until September, it is increasingly likely that we will begin the government's fiscal year 2017 with a continuing resolution. As you know, a CR will constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. Beginning the new fiscal year with a CR has unfortunately become a familiar scenario. The larger concerns is how long the CR lasts. Obviously, the longer CR lasts, the more disruptive it is to our customers' acquisitions plans. So we encourage Congress to work together to fund our government and enable its effective operations.
In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results, and we expect our focus on performance to continue to generate solid results for the remainder of 2016 as demonstrated by our updated guidance. We remain well positioned to achieve profitable long-term growth, and we continue to generate value through performance, managing our portfolio and our approach to cash deployment.
So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?"

I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance. It was a good quarter with h",1286,"Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance. 
It was a good quarter with higher sales and EPS and strong margin rates and cash flow. Performance was strong at all 3 sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Increases in both periods reflect higher volume on Manned Aircraft programs and Autonomous Systems, which more than offset a low single-digit decline in space volume due to lower nonrestricted activity on programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope. 
Restricted activities and higher F-35 deliveries were the growth drivers in Manned Aircraft. Growth in these areas more than offset lower volume for the F/A-18 and B-2 programs. The F/A-18 continues to ramp down. We delivered 5 units this quarter versus 8 units in last year's second quarter. 
Lower volume on the B-2 is due to timing of modernization activities. In Autonomous Systems, volume continues to ramp up on Triton and Global Hawk, more than offsetting lower activity on other autonomous programs, primarily NATO AGS. While space sales were lower, volume for restricted activities grew but did not fully offset lower volume for the nonrestricted space programs I referenced earlier.
Aerospace Systems' operating income declined slightly. Changing contract mix and a timing of risk retirements more than offset the impact of higher sales. Operating margin rate was 12% versus 12.8% in the last year's second quarter. And most of you will recall that last year's results benefited from risk retirements on a restricted program. 
At the midpoint of the year, Aerospace is on track to achieve our sales guidance in the low $10 billion range. Through 6 months, Aerospace has an operating margin rate of 11.6%, and we continue to expect AS to generate a margin rate in the mid- to high 11% range, no change from prior guidance.
Mission Systems' second quarter sales grew more than 2% and year-to-date MS sales are up 1%. Both periods reflect higher sales volume for Advanced Capabilities programs as well as Sensors and Processing programs. The primary drivers in Advanced Capabilities are restricted programs and ramp-up on several navigation and maritime programs, including SEWIP Block 3. Ramp-up on G/ATOR contributed to higher Sensors and Processing volume in both periods. And JCREW contributed to the second quarter increase. 
Mission Systems' second quarter operating income increased 1% and operating margin rate was 13%. Year-to-date MS operating income is up 2%, with an operating margin rate of 13.1%. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, unchanged from prior guidance. And based on strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin rate to the high 12% range versus our prior guidance of a mid- to high 12%.
Technology Services' second quarter sales declined 2% and year-to-date sales are down 3%. The trend for both periods reflects completion of several programs in 2015, lower ICBM volume as well as the ongoing repositioning of the business portfolio as mentioned by Wes.
Second quarter operating income increased 2%, and operating margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 10.8% due to improved performance. Year-to-date, TS operating margin rate has expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%. And we are raising our margin guidance to low 10% from our prior guidance of approximately 10%. We continue to expect TS sales in the mid-$4 billion range.
Total segment operating margin was 12.2% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.3% for the second quarter and 12.8% year-to-date. We now expect a low 12% total operating margin rate for the year versus our prior guidance of approximately 12%.
Our updated guidance assumes unallocated expenses -- unallocated corporate expenses of $175 million, lower than our prior estimate of approximately $200 million. You'll recall that our unallocated corporate expense is typically more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter generally being the highest. We expect that to be the case again this year.
Our guidance also includes net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million. Keep in mind that we will be finalizing our 2016 pension demographic study in the third quarter. The study results may impact our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016, so no change to the guidance until that is finalized. 
Wes mentioned one of the drivers of our EPS guidance increase is a tax benefit we will record in the third quarter. After the close of the second quarter, we received approval from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for the resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense will be reduced by approximately $40 million. This will reduce our 2016 expected effective tax rate to approximately 25.5% and provide approximately $0.20 more in EPS.
All that rolls up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $10.75 to $11, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance now anticipates capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016 versus our prior guidance of $700 million to $1 billion.
A quick update on backlog. As we indicated last quarter, we intend to report backlog for the full year and provide trend information each quarter. Year-to-date, our backlog has increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace, a modest decline in backlog in Mission Systems and a high single-digit decline at Technology Services.
Looking ahead to next year and in light of the significant decline in interest rates through midyear, I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone of our discount rate and planned asset return sensitivities as they may impact our 2017 FAS expense. Every 25 basis point change in our discount rate results in a net impact of approximately $70 million to our 2017 FAS expense. And every 100 basis point difference in our 8% return assumption and actual planned return changes and actual planned return changes 2017 FAS by approximately $50 million. In January, we provided a $470 million estimate for 2017 FAS based on a 4.53% discount rate and planned asset returns of 8%.
Year-to-date planned asset returns are a bit north of 6%, and as you're all aware, benchmark interest rates have declined by about 75 basis points. If we had to set our discount rate today and holding all other assumptions constant, our expected 2017 FAS expense would be about $200 million higher or $670 million. But obviously, a lot can happen between now and year-end. 
We continue to expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion for 2017. And we continue to expect 2017 and 2018 required cash contributions will remain fairly low at about $100 million each year. I don't expect much volatility in these required pension contributions, barring major market disruptions.
One final note on Brexit. While it's too early to predict any long-term impacts Brexit may have on our business, we saw no material impact to second quarter results. We have limited foreign currency exposures related to the affected currencies, and we hedge significant contract-related exposure. We did see a decrement in our reported cash balances in U.S. dollars of about $30 million, which reflects the conversion of balances held in affected foreign currencies. 
With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Overall, when we say performance as the primary driver, that's actually what we mean. TS has a rather significant mix of different contracts across this portfolio. And credit to the team. They've been doing a really good job on executing on those contracts. So it's a broad reflection of the work that's being done across the organization just to continue to drive on program execution. Particularly, I would say on the Global Logistics and Modernization part of the portfolio, where we're seeing some especially good program performance. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we are working on portfolio in TS. The reorganization that we did at the beginning of the year has allowed us to really pull together the broad set of our service and modernization-oriented activities. And kind of step back and look at that market space and ask ourselves how we really want to position to compete over the long term. And so we're going through some thinking on which of those areas we're going to continue to invest in and others that we may tune down on as we go forward. And as I mentioned remarks, anytime we go through a little portfolio tuning, that can, in the near term, impact the growth trajectory. But over the long term, we see this as a very good business for our company, one that we are absolutely committed to being into. And the idea is to make sure that we're investing in the places where we see really differentiated capabilities. And with differentiated capabilities, we're able to focus on the areas to provide a better margin rates. And that's our strategy sort of stated in a broad context. But we're looking at that, the implications of that strategy from each of the 3 parts of the TS business. So it's not just one of the components of that business that are the focus of this activity. And it's enabling us, I think, to better position the organization for longer-term growth. Ken, anything you want to add to that?"

So generally, we expect it to have a not too significant impact in terms of any particular year in regards to the P&L and the sales and earnings to be generated. Certainly something we're spending a fair amount of time on. Our accounting folks are working hard on that. We do expect to have that fully analyzed and our method of adoption identified by the end of 2016. And I'd say we're well on track to dealing with that issue, and we don't see it as significantly impactful to any particular P&L as we look forward."

But the other piece of this is that we've also got a fair amount of production. We spent a little bit of time talking about F-35 today as that production should mature and ramp. E-2D is a mature production. And Wes mentioned, we're looking to get LRIP on Triton. So we've got a bit working both ways. We do incentivize the team to perform better than the benchmark peers. That benchmark continues to be 11% for Aerospace. And I would say maintaining historically a strong level mix of production versus development, I think will that move one way or the other? Yes, I think development could move up but I don't think it swings so widely that margin rates are unsustainable. I think I've described margin rates as kind of relatively range-bound.

We're a company that never leaves a customer high and dry simply because we've decided that we're changing a part of the portfolio. And our approach -- I'll give you an example on that, our approach in state and local, where we've been pretty clear that we've been ramping down our business in the state and local marketplace over the last few years. And so we're not rebidding on a lot of new things, but in many cases, those customers need us to hang in there a little bit longer to effect a smooth transition. And we're committed to making sure we support them. So a lot of the variability here is on the nature of the customer needs to ensure that nobody gets left hanging in some manner. We want to make sure we support them well. My experience on these transitions, as we've gone through them over the last few years, suggest that it takes usually at a minimum about a year but sometimes it can be a little bit longer than that to affect the portfolio shaping. Some of that gets assisted by where the new bids are. And we can elect, in many cases, to just simply not rebid in an area that we're working to transition out. And you asked for a few examples so state and local is one, where we are continuing to work our way down through that process. There are other areas, both in the Global Logistics and Modernization programs as well as our modernization services and our Advanced Defense Services businesses, where we're looking at the nature of how the customer is buying. If their approach to buying is shaping things more in the direction of the commodity services, that's really not the part of the marketplace that we see ourselves adding great value. We tend to do a better job for our customers in areas where they need some aspect of technology componentry is a part of what they're doing or they need engineering applied to the outcomes for that products or services that they're looking at. And that, over time, continues to shape and shift a little bit. So this is really down at the business unit level where we're sorting through each of these areas and making those decisions. And I think you'll see the outcomes of some of those decisions as we begin to talk a little bit more about 2017. And then that'll allow us to lock in on it, make sure we're investing on it the right way and move through that as we move into 2018 and beyond."

There's, as you point out, so much innovation that's occurring right now and attempting to insert some very new thinking into the way our customers are executing their missions. SEWIP Block 3 and JCREW are perfect examples of that, and we're really proud of those wins. I'm especially proud of how the team's approached those areas. Those are reflections of so much of what we do in the company that takes a number of years of investment in advance to really generate the level of technology capability that we can demonstrate to the customers and show them that they can achieve. In some of these cases, something that they didn't actually anticipate being able to do when they began thinking about the way they were going to formulate their mission capability. And in all of these areas, as we are able to not only advance the technology system subs but better integrate these rapidly moving technology spaces, we're creating these types of outcomes for our customers. And I'm especially excited and proud about that. SEWIP 3, you mentioned, a really good example of how the Navy is thinking aggressively ahead on electronic warfare, and it needs to, given the complexity of the threat environment that the Navy is going to be facing as they move forward. And in JCREW, if you looked at what we've been able to do over the years in our communication space through the application of software-defined capability and the ability to integrate a lot of different ways of operating into singular devices, I think that's a really good example of that outcome. You mentioned space. And space is an area that I really think we're on the beginning next steps of a change and a way of looking at space portfolio of the nation. For years, we operated our space assets with sort of a perspective we were in some sort of sanctuary in space and didn't really have to worry about threat. And that's changed, changed dramatically over the last few years. You've heard a number of senior officials in government talk about that shift in the thinking in that understanding. And consequently, as we go forward, I think just about all of the space missions that are going to need to be recapitalized are going to be recapitalized with those concerns in mind, which inevitably moves the architecture of those missions in the direction of the application of higher end technologies, which is what we do. So I think there will be quite a few very good opportunities for both our company and the companies with whom we partner and addressing these new needs in space. And we are investing to make sure that we're in the right place on that and forming the right partnerships to ensure that we can together bring the capabilities our customers are going to need.

In terms of F-35 margin, I would say that yes, in fact, the margin rates we're realizing on that program is not what we expect at this level of maturity. We're talking about LRIPs 9 and 10 moving into full rate production. And we would expect that the margin would be a bit higher than where it is today. That being said, the negotiation of each lot is only the first step in that process, and you've got to perform in order to realize the margin. So we've been able to work hard with Lockheed Martin to get to an MOU on 9 and 10 for AS, and we were previously there on the other sectors. And now it's a matter of performing and delivering the margin that we expect out of that program. From a BFA perspective, we did invest, along with BAE and Lockheed Martin, in the BFA through I guess that was in 2012, 2013 time frame.

That these investments, they are team investments that are focused on helping our customer get crossed out. And as we do that, they have inherent in them a return mechanism for the companies, so this is not sort of a sideswipe at some way of reducing our margin or something. This is an overt decision by the industry team to come together to work on ways to actually get the cost -- the unit cost in the case of the BFAs and then the sustainment cost in terms of the BFS, to get the cost structure into a place where our customers can afford more of the capability. So from an industry perspective, we're only doing this because we see a benefit to the program and ultimately, an economic benefit to those who are participants in the program. And it's a win-win because the government, our customers, get that -- get an economic benefit from these investments as well and have worked very closely with us in both structuring the investment strategies and programs and on ensuring that there is a good return mechanism.

We had a very strong second quarter, driven by solid operational execution and effective cash deployment. I want to thank our team for their unwavering focus on performance.
Second quarter sales totaled $6 billion, 2% higher than last year's second quarter, driven by growth at both Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. At Aerospace Systems, we're reaching an inflection point where new programs and the planned ramp-ups on production programs are beginning to outpace declines on mature legacy programs.
While we may see some variability in that trend going forward, the growth in manned and autonomous systems drove a 4% second quarter sales increase. The programs driving sales include our restricted programs, the production ramp-up on F-35, Triton and volume on Global Hawk as we begin production for international customers. These growing programs are more than offsetting the expected declines in AS programs such as NATO ATS, F/A-18, Advanced EHF and James Webb Space Telescope.
Sales at Mission Systems grew in the second quarter, driven by higher volume for restricted programs and ramp-ups on programs like F-35, G/ATOR, SEWIP Block 3, JCREW and CIRCM. We delivered our first CIRCM systems in June, and we expect this program to continue ramping up.
The reorganization at Technology Services at the beginning of this year has enabled us to sharpen our focus on reshaping its portfolio to better align with our strategy of providing differentiated services and capabilities in this market space. We see this as an important business for our company. And while these portfolio actions may impact sales growth at TS in the near term, we see this restructuring process as key to aligning our investments and capabilities at TS with our longer-term growth objectives for this business.
Enterprise-wide, as we continue to add new programs and shape our portfolio, we remain focused on sustaining strong performance and operational excellence. This focus enabled all 3 of our businesses to contribute to a solid 12.2% segment operating margin rate in the second quarter and a 12% rate year-to-date.
Second quarter EPS increased 4% to $2.85, and based on our year-to-date results and a tax benefit that we will record in the third quarter, we are increasing 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.75 to $11 versus our prior guidance of $10.40 to $10.70.
Second quarter cash from operations was approximately $600 million, consistent with last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $173 million and free cash flow totaled $431 million. As we mentioned on previous calls, our capital spending plans contemplate the purchase of several buildings this year. And during the first half of the year, we implemented those plans, with facilities purchases totaling approximately $240 million. This includes a facility purchase for $80 million in the second quarter.
At the midpoint of the year, capital spending was $471 million, and we now expect our 2016 capital spending will range between $800 million and $1 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.
In addition to investing in our businesses, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend 12.5% to an annual rate of $3.60, our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase and our fifth consecutive double-digit increase. We also continue to repurchase our shares. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 3.4 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $3.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.
We do not yet have an FY '17 defense appropriations bill, and as Congress is adjourned until September, it is increasingly likely that we will begin the government's fiscal year 2017 with a continuing resolution. As you know, a CR will constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. Beginning the new fiscal year with a CR has unfortunately become a familiar scenario. The larger concern is how long the CR lasts. Obviously, the longer CR lasts, the more disruptive it is to our customers' acquisitions plans. So we encourage Congress to work together to fund our government and enable its effective operations.
In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results, and we expect our focus on performance to continue to generate solid results for the remainder of 2016 as demonstrated by our updated guidance. We remain well positioned to achieve profitable long-term growth, and we continue to generate value through performance, managing our portfolio and our approach to cash deployment.
So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?"

I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance.It was a good quarter with hi",1282,"Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance.
It was a good quarter with higher sales and EPS and strong margin rates and cash flow. Performance was strong at all 3 sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Increases in both periods reflect higher volume on Manned Aircraft programs and Autonomous Systems, which more than offset a low single-digit decline in space volume due to lower nonrestricted activity on programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.
Restricted activities and higher F-35 deliveries were the growth drivers in Manned Aircraft. Growth in these areas more than offset lower volume for the F/A-18 and B-2 programs. The F/A-18 continues to ramp down. We delivered 5 units this quarter versus 8 units in last year's second quarter.
Lower volume on the B-2 is due to timing of modernization activities. In Autonomous Systems, volume continues to ramp up on Triton and Global Hawk, more than offsetting lower activity on other autonomous programs, primarily NATO AGS. While space sales were lower, volume for restricted activities grew but did not fully offset lower volume for the nonrestricted space programs I referenced earlier.
Aerospace Systems' operating income declined slightly. Changing contract mix and a timing of risk retirements more than offset the impact of higher sales. Operating margin rate was 12% versus 12.8% in the last year's second quarter. And most of you will recall that last year's results benefited from risk retirements on a restricted program.
At the midpoint of the year, Aerospace is on track to achieve our sales guidance in the low $10 billion range. Through 6 months, Aerospace has an operating margin rate of 11.6%, and we continue to expect AS to generate a margin rate in the mid- to high 11% range, no change from prior guidance.
Mission Systems' second quarter sales grew more than 2%, and year-to-date MS sales are up 1%. Both periods reflect higher sales volume for Advanced Capabilities programs as well as Sensors and Processing programs. The primary drivers in Advanced Capabilities are restricted programs and ramp-up on several navigation and maritime programs, including SEWIP Block 3. Ramp-up on G/ATOR contributed to higher Sensors and Processing volume in both periods. And JCREW contributed to the second quarter increase.
Mission Systems' second quarter operating income increased 1% and operating margin rate was 13%. Year-to-date MS operating income is up 2%, with an operating margin rate of 13.1%. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, unchanged from prior guidance. And based on strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin rate to the high 12% range versus our prior guidance of a mid- to high 12%.
Technology Services' second quarter sales declined 2%, and year-to-date sales are down 3%. The trend for both periods reflects the completion of several programs in 2015, lower ICBM volume as well as the ongoing repositioning of the business portfolio as mentioned by Wes.
Second quarter operating income increased 2%, and operating margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 10.8% due to improved performance. Year-to-date, TS operating margin rate has expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%. And we are raising our margin guidance to low 10% from our prior guidance of approximately 10%. We continue to expect TS sales in the mid-$4 billion range.
Total segment operating margin was 12.2% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.3% for the second quarter and 12.8% year-to-date. We now expect a low 12% total operating margin rate for the year versus our prior guidance of approximately 12%.
Our updated guidance assumes unallocated expenses -- unallocated corporate expenses of $175 million, lower than our prior estimate of approximately $200 million. You'll recall that our unallocated corporate expense is typically more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter generally being the highest. We expect that to be the case again this year.
Our guidance also includes net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million. Keep in mind that we will be finalizing our 2016 pension demographic study in the third quarter. The study results may impact our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016, so no change to the guidance until that is finalized.
Wes mentioned one of the drivers of our EPS guidance increase is a tax benefit we will record in the third quarter. After the close of the second quarter, we received approval from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for the resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense will be reduced by approximately $40 million. This will reduce our 2016 expected effective tax rate to approximately 25.5% and provide approximately $0.20 more in EPS.
All that rolls up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $10.75 to $11, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance now anticipates capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016 versus our prior guidance of $700 million to $1 billion.
A quick update on backlog. As we indicated last quarter, we intend to report backlog for the full year and provide trend information each quarter. Year-to-date, our backlog has increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace, a modest decline in backlog at Mission Systems and a high single-digit decline at Technology Services.
Looking ahead to next year and in light of the significant decline in interest rates through midyear, I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone of our discount rate and planned asset return sensitivities as they may impact our 2017 FAS expense. Every 25 basis point change in our discount rate results in a net impact of approximately $70 million to our 2017 FAS expense. And every 100 basis point difference in our 8% return assumption and actual planned return changes 2017 FAS by approximately $50 million. In January, we provided a $470 million estimate for 2017 FAS based on a 4.53% discount rate and planned asset returns of 8%.
Year-to-date planned asset returns are a bit north of 6%, and as you're all aware, benchmark interest rates have declined by about 75 basis points. If we had to set our discount rate today and holding all other assumptions constant, our expected 2017 FAS expense would be about $200 million higher or $670 million. But obviously, a lot can happen between now and year-end.
We continue to expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion for 2017. And we continue to expect 2017 and 2018 required cash contributions will remain fairly low at about $100 million each year. I don't expect much volatility in these required pension contributions, barring major market disruptions.
One final note on Brexit. While it's too early to predict any long-term impacts Brexit may have on our business, we saw no material impact to second quarter results. We have limited foreign currency exposures related to the affected currencies, and we hedge significant contract-related exposure. We did see a decrement in our reported cash balances in U.S. dollars of about $30 million, which reflects the conversion of balances held in affected foreign currencies.
With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Overall, when we say performance as the primary driver, that's actually what we mean. TS has a rather significant mix of different contracts across this portfolio. And credit to the team. They've been doing a really good job on executing on those contracts. So it's a broad reflection of the work that's being done across the organization just to continue to drive on program execution, particularly I would say in the Global Logistics and Modernization part of the portfolio, where we're seeing some especially good program performance. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we are working on portfolio in TS. The reorganization that we did at the beginning of the year has allowed us to really pull together the broad set of our service and modernization-oriented activities, and kind of step back and look at that market space and ask ourselves how we really want to position to compete over the long term. And so we're going through some thinking on which of those areas we're going to continue to invest in and others that we may tune down on as we go forward. And as I mentioned in my remarks, anytime we go through a little portfolio tuning, that can, in the near term, impact the growth trajectory. But over the long term, we see this as a very good business for our company, one that we are absolutely committed to being into. And the idea is to make sure that we're investing in the places where we see really differentiated capabilities. And with differentiated capabilities, we're able to focus on the areas that provide better margin rates. And that's our strategy sort of stated in a broad context. But we're looking at that, the implications of that strategy from each of the 3 parts of the TS business. So it's not just one of the components of that business that are the focus of this activity. And it's enabling us, I think, to better position the organization for longer-term growth. Ken, anything you want to add to that?"

We do incentivize the team to perform better than the benchmark and its peers. That benchmark continues to be 11% for Aerospace. And I would say maintaining historically a strong level mix of production versus development, I think will that move one way or the other? Yes, I think development could move up, but I don't think it swings so widely that margin rates are unsustainable. I think I've described margin rates as kind of relatively range-bound.

We're a company that never leaves a customer high and dry simply because we've decided that we're changing a part of the portfolio. Our approach -- I'll give you an example on that, our approach in state and local, where we've been pretty clear that we've been ramping down our business in the state and local marketplace over the last few years. And so we're not rebidding on a lot of new things, but in many cases, those customers need us to hang in there a little bit longer to effect a smooth transition. And we're committed to making sure we support them. So a lot of the variability here is on the nature of the customer needs to ensure that nobody gets left hanging in some manner. We want to make sure we support them well. My experience on these transitions, as we've gone through them over the last few years, suggest that it takes usually at a minimum about a year but sometimes it can be a little bit longer than that to affect the portfolio shaping. Some of that gets assisted by where the new bids are. And we can elect, in many cases, to just simply not rebid in an area that we're working to transition out. And you asked for a few examples. So state and local is one, where we are continuing to work our way down through that process. There are other areas, both in the Global Logistics and Modernization programs as well as our Modernization and Services and our Advanced Defense Services businesses, where we're looking at the nature of how the customer is buying. If their approach to buying is shaping things more in the direction of the commodity services, that's really not the part of the marketplace that we see ourselves as adding great value. We tend to do a better job for our customers in areas where they need some aspect of technology componentry as a part of what they're doing or they need engineering applied to the outcomes for the products or services that they're looking at. And that, over time, continues to shape and shift a little bit. So this is really down at the business unit level where we're sorting through each of these areas and making those decisions. And I think you'll see the outcomes of some of those decisions as we begin to talk a little bit more about 2017. And then that'll allow us to lock in on it, make sure we're investing on it the right way and move through that as we move into 2018 and beyond."

There's, as you pointed out, so much innovation that's occurring right now in attempting to insert some very new thinking into the way our customers are executing their missions. SEWIP Block 3 and JCREW are perfect examples of that, and we're really proud of those wins. I'm especially proud of how the team's approached those areas. Those are reflections of so much of what we do in the company that takes a number of years of investment in advance to really generate the level of technology capability that we can demonstrate to the customers and show them that they can achieve. In some of these cases, something that they didn't actually anticipate being able to do when they began thinking about the way they were going to formulate their mission capability. And in all of these areas, as we are able to not only advance the technology system subs but better integrate these rapidly moving technology spaces, we're creating these types of outcomes for our customers. And I'm especially excited and proud about that. SEWIP 3, you mentioned, a really good example of how the Navy is thinking aggressively ahead on electronic warfare, and it needs to, given the complexity of the threat environment that the Navy is going to be facing as they move forward. And in JCREW, if you look at what we've been able to do over the years in our communication space through the application of software-defined capability and the ability to integrate a lot of different ways of operating into singular devices, I think that's a really good example of that outcome. You mentioned space. And space is an area that I really think we're on the beginning next steps of a change in way of looking at space portfolio for the nation. For years, we operated our space assets with sort of a perspective that we were in some sort of sanctuary in space and didn't really have to worry about threat. And that's changed, changed dramatically over the last few years. You've heard a number of senior officials in government talk about that shift in the thinking, in that understanding. And consequently, as we go forward, I think just about all of the space missions that are going to need to be recapitalized are going to be recapitalized with those concerns in mind, which inevitably moves the architecture of those missions in the direction of the application of higher-end technologies, which is what we do. So I think there will be quite a few very good opportunities for both our company and the companies with whom we partner in addressing these new needs in space. And we are investing to make sure that we're in the right place on that and forming the right partnerships to ensure that we can together bring the capabilities our customers are going to need. So there's actually quite a bit of work that's going on in our company and across our industry right now on the higher end of these technologies to ensure that our customers are going to be able to get what they need from us."

In terms of F-35 margin, I would say that yes, in fact, the margin rates we're realizing on that program is not what we expect at this level of maturity. We're talking about LRIPs 9 and 10 moving into full rate production. And we would expect that the margin would be a bit higher than where it is today. That being said, the negotiation of each lot is only the first step in that process, and you've got to perform in order to realize the margin. So we've been able to work hard with Lockheed Martin to get to an MOU on 9 and 10 for AS, and we were previously there on the other sectors. And now it's a matter of performing and delivering the margin that we expect out of that program. From a BFA perspective, we did invest, along with BAE and Lockheed Martin, in the BFA through I guess that was in 2012, 2013 time frame. And I would say that we've been making good progress on that working with the industry team and the government through that process. And any other questions on BFA, I'd refer you to Lockheed Martin for any other comment."

These investments, they are team investments that are focused on helping our customer get cost out. And as we do that, they have inherent in them a return mechanism for the company, so this is not sort of a sideswipe at some way of reducing our margin or something. This is an overt decision by the industry team to come together to work on ways to actually get the cost -- the unit cost in the case of the BFAs and then the sustainment cost in terms of the BFS, to get the cost structure into a place where our customers can afford more of the capability. So from an industry perspective, we are only doing this because we see a benefit to the program and, ultimately, an economic benefit to those who are participants in the program. And it's a win-win because the government, our customers, get that -- get an economic benefit from these investments as well and have worked very closely with us in both structuring the investment strategies and programs and on ensuring that there is a good return mechanism. So we see them as very positive mechanisms, very supportive of the program objectives. And I think it has been a really good reflection on the partnership approach that we have together across the companies on F-35, that we're able to make something innovative like this work so well.

We had a very strong second quarter, driven by solid operational execution and effective cash deployment. I want to thank our team for their unwavering focus on performance.
Second quarter sales totaled $6 billion, 2% higher than last year's second quarter, driven by growth at both Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. At Aerospace Systems, we're reaching an inflection point where new programs and the planned ramp-ups on production programs are beginning to outpace declines on mature legacy programs.
While we may see some variability in that trend going forward, the growth in manned and autonomous systems drove a 4% second quarter sales increase. The programs driving sales include our restricted programs, the production ramp-up on F-35, Triton and volume on Global Hawk as we begin production for international customers. These growing programs are more than offsetting the expected declines in AS programs such as NATO ATS, F/A-18, Advanced EHF and James Webb Space Telescope.
Sales at Mission Systems grew in the second quarter, driven by higher volume for restricted programs and ramp-ups on programs like F-35, G/ATOR, SEWIP Block 3, JCREW and CIRCM. We delivered our first CIRCM systems in June, and we expect this program to continue ramping up.
The reorganization at Technology Services at the beginning of this year has enabled us to sharpen our focus on reshaping this portfolio to better align with our strategy of providing differentiated services and capabilities in this market space. We see this as an important business for our company. And while these portfolio actions may impact sales growth at TS in the near term, we see this restructuring process as key to aligning our investments and capabilities at TS with our longer-term growth objectives for this business.
Enterprise-wide, as we continue to add new programs and shape our portfolio, we remain focused on sustaining strong performance and operational excellence. This focus enabled all 3 of our businesses to contribute to a solid 12.2% segment operating margin rate in the second quarter and a 12% rate year-to-date.
Second quarter EPS increased 4% to $2.85, and based on our year-to-date results and a tax benefit that we will record in the third quarter, we are increasing 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.75 to $11 versus our prior guidance of $10.40 to $10.70.
Second quarter cash from operations was approximately $600 million, consistent with last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $173 million and free cash flow totaled $431 million. As we’ve mentioned on previous calls, our capital spending plans contemplate the purchase of several buildings this year. And during the first half of the year, we implemented those plans, with facilities purchases totaling approximately $240 million. This includes a facility purchase for $80 million in the second quarter.
At the midpoint of the year, capital spending was $471 million, and we now expect our 2016 capital spending will range between $800 million and $1 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.
In addition to investing in our businesses, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend 12.5% to an annual rate of $3.60, our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase and our fifth consecutive double-digit increase. We also continue to repurchase our shares. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 3.4 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $3.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.
We do not yet have an FY '17 defense appropriations bill, and as Congress is adjourned until September, it is increasingly likely that we will begin the government's fiscal year 2017 with a continuing resolution. As you know, a CR will constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. Beginning the new fiscal year with a CR has unfortunately become a familiar scenario. The larger concern is how long the CR lasts. Obviously, the longer a CR lasts, the more disruptive it is to our customers' acquisitions plans. So we encourage Congress to work together to fund our government and enable its effective operations.
In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results, and we expect our focus on performance to continue to generate solid results for the remainder of 2016 as demonstrated by our updated guidance. We remain well positioned to achieve profitable long-term growth, and we continue to generate value through performance, managing our portfolio and our approach to cash deployment.
So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?"

I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance.
It was a good quarter with higher sales and EPS and strong margin rates and cash flow. Performance was strong at all 3 sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Increases in both periods reflect higher volume on Manned Aircraft programs and Autonomous Systems, which more than offset a low single-digit decline in space volume due to lower nonrestricted activity on programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.
Restricted activities and higher F-35 deliveries were the growth drivers in Manned Aircraft. Growth in these areas more than offset lower volume for the F/A-18 and B-2 programs. The F/A-18 continues to ramp down. We delivered 5 units this quarter versus 8 units in last year's second quarter.
Lower volume on the B-2 is due to timing of modernization activities. In Autonomous Systems, volume continues to ramp up on Triton and Global Hawk, more than offsetting lower activity on other autonomous programs, primarily NATO AGS. While space sales were lower, volume for restricted activities grew but did not fully offset lower volume for the nonrestricted space programs I referenced earlier.
Aerospace Systems' operating income declined slightly. Changing contract mix and a timing of risk retirements more than offset the impact of higher sales. Operating margin rate was 12% versus 12.8% in the last year's second quarter. And most of you will recall that last year's results benefited from risk retirements on a restricted program.
At the midpoint of the year, Aerospace is on track to achieve our sales guidance in the low $10 billion range. Through 6 months, Aerospace has an operating margin rate of 11.6%, and we continue to expect AS to generate a margin rate in the mid- to high 11% range, no change from prior guidance.
Mission Systems' second quarter sales grew more than 2%, and year-to-date MS sales are up 1%. Both periods reflect higher sales volume for Advanced Capabilities programs as well as Sensors and Processing programs. The primary drivers in Advanced Capabilities are restricted programs and ramp-up on several navigation and maritime programs, including SEWIP Block 3. Ramp-up on G/ATOR contributed to higher Sensors and Processing volume in both periods. And JCREW contributed to the second quarter increase.
Mission Systems' second quarter operating income increased 1% and operating margin rate was 13%. Year-to-date MS operating income is up 2%, with an operating margin rate of 13.1%. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, unchanged from prior guidance. And based on strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin rate to the high 12% range versus our prior guidance of a mid- to high 12%.
Technology Services' second quarter sales declined 2%, and year-to-date sales are down 3%. The trend for both periods reflects the completion of several programs in 2015, lower ICBM volume as well as the ongoing repositioning of the business portfolio as mentioned by Wes.
Second quarter operating income increased 2%, and operating margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 10.8% due to improved performance. Year-to-date, TS operating margin rate has expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%. And we are raising our margin guidance to low 10% from our prior guidance of approximately 10%. We continue to expect TS sales in the mid-$4 billion range.
Total segment operating margin was 12.2% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.3% for the second quarter and 12.8% year-to-date. We now expect a low 12% total operating margin rate for the year versus our prior guidance of approximately 12%.
Our updated guidance assumes unallocated expenses -- unallocated corporate expenses of $175 million, lower than our prior estimate of approximately $200 million. You'll recall that our unallocated corporate expense is typically more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter generally being the highest. We expect that to be the case again this year.
Our guidance also includes net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million. Keep in mind that we will be finalizing our 2016 pension demographic study in the third quarter. The study results may impact our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016, so no change to the guidance until that is finalized.
Wes mentioned one of the drivers of our EPS guidance increase is a tax benefit we will record in the third quarter. After the close of the second quarter, we received approval from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for the resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense will be reduced by approximately $40 million. This will reduce our 2016 expected effective tax rate to approximately 25.5% and provide approximately $0.20 more in EPS.
All that rolls up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $10.75 to $11, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance now anticipates capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016 versus our prior guidance of $700 million to $1 billion.
A quick update on backlog. As we indicated last quarter, we intend to report backlog for the full year and provide trend information each quarter. Year-to-date, our backlog has increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace, a modest decline in backlog at Mission Systems and a high single-digit decline at Technology Services.
Looking ahead to next year and in light of the significant decline in interest rates through midyear, I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone of our discount rate and planned asset return sensitivities as they may impact our 2017 FAS expense. Every 25 basis point change in our discount rate results in a net impact of approximately $70 million to our 2017 FAS expense. And every 100 basis point difference in our 8% return assumption and actual planned return changes 2017 FAS by approximately $50 million. In January, we provided a $470 million estimate for 2017 FAS based on a 4.53% discount rate and planned asset returns of 8%.
Year-to-date planned asset returns are a bit north of 6%, and as you're all aware, benchmark interest rates have declined by about 75 basis points. If we had to set our discount rate today and holding all other assumptions constant, our expected 2017 FAS expense would be about $200 million higher or $670 million. But obviously, a lot can happen between now and year-end.
We continue to expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion for 2017. And we continue to expect 2017 and 2018 required cash contributions will remain fairly low at about $100 million each year. I don't expect much volatility in these required pension contributions, barring major market disruptions.
One final note on Brexit. While it's too early to predict any long-term impacts Brexit may have on our business, we saw no material impact to second quarter results. We have limited foreign currency exposures related to the affected currencies, and we hedge significant contract-related exposure. We did see a decrement in our reported cash balances in U.S. dollars of about $30 million, which reflects the conversion of balances held in affected foreign currencies.
With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Overall, when we say performance is the primary driver, that's actually what we mean. TS has a rather significant mix of different contracts across this portfolio. And credit to the team. They've been doing a really good job on executing on those contracts. So it's a broad reflection of the work that's being done across the organization just to continue to drive on program execution, particularly I would say in the Global Logistics and Modernization part of the portfolio, where we're seeing some especially good program performance. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we are working on portfolio in TS. The reorganization that we did at the beginning of the year has allowed us to really pull together the broad set of our service and modernization-oriented activities, and kind of step back and look at that market space and ask ourselves how we really want to position to compete over the long term. And so we're going through some thinking on which of those areas we're going to continue to invest in and others that we may tune down on as we go forward. And as I mentioned in my remarks, anytime we go through a little portfolio tuning, that can, in the near term, impact the growth trajectory. But over the long term, we see this as a very good business for our company, one that we are absolutely committed to being into. And the idea is to make sure that we're investing in the places where we see really differentiated capabilities. And with differentiated capabilities, we're able to focus on the areas that provide the better margin rates. And that's our strategy sort of stated in a broad context. But we're looking at that, the implications of that strategy in each of the 3 parts of the TS business. So it's not just one of the components of that business that are the focus of this activity. And it's enabling us, I think, to better position the organization for longer-term growth. Ken, anything you want to add to that?"

It's a matter of TS having a broad portfolio of contracts that are generally differentiated in the types of services we offer and just really good execution by the team this quarter. There was really no major program and no major area that drove the majority of the increase. TS is really -- all of the sectors are innovative teams that work really hard to deliver, and they've shown that they can do that this quarter. And I would just say that maybe another piece of it kind of broadly is disciplined bidding behavior and making sure that we're going after the right work that can deliver the right margins as we look forward. So I think that's an important piece of it as well."

E-2D is in mature production. And Wes mentioned, we're looking to get to LRIP on Triton. So we've got a bit working both ways. We do incentivize the team to perform better than the benchmark and its peers. That benchmark continues to be 11% for Aerospace. And I would say maintaining historically a strong level mix of production versus development, I think will that move one way or the other? Yes, I think development could move up, but I don't think it swings so wildly that margin rates are unsustainable. I think I've described margin rates as kind of relatively range-bound.

We're a company that never leaves a customer high and dry simply because we've decided that we're changing a part of the portfolio. Our approach -- I'll give you an example on that, our approach in state and local, where we've been pretty clear that we've been ramping down our business in the state and local marketplace over the last few years. And so we're not rebidding on a lot of new things, but in many cases, those customers need us to hang in there a little bit longer to effect a smooth transition. And we're committed to making sure we support them. So a lot of the variability here is on the nature of the customer needs to ensure that nobody gets left hanging in some manner. We want to make sure we support them well. My experience on these transitions as we've gone through them over the last few years suggests that it takes usually at a minimum about a year but sometimes it can be a little bit longer than that to effect the portfolio shaping. Some of that gets assisted by where the new bids are. And we can elect, in many cases, to just simply not rebid in an area that we're working to transition out. And you asked for a few examples. So state and local is one where we are continuing to work our way down through that process. There are other areas, both in the Global Logistics and Modernization programs as well as our Modernization and Services and our Advanced Defense Services businesses, where we're looking at the nature of how the customer is buying. If their approach to buying is shaping things more in the direction of the commodity services, that's really not the part of the marketplace that we see ourselves as adding great value. We tend to do a better job for our customers in areas where they need some aspect of technology componentry as a part of what they're doing or they need engineering applied to the outcomes for the products or services that they're looking at. And that, over time, continues to shape and shift a little bit. So this is really down at the business unit level where we're sorting through each of these areas and making those decisions. And I think you'll see the outcomes of some of those decisions as we begin to talk a little bit more about 2017. And then that'll allow us to lock in on it, make sure we're investing on it the right way and move through that as we move into 2018 and beyond."

So my general bias in looking at a business like TS where we do have such an amazing group of employees is to just more effectively leverage that capability that we have into a place that makes a lot more sense for us to be and, again, being mindful of and respectful of our customers' needs. So that we're not causing any customers any grief in the process. So that's generally how I see this going. As always, and you've seen us do this over the last number of years, if it's very, very clear that some part of our business would be better executed in the hands of another party, we're the first to step up and make that happen. But in general, just to give you my impression of how I see things headed in TS, I have a bias towards redeploying the amazing people that we have in that organization to ensure that we can be on the better trajectory."

There's, as you point out, so much innovation that's occurring right now in attempting to insert some very new thinking into the way our customers are executing their missions. SEWIP Block 3 and JCREW are perfect examples of that, and we're really proud of those wins. I'm especially proud of how the teams approached those areas. Those are reflections of so much of what we do in the company that takes a number of years of investment in advance to really generate the level of technology capability that we can demonstrate to the customers and show them that they can achieve, in some of these cases, something that they didn't actually anticipate being able to do when they began thinking about the way they were going to formulate their mission capability. And in all of these areas, as we are able to not only advance the technology systems themselves but better integrate these rapidly moving technology spaces, we're creating these types of outcomes for our customers. And I'm especially excited and proud about that. SEWIP 3, you mentioned, a really good example of how the Navy is thinking aggressively ahead on electronic warfare, and it needs to, given the complexity of the threat environment that the Navy is going to be facing as they move forward. And in JCREW, if you look at what we've been able to do over the years in our communication space through the application of software-defined capability and the ability to integrate a lot of different ways of operating into singular devices, I think that's a really good example of that outcome. You mentioned space. And space is an area that I really think we're on the beginning next steps of a change in a way of looking at the space portfolio of the nation. For years, we operated our space assets with sort of a perspective that we were in some sort of sanctuary in space and didn't really have to worry about threat. And that's changed, changed dramatically over the last few years. You've heard a number of senior officials in government talk about that shift in the thinking, in that understanding. And consequently, as we go forward, I think just about all of the space missions that are going to need to be recapitalized are going to be recapitalized with those concerns in mind, which inevitably moves the architecture of those missions in the direction of the application of higher-end technologies, which is what we do. So I think there will be quite a few very good opportunities for both our company and the companies with whom we partner in addressing these new needs in space. And we are investing to make sure that we're in the right place on that and forming the right partnerships to ensure that we can together bring the capabilities our customers are going to need. So there's actually quite a bit of work that's going on in our company and across our industry right now on the higher end of these technologies to ensure that our customers are going to be able to get what they need from us."

We're talking about LRIPs 9 and 10 moving into full rate production. And we would expect that the margin would be a bit higher than where it is today. That being said, the negotiation of each lot is only the first step in that process, and you've got to perform in order to realize the margin. So we've been able to work hard with Lockheed Martin to get to an MOU on 9 and 10 for AS, and we were previously there on the other sectors. And now it's a matter of performing and delivering the margin that we expect out of that program. From a BFA perspective, we did invest, along with BAE and Lockheed Martin, in the BFA through I guess that was in 2012, 2013 time frame.

These investments, they are team investments that are focused on helping our customer get cost out. And as we do that, they have inherent in them a return mechanism for the company, so this is not sort of a sideswipe at some way of reducing our margin or something. This is an overt decision by the industry team to come together to work on ways to actually get the cost -- the unit cost in the case of the BFAs and then the sustainment cost in terms of the BFS, to get the cost structure into a place where our customers can afford more of the capability. So from an industry perspective, we are only doing this because we see a benefit to the program and, ultimately, an economic benefit to those who are participants in the program. And it's a win-win because the government, our customers, get that -- get an economic benefit from these investments as well and have worked very closely with us in both structuring the investment strategies and programs and on ensuring that there is a good return mechanism. So we see them as very positive mechanisms, very supportive of the program objectives.

We had a very strong second quarter, driven by solid operational execution and effective cash deployment. I want to thank our team for their unwavering focus on performance.
Second quarter sales totaled $6 billion, 2% higher than last year's second quarter, driven by growth at both Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. At Aerospace Systems, we're reaching an inflection point where new programs and the planned ramp-ups on production programs are beginning to outpace declines on mature legacy programs.
While we may see some variability in that trend going forward, the growth in manned and autonomous systems drove a 4% second quarter sales increase. The programs driving sales include our restricted programs, the production ramp-up on F-35, Triton and volume on Global Hawk as we begin production for international customers. These growing programs are more than offsetting the expected declines in AS programs such as NATO ATS, F/A-18, Advanced EHF and James Webb Space Telescope.
Sales at Mission Systems grew in the second quarter, driven by higher volume for restricted programs and ramp-ups on programs like F-35, G/ATOR, SEWIP Block 3, JCREW and CIRCM. We delivered our first CIRCM systems in June, and we expect this program to continue ramping up.
The reorganization at Technology Services at the beginning of this year has enabled us to sharpen our focus on reshaping this portfolio to better align with our strategy of providing differentiated services and capabilities in this market space. We see this as an important business for our company. And while these portfolio actions may impact sales growth at TS in the near term, we see this restructuring process as key to aligning our investments and capabilities at TS with our longer-term growth objectives for this business.
Enterprise-wide, as we continue to add new programs and shape our portfolio, we remain focused on sustaining strong performance and operational excellence. This focus enabled all 3 of our businesses to contribute to a solid 12.2% segment operating margin rate in the second quarter and a 12% rate year-to-date.
Second quarter EPS increased 4% to $2.85, and based on our year-to-date results and a tax benefit that we will record in the third quarter, we are increasing 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.75 to $11 versus our prior guidance of $10.40 to $10.70.
Second quarter cash from operations was approximately $600 million, consistent with last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $173 million and free cash flow totaled $431 million. As we’ve mentioned on previous calls, our capital spending plans contemplate the purchase of several buildings this year. And during the first half of the year, we implemented those plans, with facilities purchases totaling approximately $240 million. This includes a facility purchase for $80 million in the second quarter.
At the midpoint of the year, capital spending was $471 million, and we now expect our 2016 capital spending will range between $800 million and $1 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.
In addition to investing in our businesses, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend 12.5% to an annual rate of $3.60, our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase and our fifth consecutive double-digit increase. We also continue to repurchase our shares. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 3.4 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $3.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.
We do not yet have an FY '17 defense appropriations bill, and as Congress is adjourned until September, it is increasingly likely that we will begin the government's fiscal year 2017 with a continuing resolution. As you know, a CR will constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. Beginning the new fiscal year with a CR has unfortunately become a familiar scenario. The larger concern is how long the CR lasts. Obviously, the longer a CR lasts, the more disruptive it is to our customers' acquisitions plans. So we encourage Congress to work together to fund our government and enable its effective operations.
In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results, and we expect our focus on performance to continue to generate solid results for the remainder of 2016 as demonstrated by our updated guidance. We remain well positioned to achieve profitable long-term growth, and we continue to generate value through performance, managing our portfolio and our approach to cash deployment.
So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?"
97199,370589038,1014708,"Northrop Grumman Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Northrop Grumman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance.It was a good quarter with hi",1282,"Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance.
It was a good quarter with higher sales and EPS and strong margin rates and cash flow. Performance was strong at all 3 sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Increases in both periods reflect higher volume on Manned Aircraft programs and Autonomous Systems, which more than offset a low single-digit decline in space volume due to lower nonrestricted activity on programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.
Restricted activities and higher F-35 deliveries were the growth drivers in Manned Aircraft. Growth in these areas more than offset lower volume for the F/A-18 and B-2 programs. The F/A-18 continues to ramp down. We delivered 5 units this quarter versus 8 units in last year's second quarter.
Lower volume on the B-2 is due to timing of modernization activities. In Autonomous Systems, volume continues to ramp up on Triton and Global Hawk, more than offsetting lower activity on other autonomous programs, primarily NATO AGS. While space sales were lower, volume for restricted activities grew but did not fully offset lower volume for the nonrestricted space programs I referenced earlier.
Aerospace Systems' operating income declined slightly. Changing contract mix and a timing of risk retirements more than offset the impact of higher sales. Operating margin rate was 12% versus 12.8% in the last year's second quarter. And most of you will recall that last year's results benefited from risk retirements on a restricted program.
At the midpoint of the year, Aerospace is on track to achieve our sales guidance in the low $10 billion range. Through 6 months, Aerospace has an operating margin rate of 11.6%, and we continue to expect AS to generate a margin rate in the mid- to high 11% range, no change from prior guidance.
Mission Systems' second quarter sales grew more than 2%, and year-to-date MS sales are up 1%. Both periods reflect higher sales volume for Advanced Capabilities programs as well as Sensors and Processing programs. The primary drivers in Advanced Capabilities are restricted programs and ramp-up on several navigation and maritime programs, including SEWIP Block 3. Ramp-up on G/ATOR contributed to higher Sensors and Processing volume in both periods. And JCREW contributed to the second quarter increase.
Mission Systems' second quarter operating income increased 1% and operating margin rate was 13%. Year-to-date MS operating income is up 2%, with an operating margin rate of 13.1%. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, unchanged from prior guidance. And based on strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin rate to the high 12% range versus our prior guidance of a mid- to high 12%.
Technology Services' second quarter sales declined 2%, and year-to-date sales are down 3%. The trend for both periods reflects the completion of several programs in 2015, lower ICBM volume as well as the ongoing repositioning of the business portfolio as mentioned by Wes.
Second quarter operating income increased 2%, and operating margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 10.8% due to improved performance. Year-to-date, TS operating margin rate has expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%. And we are raising our margin guidance to low 10% from our prior guidance of approximately 10%. We continue to expect TS sales in the mid-$4 billion range.
Total segment operating margin was 12.2% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.3% for the second quarter and 12.8% year-to-date. We now expect a low 12% total operating margin rate for the year versus our prior guidance of approximately 12%.
Our updated guidance assumes unallocated expenses -- unallocated corporate expenses of $175 million, lower than our prior estimate of approximately $200 million. You'll recall that our unallocated corporate expense is typically more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter generally being the highest. We expect that to be the case again this year.
Our guidance also includes net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million. Keep in mind that we will be finalizing our 2016 pension demographic study in the third quarter. The study results may impact our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016, so no change to the guidance until that is finalized.
Wes mentioned one of the drivers of our EPS guidance increase is a tax benefit we will record in the third quarter. After the close of the second quarter, we received approval from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for the resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense will be reduced by approximately $40 million. This will reduce our 2016 expected effective tax rate to approximately 25.5% and provide approximately $0.20 more in EPS.
All that rolls up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $10.75 to $11, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance now anticipates capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016 versus our prior guidance of $700 million to $1 billion.
A quick update on backlog. As we indicated last quarter, we intend to report backlog for the full year and provide trend information each quarter. Year-to-date, our backlog has increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace, a modest decline in backlog at Mission Systems and a high single-digit decline at Technology Services.
Looking ahead to next year and in light of the significant decline in interest rates through midyear, I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone of our discount rate and planned asset return sensitivities as they may impact our 2017 FAS expense. Every 25 basis point change in our discount rate results in a net impact of approximately $70 million to our 2017 FAS expense. And every 100 basis point difference in our 8% return assumption and actual planned return changes 2017 FAS by approximately $50 million. In January, we provided a $470 million estimate for 2017 FAS based on a 4.53% discount rate and planned asset returns of 8%.
Year-to-date planned asset returns are a bit north of 6%, and as you're all aware, benchmark interest rates have declined by about 75 basis points. If we had to set our discount rate today and holding all other assumptions constant, our expected 2017 FAS expense would be about $200 million higher or $670 million. But obviously, a lot can happen between now and year-end.
We continue to expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion for 2017. And we continue to expect 2017 and 2018 required cash contributions will remain fairly low at about $100 million each year. I don't expect much volatility in these required pension contributions, barring major market disruptions.
One final note on Brexit. While it's too early to predict any long-term impacts Brexit may have on our business, we saw no material impact to second quarter results. We have limited foreign currency exposures related to the affected currencies, and we hedge significant contract-related exposure. We did see a decrement in our reported cash balances in U.S. dollars of about $30 million, which reflects the conversion of balances held in affected foreign currencies.
With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Overall, when we say performance is the primary driver, that's actually what we mean. TS has a rather significant mix of different contracts across this portfolio. And credit to the team. They've been doing a really good job on executing on those contracts. So it's a broad reflection of the work that's being done across the organization just to continue to drive on program execution, particularly I would say in the Global Logistics and Modernization part of the portfolio, where we're seeing some especially good program performance. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we are working on portfolio in TS. The reorganization that we did at the beginning of the year has allowed us to really pull together the broad set of our service and modernization-oriented activities, and kind of step back and look at that market space and ask ourselves how we really want to position to compete over the long term. And so we're going through some thinking on which of those areas we're going to continue to invest in and others that we may tune down on as we go forward. And as I mentioned in my remarks, anytime we go through a little portfolio tuning, that can, in the near term, impact the growth trajectory. But over the long term, we see this as a very good business for our company, one that we are absolutely committed to being into. And the idea is to make sure that we're investing in the places where we see really differentiated capabilities. And with differentiated capabilities, we're able to focus on the areas that provide the better margin rates. And that's our strategy sort of stated in a broad context. But we're looking at that, the implications of that strategy in each of the 3 parts of the TS business. So it's not just one of the components of that business that are the focus of this activity. And it's enabling us, I think, to better position the organization for longer-term growth. Ken, anything you want to add to that?"

TS is really -- all of the sectors are innovative teams that work really hard to deliver, and they've shown that they can do that this quarter. And I would just say that maybe another piece of it kind of broadly is disciplined bidding behavior and making sure that we're going after the right work that can deliver the right margins as we look forward. So I think that's an important piece of it as well."

E-2D is in mature production. And Wes mentioned, we're looking to get to LRIP on Triton. So we've got a bit working both ways. We do incentivize the team to perform better than the benchmark and its peers. That benchmark continues to be 11% for Aerospace. And I would say maintaining historically a strong level mix of production versus development, I think will that move one way or the other? Yes, I think development could move up, but I don't think it swings so wildly that margin rates are unsustainable. I think I've described margin rates as kind of relatively range-bound.

We're a company that never leaves a customer high and dry simply because we've decided that we're changing a part of the portfolio. Our approach -- I'll give you an example on that, our approach in state and local, where we've been pretty clear that we've been ramping down our business in the state and local marketplace over the last few years. And so we're not rebidding on a lot of new things, but in many cases, those customers need us to hang in there a little bit longer to effect a smooth transition. And we're committed to making sure we support them. So a lot of the variability here is on the nature of the customer needs to ensure that nobody gets left hanging in some manner. We want to make sure we support them well. My experience on these transitions as we've gone through them over the last few years suggests that it takes usually at a minimum about a year but sometimes it can be a little bit longer than that to effect the portfolio shaping. Some of that gets assisted by where the new bids are. And we can elect, in many cases, to just simply not rebid in an area that we're working to transition out. And you asked for a few examples. So state and local is one where we are continuing to work our way down through that process. There are other areas, both in the Global Logistics and Modernization programs as well as our Modernization and Services and our Advanced Defense Services businesses, where we're looking at the nature of how the customer is buying. If their approach to buying is shaping things more in the direction of the commodity services, that's really not the part of the marketplace that we see ourselves as adding great value. We tend to do a better job for our customers in areas where they need some aspect of technology componentry as a part of what they're doing or they need engineering applied to the outcomes for the products or services that they're looking at. And that, over time, continues to shape and shift a little bit. So this is really down at the business unit level where we're sorting through each of these areas and making those decisions. And I think you'll see the outcomes of some of those decisions as we begin to talk a little bit more about 2017. And then that'll allow us to lock in on it, make sure we're investing on it the right way and move through that as we move into 2018 and beyond."

There's, as you point out, so much innovation that's occurring right now in attempting to insert some very new thinking into the way our customers are executing their missions. SEWIP Block 3 and JCREW are perfect examples of that, and we're really proud of those wins. I'm especially proud of how the teams approached those areas. Those are reflections of so much of what we do in the company that takes a number of years of investment in advance to really generate the level of technology capability that we can demonstrate to the customers and show them that they can achieve, in some of these cases, something that they didn't actually anticipate being able to do when they began thinking about the way they were going to formulate their mission capability. And in all of these areas, as we are able to not only advance the technology systems themselves but better integrate these rapidly moving technology spaces, we're creating these types of outcomes for our customers. And I'm especially excited and proud about that. SEWIP 3, you mentioned, a really good example of how the Navy is thinking aggressively ahead on electronic warfare, and it needs to, given the complexity of the threat environment that the Navy is going to be facing as they move forward. And in JCREW, if you look at what we've been able to do over the years in our communication space through the application of software-defined capability and the ability to integrate a lot of different ways of operating into singular devices, I think that's a really good example of that outcome. You mentioned space. And space is an area that I really think we're on the beginning next steps of a change in a way of looking at the space portfolio of the nation. For years, we operated our space assets with sort of a perspective that we were in some sort of sanctuary in space and didn't really have to worry about threat. And that's changed, changed dramatically over the last few years. You've heard a number of senior officials in government talk about that shift in the thinking, in that understanding. And consequently, as we go forward, I think just about all of the space missions that are going to need to be recapitalized are going to be recapitalized with those concerns in mind, which inevitably moves the architecture of those missions in the direction of the application of higher-end technologies, which is what we do. So I think there will be quite a few very good opportunities for both our company and the companies with whom we partner in addressing these new needs in space. And we are investing to make sure that we're in the right place on that and forming the right partnerships to ensure that we can together bring the capabilities our customers are going to need.

We're talking about LRIPs 9 and 10 moving into full rate production. And we would expect that the margin would be a bit higher than where it is today. That being said, the negotiation of each lot is only the first step in that process, and you've got to perform in order to realize the margin. So we've been able to work hard with Lockheed Martin to get to an MOU on 9 and 10 for AS, and we were previously there on the other sectors. And now it's a matter of performing and delivering the margin that we expect out of that program. From a BFA perspective, we did invest, along with BAE and Lockheed Martin, in the BFA through I guess that was in 2012, 2013 time frame.

These investments, they are team investments that are focused on helping our customer get cost out. And as we do that, they have inherent in them a return mechanism for the company, so this is not sort of a sideswipe at some way of reducing our margin or something. This is an overt decision by the industry team to come together to work on ways to actually get the cost -- the unit cost in the case of the BFAs and then the sustainment cost in terms of the BFS, to get the cost structure into a place where our customers can afford more of the capability. So from an industry perspective, we are only doing this because we see a benefit to the program and, ultimately, an economic benefit to those who are participants in the program. And it's a win-win because the government, our customers, get that -- get an economic benefit from these investments as well and have worked very closely with us in both structuring the investment strategies and programs and on ensuring that there is a good return mechanism. So we see them as very positive mechanisms, very supportive of the program objectives.

We had another solid quarter in which all 3 sectors executed well. Our ongoing focus on performance, portfolio and effective cash deployment continues to drive outstanding results and positions us for profitable growth over the long term.
Sales rose 3% this quarter, led by a 9% increase at Aerospace. Segment operating income was higher than last year, driven by sales volume. Our segment operating margin rate declined slightly to 11.9% and is consistent with our guidance for the year and the trend toward a higher proportion of development work. Earnings per share rose 22% to $3.35 and benefited from a favorable tax settlement and lower unallocated corporate expense in the quarter. Excluding those benefits, earnings per share rose 6%.
Third quarter cash from operations was more than $700 million, approximately $180 million higher than last year. After capital expenditures of $137 million, free cash flow totaled $601 million. Typically, our cash flow -- our cash from operations is heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. We expect this year will be consistent with that pattern, and we are on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year.
Based on this quarter's results and our fourth quarter outlook, we are raising our 2016 sales guidance to a range of $23.9 billion to $24.1 billion versus our prior guidance range of $23.5 billion to $24 billion. We continue to expect our segment operating margin rate will be in the high 11% range, with total operating margin rate expectations moving to the mid to high 12%. And we now expect 2016 earnings per share will be between $11.55 and $11.75.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for approximately $470 million, and year-to-date, we've repurchased 5.6 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average price of $207 per share. Share repurchases continue to be a significant element of our capital deployment strategy.
We achieved several key program milestones and awards during the quarter. Global Hawk surpassed 200,000 flight hours and successfully completed the second of 3 planned sensor demonstrations by flying the Optical Bar Camera broad-area synoptic sensor. This is the first time this legacy U.S. Air Force camera has been flown on a high-altitude unmanned aircraft. Successful demonstration of the sensor capability supports the Air Force's plan for Global Hawk to assume greater responsibility for our nation's high-altitude ISR mission. 
Also during the quarter, Triton achieved Milestone C approval. As a result, we were awarded contracts for LRIP 1 and long lead items for LRIP 2. The transition to LRIP positions us to execute the U.S. Navy's program of record for 68 air vehicles and to move toward fulfilling missions for international customers such as Australia. 
The U.S. Navy also ordered 10 more Fire Scout unmanned helicopters with previously authorized funding, which will bring the Navy's fleet to 29. The Navy has also indicated that a successful Milestone C decision could lead to an award for an additional 11 helicopters.
On the manned aircraft side, the Air Force declared the F-35 ready for initial operational capability. And we've now completed negotiations for F-35 lots 9 and 10. We also received a U.S. Navy contract to begin producing a second E-2D Advanced Hawkeye for Japan. And the Pentagon and the State Department approved the sale of 28 F/A-18s to Kuwait, with an option to purchase 12 more of the fighter jets. If put on contract, this would extend the life of our F/A-18 production line. In summary, for AS, growing volume on new development programs and programs transitioning to production continues to outpace legacy program ramp-downs.
At Mission Systems, we delivered the first CIRCM missile-defense system to the Army. These systems were delivered under an EMD contract to produce the next generation of survivability equipment to defend rotary-wing aircraft against manned portable air defense systems and other heat-seeking threats. 
Mission Systems was also awarded a contract for 9 additional G/ATOR systems for the Marine Corps. This ground air radar system is an example of innovating to provide the best capability for the war fighter while ensuring affordability. 
At Technology Services, we were awarded additional contracts to continue maintenance and modernization of the U.K. AWACS fleet and the B-2 bomber. TS was also awarded a $108 million contract for the Social Security Administration Information Technology Support Service Program. It's really gratifying to see that the investments we have made during the defense downturn, along with our aggressive approach to affordability, including the resolving improvement in our indirect rate structure, are supporting our ability to capture new attractive programs across the enterprise.
We continue to have a rich opportunity set that includes programs like the T-X Trainer, Joint STARS recapitalization, ground-based strategic deterrent, SABR Radar, GPS 3, MQ-25 and a number of other restricted and international opportunities. Realization of these opportunities depends on our customer's ability to plan for and to fund our national security priorities. 
As you know, we're currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on December 9, and as such, we do not yet have an FY '17 Defense Appropriations bill. A prolonged CR would likely constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. So we encourage Congress to work together after the elections to fund our government and to ensure its effective operations.
In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results and our outlook. We remain well-positioned to continue generating value by focusing on performance, managing our portfolio and effectively deploying our cash.
So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of third quarter results and our 2016 guidance. Ken?"

I want to add my thanks to the team. It was another good quarter. I'll briefly review third quarter results and provide some color on the tax settlement, unallocated corporate items, our net pension adjustment and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Our overall results included higher sales, solid operating income and margin rate and good cash flow, all of which positions us for a strong finish to the year.
Performance was solid across the company. Sales at Aerospace rose 9% over the prior year quarter and 6% year-to-date. Higher volume for manned aircraft and autonomous systems drove revenue growth in both periods. For both the quarter and year-to-date, manned aircraft reflects higher volume for restricted activities, increases in F-35 deliveries and ramp-up on the E2D program. 
During the quarter, we delivered 16 F-35 units versus 15 in last year's third quarter, and year-to-date, we've delivered 44 units compared to 36 at this point last year. In autonomous systems, we continue to see higher volume across a number of programs, including Global Hawk and Triton. Growth in Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems is more than offsetting a slight decline in space volume for both the quarter and year-to-date. Lower space volume continues to be driven by reduced activity on non-restricted programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.
Aerospace third quarter operating income increased 4%, largely due to higher volume. Margin rate contracted 50 basis points to 11.2% due to the changing contract mix in Manned Aircraft, partially offset by improved performance in Autonomous Systems. Year-to-date, Aerospace operating margin is 11.4%. We now expect Aerospace sales will be in the mid-$10 billion range versus our prior guidance of low $10 billion. With this higher volume and the change in mix, we are refining our operating margin rate guidance to mid-11% from mid to high 11%. 
Mission Systems third quarter and year-to-date sales were comparable to last year. Results for the quarter included lower volume for Sensors and Processing programs and Advanced Capabilities programs, partially offset by higher volume for Cyber and ISR activities. 
In Sensors and Processing, volume was impacted by certain international programs nearing completion and lower combat avionics volume due to timing of legacy F-16 and F-35 radar deliveries. Lower volume in these areas was partially offset by higher volume for new communications programs. 
In Advanced Capabilities, volume was lower across a number of navigation and maritime programs, partially offset by higher volume for restricted activities. Higher sales in Cyber and ISR were due to higher volume on cyber solutions programs.
Mission Systems third quarter and year-to-date operating income and margin rate were comparable to last year. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, with a high 12% operating margin rate. No change from prior guidance. 
Technology Services third quarter sales were comparable to the prior year and down 2% year-to-date. Both periods reflect the completion of several programs in 2015 and lower ICBM volume, partially offset by higher volume for the KC-10 program and an international training program. Just a reminder, we expect KC-10 sales will be winding down in 2017 as our contracts nears completion. 
Technology Services third quarter and year-to-date operating income are comparable to same periods in 2015. Operating margin rate increased 20 basis points for both periods. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Technology Services sales in the mid-$4 billion range, but we're increasing guidance for operating margin rate from low 10% to mid-10%.
Total segment operating margin rate was 11.9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.4% for the third quarter and 13% year-to-date and included a significant reduction in unallocated corporate expense. 
Two items drove the $34 million improvement. The first item was a $30 million benefit for state tax refunds claimed on prior year tax returns. The second item was a $25 million benefit recognized for estimated prior year overhead claim recoveries. These items were partially offset by an increase in provisions for environmental remediation.
Year-to-date, unallocated corporate expenses are $31 million, and we now expect unallocated corporate expense will be about $100 million for the full year. You'll recall that these expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the demographic study that allows us to finalize our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016. Based on the demographics update, we are increasing our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to approximately $310 million from the previous $275 million. 
Based on our sector's consistent operating performance, lower expected unallocated corporate expense and improved net pension adjustment, we now expect a mid to high 12% total operating margin rate versus our prior guidance of low 12%. 
Our third quarter tax rate was 21.7% versus 29.2% in last year's third quarter. The lower rate reflects this quarter's favorable tax settlements as well as the extension of the research tax credit. As we told you in July, we resolved the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense was reduced by $42 million. We expect our 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. All of that rose up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $11.55 to $11.75, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares.
While we increased EPS guidance, we're maintaining free cash flow guidance as the $55 million for the unallocated corporate items will be reflected in future periods and not in 2016. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which continues to anticipate capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016.
A final note on cash. We are evaluating tax-efficient options to repatriate certain earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. If we move forward, we would expect to repatriate the majority of our foreign cash balances.
A quick update on pension. We'll be providing detailed 2017 guidance on our year-end call. And it's our practice at that time to provide a 3-year outlook for FAS, CAS and funding for the plans. As this has been a topic of much interest recently, I thought it would be helpful to give a quick update.
Last quarter, we estimated 2017 FAS expense of $670 million, assuming a 75 basis point change in our discount rate and an 8% return on planned assets, which is about where planned asset returns were as of last Friday. FAS expense is sensitive to changes in discount rate, about a net $70 million change for every 25 basis point movement. 
FAS also changes by about $50 million for every 100 basis point variance from the assumed planned asset returns. CAS, on the other hand, is much less sensitive to interest rates and planned asset returns. As most of you are aware, CAS is discounted at a 25-year average interest rate.
Under current assumptions, we expect CAS of approximately $1.1 billion in 2017 and 2018. In addition, holding all assumptions constant, we expect CAS will remain at about that level for at least a couple of additional years, barring major market dislocations. We also continue to expect the required cash contributions to the plans will be about $100 million for '17 and '18. And while we do expect higher required contributions in 2019, we estimate 2019 required contributions will be well below CAS recoveries.
With that, Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A."

It is an interesting time in that it's clear that there's a significant recapitalization wave that's underway across a number of our customer communities. And quite frankly, it's one that's been deferred for quite a long time. And so they're facing the need to address a number of not only recapitalization of older existing assets, the trainer program is an example of that, but also the need to address what's going on around the globe in terms of the emergence of more aggressive threat profiles. And so there's a view to the future of new capabilities. I went through a little bit of that list in some of my prepared remarks, but let me just touch on some of the ones that have a lot of focus from us. T-X is obviously a very interesting one, recapitalization of a significant fleet of aircraft for training. There are a number of competitors in this competition. And as you indicated, the Air Force is working on its sort of final round, come out with the RFP later this year. So we expect this to be quite an interesting competition and one that we're looking forward to participating in. If you kind of look across the landscape of other things, the recapitalization of the nuclear infrastructure, nuclear force infrastructure for the country's underway. Clearly, the bomber program is an important activity there. But another one that we're quite interested in is the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program, GBSD, that I mentioned in my remarks. This too is another imperative for the country, given the amount of time that is spent since we've really invested in our ICBM fleet, and it's an area of strong expertise and knowledge base in our company. So we see that as a really good opportunity. The space that's associated with autonomous vehicles continues to be very active on our side. There's not only the international opportunities afforded by the success of our Global Hawk and Triton programs, but we see the Navy taking steps in the direction of yet another new program that we think will be a core part of the overall architecture for the Navy going forward. The MQ-25 program is the name that it's going by currently. And all the work that we've done over the years on our UCAS demonstrator program, we think, positions us well for that. So those are some examples in the Aerospace Systems world. I can go through a long list of examples as well in each of our other sectors. Mission Systems, the work that they've been doing on advanced radars has positioned us exceptionally well for a number of upcoming activities as well as the work that's ongoing in cyber, and of course, the work that are involved in a number of other classes of sensors such as the IRCM. I mentioned CIRCM in my remarks earlier as well. So both domestically and internationally, we see a very long list of opportunities out there. Part of the challenge always is to make sure that we are thoughtful about which of the ones that are out there we go after. So we have, over the years, I think, demonstrated a lot of discipline in how we're selecting our targets and how we're investing to pursue them. But it is a really interesting period of time where there is so much demand for the class of work that we do. And we're delighted that the work that we've been doing over these last number of years has positioned us well for that."

Let me start and Ken may have some things to add on that. On F-35, we have completed our negotiations on lots 9 and 10 with Lockheed, which is typical for a prime contractor to want to lock down its supply chain as it finishes off its negotiations with a customer. I would say, across the board, we've all seen the pace on negotiations on the LRIPs for F-35 to take a lot longer than anyone would hope. So I -- it's clear there's opportunities here for process improvement as we go forward. But I'm sure both the Lockheed -- that Lockheed and the JPO would point out, these are huge complex programs. And so there is inherently -- that degree of complexity inherently drives a little bit longer cycle times. So I think, it's a matter working our way through it collectively. But in terms of just looking at the Northrop Grumman position on this today, we have definitized with Lockheed Martin on lots 9 and 10. So we're continuing to support them obviously in the work that they're doing with the customer. It's a good team across the board with Lockheed as the prime, and we and BAE Systems are very focused in supporting them in all that they're doing. On the sustainment side, sustainment is naturally an increasing area of emphasis as we're getting jets out there and deployed. I mentioned in my remarks that the Air Force has declared IOC for the jets. So when we're helping to support an operational fleet, our experience has been that sustainment begins to tick up over time. We've been supporting sustainment already. It's typically embedded in the production contracts in terms of the spares and repairs part of the business. And as the deployment rolls out more aggressively, both, I would say, domestically and around the globe, we do expect to see an increase in the demand on the sustainment side. Typically, that demand is focused first, as it should be, through the prime, and so Lockheed, I think, will see a bit more of that sustainment demand in the near term. But over time, when it comes to not only the component level but also the broader support that major teammates can provide, we expect to see -- benefit from that as well. It's just critically important that these aircraft have a very high operational availability rate, and it will take the full team working together to make sure that, that happens."

And as we think about that side of priorities and how our work lines up with them, I see a continuing shift in the priority space to reestablishing the -- if you think of it in a broad sense, reestablishing in real terms the integrity of our defense infrastructure. Now today, we've got a very aged infrastructure, whether we're talking about our fleet of ships, the aircraft that we have an inventory for the Air Force. And in many respects, it's a product of the priorities over the last number of years where we have intentionally had to focus a bit more on operations, as we've been engaged in a number of places around the globe. First and foremost, we'll always be supporting those in uniform who are deployed and who the nation is asking to go stand in harm's way. But as we think about what we need to be doing here over the next few years, we see the priorities moving in the direction of realigning the investments against the core elements that do assure our ability to defend the country and the ability to defend our allies around the globe as we see the threat moving more towards the high end of things. So I think you've heard a lot about that coming out of the Pentagon, the need to think and act a bit more aggressively around our defense infrastructure. And so that's how we're seeing this prioritization play into what you pointed out, Doug, which is very real, which is a challenging budget environment. And I think, we all expect that we'll see some challenge in the budget environment for a number of years until we can get GDP growth moving in the direction of it needs to go."

We have seen a few things that have been impacting our working capital in the last 1 year to 1.5 years, burn down of advances. We've talked a little bit about contract negotiation delays. And I think, you're also familiar with the impact of the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments, and we've seen that have a little bit of an impact as well. But we expect we're working our way through that. We were able to get, as Wes mentioned, on contract for 9 and 10 for F-35. That helped significantly in terms of cash conversions. And then, in terms of the pension, you mentioned funding, I think you meant CAS. We do expect to see a pretty consistent CAS tailwind helping us kind of offsetting the capital expenditures that we're working on right now in terms of investing towards the future opportunities that we see. And from a funding perspective, we look at that as something that's going to be not as consequential as the recoveries on the pension side. So I think, to your point, we would expect that, that's a reasonable expectation as we look out over the longer term, that we should be strong generators of cash. And as we grow the business, we'll expect that to kind of flow through to the bottom line and flow through to the cash via cash from operations and ultimately free cash flow."

So it -- from our perspective, when we're thinking about generating the returns for the business, we want to make sure that first and foremost, we are investing appropriately in the business as we go forward. So I want to make sure that's a part of understanding in the dialogue when it comes to free cash flow because as we look forward over the next few years, CAS recoveries will certainly be a part of that. And all the other aspects of that Ken mentioned with respect to the strong focus we have across the enterprise, and working capital will be a big part of that, but we are investing in our company and we expect to continue to do that."

I think, it is important for the clarity that, that report provides, it makes it clear that the GAO did perform a very rigorous and deliberate review of the work that the Air Force did and its very thorough selection process. And it sort of, I thought, made a very compelling case of validating that the Air Force clearly chose the most capable [indiscernible] solution. And in reading that GAO report, I know there are a lot of lines sort of blacked out. But I think it's important to, as you did, really kind of dig in and understand some of what was said there. First, I think you'll see in that report the continuing discipline that we bring to the bidding process and that we've been demonstrating time and again over the years. Some years ago, and it was after we had initially been awarded a multibillion-dollar tanker program, we chose to walk away from a second round of bidding on that because it was pretty clear to us that the new acquisition approach simply would not be an attractive program for our company or for our shareholders. And we declined a bit on a number of other programs over the years for the same reason. And as the GAO report, I think, did a really good job of pointing out, the Air Force took a very focused and long-term approach on this program. They've funded us for a number of years in advance of the bids that we were able to our design. But specifically to your question, during that time that we were working our design, it came really clear to us that affordability would be absolutely critical. And we focused our efforts on a couple of things that I think are important to point out. First, obviously on the direct program it was so important to create a design from the beginning that would be inherently more affordable to build than some other previous programs had been. And secondly, we had to work really hard to bring down our indirect rates, the overhead in the company, including efforts that we've had underway like reducing the pension burden of cash in our rate structure. So when we looked at all of that, we also elected to make some corporate investments to enable those affordability efforts. So we were able to bid the program at a very mature design and a disciplined approach that connected returns to investments and really drove on affordability. So it gave us a lot of confidence in our ability to go and execute on the program and [indiscernible] I have to say, I'd also give a lot of credit to our customer who's been working really hard to ensure the stability requirements and funding that we all know is one of -- or 2 of the critical ingredients for success in addition to contractor performance. So there are a lot of things that have to come together to create that environment where affordability really sticks. And for us, it has been just a drumbeat within the company for some period of time. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm just really, really gratified and I know our team around the organization is gratified to see those efforts paying off for us. They're enabling us to bid competitively. They are enabling us to put forward new ideas about how our customer can do things a bit differently and more affordably. And I think that, that is an activity that is really going to serve our customers well for the long term, and of course, will serve our shareholders well because when we're able to capture these programs and execute on them, that's how we build value. So we see it as a part of the core engine and this new environment and Doug made reference to earlier where our customers are facing such an intensity around the budget, we simply have to be much more affordable. And it's a core part of our thought process, a core part of our strategy in the company so I appreciate the question on it."

I'm sure most on the call would recall, it was not that long ago and during the last decade where we had a series of program issues that resulted in -- unfavorable would be a kind word, they resulted in terrible adjustments that we had to make to our earnings estimates. And we took away from that process a very intensive set of learnings in the company around how you not only execute on the program but also how you bid and then prepare to execute on the program. And it is addressed across our organization in all of the operating rhythms that we have. When it comes to the discipline of bidding, we have a very comprehensive, independent, non-advocate review process that has individuals who have nothing to do with the bid, come in and scrub the heck out of it and try and find everything they can that can potentially go wrong so that we can get our heads around that. It's not that we're trying to avoid every element of risk. We want to be able to manage the risk. We've also worked hard to instituting our culture, the recognition that all programs of great complexity like the ones we take on have challenges, and good program managers get their hands up early and ask for help. It's program managers that don't do that, that end up creating problems that are hard to dig your way out of it. We like to use of the analogy of a dead fish. It smells pretty bad after day 1 or day 2 but wait for a week or 2, you don't want to be anywhere near it. So it's -- for us, it is all about this discipline around program execution, the clarity and transparency that we need so that we can get the resources on issues fast. And we know there will always be issues. That's just the nature of our business where we tend to work at the higher end of technology, but it's how you manage those risks that matters. So it is, for us, a strong fabric of what we look for in our program management teams. It's embedded now in the way that we do all of our training. And I think it's helped us. Are we perfect? No. And we continue to find these issues, and as you pointed out, they show up in terms of unfavorables from time to time, but the discipline around getting on it fast and being able to work on it with clarity and really get the root cause so that we learn from one program onto another is just a core part of the way we operate across the company."

So are we at a place yet on the F-35 where we're satisfied with the profitability of that program? No, we are not. And I think if you ask the prime, they would give you a similar answer. But it is kind of a reflection of the stage we're in to some extent. So our efforts on F-35 in support of the work that Lockheed is doing is to continue to drive on affordability. The blueprint for affordability that we together put forward, I think, was a really good strategy. I was delighted to see the customer so supportive of it to continue to aggressively find opportunities around the program to really go after costs because we've got to get the cost down as soon as we can so that we can really get the production rate up is when you're rate, when you're really able to drive on cost, and that's when you also do better on profitability. So this, to me, is all about getting the rate up, and we need to demonstrate the affordability, so we can get the rate up."

Just what I see and I talked a little bit about this already in response to some of the earlier questions. What I see in our environment today is just a great pressure on our customers to fit it all in. The budget has not grown as fast as the threat, but no one has told our customers they've only got to deal with 70% of the threat because they're getting 70% of what they need. And so I fully understand where they're coming from, that things have to become much more affordable. And oftentimes, I think people here that has some sort of great conflict between the Defense Industrial Base and our customer community. It's not. What our customers are saying is they've got to be able to get more capability at a lower cost, and that's just the way it is. And we all know it doesn't do much good to go fight over the small percentage differences that you can negotiate around profitability. The place you make headway on this is to go after the 80%, 85%, 90%, whatever it is. That's the core cost, and so that's our focus, drive affordability by taking out cost. And when we do that, what we've seen is we see a customer that's eager to incentivize our performance with good profitability. So I think it's a good healthy balanced relationship that we have with our customer community. I know that on individual contracts, there can be lots of dialogue around, well, is it this percent or that percent on profitability. But we all know ultimately, at the end of the day, nibbling away at profitability is not the answer. It's driving on cost and driving affordability so that our customer can get done what they need to get done. And at the senior levels in our customer community at the program office levels, I think they understand that. I see good dialogue and engagement around that, but they do need to see more affordability from -- on the industrial base and that is our focus."

I think we've been doing a good job of that here over the last few years. And largely, what we're seeing in terms of our margin rates and the margin rate, particularly at AS, to your question, is driven by mix. I think if you look at our disclosures, you'll see that we talked about, it's basically some additional development work that's working its way into the revenue stream. We do continue to see that we've got production opportunities as well. It's just that the increase on the development side this quarter is larger than the production side, but we talked about on the production, F-35 increase, E2D increase. So we're seeing some volume there as well. At the end of the day, I think it comes down to again mix but then our ability to perform, and I'll just remind you that one of our key metrics for our team is margin rate. And so we continue to make sure the team is focused on driving margin rate. And again, it's not against our own forecast or our own budgets but driving margin rate to be higher than our peers and that's how we incentivize the team.

And also, I think as we've had a few contractual delays that have impacted the timing of cash flows and the working capital as well, as I mentioned, the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments. But largely, I don't think we see anything in there other than timing, for the most part. If you look at our historical timing of cash flows, we're much stronger in the fourth quarter just in terms of how our business flows through the year. We're much stronger in terms of inflows in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to be a continued trend this year. We'll have a strong finish to the year and we're confident that we'll be within our range from a free cash flow perspective. That cash flow will come out of those receivables and drive the working capital down. So I think at the end of the year, you'll see that we're at a level of working capital that's about more consistent with where we normally are by year-end. And then we'll continue to focus on this as we move forward. We are working with our customer on the impact of the DFAR clause working capital and how we manage that going forward. I think they recognized that, that's important to both parties in terms of an appropriate level of cash flow for the type of contract and for the cost profile that's incurred on that contract.

In terms of maybe what you're seeing is we finished the 25% repurchase in the fourth quarter of last year. We kind of have a little bit of a slower first part of the year this year in terms of cash generation, so we spend a little bit more than 100%. But as we generate the cash in the fourth quarter, I think you'll start to see that normalize a bit."

We had another solid quarter in which all 3 sectors executed well. Our ongoing focus on performance, portfolio and effective cash deployment continues to drive outstanding results and positions us for profitable growth over the long term.
Sales rose 3% this quarter, led by a 9% increase at Aerospace. Segment operating income was higher than last year, driven by sales volume. Our segment operating margin rate declined slightly to 11.9% and is consistent with our guidance for the year and the trend toward a higher proportion of development work. Earnings per share rose 22% to $3.35 and benefited from a favorable tax settlement and lower unallocated corporate expense in the quarter. Excluding those benefits, earnings per share rose 6%.
Third quarter cash from operations was more than $700 million, approximately $180 million higher than last year. After capital expenditures of $137 million, free cash flow totaled $601 million. Typically, our cash flow -- our cash from operations is heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. We expect this year will be consistent with that pattern, and we are on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year.
Based on this quarter's results and our fourth quarter outlook, we are raising our 2016 sales guidance to a range of $23.9 billion to $24.1 billion versus our prior guidance range of $23.5 billion to $24 billion. We continue to expect our segment operating margin rate will be in the high 11% range, with total operating margin rate expectations moving to the mid to high 12%. And we now expect 2016 earnings per share will be between $11.55 and $11.75.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for approximately $470 million, and year-to-date, we've repurchased 5.6 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average price of $207 per share. Share repurchases continue to be a significant element of our capital deployment strategy.
We achieved several key program milestones and awards during the quarter. Global Hawk surpassed 200,000 flight hours and successfully completed the second of 3 planned sensor demonstrations by flying the Optical Bar Camera broad-area synoptic sensor. This is the first time this legacy U.S. Air Force camera has been flown on a high-altitude unmanned aircraft. Successful demonstration of the sensor capability supports the Air Force's plan for Global Hawk to assume greater responsibility for our nation's high-altitude ISR mission. 
Also during the quarter, Triton achieved Milestone C approval. As a result, we were awarded contracts for LRIP 1 and long lead items for LRIP 2. The transition to LRIP positions us to execute the U.S. Navy's program of record for 68 air vehicles and to move toward fulfilling missions for international customers such as Australia. 
The U.S. Navy also ordered 10 more Fire Scout unmanned helicopters with previously authorized funding, which will bring the Navy's fleet to 29. The Navy has also indicated that a successful Milestone C decision could lead to an award for an additional 11 helicopters.
On the manned aircraft side, the Air Force declared the F-35 ready for initial operational capability. And we've now completed negotiations for F-35 lots 9 and 10. We also received a U.S. Navy contract to begin producing a second E-2D Advanced Hawkeye for Japan. And the Pentagon and the State Department approved the sale of 28 F/A-18s to Kuwait, with an option to purchase 12 more of the fighter jets. If put on contract, this would extend the life of our F/A-18 production line. In summary, for AS, growing volume on new development programs and programs transitioning to production continues to outpace legacy program ramp-downs.
At Mission Systems, we delivered the first CIRCM missile-defense system to the Army. These systems were delivered under an EMD contract to produce the next generation of survivability equipment to defend rotary-wing aircraft against manned portable air defense systems and other heat-seeking threats. 
Mission Systems was also awarded a contract for 9 additional G/ATOR systems for the Marine Corps. This ground air radar system is an example of innovating to provide the best capability for the war fighter while ensuring affordability. 
At Technology Services, we were awarded additional contracts to continue maintenance and modernization of the U.K. AWACS fleet and the B-2 bomber. TS was also awarded a $108 million contract for the Social Security Administration Information Technology Support Service Program. It's really gratifying to see that the investments we have made during the defense downturn, along with our aggressive approach to affordability, including the resolving improvement in our indirect rate structure, are supporting our ability to capture new attractive programs across the enterprise.
We continue to have a rich opportunity set that includes programs like the T-X Trainer, Joint STARS recapitalization, ground-based strategic deterrent, SABR Radar, GPS 3, MQ-25 and a number of other restricted and international opportunities. Realization of these opportunities depends on our customer's ability to plan for and to fund our national security priorities. 
As you know, we're currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on December 9, and as such, we do not yet have an FY '17 Defense Appropriations bill. A prolonged CR would likely constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. So we encourage Congress to work together after the elections to fund our government and to ensure its effective operations.
In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results and our outlook. We remain well-positioned to continue generating value by focusing on performance, managing our portfolio and effectively deploying our cash.
So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of third quarter results and our 2016 guidance. Ken?"

I want to add my thanks to the team. It was another good quarter. I'll briefly review third quarter results and provide some color on the tax settlement, unallocated corporate items, our net pension adjustment and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Our overall results included higher sales, solid operating income and margin rate and good cash flow, all of which positions us for a strong finish to the year.
Performance was solid across the company. Sales at Aerospace rose 9% over the prior year quarter and 6% year-to-date. Higher volume for manned aircraft and autonomous systems drove revenue growth in both periods. For both the quarter and year-to-date, manned aircraft reflects higher volume for restricted activities, increases in F-35 deliveries and ramp-up on the E-2D program. 
During the quarter, we delivered 16 F-35 units versus 15 in last year's third quarter, and year-to-date, we've delivered 44 units compared to 36 at this point last year. In autonomous systems, we continue to see higher volume across a number of programs, including Global Hawk and Triton. Growth in Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems is more than offsetting a slight decline in space volume for both the quarter and year-to-date. Lower space volume continues to be driven by reduced activity on non-restricted programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.
Aerospace third quarter operating income increased 4%, largely due to higher volume. Margin rate contracted 50 basis points to 11.2% due to the changing contract mix in Manned Aircraft, partially offset by improved performance in Autonomous Systems. Year-to-date, Aerospace operating margin is 11.4%. We now expect Aerospace sales will be in the mid-$10 billion range versus our prior guidance of low $10 billion. With this higher volume and the change in mix, we are refining our operating margin rate guidance to mid-11% from mid to high 11%. 
Mission Systems third quarter and year-to-date sales were comparable to last year. Results for the quarter included lower volume for Sensors and Processing programs and Advanced Capabilities programs, partially offset by higher volume for Cyber and ISR activities. 
In Sensors and Processing, volume was impacted by certain international programs nearing completion and lower combat avionics volume due to timing of legacy F-16 and F-35 radar deliveries. Lower volume in these areas was partially offset by higher volume for new communications programs. 
In Advanced Capabilities, volume was lower across a number of navigation and maritime programs, partially offset by higher volume for restricted activities. Higher sales in Cyber and ISR were due to higher volume on cyber solutions programs.
Mission Systems third quarter and year-to-date operating income and margin rate were comparable to last year. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, with a high 12% operating margin rate. No change from prior guidance. 
Technology Services third quarter sales were comparable to the prior year and down 2% year-to-date. Both periods reflect the completion of several programs in 2015 and lower ICBM volume, partially offset by higher volume for the KC-10 program and an international training program. Just a reminder, we expect KC-10 sales will be winding down in 2017 as our contracts nears completion. 
Technology Services third quarter and year-to-date operating income are comparable to same periods in 2015. Operating margin rate increased 20 basis points for both periods. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Technology Services sales in the mid-$4 billion range, but we're increasing guidance for operating margin rate from low 10% to mid-10%.
Total segment operating margin rate was 11.9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.4% for the third quarter and 13% year-to-date and included a significant reduction in unallocated corporate expense. 
Two items drove the $34 million improvement. The first item was a $30 million benefit for state tax refunds claimed on prior year tax returns. The second item was a $25 million benefit recognized for estimated prior year overhead claim recoveries. These items were partially offset by an increase in provisions for environmental remediation.
Year-to-date, unallocated corporate expenses are $31 million, and we now expect unallocated corporate expense will be about $100 million for the full year. You'll recall that these expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the demographic study that allows us to finalize our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016. Based on the demographics update, we are increasing our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to approximately $310 million from the previous $275 million. 
Based on our sector's consistent operating performance, lower expected unallocated corporate expense and improved net pension adjustment, we now expect a mid to high 12% total operating margin rate versus our prior guidance of low 12%. 
Our third quarter tax rate was 21.7% versus 29.2% in last year's third quarter. The lower rate reflects this quarter's favorable tax settlements as well as the extension of the research tax credit. As we told you in July, we resolved the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense was reduced by $42 million. We expect our 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. All of that rose up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $11.55 to $11.75, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares.
While we increased EPS guidance, we're maintaining free cash flow guidance as the $55 million for the unallocated corporate items will be reflected in future periods and not in 2016. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which continues to anticipate capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016.
A final note on cash. We are evaluating tax-efficient options to repatriate certain earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. If we move forward, we would expect to repatriate the majority of our foreign cash balances.
A quick update on pension. We'll be providing detailed 2017 guidance on our year-end call. And it's our practice at that time to provide a 3-year outlook for FAS, CAS and funding for the plans. As this has been a topic of much interest recently, I thought it would be helpful to give a quick update.
Last quarter, we estimated 2017 FAS expense of $670 million, assuming a 75 basis point change in our discount rate and an 8% return on planned assets, which is about where planned asset returns were as of last Friday. FAS expense is sensitive to changes in discount rate, about a net $70 million change for every 25 basis point movement. 
FAS also changes by about $50 million for every 100 basis point variance from the assumed planned asset returns. CAS, on the other hand, is much less sensitive to interest rates and planned asset returns. As most of you are aware, CAS is discounted at a 25-year average interest rate.
Under current assumptions, we expect CAS of approximately $1.1 billion in 2017 and 2018. In addition, holding all assumptions constant, we expect CAS will remain at about that level for at least a couple of additional years, barring major market dislocations. We also continue to expect the required cash contributions to the plans will be about $100 million for '17 and '18. And while we do expect higher required contributions in 2019, we estimate 2019 required contributions will be well below CAS recoveries.
With that, Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A."

It is an interesting time in that it's clear that there's a significant recapitalization wave that's underway across a number of our customer communities. And quite frankly, it's one that's been deferred for quite a long time. And so they're facing the need to address a number of not only recapitalization of older existing assets, the trainer program is an example of that, but also the need to address what's going on around the globe in terms of the emergence of more aggressive threat profiles. And so there's a view to the future of new capabilities. I went through a little bit of that list in some of my prepared remarks, but let me just touch on some of the ones that have a lot of focus from us. T-X is obviously a very interesting one, recapitalization of a significant fleet of aircraft for training. There are a number of competitors in this competition. And as you indicated, the Air Force is working on its sort of final round, come out with the RFP later this year. So we expect this to be quite an interesting competition and one that we're looking forward to participating in. If you kind of look across the landscape of other things, the recapitalization of the nuclear infrastructure, nuclear force infrastructure for the country's underway. Clearly, the bomber program is an important activity there. But another one that we're quite interested in is the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program, GBSD, that I mentioned in my remarks. This too is another imperative for the country, given the amount of time that is spent since we've really invested in our ICBM fleet, and it's an area of strong expertise and knowledge base in our company. So we see that as a really good opportunity. The space that's associated with autonomous vehicles continues to be very active on our side. There's not only the international opportunities afforded by the success of our Global Hawk and Triton programs, but we see the Navy taking steps in the direction of yet another new program that we think will be a core part of the overall architecture for the Navy going forward. The MQ-25 program is the name that it's going by currently. And all the work that we've done over the years on our UCAS demonstrator program, we think, positions us well for that. So those are some examples in the Aerospace Systems world. I can go through a long list of examples as well in each of our other sectors. Mission Systems, the work that they've been doing on advanced radars has positioned us exceptionally well for a number of upcoming activities as well as the work that's ongoing in cyber, and of course, the work that are involved in a number of other classes of sensors such as the IRCM. I mentioned CIRCM in my remarks earlier as well. So both domestically and internationally, we see a very long list of opportunities out there. Part of the challenge always is to make sure that we are thoughtful about which of the ones that are out there we go after. So we have, over the years, I think, demonstrated a lot of discipline in how we're selecting our targets and how we're investing to pursue them. But it is a really interesting period of time where there is so much demand for the class of work that we do. And we're delighted that the work that we've been doing over these last number of years has positioned us well for that."

Let me start and Ken may have some things to add on that. On F-35, we have completed our negotiations on lots 9 and 10 with Lockheed, which is typical for a prime contractor to want to lock down its supply chain as it finishes off its negotiations with a customer. I would say, across the board, we've all seen the pace on negotiations on the LRIPs for F-35 to take a lot longer than anyone would hope. So I -- it's clear there's opportunities here for process improvement as we go forward. But I'm sure both the Lockheed -- that Lockheed and the JPO would point out, these are huge complex programs. And so there is inherently -- that degree of complexity inherently drives a little bit longer cycle times. So I think, it's a matter working our way through it collectively. But in terms of just looking at the Northrop Grumman position on this today, we have definitized with Lockheed Martin on lots 9 and 10. So we're continuing to support them obviously in the work that they're doing with the customer. It's a good team across the board with Lockheed as the prime, and we and BAE Systems are very focused in supporting them in all that they're doing. On the sustainment side, sustainment is naturally an increasing area of emphasis as we're getting jets out there and deployed. I mentioned in my remarks that the Air Force has declared IOC for the jets. So when we're helping to support an operational fleet, our experience has been that sustainment begins to tick up over time. We've been supporting sustainment already. It's typically embedded in the production contracts in terms of the spares and repairs part of the business. And as the deployment rolls out more aggressively, both, I would say, domestically and around the globe, we do expect to see an increase in the demand on the sustainment side. Typically, that demand is focused first, as it should be, through the prime, and so Lockheed, I think, will see a bit more of that sustainment demand in the near term. But over time, when it comes to not only the component level but also the broader support that major teammates can provide, we expect to see -- benefit from that as well. It's just critically important that these aircraft have a very high operational availability rate, and it will take the full team working together to make sure that, that happens."

And in many respects, it's a product of the priorities over the last number of years where we have intentionally had to focus a bit more on operations, as we've been engaged in a number of places around the globe. First and foremost, we'll always be supporting those in uniform who are deployed and who the nation is asking to go stand in harm's way. But as we think about what we need to be doing here over the next few years, we see the priorities moving in the direction of realigning the investments against the core elements that do assure our ability to defend the country and the ability to defend our allies around the globe as we see the threat moving more towards the high end of things. So I think you've heard a lot about that coming out of the Pentagon, the need to think and act a bit more aggressively around our defense infrastructure. And so that's how we're seeing this prioritization play into what you pointed out, Doug, which is very real, which is a challenging budget environment. And I think, we all expect that we'll see some challenge in the budget environment for a number of years until we can get GDP growth moving in the direction of it needs to go."

I'll maybe start just by talking a little bit about the process that we work through, and I'll say that we very much focus on managing our receivables, our net working capital. We have seen a few things that have been impacting our working capital in the last 1 year to 1.5 years, burn down of advances. We've talked a little bit about contract negotiation delays. And I think, you're also familiar with the impact of the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments, and we've seen that have a little bit of an impact as well. But we expect we're working our way through that. We were able to get, as Wes mentioned, on contract for 9 and 10 for F-35. That helped significantly in terms of cash conversions. And then, in terms of the pension, you mentioned funding, I think you meant CAS. We do expect to see a pretty consistent CAS tailwind helping us kind of offsetting the capital expenditures that we're working on right now in terms of investing towards the future opportunities that we see. And from a funding perspective, we look at that as something that's going to be not as consequential as the recoveries on the pension side. So I think, to your point, we would expect that, that's a reasonable expectation as we look out over the longer term, that we should be strong generators of cash. And as we grow the business, we'll expect that to kind of flow through to the bottom line and flow through to the cash via cash from operations and ultimately free cash flow."

I went through a rather long list of opportunities that we're addressing, and one of the things that we've been focused on over the last number of years is to make sure that we invest appropriately ahead on those opportunities so that we can really drive affordability. And part of those investments are capital. And you've seen an elevated level of capital from us most recently, and we've indicated we expect that will continue to be elevated for a couple more years. So it -- from our perspective, when we're thinking about generating the returns for the business, we want to make sure that first and foremost, we are investing appropriately in the business as we go forward. So I want to make sure that's a part of understanding in the dialogue when it comes to free cash flow because as we look forward over the next few years, CAS recoveries will certainly be a part of that. And all the other aspects of that Ken mentioned with respect to the strong focus we have across the enterprise, and working capital will be a big part of that, but we are investing in our company and we expect to continue to do that."

I think, it is important for the clarity that, that report provides, it makes it clear that the GAO did perform a very rigorous and deliberate review of the work that the Air Force did and its very thorough selection process. And it sort of, I thought, made a very compelling case of validating that the Air Force clearly chose the most capable and affordable solution. And in reading that GAO report, I know there are a lot of lines that are sort of blacked out, but I think, it's important to, as you did, really kind of dig in and understand some of what was said there. First, I think, you'll see in that report the continuing discipline that we bring to the bidding process and that we've been demonstrating time and again over the years. Some years ago, and it was after we had initially been awarded a multibillion-dollar tanker program, we chose to walk away from the second round of bidding on that because it was pretty clear to us that the new acquisition approach simply would not be an attractive program for our company or for our shareholders. And we've declined a bit on a number of other programs over the years for the same reason. And as the GAO report, I think, did a really good job of pointing out, the Air Force took a very focused and long-term approach on this program. They've funded us for a number of years in advance of the bids so we were able to mature our design. But specifically to your question, during that time that we were working our design, it became really clear to us that affordability would be absolutely critical. And we focused our efforts on a couple of things that I think are important to point out. First, obviously, on the direct program, it was so important to create a design from the beginning that would be inherently more affordable to build than some other previous programs had been. And secondly, we had to work really hard to bring down our indirect rates, the overhead in the company, including efforts that we've had underway like reducing the pension burden of cash in our rate structure. So when we looked at all of that, we also elected to make some corporate investments to enable those affordability efforts. So we were able to bid the program at a very mature design and a disciplined approach that connected returns to investments and really drove on affordability. So it gave us a lot of confidence in our ability to go and execute on the program, and in that particular case, I have to say, I have to also give a lot of credit to our customer who's been working really hard to ensure the stability requirements and funding that we all know is one of -- or 2 of the critical ingredients for success in addition to contractor performance. So there are a lot of things that have to come together to create that environment where affordability really sticks. And for us, it has been just a drumbeat within the company for some period of time. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm just really, really gratified, and I know our team around the organization is gratified to see those efforts paying off for us. They're enabling us to bid competitively. They're enabling us to put forward new ideas about how our customer can do things a bit differently and more affordably. And I think that, that is an activity that is really going to serve our customers well for the long term, and of course, will serve our shareholders well because when we're able to capture these programs and execute on them, that's how we build value. So we see it as a part of the core engine in this new environment, and Doug made reference to earlier, where our customers are facing such an intensity around the budget, we simply have to be much more affordable. And it's a core part of our thought process, a core part of our strategy in the company, so I appreciate the question on it."

You, I'm sure, and most on the call would recall, it was not that long ago and during the last decade where we had a series of program issues that resulted in -- unfavorable would be a kind word, they resulted in terrible adjustments that we had to make to our earnings estimates. And we took away from that process a very intensive set of learnings in the company around how you not only execute on the program but also how you bid and then prepare to execute on the program. And it is addressed across our organization in all of the operating rhythms that we have. When it comes to the discipline of bidding, we have a very comprehensive, independent, non-advocate review process that has individuals who have nothing to do with the bid, come in and scrub the heck out of it and try and find everything they can that can potentially go wrong so that we can get our heads around that. It's not that we're trying to avoid every element of risk. We want to be able to manage the risk. We've also worked hard to institute in our culture the recognition that all programs of great complexity like the ones we take on have challenges, and good program managers get their hands up early and ask for help. It's the -- program managers that don't do that, that end up creating problems that are hard to dig your way out of it. We like to use the analogy of a dead fish. It smells pretty bad after day 1 or day 2, but wait for a week or 2, you don't want to be anywhere near it. So it's -- for us, it is all about this discipline around program execution, the clarity and transparency that we need so that we can get the resources on issues fast. And we know there will always be issues. That's just the nature of our business where we tend to work at the higher end of technology, but it's how you manage those risks that matters. So it is, for us, a strong fabric of what we look for in our program management teams. It's embedded now in the way that we do all of our training. And I think, it's helped us. Are we perfect? No. And we continue to find these issues. And as you pointed out, they show up in terms of unfavorables from time to time, but the discipline around getting on it fast and being able to work on it with clarity and really get to root cause so that we learn from one program onto another is just a core part of the way we operate across the company."

But it is kind of a reflection of the stage we're in to some extent. So our efforts on F-35 in support of the work that Lockheed is doing is to continue to drive on affordability. The blueprint for affordability that we together put forward, I think, was a really good strategy. And I was delighted to see the customer so supportive of it to continue to aggressively find opportunities around the program to really go after costs because we've got to get the cost down as soon as we can so that we can really get the production rate up is when you're at rate, when you're really able to drive on cost, and that's when you also do better on profitability.

Just what I see, and I talked a little bit about this already in response to some of the earlier questions, what I see in our environment today is just a great pressure on our customers to fit it all in. The budget has not grown as fast as the threat, but no one has told our customers they've only got to deal with 70% of the threat because they're getting 70% of what they need. And so I fully understand where they're coming from. Things have to become much more affordable. And oftentimes, I think, people hear that as some sort of great conflict between the Defense Industrial Base and our customer community. It's not. What our customers are saying is they've got to be able to get more capability at a lower cost, and that's just the way it is. And we all know it doesn't do much good to go fight over the small percentage differences that you can negotiate around profitability. The place you make headway on this is to go after the 80%, 85%, 90%, whatever it is. That's the core cost, and so that's our focus, drive affordability by taking out cost. And when we do that, what we've seen is we see a customer that's eager to incentivize our performance with good profitability. So I think, it's a good healthy balanced relationship that we have with our customer community. I know that on individual contracts, there can be lots of dialogue around, well, is it this percent or that percent on profitability. But we all know, ultimately, at the end of the day, nibbling away at profitability is not the answer. It's driving on cost and driving affordability so that our customer can get done what they need to get done. And at the senior levels in our customer community, at the program office levels, I think they understand that. I see good dialogue and engagement around that, but they do need to see more affordability from the industrial base and that is our focus."

I think, we've been doing a good job of that here over the last few years. And largely, what we're seeing in terms of our margin rates and the margin rate, particularly at AS, to your question, is driven by mix. I think, if you look at our disclosures, you'll see that we talked about it, it's basically some additional development work that's working its way into the revenue stream. We do continue to see that we've got production opportunities as well. It's just that the increase on the development side this quarter is larger than the production side, but we talked about on the production, F-35 increase, E-2D increase. So we're seeing some volume there as well. At the end of the day, I think, it comes down to, again, mix, but then our ability to perform, and I'll just remind you that one of our key metrics for our team is margin rate. And so we continue to make sure the team is focused on driving margin rate. And again, it's not against our own forecast or our own budgets but driving margin rate to be higher than our peers and that's how we incentivize the team.

But I will say that we are seeing some growth in other areas of the business. And overall, we think that the declines in space will probably work their way through the system in '17.

I commented a little bit on that earlier in terms of some of the burn down of advances that we've seen on a couple of international programs. And also, I think, as we've had a few contractual delays that have impacted the timing of cash flows and the working capital as well as I mentioned the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments. But largely, I don't think we see anything in there other than timing, for the most part. If you look at our historical timing of cash flows, we're much stronger in the fourth quarter just in terms of how our business flows through the year. We're much stronger in terms of inflows in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to be a continued trend this year. We'll have a strong finish to the year and we're confident that we'll be within our range from a free cash flow perspective. That cash flow will come out of those receivables and drive the working capital down. So I think, at the end of the year, you'll see that we're at a level of working capital that's about more consistent with where we normally are by year-end. And then, we'll continue to focus on this as we move forward. We are working with our customer on the impact of the DFAR clause on working capital and how we manage that going forward. I think, they recognize that, that's important to both parties in terms of an appropriate level of cash flow for the type of contract and for the cost profile that's incurred on that contract. So no issues in terms of overall collectibility or any significant change in our ability to manage the working capital. I think, we just got to work through these couple of things, and we'll see our cash flows start to increase as we grow the business as we look forward."

We pay a competitive dividend. You saw we increased our dividend again in May. And then, excess cash we tend to deploy through share repurchases. We take a pretty consistent approach to share repurchase. We're not speculative. We set a plan and we go after it. In terms of maybe what you're seeing is we finished the 25% repurchase in the fourth quarter of last year.

We had another solid quarter in which all 3 sectors executed well. Our ongoing focus on performance, portfolio and effective cash deployment continues to drive outstanding results and positions us for profitable growth over the long term.
Sales rose 3% this quarter, led by a 9% increase at Aerospace. Segment operating income was higher than last year, driven by sales volume. Our segment operating margin rate declined slightly to 11.9% and is consistent with our guidance for the year and the trend toward a higher proportion of development work. Earnings per share rose 22% to $3.35 and benefited from a favorable tax settlement and lower unallocated corporate expense in the quarter. Excluding those benefits, earnings per share rose 6%.
Third quarter cash from operations was more than $700 million, approximately $180 million higher than last year. After capital expenditures of $137 million, free cash flow totaled $601 million. Typically, our cash flow -- our cash from operations is heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. We expect this year will be consistent with that pattern, and we are on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year.
Based on this quarter's results and our fourth quarter outlook, we are raising our 2016 sales guidance to a range of $23.9 billion to $24.1 billion versus our prior guidance range of $23.5 billion to $24 billion. We continue to expect our segment operating margin rate will be in the high 11% range, with total operating margin rate expectations moving to the mid to high 12%. And we now expect 2016 earnings per share will be between $11.55 and $11.75.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for approximately $470 million, and year-to-date, we've repurchased 5.6 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average price of $207 per share. Share repurchases continue to be a significant element of our capital deployment strategy.
We achieved several key program milestones and awards during the quarter. Global Hawk surpassed 200,000 flight hours and successfully completed the second of 3 planned sensor demonstrations by flying the Optical Bar Camera broad-area synoptic sensor. This is the first time this legacy U.S. Air Force camera has been flown on a high-altitude unmanned aircraft. Successful demonstration of the sensor capability supports the Air Force's plan for Global Hawk to assume greater responsibility for our nation's high-altitude ISR mission. 
Also during the quarter, Triton achieved Milestone C approval. As a result, we were awarded contracts for LRIP 1 and long lead items for LRIP 2. The transition to LRIP positions us to execute the U.S. Navy's program of record for 68 air vehicles and to move toward fulfilling missions for international customers such as Australia. 
The U.S. Navy also ordered 10 more Fire Scout unmanned helicopters with previously authorized funding, which will bring the Navy's fleet to 29. The Navy has also indicated that a successful Milestone C decision could lead to an award for an additional 11 helicopters.
On the manned aircraft side, the Air Force declared the F-35 ready for initial operational capability. And we've now completed negotiations for F-35 lots 9 and 10. We also received a U.S. Navy contract to begin producing a second E-2D Advanced Hawkeye for Japan. And the Pentagon and the State Department approved the sale of 28 F/A-18s to Kuwait, with an option to purchase 12 more of the fighter jets. If put on contract, this would extend the life of our F/A-18 production line. In summary, for AS, growing volume on new development programs and programs transitioning to production continues to outpace legacy program ramp-downs.
At Mission Systems, we delivered the first CIRCM missile-defense system to the Army. These systems were delivered under an EMD contract to produce the next generation of survivability equipment to defend rotary-wing aircraft against manned portable air defense systems and other heat-seeking threats. 
Mission Systems was also awarded a contract for 9 additional G/ATOR systems for the Marine Corps. This ground air radar system is an example of innovating to provide the best capability for the war fighter while ensuring affordability. 
At Technology Services, we were awarded additional contracts to continue maintenance and modernization of the U.K. AWACS fleet and the B-2 bomber. TS was also awarded a $108 million contract for the Social Security Administration Information Technology Support Service Program. It's really gratifying to see that the investments we have made during the defense downturn, along with our aggressive approach to affordability, including the resulting improvement in our indirect rate structure, are supporting our ability to capture new attractive programs across the enterprise.
We continue to have a rich opportunity set that includes programs like the T-X Trainer, Joint STARS recapitalization, ground-based strategic deterrent, SABR Radar, GPS 3, MQ-25 and a number of other restricted and international opportunities. Realization of these opportunities depends on our customer's ability to plan for and to fund our national security priorities. 
As you know, we're currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on December 9, and as such, we do not yet have an FY '17 Defense Appropriations bill. A prolonged CR would likely constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. So we encourage Congress to work together after the elections to fund our government and to ensure its effective operations.
In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results and our outlook. We remain well-positioned to continue generating value by focusing on performance, managing our portfolio and effectively deploying our cash.
So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of third quarter results and our 2016 guidance. Ken?"

I want to add my thanks to the team. It was another good quarter. I'll briefly review third quarter results and provide some color on the tax settlement, unallocated corporate items, our net pension adjustment and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Our overall results included higher sales, solid operating income and margin rates and good cash flow, all of which positions us for a strong finish to the year.
Performance was solid across the company. Sales at Aerospace rose 9% over the prior year quarter and 6% year-to-date. Higher volume for manned aircraft and autonomous systems drove revenue growth in both periods. For both the quarter and year-to-date, manned aircraft reflects higher volume for restricted activities, increases in F-35 deliveries and ramp-up on the E-2D program. 
During the quarter, we delivered 16 F-35 units versus 15 in last year's third quarter, and year-to-date, we've delivered 44 units compared to 36 at this point last year. In autonomous systems, we continue to see higher volume across a number of programs, including Global Hawk and Triton. Growth in Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems is more than offsetting a slight decline in space volume for both the quarter and year-to-date. Lower space volume continues to be driven by reduced activity on non-restricted programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.
Aerospace third quarter operating income increased 4%, largely due to higher volume. Margin rate contracted 50 basis points to 11.2% due to the changing contract mix in Manned Aircraft, partially offset by improved performance in Autonomous Systems. Year-to-date, Aerospace operating margin is 11.4%. We now expect Aerospace sales will be in the mid-$10 billion range versus our prior guidance of low $10 billion. With this higher volume and the change in mix, we are refining our operating margin rate guidance to mid-11% from mid to high 11%. 
Mission Systems third quarter and year-to-date sales were comparable to last year. Results for the quarter included lower volume for Sensors and Processing programs and Advanced Capabilities programs, partially offset by higher volume for Cyber and ISR activities. 
In Sensors and Processing, volume was impacted by certain international programs nearing completion and lower combat avionics volume due to timing of legacy F-16 and F-35 radar deliveries. Lower volume in these areas was partially offset by higher volume for new communications programs. 
In Advanced Capabilities, volume was lower across a number of navigation and maritime programs, partially offset by higher volume for restricted activities. Higher sales in Cyber and ISR were due to higher volume on cyber solutions programs.
Mission Systems third quarter and year-to-date operating income and margin rate were comparable to last year. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, with a high 12% operating margin rate. No change from prior guidance. 
Technology Services third quarter sales were comparable to the prior year and down 2% year-to-date. Both periods reflect the completion of several programs in 2015 and lower ICBM volume, partially offset by higher volume for the KC-10 program and an international training program. Just a reminder, we expect KC-10 sales will be winding down in 2017 as our contract nears completion. 
Technology Services third quarter and year-to-date operating income are comparable to same periods in 2015. Operating margin rate increased 20 basis points for both periods. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Technology Services sales in the mid-$4 billion range, but we're increasing guidance for operating margin rate from low 10% to mid-10%.
Total segment operating margin rate was 11.9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.4% for the third quarter and 13% year-to-date and included a significant reduction in unallocated corporate expense. 
Two items drove the $34 million improvement. The first item was a $30 million benefit for state tax refunds claimed on prior year tax returns. The second item was a $25 million benefit recognized for estimated prior year overhead claim recoveries. These items were partially offset by an increase in provisions for environmental remediation.
Year-to-date, unallocated corporate expenses are $31 million, and we now expect unallocated corporate expense will be about $100 million for the full year. You'll recall that these expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the demographic study that allows us to finalize our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016. Based on the demographics update, we are increasing our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to approximately $310 million from the previous $275 million. 
Based on our sector's consistent operating performance, lower expected unallocated corporate expense and improved net pension adjustment, we now expect a mid to high 12% total operating margin rate versus our prior guidance of low 12%. 
Our third quarter tax rate was 21.7% versus 29.2% in last year's third quarter. The lower rate reflects this quarter's favorable tax settlements as well as the extension of the research tax credit. As we told you in July, we resolved the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense was reduced by $42 million. We expect our 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. All of that rose up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $11.55 to $11.75, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares.
While we increased EPS guidance, we're maintaining free cash flow guidance as the $55 million for the unallocated corporate items will be reflected in future periods and not in 2016. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which continues to anticipate capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016.
A final note on cash. We are evaluating tax-efficient options to repatriate certain earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. If we move forward, we would expect to repatriate the majority of our foreign cash balances.
A quick update on pension. We'll be providing detailed 2017 guidance on our year-end call. And it's our practice at that time to provide a 3-year outlook for FAS, CAS and funding for the plans. As this has been a topic of much interest recently, I thought it would be helpful to give a quick update.
Last quarter, we estimated 2017 FAS expense of $670 million, assuming a 75 basis point change in our discount rate and an 8% return on plan assets, which is about where plan asset returns were as of last Friday. FAS expense is sensitive to changes in discount rates, about a net $70 million change for every 25 basis point movement. 
FAS also changes by about $50 million for every 100 basis point variance from the assumed plan asset returns. CAS, on the other hand, is much less sensitive to interest rates and plan asset returns. As most of you are aware, CAS is discounted at a 25-year average interest rate.
Under current assumptions, we expect CAS of approximately $1.1 billion in 2017 and 2018. In addition, holding all assumptions constant, we expect CAS will remain at about that level for at least a couple of additional years, barring major market dislocations. We also continue to expect the required cash contributions to the plans will be about $100 million for '17 and '18. And while we do expect higher required contributions in 2019, we estimate 2019 required contributions will be well below CAS recoveries.
With that, Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A."

It is an interesting time in that it's clear that there's a significant recapitalization wave that's underway across a number of our customer communities. And quite frankly, it's one that's been deferred for quite a long time. And so they're facing the need to address a number of not only recapitalization of older existing assets, the trainer program is an example of that, but also the need to address what's going on around the globe in terms of the emergence of more aggressive threat profiles. And so there's a view to the future of new capabilities. I went through a little bit of that list in some of my prepared remarks, but let me just touch on some of the ones that have a lot of focus from us. T-X is obviously a very interesting one, capitalization of a significant fleet of aircraft for training. There are a number of competitors in this competition. And as you indicated, the Air Force is working on its sort of final round to come out with the RFP later this year. So we expect this to be quite an interesting competition and one that we're looking forward to participating in. If you kind of look across the landscape of other things, the recapitalization of the nuclear infrastructure, nuclear force infrastructure for the country's underway. Clearly, the bomber program is an important activity there. But another one that we're quite interested in is the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program, GBSD, that I mentioned in my remarks. This too is another imperative for the country, given the amount of time that is spent since we've really invested in our ICBM fleet, and it's an area of strong expertise and knowledge base in our company. So we see that as a really good opportunity. The space that's associated with autonomous vehicles continues to be very active on our side. There's not only the international opportunities afforded by the success of our Global Hawk and Triton programs, but we see the Navy taking steps in the direction of yet another new program that we think will be a core part of the overall architecture for the Navy going forward. The MQ-25 program is the name that it's going by currently. And all the work that we've done over the years on our UCAS demonstrator program, we think, positions us well for that. So those are some examples in the Aerospace Systems world. I can go through a long list of examples as well in each of our other sectors. Mission Systems, the work that they've been doing on advanced radars has positioned us exceptionally well for a number of upcoming activities as well as the work that's ongoing in cyber, and of course, the work that are involved in a number of other classes of sensors such as the IRCM. I mentioned CIRCM in my remarks earlier as well. So both domestically and internationally, we see a very long list of opportunities out there. Part of the challenge always is to make sure that we are thoughtful about which of the ones that are out there we go after. So we have, over the years, I think, demonstrated a lot of discipline in how we're selecting our targets and how we're investing to pursue them. But it is a really interesting period of time where there is so much demand for the class of work that we do. And we're delighted that the work that we've been doing over these last number of years has positioned us well for that."

Let me start and Ken may have some things to add on that. On F-35, we have completed our negotiations on lots 9 and 10 with Lockheed, which is typical for a prime contractor to want to lock down its supply chain as it finishes off its negotiations with a customer. I would say, across the board, we've all seen the pace on negotiations on the LRIPs for F-35 to take a lot longer than anyone would hope. So I -- it's clear there's opportunities here for process improvement as we go forward. But I'm sure both the Lockheed -- that Lockheed and the JPO would point out, these are huge complex programs. And so there is inherently -- that degree of complexity inherently drives a little bit longer cycle times. So I think, it's a matter working our way through it collectively. But in terms of just looking at the Northrop Grumman position on this today, we have definitized with Lockheed Martin on lots 9 and 10. So we're continuing to support them obviously in the work that they're doing with the customer. It's a good team across the board with Lockheed as the prime, and we and BAE Systems are very focused in supporting them in all that they're doing. On the sustainment side, sustainment is naturally an increasing area of emphasis as we're getting jets out there and deployed. I mentioned in my remarks that the Air Force has declared IOC for the jets. So when we're helping to support an operational fleet, our experience has been that sustainment begins to pick up over time. We've been supporting sustainment already. It's typically embedded in the production contracts in terms of the spares and repairs part of the business. And as the deployment rolls out more aggressively, both, I would say, domestically and around the globe, we do expect to see an increase in the demand on the sustainment side. Typically, that demand is focused first, as it should be, through the prime, and so Lockheed, I think, will see a bit more of that sustainment demand in the near term. But over time, when it comes to not only the component level but also the broader support that major teammates can provide, we expect to see benefit from that as well. It's just critically important that these aircraft have a very high operational availability rate, and it will take the full team working together to make sure that, that happens."

And as we think about that set of priorities and how our work lines up with them, I see a continuing shift in the priority space to reestablishing the -- if you think of it in a broad sense, reestablishing in real terms the integrity of our defense infrastructure. Now today, we've got a very aged infrastructure, whether we're talking about our fleet of ships, the aircraft that we have in inventory for the Air Force. And in many respects, it's a product of the priorities over the last number of years where we have intentionally had to focus a bit more on operations, as we've been engaged in a number of places around the globe. First and foremost, we'll always be supporting those in uniform who are deployed and who the nation is asking to go stand in harm's way. But as we think about what we need to be doing here over the next few years, we see the priorities moving in the direction of realigning the investments against the core elements that do assure our ability to defend the country and the ability to defend our allies around the globe as we see the threat moving more towards the high end of things. So I think you've heard a lot about that coming out of the Pentagon, the need to think and act a bit more aggressively around our defense infrastructure. And so that's how we're seeing this prioritization play into what you pointed out, Doug, which is very real, which is a challenging budget environment. And I think, we all expect that we'll see some challenge in the budget environment for a number of years until we can get GDP growth moving in the direction of it needs to go."

We have seen a few things that have been impacting our working capital in the last 1 year to 1.5 years, burn down of advances. We've talked a little bit about contract negotiation delays. And I think, you're also familiar with the impact of the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments, and we've seen that have a little bit of an impact as well. But we expect we're working our way through that. We were able to get, as Wes mentioned, on contract for 9 and 10 for F-35. That helped significantly in terms of cash conversions. And then, in terms of the pension, you mentioned funding, I think you meant CAS. We do expect to see a pretty consistent CAS tailwind helping us kind of offsetting the capital expenditures that we're working on right now in terms of investing towards the future opportunities that we see. And from a funding perspective, we look at that as something that's going to be not as consequential as the recoveries on the pension side. So I think, to your point, we would expect that, that's a reasonable expectation as we look out over the longer term, that we should be strong generators of cash.

So it -- from our perspective, when we're thinking about generating the returns for the business, we want to make sure that first and foremost, we are investing appropriately in the business as we go forward. So I want to make sure that's a part of understanding in the dialogue when it comes to free cash flow because as we look forward over the next few years, CAS recoveries will certainly be a part of that. And all the other aspects of that Ken mentioned with respect to the strong focus we have across the enterprise, and working capital will be a big part of that, but we are investing in our company and we expect to continue to do that."

I think, it is important for the clarity that, that report provides, it makes it clear that the GAO did perform a very rigorous and deliberate review of the work that the Air Force did and its very thorough selection process. And it sort of, I thought, made the very compelling case of validating that the Air Force clearly chose the most capable and affordable solution. And in reading that GAO report, I know there are a lot of lines that are sort of blacked out, but I think, it's important to, as you did, really kind of dig in and understand some of what was said there. First, I think, you'll see in that report the continuing discipline that we bring to the bidding process and that we've been demonstrating time and again over the years. Some years ago, and it was after we had initially been awarded a multibillion-dollar tanker program, we chose to walk away from the second round of bidding on that because it was pretty clear to us that the new acquisition approach simply would not be an attractive program for our company or for our shareholders. And we've declined to bid on a number of other programs over the years for the same reason. And as the GAO report, I think, did a really good job of pointing out, the Air Force took a very focused and long-term approach on this program. They've funded us for a number of years in advance of the bids so we were able to mature our design. But specifically to your question, during that time that we were working our design, it became really clear to us that affordability would be absolutely critical. And we focused our efforts on a couple of things that I think are important to point out. First, obviously, on the direct program, it was so important to create a design from the beginning that would be inherently more affordable to build than some other previous programs had been. And secondly, we had to work really hard to bring down our indirect rates, the overhead in the company, including efforts that we've had underway like reducing the pension burden of cash in our rate structure. So when we looked at all of that, we also elected to make some corporate investments to enable those affordability efforts. So we were able to bid the program at a very mature design and a disciplined approach that connected returns to investments and really drove on affordability. So it gave us a lot of confidence in our ability to go and execute on the program, and in that particular case, I have to say, I have to also give a lot of credit to our customer who's been working really hard to ensure the stability requirements and funding that we all know is one of -- or 2 of the critical ingredients for success in addition to contractor performance. So there are a lot of things that have to come together to create that environment where affordability really sticks. And for us, it has been just a drumbeat within the company for some period of time. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm just really, really gratified, and I know our team around the organization is gratified to see those efforts paying off for us. They're enabling us to bid competitively. They're enabling us to put forward new ideas about how our customer can do things a bit differently and more affordably. And I think that, that is an activity that is really going to serve our customers well for the long term, and of course, will serve our shareholders well because when we're able to capture these programs and execute on them, that's how we build value. So we see it as a part of the core engine in this new environment, and Doug made reference to earlier, where our customers are facing such an intensity around the budget, we simply have to be much more affordable. And it's a core part of our thought process, a core part of our strategy in the company, so I appreciate the question on it."

And we took away from that process a very intensive set of learnings in the company around how you not only execute on the program but also how you bid and then prepare to execute on the program. And it is addressed across our organization in all of the operating rhythms that we have. When it comes to the discipline of bidding, we have a very comprehensive, independent, non-advocate review process that has individuals who have nothing to do with the bid, come in and scrub the heck out of it and try and find everything they can that can potentially go wrong so that we can get our heads around that. It's not that we're trying to avoid every element of risk. We want to be able to manage the risk. We've also worked hard to institute in our culture the recognition that all programs of great complexity like the ones we take on have challenges, and good program managers get their hands up early and ask for help. It's the -- program managers that don't do that, that end up creating problems that are hard to dig your way out of it. We like to use the analogy of a dead fish.

So it is, for us, a strong fabric of what we look for in our program management teams. It's embedded now in the way that we do all of our training. And I think, it's helped us. Are we perfect? No. And we continue to find these issues. And as you pointed out, they show up in terms of unfavorables from time to time, but the discipline around getting on it fast and being able to work on it with clarity and really get to root cause so that we learn from one program onto another is just a core part of the way we operate across the company."

So are we at a place yet on the F-35 where we're satisfied with the profitability of that program? No, we are not. And I think, if you ask the prime, they would give you a similar answer. But it is kind of a reflection of the stage we're in to some extent. So our efforts on F-35 in support of the work that Lockheed is doing is to continue to drive on affordability. The blueprint for affordability that we together put forward, I think, was a really good strategy. And I was delighted to see the customer so supportive of it to continue to aggressively find opportunities around the program to really go after costs because we've got to get the cost down as soon as we can so that we can really get the production rate up is when you're at rate, when you're really able to drive on cost, and that's when you also do better on profitability. So this, to me, is all about getting the rate up, and we need to demonstrate the affordability so we can get the rate up."

Just what I see, and I talked a little bit about this already in response to some of the earlier questions, what I see in our environment today is just a great pressure on our customers to fit it all in. The budget has not grown as fast as the threat, but no one has told our customers they've only got to deal with 70% of the threat because they're getting 70% of what they need. And so I fully understand where they're coming from. Things have to become much more affordable. And oftentimes, I think, people hear that as some sort of great conflict between the Defense Industrial Base and our customer community. It's not. What our customer's saying is they've got to be able to get more capability at a lower cost, and that's just the way it is. And we all know it doesn't do much good to go fight over the small percentage differences that you can negotiate around profitability. The place you make headway on this is to go after the 80%, 85%, 90%, whatever it is, that's the core cost. And so that's our focus, drive affordability by taking out cost. And when we do that, what we've seen is we see a customer that's eager to incentivize our performance with good profitability. So I think, it's a good healthy balanced relationship that we have with our customer community. I know that on individual contracts, there can be lots of dialogue around, well, is it this percent or that percent on profitability. But we all know, ultimately, at the end of the day, nibbling away at profitability is not the answer. It's driving on cost and driving affordability so that our customer can get done what they need to get done. And at the senior levels in our customer community, at the program office levels, I think they understand that. I see good dialogue and engagement around that, but they do need to see more affordability from the industrial base and that is our focus."

And ultimately, in terms of margins, I think, it's going to come down to performance and mix. The bottom line is we have got to continue to perform on our programs. I think, we've been doing a good job of that here over the last few years. And largely, what we're seeing in terms of our margin rates and the margin rate, particularly at AS, to your question, is driven by mix. I think, if you look at our disclosures, you'll see that we talked about it, it's basically some additional development work that's working its way into the revenue stream. We do continue to see that we've got production opportunities as well. It's just that the increase on the development side this quarter is larger than the production side, what we talked about on the production, F-35 increase, E-2D increase. So we're seeing some volume there as well. At the end of the day, I think, it comes down to, again, mix, but then our ability to perform, and I'll just remind you that one of our key metrics for our team is margin rate. And so we continue to make sure the team is focused on driving margin rate. And again, it's not against our own forecast or our own budgets but driving margin rate to be higher than our peers and that's how we incentivize the team.

We've got an automated production line that's ready to roll. It's just a matter of how that moves versus the various other programs that we've got. We talked about some of the development programs as well as other production programs like E-2D and Triton. We're very excited to be into production on the Triton program.

And also, I think, as we've had a few contractual delays that have impacted the timing of cash flows and the working capital as well as I mentioned the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments. But still largely, I don't think we see anything in there other than timing, for the most part. If you look at our historical timing of cash flows, we're much stronger in the fourth quarter just in terms of how our business flows through the year. We're much stronger in terms of inflows in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to be a continued trend this year. We'll have a strong finish to the year and we're confident that we'll be within our range from a free cash flow perspective. That cash flow will come out of those receivables and drive the working capital down. So I think, at the end of the year, you'll see that we're at a level of working capital that's about more consistent with where we normally are by year-end. And then, we'll continue to focus on this as we move forward. We are working with our customer on the impact of the DFAR clause on working capital and how we manage that going forward. I think, they recognize that, that's important to both parties in terms of an appropriate level of cash flow for the type of contract and for the cost profile that's incurred on that contract. So no issues in terms of overall collectibility or any significant change in our ability to manage the working capital.

We had another solid quarter in which all 3 sectors executed well. Our ongoing focus on performance, portfolio and effective cash deployment continues to drive outstanding results and positions us for profitable growth over the long term.
Sales rose 3% this quarter, led by a 9% increase at Aerospace. Segment operating income was higher than last year, driven by sales volume. Our segment operating margin rate declined slightly to 11.9% and is consistent with our guidance for the year and the trend toward a higher proportion of development work. Earnings per share rose 22% to $3.35 and benefited from a favorable tax settlement and lower unallocated corporate expense in the quarter. Excluding those benefits, earnings per share rose 6%.
Third quarter cash from operations was more than $700 million, approximately $180 million higher than last year. After capital expenditures of $137 million, free cash flow totaled $601 million. Typically, our cash flow -- our cash from operations is heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. We expect this year will be consistent with that pattern, and we are on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year.
Based on this quarter's results and our fourth quarter outlook, we are raising our 2016 sales guidance to a range of $23.9 billion to $24.1 billion versus our prior guidance range of $23.5 billion to $24 billion. We continue to expect our segment operating margin rate will be in the high 11% range, with total operating margin rate expectations moving to the mid to high 12%. And we now expect 2016 earnings per share will be between $11.55 and $11.75.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for approximately $470 million, and year-to-date, we've repurchased 5.6 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average price of $207 per share. Share repurchases continue to be a significant element of our capital deployment strategy.
We achieved several key program milestones and awards during the quarter. Global Hawk surpassed 200,000 flight hours and successfully completed the second of 3 planned sensor demonstrations by flying the Optical Bar Camera broad-area synoptic sensor. This is the first time this legacy U.S. Air Force camera has been flown on a high-altitude unmanned aircraft. Successful demonstration of the sensor capability supports the Air Force's plan for Global Hawk to assume greater responsibility for our nation's high-altitude ISR mission. 
Also during the quarter, Triton achieved Milestone C approval. As a result, we were awarded contracts for LRIP 1 and long lead items for LRIP 2. The transition to LRIP positions us to execute the U.S. Navy's program of record for 68 air vehicles and to move toward fulfilling missions for international customers such as Australia. 
The U.S. Navy also ordered 10 more Fire Scout unmanned helicopters with previously authorized funding, which will bring the Navy's fleet to 29. The Navy has also indicated that a successful Milestone C decision could lead to an award for an additional 11 helicopters.
On the manned aircraft side, the Air Force declared the F-35 ready for initial operational capability. And we've now completed negotiations for F-35 lots 9 and 10. We also received a U.S. Navy contract to begin producing a second E-2D Advanced Hawkeye for Japan. And the Pentagon and the State Department approved the sale of 28 F/A-18s to Kuwait, with an option to purchase 12 more of the fighter jets. If put on contract, this would extend the life of our F/A-18 production line. In summary, for AS, growing volume on new development programs and programs transitioning to production continues to outpace legacy program ramp-downs.
At Mission Systems, we delivered the first CIRCM missile-defense system to the Army. These systems were delivered under an EMD contract to produce the next generation of survivability equipment to defend rotary-wing aircraft against manned portable air defense systems and other heat-seeking threats. 
Mission Systems was also awarded a contract for 9 additional G/ATOR systems for the Marine Corps. This ground air radar system is an example of innovating to provide the best capability for the war fighter while ensuring affordability. 
At Technology Services, we were awarded additional contracts to continue maintenance and modernization of the U.K. AWACS fleet and the B-2 bomber. TS was also awarded a $108 million contract for the Social Security Administration Information Technology Support Service Program. It's really gratifying to see that the investments we have made during the defense downturn, along with our aggressive approach to affordability, including the resulting improvement in our indirect rate structure, are supporting our ability to capture new attractive programs across the enterprise.
We continue to have a rich opportunity set that includes programs like the T-X Trainer, Joint STARS recapitalization, ground-based strategic deterrent, SABR Radar, GPS 3, MQ-25 and a number of other restricted and international opportunities. Realization of these opportunities depends on our customer's ability to plan for and to fund our national security priorities. 
As you know, we're currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on December 9, and as such, we do not yet have an FY '17 Defense Appropriations bill. A prolonged CR would likely constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. So we encourage Congress to work together after the elections to fund our government and to ensure its effective operations.
In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results and our outlook. We remain well-positioned to continue generating value by focusing on performance, managing our portfolio and effectively deploying our cash.
So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of third quarter results and our 2016 guidance. Ken?"

I want to add my thanks to the team. It was another good quarter. I'll briefly review third quarter results and provide some color on the tax settlement, unallocated corporate items, our net pension adjustment and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Our overall results included higher sales, solid operating income and margin rates and good cash flow, all of which positions us for a strong finish to the year.
Performance was solid across the company. Sales at Aerospace rose 9% over the prior year quarter and 6% year-to-date. Higher volume for manned aircraft and autonomous systems drove revenue growth in both periods. For both the quarter and year-to-date, manned aircraft reflects higher volume for restricted activities, increases in F-35 deliveries and ramp-up on the E-2D program. 
During the quarter, we delivered 16 F-35 units versus 15 in last year's third quarter, and year-to-date, we've delivered 44 units compared to 36 at this point last year. In autonomous systems, we continue to see higher volume across a number of programs, including Global Hawk and Triton. Growth in Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems is more than offsetting a slight decline in space volume for both the quarter and year-to-date. Lower space volume continues to be driven by reduced activity on non-restricted programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.
Aerospace third quarter operating income increased 4%, largely due to higher volume. Margin rate contracted 50 basis points to 11.2% due to the changing contract mix in Manned Aircraft, partially offset by improved performance in Autonomous Systems. Year-to-date, Aerospace operating margin is 11.4%. We now expect Aerospace sales will be in the mid-$10 billion range versus our prior guidance of low $10 billion. With this higher volume and the change in mix, we are refining our operating margin rate guidance to mid-11% from mid to high 11%. 
Mission Systems third quarter and year-to-date sales were comparable to last year. Results for the quarter included lower volume for Sensors and Processing programs and Advanced Capabilities programs, partially offset by higher volume for Cyber and ISR activities. 
In Sensors and Processing, volume was impacted by certain international programs nearing completion and lower combat avionics volume due to timing of legacy F-16 and F-35 radar deliveries. Lower volume in these areas was partially offset by higher volume for new communications programs. 
In Advanced Capabilities, volume was lower across a number of navigation and maritime programs, partially offset by higher volume for restricted activities. Higher sales in Cyber and ISR were due to higher volume on cyber solutions programs.
Mission Systems third quarter and year-to-date operating income and margin rate were comparable to last year. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, with a high 12% operating margin rate. No change from prior guidance. 
Technology Services third quarter sales were comparable to the prior year and down 2% year-to-date. Both periods reflect the completion of several programs in 2015 and lower ICBM volume, partially offset by higher volume for the KC-10 program and an international training program. Just a reminder, we expect KC-10 sales will be winding down in 2017 as our contract nears completion. 
Technology Services third quarter and year-to-date operating income are comparable to same periods in 2015. Operating margin rate increased 20 basis points for both periods. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Technology Services sales in the mid-$4 billion range, but we're increasing guidance for operating margin rate from low 10% to mid-10%.
Total segment operating margin rate was 11.9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.4% for the third quarter and 13% year-to-date and included a significant reduction in unallocated corporate expense. 
Two items drove the $34 million improvement. The first item was a $30 million benefit for state tax refunds claimed on prior year tax returns. The second item was a $25 million benefit recognized for estimated prior year overhead claim recoveries. These items were partially offset by an increase in provisions for environmental remediation.
Year-to-date, unallocated corporate expenses are $31 million, and we now expect unallocated corporate expense will be about $100 million for the full year. You'll recall that these expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, during the quarter, we completed the demographic study that allows us to finalize our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016. Based on the demographics update, we are increasing our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to approximately $310 million from the previous $275 million. 
Based on our sector's consistent operating performance, lower expected unallocated corporate expense and improved net pension adjustment, we now expect a mid to high 12% total operating margin rate versus our prior guidance of low 12%. 
Our third quarter tax rate was 21.7% versus 29.2% in last year's third quarter. The lower rate reflects this quarter's favorable tax settlements as well as the extension of the research tax credit. As we told you in July, we resolved the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense was reduced by $42 million. We expect our 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. All of that rose up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $11.55 to $11.75, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares.
While we increased EPS guidance, we're maintaining free cash flow guidance as the $55 million for the unallocated corporate items will be reflected in future periods and not in 2016. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which continues to anticipate capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016.
A final note on cash. We are evaluating tax-efficient options to repatriate certain earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. If we move forward, we would expect to repatriate the majority of our foreign cash balances.
A quick update on pension. We'll be providing detailed 2017 guidance on our year-end call. And it's our practice at that time to provide a 3-year outlook for FAS, CAS and funding for the plans. As this has been a topic of much interest recently, I thought it would be helpful to give a quick update.
Last quarter, we estimated 2017 FAS expense of $670 million, assuming a 75 basis point change in our discount rate and an 8% return on plan assets, which is about where plan asset returns were as of last Friday. FAS expense is sensitive to changes in discount rates, about a net $70 million change for every 25 basis point movement. 
FAS also changes by about $50 million for every 100 basis point variance from the assumed plan asset returns. CAS, on the other hand, is much less sensitive to interest rates and plan asset returns. As most of you are aware, CAS is discounted at a 25-year average interest rate.
Under current assumptions, we expect CAS of approximately $1.1 billion in 2017 and 2018. In addition, holding all assumptions constant, we expect CAS will remain at about that level for at least a couple of additional years, barring major market dislocations. We also continue to expect the required cash contributions to the plans will be about $100 million for '17 and '18. And while we do expect higher required contributions in 2019, we estimate 2019 required contributions will be well below CAS recoveries.
With that, Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A."

It is an interesting time in that it's clear that there's a significant recapitalization wave that's underway across a number of our customer communities. And quite frankly, it's one that's been deferred for quite a long time. And so they're facing the need to address a number of not only recapitalization of older existing assets, the trainer program is an example of that, but also the need to address what's going on around the globe in terms of the emergence of more aggressive threat profiles. And so there's a view to the future of new capabilities. I went through a little bit of that list in some of my prepared remarks, but let me just touch on some of the ones that have a lot of focus from us. T-X is obviously a very interesting one, capitalization of a significant fleet of aircraft for training. There are a number of competitors in this competition. And as you indicated, the Air Force is working on its sort of final round to come out with the RFP later this year. So we expect this to be quite an interesting competition and one that we're looking forward to participating in. If you kind of look across the landscape of other things, the recapitalization of the nuclear infrastructure, nuclear force infrastructure for the country's underway. Clearly, the bomber program is an important activity there. But another one that we're quite interested in is the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program, GBSD, that I mentioned in my remarks. This too is another imperative for the country, given the amount of time that is spent since we've really invested in our ICBM fleet, and it's an area of strong expertise and knowledge base in our company. So we see that as a really good opportunity. The space that's associated with autonomous vehicles continues to be very active on our side. There's not only the international opportunities afforded by the success of our Global Hawk and Triton programs, but we see the Navy taking steps in the direction of yet another new program that we think will be a core part of the overall architecture for the Navy going forward. The MQ-25 program is the name that it's going by currently. And all the work that we've done over the years on our UCAS demonstrator program, we think, positions us well for that. So those are some examples in the Aerospace Systems world. I can go through a long list of examples as well in each of our other sectors. Mission Systems, the work that they've been doing on advanced radars has positioned us exceptionally well for a number of upcoming activities as well as the work that's ongoing in cyber, and of course, the work that are involved in a number of other classes of sensors such as the IRCM. I mentioned CIRCM in my remarks earlier as well. So both domestically and internationally, we see a very long list of opportunities out there. Part of the challenge always is to make sure that we are thoughtful about which of the ones that are out there we go after. So we have, over the years, I think, demonstrated a lot of discipline in how we're selecting our targets and how we're investing to pursue them. But it is a really interesting period of time where there is so much demand for the class of work that we do. And we're delighted that the work that we've been doing over these last number of years has positioned us well for that."

And I would say that's the primary driver of what we're seeing is just a recognition that for our own security and the security of our allies, we need to be making these investments."

Let me start and Ken may have some things to add on that. On F-35, we have completed our negotiations on lots 9 and 10 with Lockheed, which is typical for a prime contractor to want to lock down its supply chain as it finishes off its negotiations with a customer. I would say, across the board, we've all seen the pace on negotiations on the LRIPs for F-35 to take a lot longer than anyone would hope. So I -- it's clear there's opportunities here for process improvement as we go forward. But I'm sure both the Lockheed -- that Lockheed and the JPO would point out, these are huge complex programs. And so there is inherently -- that degree of complexity inherently drives a little bit longer cycle times. So I think, it's a matter working our way through it collectively. But in terms of just looking at the Northrop Grumman position on this today, we have definitized with Lockheed Martin on lots 9 and 10. So we're continuing to support them obviously in the work that they're doing with the customer. It's a good team across the board with Lockheed as the prime, and we and BAE Systems are very focused in supporting them in all that they're doing. On the sustainment side, sustainment is naturally an increasing area of emphasis as we're getting jets out there and deployed. I mentioned in my remarks that the Air Force has declared IOC for the jets. So when we're helping to support an operational fleet, our experience has been that sustainment begins to pick up over time. We've been supporting sustainment already. It's typically embedded in the production contracts in terms of the spares and repairs part of the business. And as the deployment rolls out more aggressively, both, I would say, domestically and around the globe, we do expect to see an increase in the demand on the sustainment side. Typically, that demand is focused first, as it should be, through the prime, and so Lockheed, I think, will see a bit more of that sustainment demand in the near term. But over time, when it comes to not only the component level but also the broader support that major teammates can provide, we expect to see benefit from that as well. It's just critically important that these aircraft have a very high operational availability rate, and it will take the full team working together to make sure that, that happens."

And as we think about that set of priorities and how our work lines up with them, I see a continuing shift in the priority space to reestablishing the -- if you think of it in a broad sense, reestablishing in real terms the integrity of our defense infrastructure. Now today, we've got a very aged infrastructure, whether we're talking about our fleet of ships, the aircraft that we have in inventory for the Air Force. And in many respects, it's a product of the priorities over the last number of years where we have intentionally had to focus a bit more on operations, as we've been engaged in a number of places around the globe. First and foremost, we'll always be supporting those in uniform who are deployed and who the nation is asking to go stand in harm's way. But as we think about what we need to be doing here over the next few years, we see the priorities moving in the direction of realigning the investments against the core elements that do assure our ability to defend the country and the ability to defend our allies around the globe as we see the threat moving more towards the high end of things. So I think you've heard a lot about that coming out of the Pentagon, the need to think and act a bit more aggressively around our defense infrastructure. And so that's how we're seeing this prioritization play into what you pointed out, Doug, which is very real, which is a challenging budget environment.

I'll maybe start just by talking a little bit about the process that we work through, and I'll say that we very much focus on managing our receivables, our net working capital. We have seen a few things that have been impacting our working capital in the last 1 year to 1.5 years, burn down of advances. We've talked a little bit about contract negotiation delays. And I think, you're also familiar with the impact of the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments, and we've seen that have a little bit of an impact as well. But we expect we're working our way through that. We were able to get, as Wes mentioned, on contract for 9 and 10 for F-35. That helped significantly in terms of cash conversions. And then, in terms of the pension, you mentioned funding, I think you meant CAS. We do expect to see a pretty consistent CAS tailwind helping us kind of offsetting the capital expenditures that we're working on right now in terms of investing towards the future opportunities that we see. And from a funding perspective, we look at that as something that's going to be not as consequential as the recoveries on the pension side. So I think, to your point, we would expect that, that's a reasonable expectation as we look out over the longer term, that we should be strong generators of cash. And as we grow the business, we'll expect that to kind of flow through to the bottom line and flow through to the cash via cash from operations and ultimately free cash flow."

So it -- from our perspective, when we're thinking about generating the returns for the business, we want to make sure that first and foremost, we are investing appropriately in the business as we go forward. So I want to make sure that's a part of understanding in the dialogue when it comes to free cash flow because as we look forward over the next few years, CAS recoveries will certainly be a part of that.

I think, it is important for the clarity that, that report provides, it makes it clear that the GAO did perform a very rigorous and deliberate review of the work that the Air Force did and its very thorough selection process. And it sort of, I thought, made the very compelling case of validating that the Air Force clearly chose the most capable and affordable solution. And in reading that GAO report, I know there are a lot of lines that are sort of blacked out, but I think, it's important to, as you did, really kind of dig in and understand some of what was said there. First, I think, you'll see in that report the continuing discipline that we bring to the bidding process and that we've been demonstrating time and again over the years. Some years ago, and it was after we had initially been awarded a multibillion-dollar tanker program, we chose to walk away from the second round of bidding on that because it was pretty clear to us that the new acquisition approach simply would not be an attractive program for our company or for our shareholders. And we've declined to bid on a number of other programs over the years for the same reason. And as the GAO report, I think, did a really good job of pointing out, the Air Force took a very focused and long-term approach on this program. They've funded us for a number of years in advance of the bids so we were able to mature our design. But specifically to your question, during that time that we were working our design, it became really clear to us that affordability would be absolutely critical. And we focused our efforts on a couple of things that I think are important to point out. First, obviously, on the direct program, it was so important to create a design from the beginning that would be inherently more affordable to build than some other previous programs had been. And secondly, we had to work really hard to bring down our indirect rates, the overhead in the company, including efforts that we've had underway like reducing the pension burden of cash in our rate structure. So when we looked at all of that, we also elected to make some corporate investments to enable those affordability efforts. So we were able to bid the program at a very mature design and a disciplined approach that connected returns to investments and really drove on affordability. So it gave us a lot of confidence in our ability to go and execute on the program, and in that particular case, I have to say, I have to also give a lot of credit to our customer who's been working really hard to ensure the stability requirements and funding that we all know is one of -- or 2 of the critical ingredients for success in addition to contractor performance. So there are a lot of things that have to come together to create that environment where affordability really sticks. And for us, it has been just a drumbeat within the company for some period of time. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm just really, really gratified, and I know our team around the organization is gratified to see those efforts paying off for us. They're enabling us to bid competitively. They're enabling us to put forward new ideas about how our customer can do things a bit differently and more affordably. And I think that, that is an activity that is really going to serve our customers well for the long term, and of course, will serve our shareholders well because when we're able to capture these programs and execute on them, that's how we build value. So we see it as a part of the core engine in this new environment, and Doug made reference to earlier, where our customers are facing such an intensity around the budget, we simply have to be much more affordable. And it's a core part of our thought process, a core part of our strategy in the company, so I appreciate the question on it."

You, I'm sure, and most on the call would recall, it was not that long ago and during the last decade where we had a series of program issues that resulted in -- unfavorable would be a kind word, they resulted in terrible adjustments that we had to make to our earnings estimates. And we took away from that process a very intensive set of learnings in the company around how you not only execute on the program but also how you bid and then prepare to execute on the program. And it is addressed across our organization in all of the operating rhythms that we have. When it comes to the discipline of bidding, we have a very comprehensive, independent, non-advocate review process that has individuals who have nothing to do with the bid, come in and scrub the heck out of it and try and find everything they can that can potentially go wrong so that we can get our heads around that. It's not that we're trying to avoid every element of risk. We want to be able to manage the risk. We've also worked hard to institute in our culture the recognition that all programs of great complexity like the ones we take on have challenges, and good program managers get their hands up early and ask for help. It's the -- program managers that don't do that, that end up creating problems that are hard to dig your way out of it. We like to use the analogy of a dead fish. It smells pretty bad after day 1 or day 2, but wait for a week or 2, you don't want to be anywhere near it. So it's -- for us, it is all about this discipline around program execution, the clarity and transparency that we need so that we can get the resources on issues fast. And we know there will always be issues. That's just the nature of our business where we tend to work at the higher end of technology, but it's how you manage those risks that matters. So it is, for us, a strong fabric of what we look for in our program management teams. It's embedded now in the way that we do all of our training. And I think, it's helped us. Are we perfect? No. And we continue to find these issues. And as you pointed out, they show up in terms of unfavorables from time to time, but the discipline around getting on it fast and being able to work on it with clarity and really get to root cause so that we learn from one program onto another is just a core part of the way we operate across the company."

But it is kind of a reflection of the stage we're in to some extent. So our efforts on F-35 in support of the work that Lockheed is doing is to continue to drive on affordability. The blueprint for affordability that we together put forward, I think, was a really good strategy. And I was delighted to see the customer so supportive of it to continue to aggressively find opportunities around the program to really go after costs because we've got to get the cost down as soon as we can so that we can really get the production rate up is when you're at rate, when you're really able to drive on cost, and that's when you also do better on profitability.

Just what I see, and I talked a little bit about this already in response to some of the earlier questions, what I see in our environment today is just a great pressure on our customers to fit it all in. The budget has not grown as fast as the threat, but no one has told our customers they've only got to deal with 70% of the threat because they're getting 70% of what they need. And so I fully understand where they're coming from. Things have to become much more affordable. And oftentimes, I think, people hear that as some sort of great conflict between the Defense Industrial Base and our customer community. It's not. What our customer's saying is they've got to be able to get more capability at a lower cost, and that's just the way it is. And we all know it doesn't do much good to go fight over the small percentage differences that you can negotiate around profitability. The place you make headway on this is to go after the 80%, 85%, 90%, whatever it is, that's the core cost. And so that's our focus, drive affordability by taking out cost. And when we do that, what we've seen is we see a customer that's eager to incentivize our performance with good profitability. So I think, it's a good healthy balanced relationship that we have with our customer community. I know that on individual contracts, there can be lots of dialogue around, well, is it this percent or that percent on profitability. But we all know, ultimately, at the end of the day, nibbling away at profitability is not the answer. It's driving on cost and driving affordability so that our customer can get done what they need to get done. And at the senior levels in our customer community, at the program office levels, I think they understand that. I see good dialogue and engagement around that, but they do need to see more affordability from the industrial base and that is our focus."

I think, we've been doing a good job of that here over the last few years. And largely, what we're seeing in terms of our margin rates and the margin rate, particularly at AS, to your question, is driven by mix. I think, if you look at our disclosures, you'll see that we talked about it, it's basically some additional development work that's working its way into the revenue stream. We do continue to see that we've got production opportunities as well. It's just that the increase on the development side this quarter is larger than the production side, what we talked about on the production, F-35 increase, E-2D increase. So we're seeing some volume there as well. At the end of the day, I think, it comes down to, again, mix, but then our ability to perform, and I'll just remind you that one of our key metrics for our team is margin rate. And so we continue to make sure the team is focused on driving margin rate. And again, it's not against our own forecast or our own budgets but driving margin rate to be higher than our peers and that's how we incentivize the team.

We've kind of seen, I think, the ramp down on those and we'll probably be at a more consistent level as we look forward. But I think it's important to recognize that we've managed the space business really as an overall portfolio. And unfortunately, a large part of that business is one that we can't talk a lot about. But I will say that we are seeing some growth in other areas of the business. And overall, we think that the declines in space will probably work their way through the system in '17. And largely, when we look at that business as a whole and we look at it as it moves forward, we expect that we'll see some growth over the long term in the space business. It's a robust business and has some opportunity sets in front of us that Wes mentioned. So we look at that as something that will be growing over the long term."

And that's the re-look that's going into the space architecture, where it's pretty clear on a go-forward basis, space is no longer a sanctuary, and we're going to have to think about that architecturally. And our customer's being thoughtful on that, and it will take a little bit of time to sort out exactly how they want to acquire the new capabilities. So I think it's kind of a natural process on our unrestricted space business. The restricted side of the business continues to be quite healthy."

A lot of the upward pressure on working capital this year has been in receivables, and there's typically some but it's been more this year.

I commented a little bit on that earlier in terms of some of the burn down of advances that we've seen on a couple of international programs. And also, I think, as we've had a few contractual delays that have impacted the timing of cash flows and the working capital as well as I mentioned the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments. But still largely, I don't think we see anything in there other than timing, for the most part. If you look at our historical timing of cash flows, we're much stronger in the fourth quarter just in terms of how our business flows through the year. We're much stronger in terms of inflows in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to be a continued trend this year. We'll have a strong finish to the year and we're confident that we'll be within our range from a free cash flow perspective. That cash flow will come out of those receivables and drive the working capital down. So I think, at the end of the year, you'll see that we're at a level of working capital that's about more consistent with where we normally are by year-end. And then, we'll continue to focus on this as we move forward. We are working with our customer on the impact of the DFAR clause on working capital and how we manage that going forward. I think, they recognize that, that's important to both parties in terms of an appropriate level of cash flow for the type of contract and for the cost profile that's incurred on that contract. So no issues in terms of overall collectibility or any significant change in our ability to manage the working capital. I think, we just got to work through these couple of things, and we'll see our cash flows start to increase as we grow the business as we look forward."

We worked that through the system through the fourth quarter of last year, and that resulted in a significant amount of capital deployed in excess of free cash flow. I wouldn't necessarily expect that to continue. As you look forward, we would expect to be essentially deploying cash in a manner that says, look, we're going to invest in the business, as Wes mentioned. We're investing higher in terms of CapEx. We pay a competitive dividend. You saw we increased our dividend again in May. And then, excess cash we tend to deploy through share repurchases. We take a pretty consistent approach to share repurchase. We're not speculative. We set a plan and we go after it. In terms of maybe what you're seeing is we finished the 25% repurchase in the fourth quarter of last year. We kind of have a little bit of a slower first part of the year this year in terms of cash generation, so we spent a little bit more than 100%. But as we generate the cash in the fourth quarter, I think, you'll start to see that normalize a bit."
