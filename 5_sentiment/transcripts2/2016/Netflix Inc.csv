We've done this before, not just in LatAm but in other places, and we'll continue with our playbook in the rest of the world. Our partners are another element of this, right? So Reed mentioned iOS. we'll be looking to draft of large partners in the group in terms of iOS, Android and other options. And there's a lot of evolution going on in the payments world. I got misquoted at Citi by saying that we're interested in Bitcoin, but what I said was they'll be nice to have in 5 to 10 years a borderless currency like Bitcoin. I think those people that are so excited about it are interested in breaking down those barriers and in using the power of Internet at the Internet age to reduce the friction of payments that are existing today in terms of some of these banking structures.

But I think the 1 3 to 1 4 range of cash to P&L expense will continue to hold, and so far our expectations of use of cash have been about as expected. You see in the letter that we wrote that we're on pace to use about $1 billion and maybe a little more this year. But we upsized our debt deal last year, about a year ago. And so in terms of timing, we'd be looking at later this year, maybe early next year before we would need to do any more on the capital side."

And we continue to see new additions even in the U.S. and markets that are -- have been in place for 4 to 5 years now.

What you asked about, about our suppliers, and I think confrontation is probably overstated, but there's a lot of rhetoric going around right now about how quickly and how aggressively people will license. It's still a very competitive business. And I think what happens is that people sell their programming to the highest bidder. And if we're that bidder, we get the programming.

And I think we'll take the approach that we took in Latin America, which is just to look at our next best opportunities to open up additional pockets of the market. We've done this before not just in LatAm but in other places, and we'll continue with that playbook in the rest of the world. Our partners are another element of this, right? So Reed mentioned iOS. We'll be looking to draft off of large partners in the group in terms of iOS, Android and other options. And there's a lot of evolution going on in the payments world. I got misquoted at Citi by saying that we're interested in Bitcoin. But what I said was it'd be nice to have in 5 to 10 years a borderless currency like Bitcoin. I think those people that are so excited about it are interested in breaking down those barriers and in using the power of the Internet at the Internet age to reduce the friction of payments that are existing today in some of these banking structures. So we'll be drafting off those long term as well. But in the near term, expect us to continue to just knock down the best opportunities in terms of adding local payment methods, credit, debit cards, drafting off partners as well."

We were literally within hours of it, but -- so we did anticipate that net additions would be lighter year-on-year. I would say the credit card was a background issue in Q3, continues to be a background issue. But the larger thing is that it's just the next 50 million are a little harder than the first 50 million in terms of growth. And we're doing everything on the content side, on the product side. We're continuing to improve that service. But you're seeing that the law of large numbers, when you grow steady at 5 million, 6 million net additions a year on a larger number, then that percentage growth is smaller year-over-year. And that's what we predicted, and that's what you see in our guide for Q1 as well."

When normally people think of Netflix original programming, they've been thinking about our sophisticated dramas and adult comedies more so than our kids programming.

And we're just -- we're also looking to grow categories like Fuller House, which are programming that are watched together: parents watching their kid -- a show that their kids love, that they just don't tolerate but they enjoy too. And it's a really underserved market, and that's why we called that out specifically. And on the movies side, it was a great first swing, I think, with Ridiculous Six and Beasts of No Nation. Beasts of No Nation is in the discussion about the Oscars, didn't quite make it there, but picked up nominations in almost every other category. The viewing we're thrilled with around the world and have been continued to be thrilled with, as we've expanded into new territories.

And we continue to see new additions even in the U.S. and markets that are -- have been in place for 4 to 5 years now.

We've done this before not just in LatAm but in other places, and we'll continue with that playbook in the rest of the world. Our partners are another element of this, right? So Reed mentioned iOS. We'll be looking to draft off of large partners in the group in terms of iOS, Android and other options. And there's a lot of evolution going on in the payments world. I got misquoted at Citi by saying that we're interested in Bitcoin. But what I said was, it'd be nice to have in 5 to 10 years a borderless currency like Bitcoin. I think those people that are so excited about it are interested in breaking down those barriers and in using the power of the Internet and the Internet age to reduce the friction of payments that are existing today in some of these banking structures. So we'll be drafting off those long term as well. But in the near term, expect us to continue to just knock down the best opportunities in terms of adding local payment methods, credit, debit cards, drafting off partners as well."

Now that being said, we think it's worth it to complement the selection by focusing on some local productions in those territories throughout Europe and throughout Latin America. So we had mentioned that on May 5, we will launch Marseille, which is our first French language show, filmed in France, starting Gerard Depardieu. We're also filming original series in Spain, in Brazil, in Italy.

So I think from our perspective, we were super happy with the results of Q1 and we wanted, in Q2, that to continue and it is, but we're mindful of the fact that we've got these large blooms of launches last year and then in Q1 this year, with the rest of world markets for the Netflix global launch, that are going to continue forward because they're addressing pent-up demand. So for us, we're focused on continuing -- continued growth in those markets and that's what we're seeing and we're focused on continued improvement from an economic sense of reducing those losses.

So while we -- they're a great producing partner. They're a great licensing supplier, and we're always trying to figure out ways that we don't bump into one another competitively, but sometimes it's inevitable. Daredevil Season 2 was fantastic. I think critics loved it. Our -- the viewing numbers have really grown, and we've added an enormous number of people to Daredevil Season 1, both because of the excitement around Season 2 and they were in additional territories now that didn't have the opportunity to see the show in the first go-around.

Yes, you asked the question, why are we confident of this explanation. Well, the obvious explanations other than this, our competition, which we're pretty confident is not a factor because we got this slight uptick in churn in multiple countries the same week. And of course, that's not a competitive signature, including Canada where many of the other S cloud services don't operate. There's a separate set and that operate in Canada. So that's why we're pretty confident it's not competition. And then again, if it was saturation, what we'd be seeing is hit to gross ads more than we would in terms of churn. So other possible explanations were that we did something on our service around that week. But we've looked at everything and the fact that it's coincident with that Google trend data we included, really indicates that people don't like price increases. We know that. It's a necessary phase for us to go through. And with the increased revenue, we're continuing to invest in better and better content.

As for the CW, the CW is a real anomaly in terms of the network. They happen to produce programming that has a very consistent sensibility and a very consistent fan base and that fits really nicely with the big viewing and demographic with Netflix. We've got a great relationship with them. We've opted to re-up that relationship even though it's domestic-only ended up individually license, many of those shows for global distribution. And we're -- we are thrilled to do that and not only to free up our business, but also to move up the availability date of those shows to just 8 days after their last episode airs, versus having to wait until just before the new season launches so the Franks arm as far us the PBS Amazon I would say we have so oh aggressively improved and expanded our original kids programming. In fact, we have 35 original kids programming, the kids shows on Netflix now many more in production and various forms of development. So more and more of that programming is leading to our exclusive global programming, our original programming in place of massive loads of content from other sources. So our appetite for that, meaning our appetite for high prices have gone down quite a bit. And what else did I miss there? Yes, the Star Trek. So Star Trek is an example of one that seems like an oddball because we don't have it in the U.S. this is one of those overheads of regional licensing is that CBS was not making the U.S. available and we wanted to make sure that we could bring that show to the rest of our subscribers around the world so we're happy to premiere the use Star Trek series all over the world outside of North America."

But we also have to figure what's the right amount of reinvestment in the business to maintain competitiveness both domestically and abroad. And I think the U.S. business, I've mentioned this in the past that to the extent that we produce an original for the globe, now that we're in additional markets, we're in more and more markets, the U.S. P&L does receive some of that relief because there's a smaller share of that allocation going to the U.S. than there was before. So some of those -- that was a play -- that was in the past, my team reminds me. And nowadays, the profit growth of the U.S. is being driven just by growing revenue faster than content.

As for the CW, the CW is a real anomaly in terms of a network. They happen to produce programming that has a very consistent sensibility and a very consistent fan base, and it fits really nicely with the big viewing demographic on Netflix. We've got a great relationship with them. We opted to re-up that relationship even though it's domestic only and an output deal. And we've individually licensed many of those shows for global distribution. And we are thrilled to do that and not only to re-up our business but also to move up the availability date of those shows to just 8 days after their last episode airs versus having to wait until just before the new season launches. So the fans of the CW programming are going to love that development. Then as far as the PBS, Amazon, I would say we have so aggressively improved and expanded our original kids programming. In fact, we have 35 different original kids programming, the kids shows on Netflix now, many more in production and various forms of development. So more and more of that programming is leaning to our exclusive global programming, our original programming in place of massive loads of content from other sources. So our appetite for that, meaning our appetite for high prices, has gone down quite a bit. And what else did I miss there? Yes, Star Trek. So Star Trek's an example of one that seems like an oddball because we don't have it in the U.S. But this is one of those overhangs of regional licensing, is that CBS was not making the U.S. available, and we wanted to make sure that we could bring that show to our -- to the rest of our subscribers around the world. So we're happy to premiere the new Star Trek series all over the world outside of North America."

So I'm pretty confident that we're going to -- that it will be business as usual with the networks and studios."

We launched in Marseille. We've launched original shows like in Japan. We've launched in Mexico, and we currently have productions going on in Germany, Spain, Italy, Korea, Japan, France, Brazil, Cambodia. So we are producing around the world, original programming. And it really has an outsized impact in those first couple of shows because I think it does show those local markets that we're investing in their production infrastructure. We're investing in their culture and then taken -- most importantly, taking those shows and distributing them around the world. So when we release a show like HIBANA in Japan, people are watching HIBANA all around the world at the exact same time, which makes us a very important part of the entertainment landscape in those countries and, ultimately, to those consumers as well."

So we have to sort of acknowledge reality that we may get there sooner than we sort of initially targeted. I think, for us, broadening it back from just the sort of quarterly performance of that progression towards U.S. contribution margin is the right amount to reinvest in the business. We know that we want to drive efficiency, so we want some discipline there between profit and additional investment. But we also have to figure what's the right amount of reinvestment in the business to maintain competitiveness both domestically and abroad. And I think the U.S. business, I've mentioned this in the past that to the extent that we produce an original for the globe, now that we're in additional markets, we're in more and more markets, the U.S. P&L does receive some of that relief because there's a smaller share of that allocation going to the U.S. than there was before. So some of those -- that was at play.  That was in the past, my team reminds me. And nowadays, the profit growth of the U.S. is being driven just by growing revenue faster than content. But I think those 2 things were at play in the sort of last 4 to 6 quarters as we look at the trends."

As for the CW, the CW is a real anomaly in terms of a network. They happen to produce programming that has a very consistent sensibility and a very consistent fan base, and it fit really nicely with the big viewing demographic on Netflix. We've got a great relationship with them. We opted to re-up that relationship even though it's domestic-only and an output deal. And we've individually licensed many of those shows for global distribution. And we are thrilled to do that and not only to re-up our business but also to move up the availability date of those shows to just 8 days after their last episode airs versus having to wait until just before the new season launches. So the fans of the CW programming are going to love that development. Then as far as the PBS, Amazon, I would say we have so aggressively improved and expanded our original kids programming. In fact, we have 35 different original kids programming -- kids shows on Netflix now, many more in production and various forms of development. So more and more of that programming is leaning to our exclusive global programming and our original programming in place of massive loads of content from other sources. So our appetite for that, meaning our appetite for high prices, has gone down quite a bit. And what else did I miss there? The CBS deal: Star Trek. So Star Trek's an example of one that seems like an oddball because we don't have it in the U.S. But this is one of those overhangs of regional licensing, is that CBS was not making the U.S. available, and we wanted to make sure that we could bring that show to our -- to the rest of our subscribers around the world. So we're happy to premiere the new Star Trek series all over the world outside of North America."

So that's why we're pretty confident it's not competition. And then, again, if it was saturation, what we'd be seeing is a hit to gross adds more than we would in terms of churn. So other possible explanations were that we did something on our service around that week, but we've looked at everything. And the fact that it's coincident with that Google Trend data we included, really, indicates that people don't like price increases. We know that. It's a necessary phase for us to get through.

In terms of that moderating, you've got a lot of pent-up demand that then sort of reverts to a more normal growth pattern over time. That can take several quarters. It can take 2 quarters. We've seen different experiences by market. So I would say Japan was a pent-up market in some respects and then starts to moderate. So that does factor into the comp. And some of our other markets may be experiencing flat or even down year on growth. It's just a mixture across that. But like I said, we've seen markets that have decelerated, then pick up again and accelerate. So collectively, across the -- all of our basket of investments in markets, we think there is a large long-term opportunity that we're going to optimize against. And we know that we got work cut out for some of our newer markets that will take time to get there."

As for the CW, the CW is a real anomaly in terms of a network. They happen to produce programming that has a very consistent sensibility and a very consistent fan base, and it fit really nicely with the big viewing demographic on Netflix. We've got a great relationship with them. We opted to re-up that relationship even though it's domestic-only and an output deal. And we've individually licensed many of those shows for global distribution. And we are thrilled to do that and not only to re-up our business but also to move up the availability date of those shows to just 8 days after their last episode airs versus having to wait until just before the new season launches. So the fans of the CW programming are going to love that development. Then as far as the PBS, Amazon, I would say we have so aggressively improved and expanded our original kids programming. In fact, we have 35 different original kids programming -- kids shows on Netflix now, many more in production and various forms of development. So more and more of that programming is leaning to our exclusive global programming and our original programming in place of massive loads of content from other sources. So our appetite for that, meaning our appetite for high prices, has gone down quite a bit. And what else did I miss there? The CBS deal: Star Trek. So Star Trek's an example of one that seems like an oddball because we don't have it in the U.S. But this is one of those overhangs of regional licensing, is that CBS was not making the U.S. available, and we wanted to make sure that we could bring that show to our -- to the rest of our subscribers around the world. So we're happy to premiere the new Star Trek series all over the world outside of North America."

So I would say that it's way too early. We've been very successful with sort of an 80-20 model today in very, very disparate non-English markets in Chile, in Finland, in The Netherlands. And so we do have markets, early markets like Japan that are tilted a little bit more towards local content, but I don't think the margin characteristics are going to be necessarily determined by the percent of local as how competitive the market is."

But I want to give some level room for the scale of the business. If we're successful and if we grow faster than we expect, then we could expand our content even more than what we consider we would do today. So there's [ph] a little bit of matching that to the scale growth of that business. How successful we are, how big the business we are growing internationally. And I would say in terms of the commitment number, that number is up to 14 2 [ph] from the 13s [ph] before. And that has a lot to do with the expansion of our originals, our licensed originals and our international. So we launched the Rest of the World in January this year. We continue to add content to all of our international markets as well, so we're seeing that grow. I would expect that to somewhat moderate in the 18- to 24-month period as we go forward. We don't have another international launch to layer on to that. But we are expanding the business so you got 2 forces there that sort of counteracting each other. But in terms of our -- go ahead."

It's just a matter of understanding the production and the local tastes and who's working and making great films in those markets in some cases and are anxious to make the migration to television that they've been seeing happening in the U.S. So it's difficult in terms of not being on the ground they're usually. But I think we're making trade-offs in terms of the company culture to travel our folks into territory, get to know the folks in the markets, work with the best and brightest filmmakers and television creators, and bring their shows to the global markets through Netflix. And in terms of localizing for taste. In many parts of the world, U.S. content or English-speaking content localize in the local languages have been incredibly successful. In some cases where tastes run much more local like Japan, like India. We're certain that will take more of a local approach in terms of licensing and producing more local language content there as well.

Some of that was pent-up demand and we're not going to be able to do that. That's not to say that many of our other markets are growing in terms of growth. It's just right now, in terms of what we see that large launch is going to overwhelm some of the growth in the other markets. So we still like what we're seeing in those markets.

I wouldn't hook into the micro variables about this churn or that churn or this show. It's much more of a deep force that's changing the market as more and more people are getting used to Internet television."

But I think we're making trade-offs in terms of the company culture to travel our folks into territory, get to know the folks in the markets, work with the best and brightest filmmakers and television creators, and bring their shows to the global markets through Netflix. And in terms of localizing for taste. In many parts of the world, U.S. content or English-speaking content localize in the local languages have been incredibly successful. In some places where taste run much more local like Japan, like India, we certainly will take more of a local approach in terms of licensing and producing more local language content there as well.

If we're successful and if we grow faster than we expect, then we could expand our content even more than what we consider we would do today. So there's a little bit of matching that to the scale growth of that business. How successful we are, how big the business we are growing internationally. And I would say in terms of the commitment number, that number is up to 14 2 from the 13s before. And that has a lot to do with the expansion of our originals, our licensed originals and our international. So we launched the Rest of World in January this year. We continue to add content to all of our international markets as well, so you're seeing that grow. I would expect that to somewhat moderate in the 18- to 24-month period as we go forward.

But I think we're making trade-offs in terms of the company culture to travel our folks into territory, get to know the folks in the markets, work with the best and brightest filmmakers and television creators, and bring their shows to the global markets through Netflix. And in terms of localizing for taste. In many parts of the world, U.S. content or English-speaking content localized into the local languages have been incredibly successful. In some places where taste run much more local like Japan, like India, we certainly will take more of a local approach in terms of licensing and producing more local language content there as well.

Some of that was pent-up demand, and we're not going to be able to do that. That's not saying that we're -- many of our other markets are growing in terms of the growth. It's just right now, in terms of what we see that large launch is not going to -- is going to overwhelm some of the growth in the other markets. So we still like what we're seeing in these markets. We're growing year-on-year in some. Some are moderate. We've had very different -- a wide variety of results across markets. We've had markets that slowdown and then accelerate in growth.

It's starting to fade, and we expect that to continue to fade, but we do think there's opportunity to improve that going forward in terms of next year."

And the same thing is true with linear TV. It's been an amazing innovation, but the age of linear is starting to fade, and it's going to be replaced by Internet. And those firms like the BBC or CBS, that's doing all access that invest heavily, I think will move into the future on Internet consumption. And I think you'll see Internet growth generally more broadband kind of fiber optic to every village in town. Those general trend lines, the growth both of YouTube-type advertising supported services, Facebook video, Snapchat. So you're just going to see these new scenarios everywhere. And eventually, movies and TV shows will be global, ubiquitous, some amazing budgets. So I think you have to think big about the future. We're closing in on 100 million members. But I'll remind everyone at Netflix that Facebook and YouTube have 1 billion daily actives. And so in many parts, we are just so small compared to those other Internet video firms. And we have a lot of catch-up to do and that's again investing in our content and making it globally interesting and compelling which we're working on. So there's a lot out there. But we only just have to take it year by year, and it's tremendous fun inventing the future. Thank you."

If we're successful and if we grow faster than we expect, then we could expand our content even more than what we consider we would do today.

And I would say in terms of the commitment number, that number is up to 14 2 from the 13s before. And that has a lot to do with the expansion of our originals, our licensed originals and our international. So we launched the Rest of World in January this year.

And the other is the much, much more flexibility in terms of the rights that we have and the rights -- and how we exploit and how we continue to maintain exclusivity, where we're not seeing the content against our wishes going to other markets in the syndication, in DVD and others. And we're able to produce it at a very high-quality and also much more efficiently. So to the extent that we can do that, while it does -- it require more cash upfront to fund the development process versus a studio who would take that on, we find it's a great trade-off for cash."

Club de Cuervos, our first Mexican original, was quite successful and we're getting ready to bring out the second season. Marseille for our French customers, not only successful in France but successful throughout Europe and got a significant amount of watching in the United States subtitled and dubbed in English. And so we're continuing to push. It's not degrees of difficulties. It's just a matter of understanding the production community and the local taste and who's working and making great films in those markets in some cases and are anxious to make the migration to television that they've been seeing happening in the U.S. And so it's difficult in terms of not being on the ground there usually. But I think we're making trade-offs in terms of the company culture to travel our folks into territory, get to know the folks in the markets, work with the best and brightest filmmakers and television creators, and bring their shows to the global markets through Netflix. And in terms of localizing for taste. In many parts of the world, U.S. content or English-speaking content localized into the local languages have been incredibly successful. In some places where taste run much more local like Japan, like India, we certainly will take more of a local approach in terms of licensing and producing more local language content there as well. But I think over time that the tastes will fall into line with the kind of desire to see the big spectacular shows that people are talking about around the world no matter where you are."

What I was trying to call out without actually providing our Q1 guidance until January was back in January of this year, which I tried to moderate the estimates or the expectations coming out of our global launch, we had a very successful launch. In Q1, we had a lot of demand associated with that launch that started moderating into Q2. And I think people saw the success of Q1, and really raised their numbers in Q2, and I'm trying to get a little bit ahead of that in the sense that we had a very successful launch in Q1 of this year that is going to be very difficult to replicate. Some of that was pent-up demand, and we're not going to be able to do that. That's not saying that we're -- many of our other markets are growing in terms of the growth. It's just right now, in terms of what we see that large launch is not going to -- is going to overwhelm some of the growth in the other markets. So we still like what we're seeing in these markets. We're growing year-on-year in some. Some are moderate. We've had very different -- a wide variety of results across markets. We've had markets that slowdown and then accelerate in growth. And so if you abstract back, I think, the general trend is the world is embracing Internet television, and we're riding on a very strong kind of tailwind of technological change. And that is definitely intact."
