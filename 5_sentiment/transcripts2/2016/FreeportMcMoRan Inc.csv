Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call. 
In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release today and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements. and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. 
On the call today, are Richard Ackerson, the employees [indiscernible] Mark Johnson's here as well, as well as several other senior members of our team. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be focusing today's discussion on how we are positioned in our operation and addressing our balance sheet in the current marketing environment. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. 
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.1 billion, $3.47 per share for the fourth quarter 2015. As indicated in the press release where we have a reconciliation of the net loss included charges totaling $4.1 billion or $3.45 per share, primarily for the reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these net charges, the fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $21 million or $0.02 per share. 
Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, our EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $919 million. We have a reconciliation of that in our broad materials for your reference. The consolidated copper sales totaled 1.15 billion pounds in the fourth quarter. Our gold sales totaled 338,000 ounces. We sold 20 million pounds of molybdenum and 13.2 million barrels of oil equivalent during the quarter. Our average realized copper price was 2 18 per pound, that was below last years 2014 fourth quarter average of 2.95 per pound. 
Gold prices averaged $1,067 per ounce in the fourth quarter of '15 and our realized price for crude oil was 48.88 per barrel, which included $11 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. We generated operating cash flows during the fourth quarter of $612 million and funded capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion during the quarter. We ended the year with $20.4 billion in debt and cash -- consolidated cash was $224 million. 
As indicated in the release, since August of 2015, a total of 2-point -- $2 billion of gross proceeds have been raised under FCX aftermarket equity program, including approximately $1 billion during fourth quarter of 2015. And we ended the year with approximately 1.25 billion common shares outstanding and had no amounts drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility. 
I'll turn the call over to Richard who will be using the slide materials that are on our website."

This is going to be a different call than we have been done in the past for obvious reasons. We face serious challenges because of what's going on in the marketplace and because of the situation with our balance sheet, and we want",558,"Good morning, everyone. This is going to be a different call than we have been done in the past for obvious reasons. We face serious challenges because of what's going on in the marketplace and because of the situation with our balance sheet, and we want to convey that we're addressing this seriously and with a degree of urgency and we're very focused on it. 
Now let's think about what's changed for us since our last earnings call. On Slide 3, we show the obvious, the drop in copper price is the drop in oil prices. And as we talked about it at the end of the third quarter, we were looking at various scenarios that range from further decline in prices at that time to other more positive scenarios. We're experiencing the worst of those scenarios right now with copper dropping to $2 and oil dropping to $30. 
And we're also facing a market of where market settlement continues to be negative, particularly negative about China and we have to prepare for that. So the issue is, what are we doing? What is Freeport going to do about this right now? And I want to convey to you what we are doing. And turn to Slide 4. We're aggressively managing costs, CapEx, production, cash flow and working for capital raising transactions to address our balance sheet. 
At the third quarter earnings release, we talked about how we restructured our Board of Directors. We have gone from 16 previous members to 7. We added 2 representatives of Carl Icon, a significant shareholders of ours now. I can tell you, we have a board that's fully engaged and fully supportive of what we need to do and very active and we're listening to the input of our board members and reviewing our plans as we go forward. 
At that time, we have also revised our management structure from the previous office of the Chairman to go to a different structure, and that structure was further changed in December with Jim Bob stepping down as Executive Chairman of our company. Jerry Ford, our lead director, has been elected as a nonexecutive Chairman. And I now have, effective January 1, executive responsibility for our global business, including our oil and gas business and our business in Indonesia. 
Jim Bob continues to work as an adviser and is working very helpfully in dealing with our ongoing discussions with the government of Indonesia. But we have a clear strategic direction of our company now. And that strategic direction is to create shareholder value out of our copper and minerals business as we go forward. We're going to be looking at our oil and gas assets as a way to generate value to help support that strategy and we're going to be focused immediately on addressing our balance sheet issues. 
And the one thing I believe as has been lost in the noise of the turmoil in the commodities market business, the issues relating to our over leverage as a result of the oil and gas transaction in 2013, the concerns about credit generally for natural resource companies, is the fact that we have a very profitable mining business underlying all this. It's going to give us the way forward for the future. We had over $19 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter..."

We've made significant reductions in our capital spending. We're continuing to review that. We've adjusted mine plans to improve cash flows.

We're continuing to review that. We've adjusted mine plans to improve cash flows. We've deferred our oil and gas drilling activities to conserve cash. We're engaged in strategic review of those assets and we're looking at alternatives, including sales of the business, sales of assets and how we might manage it going forward because of the market condition we're in. 
You'll see that we have reduced our copper and oil unit cost of production significantly. We've also and want to comment about the success we've had with the Cerro Verde project. Project we wouldn't start today with these market conditions. But that's the nature of mining assets. We actually began the work of this expansion of Cerro Verde in 2010, $4.6 billion project that we brought in, but without having a significant cost overrun, the world's largest concentrator facilities and a mine anywhere in the world. And it's come up without significant -- without cost overrun at all in a very vision effective way. And it'll be a great long-term asset for our company going forward. 
We've taken steps to protect our balance sheet by suspending our dividend. We raised equity proceeds through ATM initiatives that have generated $2 billion of equity for us. Now we're going to talk about further steps. As we look at restoring our balance sheet to reflect current market conditions, we're going to focus and manage our cost and capital and continue to generate cash flow in a safe way. We're going to take immediate steps to reduce debt, to enhance shareholder value. 
We are in active discussions with a number of parties of alternatives on our asset sales. Besides the review of the oil and gas business, we are looking at transaction involving a wide range of our copper assets that involve alternatives. But we have interested parties. We have great assets that could lead to sales or joint venture arrangements that will be important steps of our dealing with our balance sheet. 
I mentioned in the oil and gas business, we're engaged in a review for that. Our board has, Lazard as the board's financial advisory on that working together with our traditional banker, JPMorgan. We're canvassing the market to understand what the current market value is in an obviously, tough market. And we are engaged with interested parties now who are being provided recent access to our year-end updates of our oil and gas reserve information and our various plan. We expect all of these to achieve progress that we'll be reporting to you as it occurs during the first half of 2016. 
Look at Slide 6 to show what we've done with capital. The capitol we spent in 2015, which reflected the Cerro Verde project's completion, of a project that as I said has started a number of years ago, but that is now completed. The oil and gas capital spending reflected plans and commitments for a drilling rig equipment and other support facilities that were structured during the time we were planning on investing for growth of that business and we're making adjustments that reduce capital spending for 2016 to $3.4 billion and our plans for 2017 show capital dropping to $2.3 billion. 
The $1.5 billion for oil and gas reflects a couple of factors that we'll be carrying over in the early part of the year. We had some cash cost to pay for costs that were actually incurred last year. We are restructuring our drilling rig contracts. We are undertaking a plan to idle all 3 of the deepwater rigs. And so we will be seeing that spending dropping off markedly after midyear of this year. And you can see that by 2017, the CapEx will be down to $600 million. That includes -- that excludes idle rig costs that we will be incurring for the commitments that we have under these contracts, which we are negotiating how to arrange those with the drilling rig contractors. But included in those -- excluded from the CapEx plans are $600 million of idle rig costs in 2016 and $400 million in 2017, these are going to be reflected as expenses in our income statement rather than as capital spending. 
So major reductions, continued focus on how to continue to restrain capital. We've adjusted our mine plans. We look at each one of our mines. We talked about this earlier, but we evaluate each of our mines with looking at a $2 copper price and considering sustaining capital. And we have made adjustments that aggregate roughly 350 million pounds, about 9% of our 2015 sales by adjusting production at 4 of our mines. We have stress tested our current operating plans at copper prices below $2 and developed contingency actions to take if the market weakens further and we will be monitoring that on a day by day basis. Tim is doing a great job to do that. 
The facts are that we have such an attractive cost structure that we will generate cash flows -- free cash flows out of our mining business even at much lower prices than $2. When we've taken these actions to preserve our very valuable, significant long-term resources while reducing near-term supply and generating cash flows. 
To show the results of these actions as it reflected on our unit cost. We look at Slide 8, you can see in the charts that in 2015, our consolidated site production and delivery costs is a 4 [ph] byproduct credits was $1.78. With our new plans, we are reducing our outlook for that for next year by 25% to $1.34. And when you take into account byproduct credits for golden Grasberg molybdenum in several of our mines cobalt in Africa, you get down to a unit net cash cost even at these low commodity priced levels for byproducts of $1.10 consolidated for our company going forward. 
We're doing this through aggressive cost and equipment fleet management in addition to curtailing high cost of production. We get the benefits of scale at Cerro Verde. We have Grasberg's ore grades improving beginning in the second half of this year as we execute our plan to complete mining in the open pit by the end of 2017, managing working capital, taking advantage of low input costs. Our oil and gas cash production costs are being reduced by nearly 20%. And that reflects the fact that we're having increasing volumes from our past drilling work in the Gulf of Mexico where our unit costs are lower than in California
[Audio Gap]
And also work that our oil and gas team is doing to take advantage of lower cost from contractors and being more efficient in general. More on our mining unit net costs presented on Page 9. You can see this by region where in the Americas, our -- before capital expenditure of cost levels is about $1.50 per pound. And in Indonesia where costs are lower, reflecting the higher grade volumes that we have coming to us through our mine plan, the average $1.10. And then after showing capital expenditures for sustaining capital, you can see that it averages $1.30 to mining of the open pit in 2017. 
So much talk about copper market commentary that I'm just going to make a couple of comments about it. And questionably, the uncertainty about the global economy is negatively impacting financial market sentiment, accounting demand
[Audio Gap]
The slowing western demand is not as good as we and others had hoped it would be. But it's still expanding gradually. I'm not going to debate anyone about the market. The market is what the market is. But the facts are that in the copper business, differs from other commodities in the
[Audio Gap]
It's not an enormous excess supply in inventories. What we just show here, the exchange stocks that has developed from the end of 2014 to the current date. Similar story when you look at total global inventories, but here, we have exchange stocks not rising significantly, remaining low by historical standards, that the time when the copper price has gone from $2.88 to $2 from the end of '14 to the current date. It is -- even looking at the decline [ph] particular insight as to what's going to happen in China in the future, we have to prepare ourselves for what the market is. And the market is we got $2 copper and we got to react to it. 
To date, industry-wide, there've been reduction in high-cost mines with McKinsey says 730,000 tons a year. There will be other cuts if prices stay at this level. The supply from new mines like Cerro Verde, like Morenci that began construction years ago are coming to an end now. The current level of balance in the marketplace is not yielding a surplus as high as people had predicted. And all the time, low-grade -- lower grade mines -- lower grade ores are coming from existing mines. Mines are depleting. Mines are moving underground. All these things are -- will lead to an ultimate price recovery in my view, absent just a collapse in the world economy because today's price is not honed up to incentivize any future developments. 
So we have enormous resources. We're not going to be spending any money on developing those resources until the market improves. And if we were to start today, if the price of copper would have magically jumped to $4 a pound, it would be on the order 10 years before new production come out of our resources. So we remain confident about the long-term copper markets in dealing with the reality of today's low prices. 
Now looking at just how good our copper business is. We talked about 2015 being a bridge year. Well, we crossed the bridge and now we're looking at a big uphill climb because of the current price. But even at current prices, our mining business at $2 yields $4.2 billion of EBITDA. And you can see that steps up if we were to have higher prices and our CapEx and our mining business is $1.9 billion. So we have a company -- we have a business that earns profits at low, low, low prices. We cut back capital and we have that providing support for what we're doing. 
We have a great set of assets. We have a great set of assets and we have 5 mines that have the potential of producing 1 billion pounds of copper per year, 3 of them are already doing that. The Morenci, Cerro Verde Grasberg mines, Tenke Fungurume has great growth opportunities as does our El Abra mine in Chile. So we have a very attractive, long-term set of assets to deal with. Quality assets, which gives us the opportunities to deal with the financing issues we face with our balance sheet. Very large reserves that I'm sure most of you know about it. 
We've got 100 billion pounds of copper at $2 mine plans, adding in another like amount of mineralized material that's already been identified. As I said, that's there for our company for the long run. We're not going to be developing new projects until the market improves. Grasberg is a great asset. It is a very special asset with a high-grade ore and copper, and gold combined. And we have been working with the government of Indonesia in a challenging political environment in that country. 
We have a commitment from the government that was reflected in communication we received on October 7, from the Ministry of Energy and Mines about our proposal to extend the primary term of our contract, which the primary term of our 1991 contract goes to 2021. It gives us the rights to 2 10-year extensions to 2041. We've been working with the government and received the positive letter from the Minister, saying the government will grant the approval for the contract and will preserve our rights to -- in the same level of legal and fiscal certainty in the existing contract. 
We have recent reaffirmation of that commitment from senior government officials. The process going forward has been complicated by recent political developments in the country, including the investigations related to the taped conversation with the former speaker of the Indonesian Parliament and the reviews by Parliament of that, and the investigation with it. But we remain confident and have support from senior government officials that their policy about extending our contract remains in place. The issue is when that happens and how the government deals with existing regulations for extending contracts. 
In consistent with our agreement with the government -- with the government's agreement to extend our contract and that we are advancing plans for the development of new smelting capacity with the government and with divesting interest in our ownership of PT-FI, we committed recently a valuation in response to the government's, asking for that, our valuation of PT-FI and reflected a valuation of approximately $16 billion, which reflects standard market ways of looking at values of mining assets and we've agreed to offer overtime, 20.64% interest of PT-FI to Indonesian ownership whether that's through the government state-owned companies or listing on the stock exchange or sales to other Indonesian interests at fair market value. 
We've had ongoing discussions with the government on renewing our export license. Members, certain officials within the Ministry of Energy and Mines have suggested that we should continue to pay an export duty, that we should make a sizable escrow deposit to support the smelter development. These points are inconsistent with the arrangements that we had worked with the government on, beginning mid-2014. And our discussions with the government continue. 
I'm here today to tell you that we have full confidence that the government will come up with a favorable decision and issue the export license to ensure that continuity of our mining operation, and in doing so, will serve the interest of Indonesia's mining industry in general. So that's the status we have not, to date, given that export license but we have confidence that we will.
Now turning to our oil and gas business. I want to reiterate things we talked about in the past. These are very good assets. They have valuable infrastructure and associated resources. We've had successful drilling activities since their acquisition by Freeport in mid-2013, and this successful drilling has derisked the opportunities around the underutilized production facilities that we acquired in the transaction. 
We drill 14 wells with positive results, 4 wells have been brought on production and even though we are deferring drilling for the foreseeable future because of market conditions, the success we've had in the past drilling will allow us to connect certain of these discussion -- discoveries in a way that our near-term production volumes will actually be increasing because of past drilling successes. 
Major property that we have an interest in, Heidelberg operated by Anadarko, produced its first oil this month and it will be ramping up as we go into 2016. We will also expect to place 6 additional wells of production from our own drilling in 2016. This will result, as I mentioned earlier, a reduction in our cash production costs through a consolidated of approximately $15 a barrel. But that reflects $10 a barrel in the Gulf of Mexico. We are deferring for the foreseeable future our exploration development activities, as I said, all 3 of our deepwater rigs are being idle, 1 -- 2 are already idle and 1 is completing in the imminent future, immediate future completion activities that it is currently working on. 
But the business has very long-term production and development potential that'll be there for the ultimate recovery in oil prices. There's a big inventory of drilling locations that will be available to create incremental value over the long period of time. And that comes about because of our focus area in the deepwater where we have 3 major, underutilized platforms: Marlin, Holstein and Horn Mountain where our recent tieback drilling has been done and where we've identified significant incremental drilling opportunities. 
We have interest in the Lucius Heidelberg Fields of nonoperated bases and interest in the Vito area that adds significant long-term development potential. On Slide 18, we show what the EBITDA for this business would be generating and what the CapEx would be, excluding the idled rig cost. You can see that this business is very highly leveraged of course, to the price of oil and can generate substantial free cash flows in an environment -- depending on the price of oil. 
We are planning our business not with an expectation that price increases will incur, but preserving values for an eventual recovery in prices. We're taking a very hard look at G&A costs as we go forward with this oil and gas review process. We've been working with Jim and his team in Houston. We're targeting a near-term 30% reduction in G&A costs. And then as we complete the oil and gas review process, we will assess the structure of our business. 
At that time, if in fact, we don't sell the entire business and then we will organize the business to fit with what comes out of the oil and gas review process. Throughout our organization and with our team in Houston, I'm encouraged by the very positive and cooperative approach that all of our team is dealing with to deal with this price environment. 
Jim, do you have anything you'd like to comment on?"

Looking at our debt levels. This is the focus of what we have to deal with and we have to deal with it in today's marketplace. We have total debt at the end of December of just over $20 billion. We have adequate liquidity as we go forward. We have limited -- very limited amounts, $200 million of debt maturing in 2016. We have no funds drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility, and I'm sure you all have followed the rating actions taken on our company and have also followed the rating agencies public comment about their broadly based reviews of credits in the metals, mining and energy sector. 
We have worked with agents -- agencies over the years to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our balance sheet and we'll continue to do so. In light of the recent ratings actions and the settlements by the rating agencies, we are -- we have prepared contingency plans to address our financial insurance obligations for our mining properties on a scenario where we're not investment-grade rated. We have dealt plans that would allow us to address these in a fashion that would either not require or minimize letters of credit under our bank credit facilities and we have a number of alternatives for doing that. 
So we're working to come up with plans to reduce debt. To get our balance sheet stronger and improve our financial flexibility and protect our liquidity in the short run. So we are -- start out, telling you we're serious and we are serious and focused to take advantage of our large-scale current production base of resources.

Our mining business, we've shown to generate free cash flows at very low prices and we're taking prudent management steps and will continue to do so to respond to these market conditions. We are going to address our asset -- our balance sheet debt levels through asset sales, other initiatives to raise capital. And we have the assets to do that. And throughout all this, throughout all this, we're going to have a positive outlook for our company, based on the long-term global demand of supply fundamentals by the commodities that we produce and for our -- given our high-quality asset base.

So you drop those development activity, and that's before any CapEx. And then I'll just stick on the LOE basis, you continue your cost, you manage your chemicals, you manage your trucking, you manage your employee levels and compensation and so forth to where to make sure that the oilfield continues to produce at least breakeven, than lose money producing oil at this point in time.

In our area where we employ over 30,000 workers, we represent in the province we work in, over 90% of their economy. The taxes, employment, the exports that we generate for the country of Indonesia is important to the country as a whole. Like all countries around the world and all developing countries in Asia, Indonesia is being challenged by the downturn in China and the global economy. And so we're important to them as they are important to us. And in Indonesia today, is a true democracy where there's a freedom of the press and political figures are free to comment on it. That's a good thing. And some of the comments reflect, as we see around the world into a significant degree here in the United States, that feeling of nationalism. Witness comments about free trade here in the United States. And so what you're reading is the functioning of a democratic system where people have views about nationalism. Underlying that is a company that's been a long-term investor in Indonesia that has plans to make significant investments in developing the underground resources that we have there that's -- provides employment and economic benefits to a province that's been very much of need of developments, there's Papua, it's a country that is in need of this. So we have a mutual need for each other.

1980's [ph]. This is the most recent, significant extension to it. It's very high-grade for copper and gold, a very long life. That mine has come up to speed very efficiently. We are progressing with our underground development for the Grasberg underground ore through the block cave mine plans that we have. We're stockpiling ore to produce beyond 2017. This is where we are currently with our plans, as what you see -- as you say in the slide deck. And Mark Johnson and his team, with our team at job sites, working every day to see how we can minimize the impact of that transition. But it is a reality that there will be a transition because we can't begin mining the Grasberg underground ore body until we complete mining the pit because the pit subsides and the ground falls in on the cave, so you specifically can't do it. And yet we're taking every step we can to mitigate that increase. That was one of our developments for developing Cerro Verde, that was one of our reasons for developing Tenke and Morenci, was to drive volumes for us during that time period when we were making the transition from Grasberg. So what you see today is the best estimate from where we are. We're going to work to do our best to improve that. We have success in the past of doing that. We have a great team working on it, and that's what we're working on. We're very confident technically about our ability to do it.

And I think the rest of the mining industry would agree with it, that 30,000 feet in the middle of Papua where it rains absolutely El Nino, 200 to 400 inches a year where we mine the pit, we mine the underground. I mean, we can do this. And so technically, we're very comfortable and we're confident about working in Indonesia where we've been for, for over 40 years. It's complicated, I'm not going to underestimate the complications. But we got a team here that can handle it."

That generates substantial cash, which is something we need. But if this market deteriorates, if the worst predictions for China are true in terms of its economy shrinking and its just demand for copper strengths, and we have assets that will further adjust to that.

As you point out, it's a difficult marketplace. And yet, I was listening to comments coming out of Davos and out of the financial community, this lower oil price is ultimately going to have an impact on the level of oil that's being produced globally, it's putting pressure on producers here in the United States, but also producers in countries around the world. So ultimately, low prices will have an impact on supplies and there are people out there who are making comments about how attractive it is to invest in natural resources at this point in the marketplace. So we're going to find out what the interest are, and it's a wide range of activities. We're not going to do anything dumb with these assets because we know what their values are and what their leverage to prices are.

We can't just get out of -- we can't just not pay them because we want to. Now what we're doing is minimizing the costs given our contractual obligations. We're doing that one, by idling the rigs, which involves these spread costs that incur when rigs are operating. And two, we're entering into negotiations with the contractor companies to mitigate the near-term cash obligations that we have in ways that we can mutually agree to that's in the benefit of both companies.

In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call. And a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release today and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today, are Richard Adkerson; the employees, Red Conger is here; Mark Johnson's here as well, as well as several other senior members of our team. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be focusing today's discussion on how we are positioned in our operations and addressing our balance sheet in the current market environment. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.1 billion, $3.47 per share for the fourth quarter 2015. As indicated in the press release where we have a reconciliation of the net loss included charges totaling $4.1 billion or $3.45 per share, primarily for the reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these net charges, the fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $21 million or $0.02 per share.
Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter totaled $919 million. We have a reconciliation of that in our broad materials for your reference. The consolidated copper sales totaled 1.15 billion pounds in the fourth quarter. Our gold sales totaled 338,000 ounces. We sold 20 million pounds of molybdenum and 13.2 million barrels of oil equivalent during the quarter. Our average realized copper price was $2.18 per pound, that was below last year's 2014 fourth quarter average of $2.95 per pound.
Gold prices averaged $1,067 per ounce in the fourth quarter of '15 and our realized price for crude oil was $48.88 per barrel, which included $11 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. We generated operating cash flows during the fourth quarter of $612 million and funded capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion during the quarter. We ended the year with $20.4 billion in debt and cash -- consolidated cash was $224 million.
As indicated in the release, since August of 2015, a total of 2-point -- $2 billion of gross proceeds have been raised under FCX's aftermarket equity program, including approximately $1 billion during fourth quarter of 2015. And we ended the year with approximately 1.25 billion common shares outstanding and had no amounts drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility.
I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be using the slide materials that are on our website."

This is going to be a different call than we have been done in the past for obvious reasons. We face serious challenges because of what's going on in the marketplace and because of the situation with our balance sheet. And we want to convey that we're addressing this seriously and with a degree of urgency, and we're very focused on it.
Now let's think about what's changed for us since our last earnings call. On Slide 3, we show the obvious, the drop in copper prices, the drop in oil prices. And as we talked about it at the end of the third quarter, we were looking at various scenarios that range from further decline in prices at that time to other more positive scenarios. We're experiencing the worst of those scenarios right now with copper dropping to $2 and oil dropping to $30.
And we're also facing a market of where market settlement continues to be negative, particularly negative about China, and we have to prepare for that. So the issue is, what are we doing? What's Freeport going to do about this right now? And I want to convey to you what we are doing.
And turn to Slide 4. We're aggressively managing cost, CapEx, production, cash flow and working for capital raising transactions to address our balance sheet.
At the third quarter earning release, we talked about how we had restructured our Board of Directors. We had gone from 16 previous members to 7. We added 2 representatives of Carl Icahn, a significant shareholders of ours now. I can tell you, we have a board that's fully engaged and fully supportive of what we need to do and very active, and we're listening to the input of our board members and reviewing our plans as we go forward.
At that time, we had also revised our management structure from the previous office of the Chairman to go to a different structure and that structure was further changed at the -- in December with Jim Bob stepping down as Executive Chairman of our company. Jerry Ford, our lead director, has been elected as a Nonexecutive Chairman. And I now have, effective January 1, executive responsibility for our global business, including our oil and gas business and our business in Indonesia.
Jim Bob continues to work as an adviser and is working very helpfully in dealing with our ongoing discussions with the government of Indonesia. But we have a clear strategic direction of our company now. And that strategic direction is to create shareholder value out of our copper and minerals business as we go forward. We're going to be looking at our oil and gas assets as a way to generate value to help support that strategy, and we're going to be focused immediately on addressing our balance sheet issues.
And one thing I believe has this been lost in the noise of the turmoil in the commodities market business, the issues relating to our over leverage as a result of the oil and gas transaction in 2013, the concerns about credit generally for natural resource companies, is the fact that we have a very profitable mining business underlying all this. It's going to give us the way forward for the future. We had over $19 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter..."

We're continuing to review that. We've adjusted mine plans to improve cash flows. We've deferred our oil and gas drilling activities to conserve cash. We're engaged in strategic review of those assets. And we're looking at alternatives, including sales of the business, sales of assets and how we might manage it going forward because of the market condition we're in.
You'll see that we've reduced our copper and oil unit cost production significantly. We've also and want to comment about the success we've had with the Cerro Verde project. Project, we wouldn't start today in these market conditions. But that's the nature of mining assets. We actually began the work on this expansion of Cerro Verde in 2010, $4.6 billion project that we brought in, but without having a significant cost overrun, the world's largest concentrator facilities at a mine anywhere in the world. And it's come up without significant -- without cost overrun at all in a very vision [ph] effective way. And it'll be a great long-term asset for our company going forward.
We've taken steps to protect our balance sheet by suspending our dividend. We raised equity proceeds through 2 ATM initiatives that have generated $2 billion of equity for us. Now we're going to talk about further steps. As we look at restoring our balance sheet to reflect current market conditions, we're going to focus and manage our cost and capital and continue to generate cash flow in a safe way. We're going to take immediate steps to reduce debt, to enhance shareholder value.
We are in active discussions with a number of parties on alternatives for asset sales. Besides the review of the oil and gas business, we are looking at transaction involving a wide range of our copper assets that involve alternatives. But we have interested parties. We have great assets that could lead to sales or joint venture arrangements that will be important steps of our dealing with our balance sheet.
I mentioned in the oil and gas business, we're engaged in a review for that. Our board has hired Lazard as the board's financial advisory on that, working together with our traditional banker, JPMorgan. We're canvassing the market to understand what the current market value is in an obviously tough market. And we are engaged with interested parties now who are being provided recent access to our year-end updates of our oil and gas reserve information and our various plans. We expect all of these to achieve progress that we'll be reporting to you as it occurs during the first half of 2016.
Look at Slide 6 to show what we've done with capital. The capitol we spent in 2015, which reflected the Cerro Verde project's completion, of a project, as I said, has started a number of years ago, but that is now completed. The oil and gas capital spending reflected plans and commitments for a drilling rig equipment and other support facilities that were structured during the time when we were planning on investing for growth of that business. And we're making adjustments that reduce capital spending for 2016 to $3.4 billion and our plans for 2017 show capital dropping to $2.3 billion.
The $1.5 billion for oil and gas reflects a couple of factors that will be carrying over in the early part of the year. We had some cash cost to pay for cost that we're actually incurred last year. We are restructuring our drilling rig contracts. We are undertaking a plan to idle all 3 of the deepwater rigs. And so we will be seeing that spending dropping off markedly after midyear of this year. And you can see that by 2017, the CapEx will be down to $600 million. That includes -- that excludes idle rig cost that we will be incurring for the commitments we have under these contracts, which we are negotiating how to arrange those with the drilling rig contractors, but included in those -- excluded from the CapEx plans or $600 million of idle rig cost in 2016 and $400 million in 2017. These are going to be reflected as expenses in our balance -- in our income statement rather than as capital spending.
So major reductions, continued focus on how to continue to restrain capital. We've adjusted our mine plans. We look at each one of our mines. We talked about this earlier, but we evaluate each of our mines with looking at a $2 copper price and considering sustaining capital. And we have made adjustments that aggregate roughly 350 million pounds, about 9% of our 2015 sales by adjusting production at 4 of our mines. We have stress tested our current operating plans at copper prices below $2 and developed contingency actions to take if the market weakens further. And we will be monitoring that on a day by day basis. Team is doing a great job to do that.
The facts are that we have such an attractive cost structure that we will generate cash flows -- free cash flows out of our mining business even at much lower prices than $2, when we've taken these actions to preserve our very valuable, significant long-term resources while reducing near-term supply and generating cash flow.
To show the results of these actions as it reflected on our unit cost. We look at Slide 8. You can see in the charts that in 2015, our consolidated site production and delivery costs before byproduct credits was $1.78. With our new plans, we are reducing our outlook for that for next year by 25% to $1.34. And when you take into account byproduct credits for gold at Grasberg, molybdenum in several of our mines, cobalt in Africa, you get down to a unit net cash cost even at these low commodity price levels for byproducts of $1.10 consolidated for our company going forward.
We're doing this through aggressive cost and equipment fleet management in addition to curtailing high cost production. We get the benefits of scale at Cerro Verde. We have Grasberg's ore grades improving beginning in the second half of this year, as we execute our plan to complete mining in the open pit by the end of 2017, managing working capital, taking advantage of low input costs. Our oil and gas cash production costs are being reduced by nearly 20%. And that reflects the fact that we're having increasing volumes from our past drilling work in the Gulf of Mexico, where our unit costs are lower than in California and also work that our oil and gas team is doing to take advantage of lower cost from contractors and being more efficient in general. More on our mining net -- unit net costs presented on Page 9. You can see this by region where in the Americas, our -- before capital expenditure cost levels is about $1.50 per pound. And in Indonesia where costs are lower, reflecting the higher grade volumes that we have coming to us through our mine plan, the average $1.10. And then after showing capital expenditures for sustaining capital, you can see that it averages $1.30 to mining of the open pit in 2017.
So much talk about market -- copper market commentary that I'm just going to make a couple of comments about it. And questionably, the uncertainty about the global economy is negatively impacting financial market sentiment. China's demand growth is slowing. Western demand is not as good as we and others had hoped it would be. But it still expanding gradually. I'm not going to debate anyone about the market. The market is what the market is. But the facts are that in the copper business differs from other commodities and that there is not an enormous excess supply in inventories. What we just show here, the exchange stocks that's developed from the end of 2014 to the current date. Similar story when you look at total global inventories, but here we have exchange stocks not rising significantly, remaining low by historical standards at a time when the copper price has gone from $2.88 to $2 from the end of '14 to the current date. It is -- even looking at the decline -- particular insight as to what's going to happen in China in the future, we have to prepare ourselves for what the market is. And the market is we got $2 copper and we got to react to it.
To date, industry-wide, there've been reduction in high-cost mines, what McKinsey says 730,000 tons a year. There will be other cuts if prices stay at this level. The supply from new mines like Cerro Verde, like Morenci that began construction years ago are coming to an end now. The current level of balance in the marketplace is not yielding a surplus as high as people had predicted. And all the time, low-grade -- lower grade mines, lower grade ores are coming from existing mines. Mines are depleting. Mines are moving underground. All these things are -- will lead to an ultimate price recovery in my view, absent just a collapse in the world's economy, because today's price is not honed up to incentivize any future developments.
So we have enormous resources. We're not going to be spending any money on developing those resources until the market improves. And if we were to start today, if the price of copper would have magically jump to $4 a pound, it would be on the order 10 years before new production could come out of our resources. So we remain confident about the long-term copper markets in dealing with reality of today's low prices.
Now looking at just how good our copper business is. We talked about 2015 being a bridge year. Well, we crossed the bridge and now we're looking at a big uphill climb because of the current price. But even at current prices, our mining business at $2 yields $4.2 billion of EBITDA. And you can see that steps up if we were to have higher prices and our CapEx and our mining business is $1.9 billion. So we have a company -- we have a business that earns profits at low, low, low prices. We cut back capital and we have that providing support for what we're doing.
We have a great set of assets. We have a great set of assets and we have 5 mines that have the potential of producing 1 billion pounds of copper per year, 3 of them are already doing that. The Morenci, Cerro Verde, Grasberg mines. Tenke Fungurume has great growth opportunities as does our El Abra mine in Chile. So we have a very attractive, long-term set of assets to deal with. Quality assets, which gives us the opportunities to deal with the financing issues we face with our balance sheet. Very large reserves that I'm sure most of you know about them.
We've got 100 billion pounds of copper at $2 mine plans, adding in another like amount of mineralized material that's already been identified. As I said, that's there for our company for the long run. We're not going to be developing new projects until the market improves. Grasberg is a great asset. It is a very special asset with a high-grade ore and copper and gold combined. And we have been working with the government of Indonesia in a challenging political environment in that country.
We have a commitment from the government that was reflected in communication we received on October 7 from the Ministry of Energy and Mines about our proposal to extend the primary term of our contract, which primary term of our 1991 contract goes to 2021. It gives us the rights to 2 10-year extensions to 2041. We've been working with the government and received the positive letter from the Minister, saying the government will grant the approval for the contract and will preserve our rights to -- in the same level of legal and physical certainty in the existing contract.
We have recent reaffirmation of that commitment from senior government officials. The process going forward has been complicated by recent political developments in the country, including the investigations related to the taped conversation with the former speaker of the Indonesian Parliament and the reviews by Parliament of that, and the investigation with it. But we remain confident and have support from senior government officials that their policy about extending our contract remains in place. The issue is when that happens and how the government deals with its existing regulations for extending contracts.
In consistent with our agreement with the government -- with the government's agreement to extend our contract and that we are advancing plans for the development of new smelting capacity with the government and with divesting interest in our ownership of PT-FI, we committed recently a valuation in response to the government's asking for that, our valuation of PT-FI and reflected it valuation of approximately $16 billion, which reflects standard market ways of looking at values of mining assets. And we've agreed to offer over time 20.64% interest of PT-FI to Indonesian ownership whether that's the government state-owned companies listing on the stock exchange or sales to other Indonesian interest at fair market value.
We've had ongoing discussions with the government on renewing our export license. Members, certain officials within the Ministry of Energy and Mines have suggested that we should continue to pay an export duty, that we should make a sizable escrow deposit to support the smelter development. These points are inconsistent with the arrangements that we had worked with the government on beginning in mid-2014. And our discussions with the government continue.
I'm here today to tell you that we have full confidence that the government will come up with a favorable decision and issue the export license to ensure the continuity of our mining operations. And in doing so, we'll serve the interest of Indonesia's mining industry in general. So that's the status we have not, to date, and given that export license, but we have confidence that we will.
Now turning to our oil and gas business. I want to reiterate things we talked about in the past. These are very good assets. They have valuable infrastructure and associated resources. We've had successful drilling activities since their acquisition by Freeport in mid-2013. And this successful drilling has derisked the opportunities around the underutilized production facilities that we acquired in the transaction.
We drilled 14 wells with positive results. 4 wells have been brought on production. And even though we are deferring drilling for the foreseeable future because of market conditions, the success we've had in the past drilling will allow us to connect certain of these discussion -- discoveries in a way that our near-term production volumes will actually be increasing because of past drilling successes.
Major property that we have an interest in, Heidelberg operated by Anadarko, produced its first oil this month and it will be ramping up as we go into 2016. We will also expect to place 6 additional wells on production from our own drilling in 2016. This will result, as I mentioned earlier, reduction in our cash production costs through a consolidated of approximately $15 a barrel. But that reflects $10 a barrel in the Gulf of Mexico. We are deferring for the foreseeable future our exploration development activities, as I said, all 3 of our deepwater drilling rigs are being idle, 1 -- 2 are already idle and 1 is completing in the imminent future, immediate future completion activities that it is currently working on.
But the business has very long-term production and development potential that will be there for the ultimate recovery in oil prices. There's a big inventory of drilling locations that will be available to create incremental value over the long period of time. And that comes about because of our focus area in the deepwater, where we have 3 major underutilized platforms: Marlin, Holstein and Horn Mountain, where our recent tieback drilling has been done and where we've identified significant incremental drilling opportunities.
We have interest in the Lucius Heidelberg fields of nonoperated bases and interest in the Vito area that adds significant long-term development potential.
On Slide 18, we show what the EBITDA for this business would be generating and what the CapEx would be, excluding the idled rig cost. You can see that this business is very highly leveraged, of course, to the price of oil and can generate substantial free cash flows in an environment -- depending on the price of oil.
We are planning our business, not with an expectation that price increases will occur, but preserving values for an eventual recovery in prices. We're taking a very hard look at G&A costs as we go forward with this oil and gas review process. We've been working with Jim and his team in Houston. We're targeting a near-term 30% reduction in G&A costs. And then as we complete the oil and gas review process, we will assess the structure of our business.
At that time, if, in fact, we don't sell the entire business and then we will organize the business to fit with what comes out of the oil and gas review process. Throughout our organization and with our team in Houston, I'm encouraged by the very positive and cooperative approach that all of our team is dealing with to deal with this price environment.
Jim, do you have anything you'd like to comment on?"

Looking at our debt levels. This is the focus of what we have to deal with and we have to deal with it in today's marketplace. We have total debt at the end of December of just over $20 billion. We have adequate liquidity as we go forward. We have limited -- very limited amounts, $200 million of debt maturing in 2016. We have no funds drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility. I'm sure you all have followed the rating actions taken on our company and have also followed the rating agencies public comment about their broadly-based reviews of credits in the metals, mining and energy sector.
We have worked with agents -- agencies over the years to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our balance sheet, and we'll continue to do so. In light of the recent ratings actions and the sentiments by the rating agencies, we are -- we have prepared contingency plans to address our financial assurance obligations for our mining properties on a scenario where we're not investment-grade rated. We would dealt plans that would allow us to address these in a fashion that would either not require or minimize using letters of credits under our bank credit facilities and we have a number of alternatives for doing that.
So we're working to come up with plans to reduce debt, to get our balance sheet stronger and improve our financial flexibility and protect our liquidity in the short run. So we are -- start out, telling we're serious and we are serious and focused to take advantage of our large-scale current production base of resources. We've established these long-lived reserves that are going to be there for the future of our company. We have significant undeveloped resources that will be available for the future.
I'm very proud and pleased to represent a global organization of such highly-qualified management, workers, people that we work with. They're first-class in every respect. Our mining business, we've shown to generate free cash flows at very low prices and we're taking prudent management steps and will continue to do so to respond to these market conditions. We are going to address our asset -- our balance sheet debt levels through asset sales, other initiatives to raise capital. And we have the assets to do that. And throughout all this, throughout all this, we're going to have a positive outlook for our company. Based on the long-term global demand of supply fundamentals by the commodities that we produce and for our -- and given our high-quality asset base.

We've been through lots of changes about as many changes as you can imagine with a country. And we have successfully managed our way through those changes over 40 years. It's important to us. But please remember, this is important to Indonesia. I mean, where we operate in Papua, which is a challenging political, social economic region of Indonesia that's important to the country, strategically. In our area where we employ over 30,000 workers, we represent in the province we work in, over 90% of their economy. The taxes, employment, the exports that we generate for the country of Indonesia is important to the country as a whole. Like all countries around the world and all developing countries in Asia, Indonesia is being challenged by the downturn in China and the global economy. And so we're important to them as they are important to us. And Indonesia today is a true democracy where there's a freedom of the press and political figures are free to comment on it. That's a good thing. And some of the comments reflect, as we see around the world into a significant degree here in the United States, a feeling of nationalism. Witness comments about free trade here in the United States. And so what you're reading is the functioning of a democratic system where people have views about nationalism. Underlying that is a company that's been a long-term investor in Indonesia that has plans to make significant investments in developing the underground resources that we have there that's -- provides employment and economic benefits to -- a province that's in very much of need of development is Papua, and it's a country that's in need of this. And so we have a mutual need for each other.
[Audio Gap]
1980's [ph]. This is the most recent, significant extension to it. It's very high grades of copper and gold, a very long life. That mine has come up to speed very efficiently. We are progressing with our underground development for the Grasberg underground ore through the block cave mine plans that we have. We're stockpiling ore to produce beyond 2017. This is where we are currently with our plans, as what you see in, as you say, in the slide deck. And Mark Johnson and his team, with our team at job sites, working every day to see how we can minimize the impact of that transition. But it is a reality. It is a reality that there will be a transition because we can't begin mining the Grasberg underground ore body until we complete mining the pit because the pit subsides and the ground falls in on the cave, so you physically can't do it. And yet we're taking every step we can to mitigate that increase. That was one of our reasons for developing Cerro Verde. That was one of our reasons for developing Tenke and Morenci, was to drive volumes for us during that time period when we were making the transition to Grasberg. So what you see today is our best estimate of where we are. We're going to work to do our dead-level best to improve that. We've had success in the past of doing that. We got a great team working on it, and that's what we're working on. We're very confident technically about our ability to do it. I mean this organization has operated the most complex mine in the world, and I feel comfortable in saying that. And I think the rest of the mining industry would agree with it, at 13,000 feet in the middle of Papua where it rains -- El Niño, 200 to 400 inches a year where we mine the pit, we mine the underground. I mean, we can do this. So technically, we're very comfortable and we're confident about working in Indonesia where we've been for over 40 years. It's complicated. I'm not going to underestimate the complications. But we -- you got a team here that can handle it."

Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release today and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today, are Richard Adkerson; the employees: Red Conger is here; Mark Johnson's here as well, as well as several other senior members of our team. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be focusing today's discussion on how we are positioned in our operations and addressing our balance sheet in the current market environment. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.1 billion, $3.47 per share for the fourth quarter 2015. As indicated in the press release, where we have a reconciliation, the net loss included charges totaling $4.1 billion or $3.45 per share, primarily for the reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these net charges, the fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $21 million or $0.02 per share.
Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter totaled $919 million. We have a reconciliation of that in our slide materials for your reference. The consolidated copper sales totaled 1.15 billion pounds in the fourth quarter. Our gold sales totaled 338,000 ounces. We sold 20 million pounds of molybdenum and 13.2 million barrels of oil equivalent during the quarter. Our average realized copper price was $2.18 per pound, that was below last year's 2014 fourth quarter average of $2.95 per pound.
Gold prices averaged $1,067 per ounce in the fourth quarter of '15, and our realized price for crude oil was $48.88 per barrel, which included $11 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. We generated operating cash flows during the fourth quarter of $612 million and funded capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion during the quarter. We ended the year with $20.4 billion in debt and cash -- consolidated cash was $224 million.
As indicated in the release, since August of 2015, a total of 2-point -- $2 billion of gross proceeds have been raised under FCX's aftermarket equity program, including approximately $1 billion during fourth quarter of 2015. And we ended the year with approximately 1.25 billion common shares outstanding, and had no amounts drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility.
I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be using the slide materials that are on our website."

This is going to be a different call than we have been done in the past for obvious reasons. We face serious challenges because of what's going on in the marketplace and because of the situation with our balance sheet. And we want to convey that we're addressing this seriously and with a degree of urgency, and we're very focused on it.
Now let's think about what's changed for us since our last earnings call. On Slide 3, we show the obvious, the drop in copper prices, the drop in oil prices. And as we talked about it at the end of the third quarter, we were looking at various scenarios that ranged from further decline in prices at that time to other more positive scenarios. We're experiencing the worst of those scenarios right now, with copper dropping to $2 and oil dropping to $30.
And we're also facing a market of where market sentiment continues to be negative, particularly negative about China, and we have to prepare for that. So the issue is, what are we doing? What's Freeport going to do about this right now? And I want to convey to you what we are doing.
And turn to Slide 4. We're aggressively managing cost, CapEx, production, cash flow and working for capital raising transactions to address our balance sheet.
At the third quarter earning release, we talked about how we had restructured our Board of Directors. We had gone from 16 previous members to 7. We added 2 representatives of Carl Icahn, a significant shareholder of ours now. I can tell you, we have a board that's fully engaged and fully supportive of what we need to do and very active, and we're listening to the input of our board members and reviewing our plans as we go forward.
At that time, we had also revised our management structure from the previous office of the Chairman to go to a different structure, and that structure was further changed at the -- in December with Jim Bob stepping down as Executive Chairman of our company. Gerry Ford, our lead director, has been elected as a Nonexecutive Chairman. And I now have, effective January 1, executive responsibility for our global business, including our oil and gas business and our business in Indonesia.
Jim Bob continues to work as an adviser and is working very helpfully in dealing with our ongoing discussions with the government of Indonesia. But we have a clear strategic direction of our company now. And that strategic direction is to create shareholder value out of our copper and minerals business as we go forward. We're going to be looking at our oil and gas assets as a way to generate value to help support that strategy, and we're going to be focused immediately on addressing our balance sheet issues.
And one thing I believe has just been lost in the noise of the turmoil in the commodities market business, the issues relating to our over-leverage as a result of the oil and gas transaction in 2013, the concerns about credit generally for natural resource companies, is the fact that we have a very profitable mining business underlying all this. It's going to give us the way forward for the future. We had over $19 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter..."

We're continuing to review that. We've adjusted mine plans to improve cash flows. We've deferred our oil and gas drilling activities to conserve cash. We're engaged in strategic review of those assets. And we're looking at all alternatives, including sales of the business, sales of assets and how we might manage it going forward because of the market condition we're in.
You'll see that we've reduced our copper and oil unit cost of production significantly. We also want to comment about the success we've had with the Cerro Verde project, a project we wouldn't start today in these market conditions. But that's the nature of mining assets. We actually began the work on this expansion of Cerro Verde in 2010, $4.6 billion project that we brought in, but without having a significant cost overrun, the world's largest concentrator facilities at a mine anywhere in the world. And it's come up without significant -- without cost overrun at all in a very efficient, effective way. And it'll be a great long-term asset for our company going forward.
We've taken steps to protect our balance sheet by suspending our dividend. We raised equity proceeds through 2 ATM initiatives that have generated $2 billion of equity for us. Now we're going to talk about further steps. As we look at restoring our balance sheet to reflect current market conditions, we're going to focus and manage our cost and capital and continue to generate cash flow in a safe way. We're going to take immediate steps to reduce debt, to enhance shareholder value.
We are in active discussions with a number of parties on alternatives for asset sales. Besides the review of the oil and gas business, we are looking at transactions involving a wide range of our copper assets that involve alternatives. But we have interested parties. We have great assets that could lead to sales or joint venture arrangements that will be important steps of our dealing with our balance sheet.
I mentioned in the oil and gas business, we're engaged in a review for that. Our board has hired Lazard as the board's financial adviser on that, working together with our traditional banker, JPMorgan. We're canvassing the market to understand what the current market value is in an obviously tough market. And we are engaged with interested parties now, who are being provided recent access to our year-end updates of our oil and gas reserve information and our various plans. We expect all of these to achieve progress that we'll be reporting to you as it occurs during the first half of 2016.
Look at Slide 6 to show what we've done with capital. The capital we spent in 2015, which reflected the Cerro Verde project's completion, of a project, as I said, that started a number of years ago, but that is now completed. The oil and gas capital spending reflected plans and commitments for a drilling rig, equipment and other support facilities that were structured during a time when we were planning on investing for growth in that business. And we're making adjustments that reduce capital spending for 2016 to $3.4 billion, and our plans for 2017 show capital dropping to $2.3 billion.
The $1.5 billion for oil and gas reflects a couple of factors that will be carrying over in the early part of the year. We had some cash cost to pay for costs that we're actually incurred last year. We are restructuring our drilling rig contracts. We are undertaking a plan to idle all 3 of the deepwater rigs. And so we will be seeing that spending dropping off markedly after midyear of this year. And you can see that by 2017, the CapEx will be down to $600 million. That includes -- that excludes idle rig cost that we will be incurring for the commitments we have under these contracts, which we are negotiating how to arrange those with the drilling rig contractors. But included in those -- excluded from the CapEx plans are $600 million of idle rig cost in 2016 and $400 million in 2017. These are going to be reflected as expenses in our balance -- in our income statement rather than as capital spending.
So major reductions, continued focus on how to continue to constrain capital. We've adjusted our mine plans. We look at each one of our mines. We talked about this earlier, but we evaluate each of our mines with looking at a $2 copper price and considering sustaining capital. And we have made adjustments that aggregate roughly 350 million pounds, about 9% of our 2015 sales, by adjusting production at 4 of our mines. We have stress tested our current operating plans at copper prices below $2 and developed contingency actions to take if the market weakens further. And we will be monitoring that on a day-by-day basis. Team is doing a great job to do that.
The facts are that we have such an attractive cost structure that we will generate cash flows -- free cash flows out of our mining business even at much lower prices than $2. And we've taken these actions to preserve our very valuable, significant long-term resources while reducing near-term supply and generating cash flow.
To show the results of these actions as it reflected on our unit cost, we look at Slide 8. You can see in the charts that in 2015, our consolidated site production and delivery costs before byproduct credits was $1.78. With our new plans, we are reducing our outlook for that for next year by 25% to $1.34. And when you take into account byproduct credits for gold at Grasberg, molybdenum at several of our mines, cobalt in Africa, you get down to a unit net cash cost, even at these low commodity price levels for byproducts, of $1.10 consolidated for our company going forward.
We're doing this through aggressive cost and equipment fleet management, in addition to curtailing high-cost production. We get the benefits of scale at Cerro Verde. We have Grasberg's ore grades improving, beginning in the second half of this year, as we execute our plan to complete mining in the open pit by the end of 2017, managing working capital, taking advantage of low input costs. Our oil and gas cash production costs are being reduced by nearly 20%. And that reflects the fact that we're having increasing volumes from our past drilling work in the Gulf of Mexico, where our unit costs are lower than in California, and also work that our oil and gas team is doing to take advantage of lower cost from contractors and being more efficient in general. More on our mining net -- unit net costs presented on Page 9. You can see this by region, where in the Americas our before-capital-expenditure cost levels is about $1.50 per pound. And in Indonesia, where costs are lower, reflecting the higher-grade volumes that we have coming to us through our mine plan, the average of $1.10. And then after showing capital expenditures for sustaining capital, you can see that it averages $1.30 to mining of the open pit in 2017.
So much talk about market -- copper market commentary that I'm just going to make a couple of comments about it. Unquestionably, the uncertainty about the global economy is negatively impacting financial market sentiment. China's demand growth is slowing. Western demand is not as good as we and others had hoped it would be. But it's still expanding gradually. I'm not going to debate anyone about the market. The market is what the market is. But the facts are that the copper business differs from other commodities in that there is not an enormous excess supply in inventories. What we just show here, the exchange stocks that's developed from the end of 2014 to the current date. Similar story when you look at total global inventories. But here we have exchange stocks not rising significantly, remaining low by historical standards at a time when the copper price has gone from $2.88 to $2 from the end of '14 to the current date. It is -- even looking at the decline 
[Audio Gap]
particular insight as to what's going to happen in China in the future, we have to prepare ourselves for what the market is. And the market is we got $2 copper and we got to react to it.
To date, industry-wide, there've been reduction in high-cost mines. What McKinsey says, 730,000 tons a year. There will be other cuts if prices stay at this level. The supply from new mines like Cerro Verde, like Morenci, that began construction years ago, are coming to an end now. The current level of balance in the marketplace is not yielding a surplus as high as people had predicted. And all the time, low-grade -- lower-grade mines, lower-grade ores are coming from existing mines. Mines are depleting. Mines are moving underground. All these things are -- will lead to an ultimate price recovery, in my view, absent just a collapse in the world's economy, because today's price is not high enough to incentivize any future developments.
So we have enormous resources. We're not going to be spending money on developing those resources until the market improves. And if we were to start today, if the price of copper were to magically jump to $4 a pound, it would be on the order of 10 years before new production could come out of our resources. So we remain confident about the long-term copper markets in dealing with reality of today's low prices.
Now looking at just how good our copper business is. We talked about 2015 being a bridge year. Well, we crossed the bridge and now we're looking at a big uphill climb because of the current price. But even at current prices, our mining business at $2 yields $4.2 billion of EBITDA. And you can see that steps up if we were to have higher prices. And our CapEx in our mining business is $1.9 billion. So we have a company -- we have a business that earns profits at low prices. We cut back capital and we have that providing support for what we're doing.
We have a great set of assets. We have a great set of assets and we have 5 mines that have the potential of producing 1 billion pounds of copper per year. Three of them are already doing that. The Morenci, Cerro Verde, Grasberg mines. Tenke Fungurume has great growth opportunities, as does our El Abra mine in Chile. So we have a very attractive, long-term set of assets to deal with. Quality assets, which gives us the opportunities to deal with the financing issues we face with our balance sheet. Very large reserves that I'm sure most of you know about.
We've got 100 billion pounds of copper at $2 mine plans, adding in another like amount of mineralized material that's already been identified. As I said, that's there for our company for the long run. We're not going to be developing new projects until the market improves. Grasberg is a great asset. It is a very special asset with a high-grade ore in copper and gold combined. And we have been working with the government of Indonesia in a challenging political environment in that country.
We have a commitment from the government that was reflected in communication we received on October 7 from the Ministry of Energy and Mines about our proposal to extend the primary term of our contract, which -- primary term of our 1991 contract goes to 2021. It gives us the rights to 2 10-year extensions to 2041. We've been working with the government and received the positive letter from the Minister, saying the government will grant the approval for the contract and will preserve our rights to -- and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty in the existing contract.
We have recent reaffirmation of that commitment from senior government officials. The process going forward has been complicated by recent political developments in the country, including the investigations related to the taped conversation with the former speaker of the Indonesian Parliament and the reviews by Parliament of that, and the investigation with it. But we remain confident and have support from senior government officials that their policy about extending our contract remains in place. The issue is when that happens and how the government deals with its existing regulations for extending contracts.
Consistent with our agreement with the government -- with the government's agreement to extend our contract and that we are advancing plans for the development of new smelting capacity with the government and with divesting interest in our ownership of PT-FI, we committed recently a valuation in response to the government's asking for that, our valuation of PT-FI, and it reflected a valuation of approximately $16 billion, which reflects standard market ways of looking at values of mining assets. And we've agreed to offer, over time, 20.64% interest of PT-FI to Indonesian ownership, whether that's the government state-owned companies listing on the stock exchange or sales to other Indonesian interests, at fair market value.
We've had ongoing discussions with the government on renewing our export license. Members, certain officials within the Ministry of Energy and Mines have suggested that we should continue to pay an export duty, that we should make a sizable escrow deposit to support the smelter development. These points are inconsistent with the arrangements that we had worked with the government on, beginning in mid-2014. And our discussions with the government continue.
I'm here today to tell you that we have full confidence that the government will come up with a favorable decision and issue the export license to ensure the continuity of our mining operations, and in doing so, will serve the interest of Indonesia's mining industry in general. So that's the status. We have not, to date, been given that export license, but we have confidence that we will.
Now turning to our oil and gas business. I want to reiterate things we talked about in the past. These are very good assets. They have valuable infrastructure and associated resources. We've had successful drilling activities since their acquisition by Freeport in mid-2013. And this successful drilling has derisked the opportunities around the underutilized production facilities that we acquired in the transaction.
We drilled 14 wells with positive results. Four wells have been brought on production. And even though we are deferring drilling for the foreseeable future because of market conditions, the success we've had in the past drilling will allow us to connect certain of these discussion -- discoveries in a way that our near-term production volumes will actually be increasing because of past drilling successes.
Major property that we have an interest in, Heidelberg operated by Anadarko, produced its first oil this month, and it will be ramping up as we go into 2016. We will also expect to place 6 additional wells on production from our own drilling in 2016. This will result, as I mentioned earlier, reduction in our cash production costs through a consolidated of approximately $15 a barrel. But that reflects $10 a barrel in the Gulf of Mexico. We are deferring for the foreseeable future our exploration development activities. As I said, all 3 of our deepwater drilling rigs are being idled. One -- 2 are already idled and 1 is completing in the imminent future, immediate future, completion activities that it is currently working on.
But the business has very long-term production and development potential that will be there for the ultimate recovery in oil prices. There's a big inventory of drilling locations that will be available to create incremental value over the long period of time. And that comes about because of our focus area in the deepwater, where we have 3 major underutilized platforms: Marlin, Holstein and Horn Mountain, where our recent tieback drilling has been done and where we've identified significant incremental drilling opportunities.
We have interest in the Lucius, Heidelberg fields of nonoperated basis, and an interest in the Vito area that adds significant long-term development potential.
On Slide 18, we show what the EBITDA for this business would be generating and what the CapEx would be, excluding the idled rig cost. You can see that this business is very highly leveraged, of course, to the price of oil and can generate substantial free cash flows in an environment, depending on the price of oil.
We are planning our business, not with an expectation that price increases will occur, but preserving values for an eventual recovery in prices. We're taking a very hard look at G&A costs as we go forward with this oil and gas review process. We've been working with Jim and his team in Houston. We're targeting a near-term 30% reduction in G&A costs. And then as we complete the oil and gas review process, we will assess the structure of our business at that time, if, in fact, we don't sell the entire business, and then we will organize the business to fit with what comes out of the oil and gas review process. Throughout our organization and with our team in Houston, I'm encouraged by the very positive and cooperative approach that all of our team is dealing with to deal with this price environment.
Jim, do you have anything you'd like to comment on?"

Looking at our debt levels. This is the focus of what we have to deal with, and we have to deal with it in today's marketplace. We have total debt at the end of December of just over $20 billion. We have adequate liquidity as we go forward. We have limited -- very limited amounts, $200 million of debt maturing in 2016. We have no funds drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility. I'm sure you all have followed the rating actions taken on our company and have also followed the rating agencies public comment about their broadly based reviews of credits in the metals, mining and energy sector.
We have worked with agents -- agencies over the year to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our balance sheet, and we'll continue to do so. In light of the recent ratings actions and the sentiments by the rating agencies, we are -- we have prepared contingency plans to address our financial assurance obligations for our mining properties under a scenario where we're not investment-grade rated. We developed plans that would allow us to address these in a fashion that would either not require or minimize using letters of credits under our bank credit facilities, and we have a number of alternatives for doing that.
So we're working to come up with plans to reduce debt, to get our balance sheet stronger and improve our financial flexibility, and protect our liquidity in the short run. So we are -- started out telling you we're serious, and we are serious and focused to take advantage of our large-scale current production base of resources.

Our mining business we've shown generates free cash flows at very low prices, and we're taking prudent management steps and will continue to do so to respond to these market conditions. We are going to address our asset -- our balance sheet debt levels through asset sales, other initiatives to raise capital. And we have the assets to do that. And throughout all this, throughout all this, we're going to have a positive outlook for our company, based on the long-term global demand and supply fundamentals for the commodities that we produce and for our -- and given our high-quality asset base.

And then I'll just, quick [ph], on the LOE basis, you continue the cost, you manage your chemicals, you manage your trucking, you manage your employee levels and compensation and so forth to where -- to make sure the oilfield continues to produce at, at least breakeven. You don't want to lose money producing oil at this point in time. And what Richard talked about in the Point Arguello, so forth, that's in the historical numbers. So we see a reduction down to the low 20s of LOE by $20, $22 [ph] -- $22 to $22.50 a barrel on California going forward. And that's why $30 a barrel, it will justify continuing to produce.

But please remember, this is important to Indonesia. I mean, where we operate in Papua, which is a challenging political, social, economic region of Indonesia, that's important to the country, strategically. In our area, where we employ over 30,000 workers, we represent, in the province we work in, over 90% of their economy. The taxes, the employment, the exports that we generate for the country of Indonesia is important to the country as a whole. Like all countries around the world and all developing countries in Asia, Indonesia is being challenged by the downturn in China and the global economy. And so we're important to them as they are important to us. And Indonesia today is a true democracy, where there's a freedom of the press and political figures are free to comment on it. That's a good thing. And some of the comments reflect, as we see around the world and to a significant degree here in the United States, a feeling of nationalism. Witness comments made about free trade here in the United States. And so what you're reading is the functioning of a democratic system, where people have views about nationalism. Underlying that is a company that's been a long-term investor in Indonesia, that has plans to make significant investments in developing the underground resources that we have there, that provides employment and economic benefits to a province that's very much in need of development, as Papua and as a country, that's in need of this. And so we have a mutual need for each other.
[Audio Gap]
1980's [ph]. This is the most recent, significant extension to it. It's very high grades of copper and gold, a very long life. That mine has come up to speed very efficiently. We are progressing with our underground development for the Grasberg underground ore through the Block Cave mine plans that we have. We're stockpiling ore to produce beyond 2017. This is where we are currently with our plans. It's what you see in, as you say, in the slide deck. And Mark Johnson and his team, with our team at job sites, working every day to see how we can minimize the impact of that transition. But it is a reality. It is a reality that there will be a transition because we can't begin mining the Grasberg underground ore body until we complete mining the pit, because the pit subsides and the ground falls in on the cave, so you physically can't do it. And yet we're taking every step we can to mitigate that increase. That was one of our reasons for developing Cerro Verde. That was one of our reasons for developing Tenke and Morenci, was to drive volumes for us during that time period when we were making the transition to Grasberg. So what you see today is our best estimate of where we are. We're going to work to do our dead-level best to improve that. We've had success in the past of doing that. We got a great team working on it, and that's what we're working on. We're very confident technically about our ability to do it. I mean this organization has operated the most complex mine in the world, and I feel comfortable in saying that, and I think the rest of the mining industry would agree with it. At 13,000 feet in the middle of Papua, where it rains, absent El Niño, 200 to 400 inches a year, where we mine the pit, we mine the underground, I mean, we can do this. So technically, we're very comfortable and we're confident about working in Indonesia, where we've been for over 40 years. It's complicated. I'm not going to underestimate the complications. But we -- you got a team here that can handle it."

First of all, what we have signed are standard contracts for the offshore drilling industry.

They're standard. They have obligations that we have entered into, these contractors, as in a company -- as a company we honor our contracts. So we start with that. We can't just get out of -- we can't just not pay them because we want to. Now what we're doing is minimizing the costs given our contractual obligations. We're doing that: one, by idling the rigs, which involves these spread costs that incur when rigs are operating; and two, we're entering into negotiations with the contractor companies to mitigate the near-term cash obligations that we have in ways that we can mutually agree to that's in the benefit of both companies. And we have positive relationships and we want to maintain positive relationships with these contractors. They're very good companies. They're people that are -- whoever operates this business in the long run is going to want to have good relationships with them. They want to have good relationships with us.

And we are going to understand the market's interest, we're going to understand where we can find transactions, and including potential for capital markets transactions that might involve placements of various types of securities. But we're looking across the board at how can we achieve these 2 goals in the best fashion. How can we deal with our balance sheet? How we can come out of that with a company that can be there with significant cash flows, development opportunities for the long-run business. And I know you would like, and I would like, to know exactly how we're going to do that. But the market is such that I can't tell you right now. But I can tell you our commitment to it and our across-the-board consideration of alternatives."

So the review process is -- that's predicated on our ability to continue to export concentrate. So these current discussions we have about getting an extension for the export is important to those decisions to continue to invest. As I said, we are presently very confident that we're going to get this export permit arranged for us. But if there was any aspects of our work with the government of Indonesia that would change that, then unfortunately, we'd be forced to curtail development activities, curtail employment, take actions to preserve our company. We don't expect that to happen, but those are the sorts of things that were referenced in terms of the comments you saw about reviewing."

Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call.
In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release today and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today are Richard Adkerson; the employees. Red Conger is here; Mark Johnson's here as well, as well as several other senior members of our team. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be focusing today's discussion on how we are positioned in our operations and addressing our balance sheet in the current market environment. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.1 billion, $3.47 per share for the fourth quarter 2015. As indicated in the press release, where we have a reconciliation, the net loss included charges totaling $4.1 billion or $3.45 per share, primarily for the reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these net charges, the fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $21 million or $0.02 per share.
Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter totaled $919 million. We have a reconciliation of that in our slide materials for your reference. The consolidated copper sales totaled 1.15 billion pounds in the fourth quarter. Our gold sales totaled 338,000 ounces. We sold 20 million pounds of molybdenum and 13.2 million barrels of oil equivalent during the quarter. Our average realized copper price was $2.18 per pound, that was below last year's 2014 fourth quarter average of $2.95 per pound.
Gold prices averaged $1,067 per ounce in the fourth quarter of '15, and our realized price for crude oil was $48.88 per barrel, which included $11 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. We generated operating cash flows during the fourth quarter of $612 million and funded capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion during the quarter. We ended the year with $20.4 billion in debt and cash -- consolidated cash was $224 million.
As indicated in the release, since August of 2015, a total of 2-point -- $2 billion of gross proceeds have been raised under FCX's aftermarket equity program, including approximately $1 billion during fourth quarter of 2015. And we ended the year with approximately 1.25 billion common shares outstanding, and had no amounts drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility.
I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be using the slide materials that are on our website."

This is going to be a different call than we have been done in the past for obvious reasons. We face serious challenges because of what's going on in the marketplace and because of the situation with our balance sheet. And we want to convey that we're addressing this seriously and with a degree of urgency, and we're very focused on it.
Now let's think about what's changed for us since our last earnings call. On Slide 3, we show the obvious, the drop in copper prices, the drop in oil prices. And as we talked about it at the end of the third quarter, we were looking at various scenarios that ranged from further decline in prices at that time to other more positive scenarios. We're experiencing the worst of those scenarios right now, with copper dropping to $2 and oil dropping to $30.
And we're also facing a market of where market sentiment continues to be negative, particularly negative about China, and we have to prepare for that. So the issue is, what are we doing? What's Freeport going to do about this right now? And I want to convey to you what we are doing.
And turn to Slide 4. We're aggressively managing cost, CapEx, production, cash flow and working for capital raising transactions to address our balance sheet.
At the third quarter earning release, we talked about how we had restructured our Board of Directors. We had gone from 16 previous members to 7. We added 2 representatives of Carl Icahn, a significant shareholder of ours now. I can tell you, we have a board that's fully engaged and fully supportive of what we need to do and very active, and we're listening to the input of our board members and reviewing our plans as we go forward.
At that time, we had also revised our management structure from the previous office of the Chairman to go to a different structure, and that structure was further changed at the -- in December with Jim Bob stepping down as Executive Chairman of our company. Gerry Ford, our lead director, has been elected as a Nonexecutive Chairman. And I now have, effective January 1, executive responsibility for our global business, including our oil and gas business and our business in Indonesia.
Jim Bob continues to work as an adviser and is working very helpfully in dealing with our ongoing discussions with the government of Indonesia. But we have a clear strategic direction of our company now. And that strategic direction is to create shareholder value out of our copper and minerals business as we go forward. We're going to be looking at our oil and gas assets as a way to generate value to help support that strategy, and we're going to be focused immediately on addressing our balance sheet issues.
And one thing I believe has just been lost in the noise of the turmoil in the commodities market business, the issues relating to our over-leverage as a result of the oil and gas transaction in 2013, the concerns about credit generally for natural resource companies, is the fact that we have a very profitable mining business underlying all this. It's going to give us the way forward for the future. We had over $19 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter..."

We're continuing to review that. We've adjusted mine plans to improve cash flows. We've deferred our oil and gas drilling activities to conserve cash. We're engaged in strategic review of those assets. And we're looking at all alternatives, including sales of the business, sales of assets and how we might manage it going forward because of the market condition we're in.
You'll see that we've reduced our copper and oil unit cost of production significantly. We also want to comment about the success we've had with the Cerro Verde project, a project we wouldn't start today in these market conditions. But that's the nature of mining assets. We actually began the work on this expansion of Cerro Verde in 2010, $4.6 billion project that we brought in, but without having a significant cost overrun, the world's largest concentrator facilities at a mine anywhere in the world. And it's come up without significant -- without cost overrun at all in a very efficient, effective way. And it'll be a great long-term asset for our company going forward.
We've taken steps to protect our balance sheet by suspending our dividend. We raised equity proceeds through 2 ATM initiatives that have generated $2 billion of equity for us. Now we're going to talk about further steps. As we look at restoring our balance sheet to reflect current market conditions, we're going to focus and manage our cost and capital and continue to generate cash flow in a safe way. We're going to take immediate steps to reduce debt, to enhance shareholder value.
We are in active discussions with a number of parties on alternatives for asset sales. Besides the review of the oil and gas business, we are looking at transactions involving a wide range of our copper assets that involve alternatives. But we have interested parties. We have great assets that could lead to sales or joint venture arrangements that will be important steps of our dealing with our balance sheet.
I mentioned in the oil and gas business, we're engaged in a review for that. Our board has hired Lazard as the board's financial adviser on that, working together with our traditional banker, JPMorgan. We're canvassing the market to understand what the current market value is in an obviously tough market. And we are engaged with interested parties now, who are being provided recent access to our year-end updates of our oil and gas reserve information and our various plans. We expect all of these to achieve progress that we'll be reporting to you as it occurs during the first half of 2016.
Look at Slide 6 to show what we've done with capital. The capital we spent in 2015, which reflected the Cerro Verde project's completion, of a project, as I said, that started a number of years ago, but that is now completed. The oil and gas capital spending reflected plans and commitments for a drilling rig, equipment and other support facilities that were structured during a time when we were planning on investing for growth in that business. And we're making adjustments that reduce capital spending for 2016 to $3.4 billion, and our plans for 2017 show capital dropping to $2.3 billion.
The $1.5 billion for oil and gas reflects a couple of factors that will be carrying over in the early part of the year. We had some cash cost to pay for costs that we're actually incurred last year. We are restructuring our drilling rig contracts. We are undertaking a plan to idle all 3 of the deepwater rigs. And so we will be seeing that spending dropping off markedly after midyear of this year. And you can see that by 2017, the CapEx will be down to $600 million. That includes -- that excludes idle rig cost that we will be incurring for the commitments we have under these contracts, which we are negotiating how to arrange those with the drilling rig contractors. But included in those -- excluded from the CapEx plans are $600 million of idle rig cost in 2016 and $400 million in 2017. These are going to be reflected as expenses in our balance -- in our income statement rather than as capital spending.
So major reductions, continued focus on how to continue to constrain capital. We've adjusted our mine plans. We look at each one of our mines. We talked about this earlier, but we evaluate each of our mines with looking at a $2 copper price and considering sustaining capital. And we have made adjustments that aggregate roughly 350 million pounds, about 9% of our 2015 sales, by adjusting production at 4 of our mines. We have stress tested our current operating plans at copper prices below $2 and developed contingency actions to take if the market weakens further. And we will be monitoring that on a day-by-day basis. Team is doing a great job to do that.
The facts are that we have such an attractive cost structure that we will generate cash flows -- free cash flows out of our mining business even at much lower prices than $2. And we've taken these actions to preserve our very valuable, significant long-term resources while reducing near-term supply and generating cash flow.
To show the results of these actions as it reflected on our unit cost, we look at Slide 8. You can see in the charts that in 2015, our consolidated site production and delivery costs before byproduct credits was $1.78. With our new plans, we are reducing our outlook for that for next year by 25% to $1.34. And when you take into account byproduct credits for gold at Grasberg, molybdenum at several of our mines, cobalt in Africa, you get down to a unit net cash cost, even at these low commodity price levels for byproducts, of $1.10 consolidated for our company going forward.
We're doing this through aggressive cost and equipment fleet management, in addition to curtailing high-cost production. We get the benefits of scale at Cerro Verde. We have Grasberg's ore grades improving, beginning in the second half of this year, as we execute our plan to complete mining in the open pit by the end of 2017, managing working capital, taking advantage of low input costs. Our oil and gas cash production costs are being reduced by nearly 20%. And that reflects the fact that we're having increasing volumes from our past drilling work in the Gulf of Mexico, where our unit costs are lower than in California, and also work that our oil and gas team is doing to take advantage of lower cost from contractors and being more efficient in general. More on our mining net -- unit net costs presented on Page 9. You can see this by region, where in the Americas our before-capital-expenditure cost levels is about $1.50 per pound. And in Indonesia, where costs are lower, reflecting the higher-grade volumes that we have coming to us through our mine plan, the average of $1.10. And then after showing capital expenditures for sustaining capital, you can see that it averages $1.30 to mining of the open pit in 2017.
So much talk about market -- copper market commentary that I'm just going to make a couple of comments about it. Unquestionably, the uncertainty about the global economy is negatively impacting financial market sentiment. China's demand growth is slowing. Western demand is not as good as we and others had hoped it would be. But it's still expanding gradually. I'm not going to debate anyone about the market. The market is what the market is. But the facts are that the copper business differs from other commodities in that there is not an enormous excess supply in inventories. What we just show here, the exchange stocks that's developed from the end of 2014 to the current date. Similar story when you look at total global inventories. But here we have exchange stocks not rising significantly, remaining low by historical standards at a time when the copper price has gone from $2.88 to $2 from the end of '14 to the current date. It is -- even looking at the decline 
[Audio Gap]
particular insight as to what's going to happen in China in the future, we have to prepare ourselves for what the market is. And the market is we got $2 copper and we got to react to it.
To date, industry-wide, there've been reduction in high-cost mines. What McKinsey says, 730,000 tons a year. There will be other cuts if prices stay at this level. The supply from new mines like Cerro Verde, like Morenci, that began construction years ago, are coming to an end now. The current level of balance in the marketplace is not yielding a surplus as high as people had predicted. And all the time, low-grade -- lower-grade mines, lower-grade ores are coming from existing mines. Mines are depleting. Mines are moving underground. All these things are -- will lead to an ultimate price recovery, in my view, absent just a collapse in the world's economy, because today's price is not high enough to incentivize any future developments.
So we have enormous resources. We're not going to be spending money on developing those resources until the market improves. And if we were to start today, if the price of copper were to magically jump to $4 a pound, it would be on the order of 10 years before new production could come out of our resources. So we remain confident about the long-term copper markets in dealing with reality of today's low prices.
Now looking at just how good our copper business is. We talked about 2015 being a bridge year. Well, we crossed the bridge and now we're looking at a big uphill climb because of the current price. But even at current prices, our mining business at $2 yields $4.2 billion of EBITDA. And you can see that steps up if we were to have higher prices. And our CapEx in our mining business is $1.9 billion. So we have a company -- we have a business that earns profits at low prices. We cut back capital and we have that providing support for what we're doing.
We have a great set of assets. We have a great set of assets and we have 5 mines that have the potential of producing 1 billion pounds of copper per year. Three of them are already doing that. The Morenci, Cerro Verde, Grasberg mines. Tenke Fungurume has great growth opportunities, as does our El Abra mine in Chile. So we have a very attractive, long-term set of assets to deal with. Quality assets, which gives us the opportunities to deal with the financing issues we face with our balance sheet. Very large reserves that I'm sure most of you know about.
We've got 100 billion pounds of copper at $2 mine plans, adding in another like amount of mineralized material that's already been identified. As I said, that's there for our company for the long run. We're not going to be developing new projects until the market improves. Grasberg is a great asset. It is a very special asset with a high-grade ore in copper and gold combined. And we have been working with the government of Indonesia in a challenging political environment in that country.
We have a commitment from the government that was reflected in communication we received on October 7 from the Ministry of Energy and Mines about our proposal to extend the primary term of our contract, which -- primary term of our 1991 contract goes to 2021. It gives us the rights to 2 10-year extensions to 2041. We've been working with the government and received the positive letter from the Minister, saying the government will grant the approval for the contract and will preserve our rights to -- and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty in the existing contract.
We have recent reaffirmation of that commitment from senior government officials. The process going forward has been complicated by recent political developments in the country, including the investigations related to the taped conversation with the former speaker of the Indonesian Parliament and the reviews by Parliament of that, and the investigation with it. But we remain confident and have support from senior government officials that their policy about extending our contract remains in place. The issue is when that happens and how the government deals with its existing regulations for extending contracts.
Consistent with our agreement with the government -- with the government's agreement to extend our contract and that we are advancing plans for the development of new smelting capacity with the government and with divesting interest in our ownership of PT-FI, we committed recently a valuation in response to the government's asking for that, our valuation of PT-FI, and it reflected a valuation of approximately $16 billion, which reflects standard market ways of looking at values of mining assets. And we've agreed to offer, over time, 20.64% interest of PT-FI to Indonesian ownership, whether that's the government state-owned companies listing on the stock exchange or sales to other Indonesian interests, at fair market value.
We've had ongoing discussions with the government on renewing our export license. Members, certain officials within the Ministry of Energy and Mines have suggested that we should continue to pay an export duty, that we should make a sizable escrow deposit to support the smelter development. These points are inconsistent with the arrangements that we had worked with the government on, beginning in mid-2014. And our discussions with the government continue.
I'm here today to tell you that we have full confidence that the government will come up with a favorable decision and issue the export license to ensure the continuity of our mining operations, and in doing so, will serve the interest of Indonesia's mining industry in general. So that's the status. We have not, to date, been given that export license, but we have confidence that we will.
Now turning to our oil and gas business. I want to reiterate things we talked about in the past. These are very good assets. They have valuable infrastructure and associated resources. We've had successful drilling activities since their acquisition by Freeport in mid-2013. And this successful drilling has derisked the opportunities around the underutilized production facilities that we acquired in the transaction.
We drilled 14 wells with positive results. Four wells have been brought on production. And even though we are deferring drilling for the foreseeable future because of market conditions, the success we've had in the past drilling will allow us to connect certain of these discussion -- discoveries in a way that our near-term production volumes will actually be increasing because of past drilling successes.
Major property that we have an interest in, Heidelberg operated by Anadarko, produced its first oil this month, and it will be ramping up as we go into 2016. We will also expect to place 6 additional wells on production from our own drilling in 2016. This will result, as I mentioned earlier, reduction in our cash production costs through a consolidated of approximately $15 a barrel. But that reflects $10 a barrel in the Gulf of Mexico. We are deferring for the foreseeable future our exploration development activities. As I said, all 3 of our deepwater drilling rigs are being idled. One -- 2 are already idled and 1 is completing in the imminent future, immediate future, completion activities that it is currently working on.
But the business has very long-term production and development potential that will be there for the ultimate recovery in oil prices. There's a big inventory of drilling locations that will be available to create incremental value over the long period of time. And that comes about because of our focus area in the deepwater, where we have 3 major underutilized platforms: Marlin, Holstein and Horn Mountain, where our recent tieback drilling has been done and where we've identified significant incremental drilling opportunities.
We have interest in the Lucius, Heidelberg fields of nonoperated basis, and an interest in the Vito area that adds significant long-term development potential.
On Slide 18, we show what the EBITDA for this business would be generating and what the CapEx would be, excluding the idled rig cost. You can see that this business is very highly leveraged, of course, to the price of oil and can generate substantial free cash flows in an environment, depending on the price of oil.
We are planning our business, not with an expectation that price increases will occur, but preserving values for an eventual recovery in prices. We're taking a very hard look at G&A costs as we go forward with this oil and gas review process. We've been working with Jim and his team in Houston. We're targeting a near-term 30% reduction in G&A costs. And then as we complete the oil and gas review process, we will assess the structure of our business at that time, if, in fact, we don't sell the entire business, and then we will organize the business to fit with what comes out of the oil and gas review process. Throughout our organization and with our team in Houston, I'm encouraged by the very positive and cooperative approach that all of our team is dealing with to deal with this price environment.
Jim, do you have anything you'd like to comment on?"

At $2 copper, that would generate $3.4 billion of operating cash flows, including the impact of the idle rig cost. We've got significant leverage to copper, of course, and we've reduced capital expenditures. 
In looking at our sales profile going into 2016 and 2017, you can see the level of copper sales, which reflects Cerro Verde, Grasberg's positive results and continued operations at our existing mines, net of our curtailed production. And you can see in 2017, as we complete mining the Grasberg open pit, the significant volumes of gold that will be produced. And in looking at the bottom of the slides with oil and gas sales, even with the suspension of drilling activities because of our past drilling successes and completing the tieback wells, we're not seeing a falloff in our oil and gas sales profile.

And again, I want to emphasize, we're also stress testing our business to respond to a scenario where prices may go lower. 
Looking at our debt levels. This is the focus of what we have to deal with, and we have to deal with it in today's marketplace. We have total debt at the end of December of just over $20 billion. We have adequate liquidity as we go forward. We have limited -- very limited amounts, $200 million of debt maturing in 2016. We have no funds drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility. I'm sure you all have followed the rating actions taken on our company and have also followed the rating agencies public comment about their broadly based reviews of credits in the metals, mining and energy sector.
We have worked with agents -- agencies over the year to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our balance sheet, and we'll continue to do so. In light of the recent ratings actions and the sentiments by the rating agencies, we are -- we have prepared contingency plans to address our financial assurance obligations for our mining properties under a scenario where we're not investment-grade rated. We developed plans that would allow us to address these in a fashion that would either not require or minimize using letters of credits under our bank credit facilities, and we have a number of alternatives for doing that.
So we're working to come up with plans to reduce debt, to get our balance sheet stronger and improve our financial flexibility, and protect our liquidity in the short run. So we are -- started out telling you we're serious, and we are serious and focused to take advantage of our large-scale current production base of resources. We've established these long-lived reserves that are going to be there for the future of our company. We have significant undeveloped resources that will be available for the future.
I'm very proud and pleased to represent a global organization of such highly qualified management, workers, people that we work with. They're first class in every respect. Our mining business we've shown generates free cash flows at very low prices, and we're taking prudent management steps and will continue to do so to respond to these market conditions. We are going to address our asset -- our balance sheet debt levels through asset sales, other initiatives to raise capital. And we have the assets to do that. And throughout all this, throughout all this, we're going to have a positive outlook for our company, based on the long-term global demand and supply fundamentals for the commodities that we produce and for our -- and given our high-quality asset base. I know you have a lot of questions, and I look forward to responding to them."

We've been through lots of changes, about as many changes as you can imagine with a country. And we have successfully managed our way through those changes over 40 years. It's important to us. But please remember, this is important to Indonesia. I mean, where we operate in Papua, which is a challenging political, social, economic region of Indonesia, that's important to the country, strategically. In our area, where we employ over 30,000 workers, we represent, in the province we work in, over 90% of their economy. The taxes, the employment, the exports that we generate for the country of Indonesia is important to the country as a whole. Like all countries around the world and all developing countries in Asia, Indonesia is being challenged by the downturn in China and the global economy. And so we're important to them as they are important to us. And Indonesia today is a true democracy, where there's a freedom of the press and political figures are free to comment on it. That's a good thing. And some of the comments reflect, as we see around the world and to a significant degree here in the United States, a feeling of nationalism. Witness comments made about free trade here in the United States. And so what you're reading is the functioning of a democratic system, where people have views about nationalism. Underlying that is a company that's been a long-term investor in Indonesia, that has plans to make significant investments in developing the underground resources that we have there, that provides employment and economic benefits to a province that's very much in need of development, as Papua and as a country, that's in need of this. And so we have a mutual need for each other.
[Audio Gap]
1980's [ph]. This is the most recent, significant extension to it. It's very high grades of copper and gold, a very long life. That mine has come up to speed very efficiently. We are progressing with our underground development for the Grasberg underground ore through the Block Cave mine plans that we have. We're stockpiling ore to produce beyond 2017. This is where we are currently with our plans. It's what you see in, as you say, in the slide deck. And Mark Johnson and his team, with our team at job sites, working every day to see how we can minimize the impact of that transition. But it is a reality. It is a reality that there will be a transition because we can't begin mining the Grasberg underground ore body until we complete mining the pit, because the pit subsides and the ground falls in on the cave, so you physically can't do it. And yet we're taking every step we can to mitigate that increase. That was one of our reasons for developing Cerro Verde. That was one of our reasons for developing Tenke and Morenci, was to drive volumes for us during that time period when we were making the transition to Grasberg. So what you see today is our best estimate of where we are. We're going to work to do our dead-level best to improve that. We've had success in the past of doing that. We got a great team working on it, and that's what we're working on. We're very confident technically about our ability to do it. I mean this organization has operated the most complex mine in the world, and I feel comfortable in saying that, and I think the rest of the mining industry would agree with it. At 13,000 feet in the middle of Papua, where it rains, absent El Niño, 200 to 400 inches a year, where we mine the pit, we mine the underground, I mean, we can do this. So technically, we're very comfortable and we're confident about working in Indonesia, where we've been for over 40 years. It's complicated. I'm not going to underestimate the complications. But we -- you got a team here that can handle it."

Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release today and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Jim Flores, Red Conger's here, Mark Johnson's here as well, as well as several other senior members of our team. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be focusing today's discussion on how we are positioning our operations and addressing our balance sheet in the current market environment. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.1 billion, $3.47 per share for the fourth quarter 2015. As indicated in the press release, where we have a reconciliation of the net loss included charges totaling $4.1 billion or $3.45 per share, primarily for the reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these net charges, the fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $21 million or $0.02 per share.
Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter totaled $919 million. We have a reconciliation of that in our slide materials for your reference. The consolidated copper sales totaled 1.15 billion pounds in the fourth quarter. Our gold sales totaled 338,000 ounces. We sold 20 million pounds of molybdenum and 13.2 million barrels of oil equivalents during the quarter. Our average realized copper price was $2.18 per pound. That was below last year's 2014's fourth quarter average of $2.95 per pound.
Gold prices averaged $1,067 per ounce in the fourth quarter of '15, and our realized price for crude oil was $48.88 per barrel, which included $11 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. We generated operating cash flows during the fourth quarter of $612 million and funded capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion during the quarter. We ended the year with $20.4 billion in debt and cash -- consolidated cash was $224 million.
As indicated in the release, since August of 2015, a total of 2-point -- $2 billion of gross proceeds have been raised under FCX's aftermarket equity program, including approximately $1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015. And we ended the year with approximately 1.25 billion common shares outstanding and had no amounts drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility.
I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be using the slide materials that are on our website."

This is going to be a different call than we have been done in the past for obvious reasons. We face serious challenges because of what's going on in the marketplace and because of the situation with our balance sheet. And we want to convey that we're addressing this seriously and with a degree of urgency, and we're very focused on it.
Now let's think about what's changed for us since our last earnings call. On Slide 3, we show the obvious, the drop in copper prices, the drop in oil prices. And as we talked about it at the end of the third quarter, we were looking at various scenarios that ranged from a further decline in prices at that time to other more positive scenarios. We're experiencing the worst of those scenarios right now, with copper dropping to $2 and oil dropping to $30. And we're also facing a market of where market sentiment continues to be negative, particularly negative about China, and we have to prepare for that. So the issue is, what are we doing? What's Freeport going to do about this right now? And I want to convey to you what we are doing.
And turn to Slide 4. We are aggressively managing cost, CapEx, production, cash flow and working for capital raising transactions to address our balance sheet. At the third quarter earning release, we talked about how we had restructured our Board of Directors. We had gone from 16 previous members to 7. We added 2 representatives of Carl Icahn, a significant shareholder of ours now. I can tell you, we have a board that's fully engaged and fully supportive of what we need to do and very active, and we're listening to the input of our board members and reviewing our plans as we go forward.
At that time, we had also revised our management structure from the previous office of the Chairman to go to a different structure, and that structure was further changed at the -- in December with Jim Bob stepping down as Executive Chairman of our company. Jerry Ford, our Lead Director, has been elected as a Nonexecutive Chairman. And I now have, effective January 1, executive responsibility for our global business including our oil and gas business and our business in Indonesia.
Jim Bob continues to work as an adviser and is working very helpfully in dealing with our ongoing discussions with the government in Indonesia. But we have a clear strategic direction of our company now, and that strategic direction is to create shareholder value out of our copper and minerals business as we go forward. We're going to be looking at our oil and gas assets as a way to generate value to help support that strategy, and we're going to be focused immediately on addressing our balance sheet issues.
And one thing I believe as that's been lost in the noise of the turmoil in the commodities market business, the issues relating to our over leverage as a result of the oil and gas transaction in 2013, the concerns about credit generally for natural resource companies is the fact that we have a very profitable mining business underlying all this that's going to give us the way forward for the future. We had over $19 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter..."

We've made significant reductions in our capital spending, and we're continuing to review that. We've adjusted mine plans to improve cash flows. We've deferred our oil and gas drilling activities to conserve cash. We're engaged in strategic review about those assets, and we're looking at all alternatives including sales of the business, sales of assets and how we might manage it going forward because of the market condition we're in.
You'll see that we have reduced our copper and oil unit cost of production significantly. We've also want to comment about the success we've had with the Cerro Verde project, project we wouldn't start today in these market conditions. But that's the nature of mining assets. We actually began the work on this expansion of Cerro Verde in 2010, $4.6 billion project that we brought in without having a significant cost overrun, the world's largest concentrator facilities at a mine anywhere in the world. And it's come up without significant -- without cost overrun at all in a very efficient, effective way. And it'll be a great long-term asset for our company going forward.
We've taken steps to protect our balance sheet by suspending our dividend. We raised equity proceeds through 2 ATM initiatives that have generated $2 billion of equity for us. And now we're going to talk about further steps. As we look at restoring our balance sheet to reflect current market conditions, we're going to focus and manage our cost and capital and continue to generate cash flow in a safe way. We're going to take immediate steps to reduce debt, to enhance shareholder value.
We are in active discussions with a number of parties on alternatives for asset sales. Besides the review of the oil and gas business, we are looking at transaction involving a wide range of our copper assets that involve alternatives. But we have interested parties, we have great assets that could lead to sales or joint venture arrangements that will be important steps for dealing with our balance sheet.
I mentioned in oil and gas business, we're engaged in a review for that. Our board has hired Lazard as the board's financial adviser on that, working together with our traditional banker, JPMorgan. We're canvassing the market to understand what the current market value is in an obviously tough market. And we are engaged with interested parties now who are being provided recent access to our year-end updates of our oil and gas reserve information and our various plans. We expect all of these to achieve progress that we'll be reporting to you as it occurs during the first half of 2016.
Look at Slide 6 to show what we've done with capital. The capital we spent in 2015, which reflected the Cerro Verde project's completion of a project, as I said, that started a number of years ago, but that is now completed. The oil and gas capital spending reflected plans and commitments for our drilling rig equipment and other support facilities that were structured during a time when we were planning on investing for growth in that business. And we're making adjustments that reduce capital spending for 2016 to $3.4 billion, and our plans for 2017 show capital dropping to $2.3 billion.
The $1.5 billion for oil and gas reflects couple of factors that will be carrying over in the early part of the year. We had some cash costs to pay for costs that we're actually incurred last year. We are restructuring our drilling rig contracts. We are undertaking a plan to idle all 3 of the deepwater rigs. And so we will be seeing that spending dropping off markedly after midyear of this year. And you can see that by 2017, the CapEx will be down to $600 million. That includes -- that excludes idled rig costs that we will be incurring for the commitments we have under these contracts, which we are negotiating how to arrange those with the drilling rig contractors. But included in those -- excluded from the CapEx plans are $600 million of idle rig cost in 2016 and $400 million in 2017. These are going to be reflected as expenses in our balance -- in our income statement rather than as capital spending.
So major reductions and continued focus on how to continue to constrain capital. We've adjusted our mine plans. We look at each one of our mines. We talked about this earlier, but we evaluate each of our mines with looking at a $2 copper price and considering sustaining capital. And we have made adjustments that aggregate roughly 350 million pounds, about 9% of our 2015 sales by adjusting production at 4 of our mines. We have stress tested our current operating plans at copper prices below $2 and developed contingency actions to take if the market weakens further. And we will be monitoring that on a day-by-day basis. Jim is doing a great job to do that.
The facts are that we have such an attractive cost structure that we will generate cash flows -- free cash flows out of our mining business even at much lower prices than $2. And we've taken these actions to preserve our very valuable significant long-term resources but while reducing near-term supply and generating cash flow.
To show the results of these actions as it reflected on our unit cost, we look at Slide 8. You can see in the charts that in 2015, our consolidated site production and delivery cost before byproduct credits was $1.78. With our new plans, we are reducing our outlook for that for next year by 25% to $1.34. And when you take into account byproduct credits for gold at Grasberg, molybdenum at several of our mines, cobalt in Africa, you get down to a unit net cash cost even at these low commodity price levels for byproducts of $1.10 consolidated for our company going forward.
We're doing this through aggressive cost and equipment fleet management in addition to curtailing high cost production. We get the benefits of scale at Cerro Verde. We have Grasberg's ore grades improving beginning in the second half of this year, as we execute our plan to complete mining in the open pit by the end of 2017, managing working capital, taking advantage of low input costs. Our oil and gas cash production costs are being reduced by nearly 20%. And that reflects the fact that we're having increasing volumes from our past drilling work in the Gulf of Mexico where our unit costs are lower than in California, and also work that our oil and gas team is doing to take advantage of lower costs from contractors and being more efficient in general. 
More on our mining net -- unit net costs are presented on Page 9. You can see this by region where in the Americas our before capital expenditure cost level is about $1.50 per pound. And in Indonesia, where costs are lower, reflecting the higher grade volumes that we have coming to us through our mine plan, the average $1.10. And then after showing capital expenditures for sustaining capital, you can see that it averages $1.32. The Grasberg number includes the capital we're spending on underground development so that we have the underground mines available to continue Grasberg as a high volume low cost long-term operation after the completion of the mining of the open pit in 2017.
So much talk about market -- copper market commentary that I'm just going to make a couple of comments about it. Unquestionably, the uncertainty about the global economy is negatively impacting financial market sentiment. China's demand growth is slowing. Western demand is not as good as we and others had hoped it would be, but it's still expanding gradually. I'm not going to debate anyone about the market. The market is what the market is. But the facts are that in the copper business differs from other commodities in that there's not an enormous excess supply in inventories. 
We just show here the exchange stocks that have -- as that's developed from the end of 2014 to the current date, similar story when you look at total global inventories. But here we have exchange stocks not rising significantly, remaining low by historical standards at a time when the copper price has gone from $2.88 to $2 from the end of '14 to the current date. It is -- even looking at the decline in prices so dramatically since the third quarter, inventories are not building. 
The story is fundamentally in today's world, the business we're seeing is not as negative as the financial markets are reacting to it. We have no particular insight as to what's going to happen in China in the future. We have to prepare ourselves for what the market is, and the market is we've got $2 copper and we've got to react to it.
To date, industry-wide, there've been reduction in high cost mines. What McKinsey says 730,000 tons a year, there will be other cuts if prices stay at this level. The supply from new mines like Cerro Verde, like Morenci that began construction years ago are coming to an end now. The current level of balance in the marketplace is not yielding a surplus as high as people had predicted. And all the time, low grade -- lower grade mines, lower grade ores are coming from existing mines. Mines are depleting. Mines are moving underground. 
All these things are -- will lead to an ultimate price recovery, in my view, absent just a collapse in the world's economy because today's price is not high enough to incentivize any future development. So we have enormous resources. We're not going to be spending money on developing those resources until the market improves. And if we were to start today, if the price of copper were to magically jump to $4 a pound, it would be on the order of 10 years before new production could come out of our resources. So we remain confident about the long-term copper markets in dealing with the reality of today's low prices.
Now looking at just how good our copper business is. We talked about 2015 being a bridge year. Well, we crossed the bridge and now we're looking at a big uphill climb because of the current price. But even at current prices, our mining business at $2 yields $4.2 billion of EBITDA. And you can see that steps up if we were to have higher prices. And our CapEx in our mining business is $1.9 billion. So we have a company -- we have a business that earns profits at low prices. We've cut back capital and we have that providing support for what we're doing.
We have a great set of assets. We have a great set of assets and we have 5 mines that have the potential of producing 1 billion pounds of copper per year. Three of them are already doing that. The Morenci, Cerro Verde, Grasberg mines, Tenke Fungurume has great growth opportunities, as does our El Abra mine in Chile. So we have a very attractive long-term set of assets to deal with. Quality assets, which gives us the opportunities to deal with the financing issues we face with our balance sheet. 
Very large reserves that I'm sure most of you know about. We've got 100 billion pounds of copper at $2 mine plans, adding in another like amount of mineralized material that's already been identified. As I said, that's there for our company for the long run, and we're not going to be developing new projects until the market improves. Grasberg is a great asset. It is a very special asset with a high grade ore in copper and gold combined. And we have been working with the government of Indonesia in a challenging political environment in that country.
We have a commitment from the government that was reflected in communication we received on October 7 from the Minister of Energy and Mines about our proposal to extend the primary term of our contract, which -- primary term of our 1991 contract goes to 2021. It gives us the rights to 2 10-year extensions to 2041. We've been working with the government and we received the positive letter from the Minister saying the government will grant approval for the contract and will preserve our rights to -- in the same level of legal and fiscal certainty in the existing contract. 
We have recent reaffirmation of that commitment from senior government officials. The process going forward has been complicated by recent political developments in the country, including the investigations related to the taped conversation with the former speaker of the Indonesian parliament and the reviews by parliament of that and the investigation with it. But we remain confident and have support from senior government officials that their policy about extending our contract remains in place. The issue is when that happens and how the government deals with its existing regulations for extending contracts.
Consistent with our agreement with the government -- with the government's agreement to extend our contract and that we are advancing plans for the development of new smelting capacity with the government and with the vesting interest in our ownership of PT-FI, we submitted recently a valuation in response to the government's asking for that of our valuation of PT-FI. And it reflected a valuation of approximately $16 billion, which reflects standard market ways of looking at values of mining assets. And we've agreed to offer over time 20.64% interest of PT-FI to Indonesian ownership, whether that's the government state-owned companies listing on the stock exchange or sales to other Indonesian interest at fair market value.
We've had ongoing discussions with the government on renewing our export license. Members, certain officials within the Ministry of Energy and Mines have suggested that we should continue to pay an export duty, that we should make a sizable escrow deposit to support the smelter development. These points are inconsistent with the arrangements that we had worked with the government on beginning in mid-2014 and our discussions with the government continue.
I'm here today to tell you that we have full confidence that the government will come up with a favorable decision and issue the export license to ensure the continuity of our mining operation, and in doing so, will serve the interest of Indonesia's mining industry in general. So that's the status. We have not, to date, been given that export license, but we have confidence that we will.
Now turning to our oil and gas business, want to reiterate things we've talked about in the past. These are very good assets. They have valuable infrastructure and associated resources. We've had successful drilling activities since their acquisition by Freeport in mid-2013. And this successful drilling has derisked the opportunities around the underutilized production facilities that we acquired in the transaction.
We drilled 14 wells with positive results, 4 wells have been brought on production. And even though we are deferring drilling for the foreseeable future because of market conditions, the success we've had in the past drilling will allow us to connect certain of these discussion -- discoveries in a way that our near-term production volumes will actually be increasing because of the past drilling successes.
Major property that we have an interest in, Heidelberg operated by Anadarko, produced its first oil this month, and it will be ramping up as we go into 2016. We will also expect to place 6 additional wells on production from our own drilling in 2016. This will result, as I mentioned earlier, reduction in our cash production costs to a consolidated of approximately $15 a barrel, that reflects $10 a barrel in the Gulf of Mexico. We are deferring for the foreseeable future our exploration development activities. As I said, all 3 of our deepwater drilling rigs are being idle. One -- 2 are already idled and 1 is completing in the imminent future, the immediate future completion activities that is currently working on.
But the business has very long-term production and development potential that will be there for the ultimate recovery in oil prices. There's a big inventory of drilling locations that will be available to create incremental value over the long period of time. And that comes about because of our focus area in the deepwater where we have 3 major underutilized platforms: Marlin, Holstein and Horn Mountain, where our recent tieback drilling has been done and where we've identified significant incremental drilling opportunities. We have interest in the Lucius, Heidelberg fields nonoperated basis and interest in the Vito area that has significant long-term development potential.
On Slide 18, we show what the EBITDA for this business would be generating and what the CapEx would be excluding the idled rig cost. You can see that this business is very highly leveraged, of course, to the price of oil and can generate substantial free cash flows in an environment depending on the price of oil. We are planning our business, not with an expectation that price increases will occur, but preserving values for an eventual recovery in prices. We're taking a very hard look at G&A costs as we go forward with this oil and gas review process, been working with Jim and his team in Houston. We're targeting a near-term 30% reduction in G&A costs. And then as we complete the oil and gas review process, we will assess the structure of our business at that time, if, in fact, we don't sell the entire business, and then we will organize the business to fit with what comes out of the oil and gas review process. Throughout our organization and with our team in Houston, I'm encouraged by the very positive and cooperative approach that all of our team is dealing with to deal with this price environment.
Jim, do you have anything you'd like to comment on?"

Looking at our debt levels. This is the focus of what we have to deal with, and we have to deal with it in today's marketplace. We have total debt at the end of December of just over $20 billion. We have adequate liquidity as we go forward. We have limited -- very limited amounts, $200 million of debt maturing in 2016. We have no funds drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility. I'm sure you all have followed the rating actions taken on our company and have also followed the rating agencies public comment about their broadly based reviews of credits in the metals and mining and energy sector. We have worked with agents -- agencies over the year to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our balance sheet, and we'll continue to do so. 
In light of the recent ratings actions and the sentiments by the rating agencies, we are -- we have prepared contingency plans to address our financial assurance obligations for our mining properties under a scenario where we're not investment grade rated. We would develop plans that would allow us to address these in a fashion that would either not require or minimize using letters of credits under our bank credit facilities, and we have a number of alternatives for doing that. 
So we're working to come up with plans to reduce debt, to get our balance sheet stronger, improve our financial flexibility, and protect our liquidity in the short run. So we are -- start out telling you we're serious, and we are serious and focused to take advantage of our large scale current production base of resources. We've established these long-lived reserves that are going to be there for the future of our company. We have significant undeveloped resources that will be available for the future. I'm very proud and pleased to represent a global organization of such highly qualified management, workers and people that we work with. They're first class in every respect. 
Our mining business we've shown generates free cash flows at very low prices, and we're taking prudent management steps and will continue to do so to respond to these market conditions. We are going to address our asset -- our balance sheet debt levels through asset sales, other initiatives to raise capital. And we have the assets to do that. And throughout all this, throughout all of this, we're going to have a positive outlook for our company based on the long-term global demand and supply fundamentals for the commodities that we produce and for our -- and given our high quality asset base.

So you drop those development activity, and that's before any CapEx. And then I'll just -- strict [ph] on LOE basis, you continue to cost, you manage your chemicals, you manage your trucking, you manage your employee levels and compensation and so forth to where -- to make sure the oilfield continues to produce at, at least breakeven. You don't want to lose money producing oil at this point in time. And what Richard talked about in the Point Arguello, so forth, that's in the historical numbers. So we see a reduction now in the low 20s of LOE by $20, $22 [ph] -- $22 to $22.50 a barrel on California going forward.

I mean, where we operate in Papua, which is a challenging political, social, economic region of Indonesia that's important to the country strategically. In our area, where we employ over 30,000 workers, we represent, in the province we work in, over 90% of their economy. The taxes, the employment, the exports that we generate for the country of Indonesia is important to the country as a whole. Like all countries around the world and all developing countries in Asia, Indonesia is being challenged by the downturn in China and the global economy. And so we're important to them as they are important to us. And Indonesia today is a true democracy where there's a freedom of the press and political figures are free to comment on it. That's a good thing. And some of the comments reflect, as we see around the world and to a significant degree here in the United States, a feeling of nationalism. Witness comments that make about free trade here in the United States. And so what you're reading is the functioning of a democratic system where people have views about nationalism. Underlying that is a company that's been a long-term investor in Indonesia that has plans to make significant investments in developing the underground resources that we have there that provides employment and economic benefits to a province that's been very much of need of development as Papua and is a country that's in need of this.

We've had great success in expanding our ore bodies there. In the third quarter, we began producing from the Deep MLZ mine which is an extension of our underground block caving operations that started in the early 1980s. This is the most recent significant extension to it. It's very high grades of copper and gold, a very long life. That mine has come up to speed very efficiently. We are progressing with our underground development for the Grasberg underground ore through the Block Cave mine plans that we have. We're stockpiling ore to produce beyond 2017. This is where we are currently with our plans is what you see in, as you say, in the slide deck. And Mark Johnson and his team with our team at job sites working every day to see how we can minimize the impact of that transition. But it is a reality, it is a reality that there will be a transition because we can't begin mining the Grasberg underground ore body until we complete mining the pit because the pit subsides and the ground falls in on the cave, so you physically can't do it. And yet we're taking every step we can to mitigate that increase. That was one of our reasons for developing Cerro Verde. It was one of our reasons for developing Tenke and Morenci was to drive volumes for us during that time period when we were making the transition to Grasberg. So what you see today is our best estimate of where we are. We're going to work to do our dead-level best to improve that. We've had success in the past of doing that. We got a great team working on it, and that's what we're working on. But we're very confident technically about our ability to do it. I mean this organization has operated the most complex mine in the world, and I feel comfortable in saying that, and I think the rest of the mining industry would agree with it. At 13,000 feet in the middle of Papua where it rains, absent El Niño, 200 to 400 inches a year, where we mine the pit, we mine the underground and we can do this.

First of all, what we have signed are standard contracts for the offshore drilling industry. These are contracts that we had entered into that are similar to contracts that all other operators have entered into. And if you read, you can find that there are a number of other operators who are also idling rigs and doing this. So we can't get out of the contracts. I mean, they are what they are. They're standard. They have obligations that we have entered into these contractors. As in a company -- company, we honor our contracts. So we start with that. We can't just get out of -- we can't just not pay them because we want to. Now what we're doing is minimizing the costs given our contractual obligations. We're doing that, one, by idling the rigs, which involves these spread costs that incur when the rigs are operating; and two, we're entering into negotiations with the contractor companies to mitigate the near-term cash obligations that we have in ways that we can mutually agree to that's in the benefit of both companies. And we have positive relationships and we want to maintain positive relationships with these contractors. They're very good companies. They're people that are -- whoever operates this business in the long run is going to want to have good relationships with them. They want to have good relationships with us. They're very high quality rigs. And so it gives us a basis for talking with them, which they're doing to try to achieve our objectives in ways that's consistent with their rights under the contract."

Now the values are less now than they were 2.5 years ago because oil prices have gone from over $100 to $30 just like our copper assets. The value that we put on PT-FI, which is $16 billion reflecting today's market, is a lot less than it was when copper prices were $3 or more. So we've got to recognize realities, but in the midst of all -- and I said this earlier. In the midst of all of this noise about negative investor sentiment, about commodities in China and global growth, and in the midst of all the concerns about Freeport because of our debt level in Indonesia, we've got a great set of assets underlying this.

We are continuing with our investments to develop the underground ore bodies, the access to them and to prepare those -- the Grasberg Block Cave for bringing it on stream beginning in roughly 2018 -- beginning 2018. So the review process is, that's predicated on our ability to continue to export concentrate. So this current discussions we have about getting an extension for the export is important to those decisions to continue to invest. As I said, we are presently very confident that we are going to get this export permit arranged for us. But if there was any aspects of our work with the government of Indonesia that would change that, then unfortunately, we'd be forced to curtail development activities, curtail employment, take actions to preserve our company. We don't expect that to happen, but those are the sorts of things that were referenced in terms of the comments you saw about reviewing."

Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call. 
In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release today and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today, Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we've also got Red Conger here and Mark Johnson. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our presentation materials on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for Q&A.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion or $3.35 per share for first quarter 2016. The loss included net charges totaling $4 billion or $3.19 per share, primarily for the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas, properties, idle rig cost and other items. After adjusting for the net special items, the first quarter adjusted net loss attributable common stock totaled 197 million or $0.16 per share. 
The earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter approximated $873 million and there's a reconciliation of that amount on Page 32 of our slide deck. Consolidated sales totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper during the quarter. This is over 200,000 ounces of gold, 17 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.1 billion barrels of oil equivalents. 
Our realized price for copper during the first quarter was $2.17 per pound that was below last years first quarter average of $2.72 per pound. Gold prices were slightly above last year's average in the first quarter 2016. Our gold prices averaged $12.27 per ounce and our realized price for crude oil during the first quarter of 2016 was $29 per barrel. That was significantly below last year's first quarter price of $44.54 per barrel, which included about $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts. 
We reported very good cost performance during the quarter, and are on track to meet or exceed our cost guidance for the year. Of the average cost of production net of by-product credits for our copper mines averaged $1.38 per pound in the first quarter 2016. Those were lower than last year's first quarter of $1.64. We had the benefit of volumes and also the impact of our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. The average cost of $1.38 was below the estimate we have provided in January 2016 of $1.44 per pound. 
We generated operating cash flows totaling $740 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures were just under $1 billion at $982 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $20.8 billion in debt and our consolidated cash was $331 million. We had the -- Richard's going to be talking on this call about our efforts to reduce debt significantly and our progress on our asset sale program. We ended the quarter with availability under our revolver of totaling $3 billion at quarter end. And at the end of the quarter, we had 1.25 billion common shares outstanding. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation."

That's the ab",3449,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. It's been a very active and encouraging quarter for us here at Freeport. We're just mailing out our Annual Report, the theme of it is proving our metal. That's the ability to face a demanding situation in a spirited and resilient way. And I can tell you our team here couldn't be approaching its work in a more positive way from that standpoint. I'm very proud of all that our team is doing. 
We have a clearly defined strategy that our board has set and we're really focused on executing it now. We experienced strong operating results in the face of weak commodity prices. And we made a lot of progress in achieving our strategic and financial objectives during this quarter. Our reported earnings were in line with our plans, actually a bit higher because we had somewhat higher copper prices during the quarter. We did have a significant additional impairment charge, which is a substantially all in our oil and gas business, and we have taken recent steps to restructure that business to reduce costs and that is progressing well. 
We've got a really good operating team is there and some good assets and we're focused on attacking costs aggressively and have begun to do that. We're continuing to look for opportunities to sell our monetized assets in the oil and gas business, but we're now working with -- and it is a tough market, admittedly a tough market to try to do that. But we're working with our operating team on new plans to preserve and enhance the value of our assets for the future. 
With our mining business, we're performing well. The Cerro Verde startup has -- we're seeing exceptionally well. We'll talk a bit more about that. Mining CapEx are declining as we've been talking about in the past. Volumes are increasing. Costs are being constrained and copper prices have risen from the lows in the face of admittedly uncertain global market. But there's been positive movements recently. 
We are continuing with our efforts to improve our balance sheet and have increasing confidence that we're going to be able to do that in an effective way. And after we get our balance sheet situation developed, we're going to have a -- continue to have an industry-leading copper company and we remain very positive about its long-term fundamentals. 
With the copper market itself. The initial but if it came of course from monetary policies, policies to encourage business activity in China and its position by the U.S. Fed initially created a positive -- more positive environment for copper and other commodities prices. But recent data out of China, the internal economy has been encouraging in the power grid business, automobiles, but recognize it's a mixed situation there as construction remains subdued. But there is improved market sentiment. Short positions have been closed. Long positions have been taken, which is just a function of the marketplace. And globally, demand is improving modestly. 
So what the net of all this has been that large participated surplus in the copper markets have not materialized. Companies are reducing costs as we are and we're pleased with our progress there. Then some curtailment not as much as might be expected, but almost 800,000 tons year-to-date. But the pipeline in new supply of projects is declining as companies are deferring projects, cutting CapEx and all of this is resulting in a longer-term outlook for a very positive copper price environment. And that's what we're focused on finding a way to structure our business to take advantage of that. 
Page 5 is a slide that illustrates the theme that I've been talking about for years. Existing base production is declining. Over the next 10 years, with Mackenzie predict an 18% decline in production from just under 20 million tons a year to just over 16 million tons a year. If you take very modest outlooks for our global consumption growth, they use 1.7%, you end up with a shortfall of mine supply in relation to consumption of 7 million tons. Right now what Mackenzie estimates that highly probable mine developments only 2 million tons. That leaves 5 million tons to be made up of other projects, the top 10 mines in the world produce about that level. So that shows the extent of the shortfall, and 1/3 of that 5 million has to come from new projects that are not considered probably, yes, that's over 3 million tons. That's 3 -- that's 3 Escondidas, 8 -- roughly 8 Morenci's. So there's got to be a lot of new mines developed, the incentive price even in today's world for developing new mines is that prices that are probably 50% higher than the current price. So that's what we're in the business for and we remain confident about it. 
So what are we doing right now? That's what's on everybody's mind and that's what we're focusing in on. We are executing our strategy. We're going to strengthen our balance sheet. We're going to maintain a high-quality portfolio of assets and we're going to position them for value creation. We've adjusted our mine plans, curtailed some high-cost production, have contingency plans for taking further plans, if need be. That's going well. We're completing our major projects. 
With the Cerro Verde project, that's completion of the third of 3 projects we started in 2011. And all 3 of those have done well and will be beneficial to us in the next -- in the coming years. We financially suspended our dividend. We issued $2 billion of equity in 2015. Our asset sales progress, which we commented on in some detail at our fourth quarter earnings release, is going very well. We are really encouraged by the nature of those discussions. And now we've taken steps through restructuring our management oil and gas business, taking costs cuts to align that business or corporate objectives of improving our balance sheet and reducing the -- by reducing cost approaching future investments in a different way. And so that is what we are doing and what we're all about.
In terms of cost experience in the mining business. For the first quarter, you can see on Slide 7 that we've made progress. We're down -- we achieved levels for -- that are lower than our January guidance. Consolidated $1.38. We're reducing that further as you'll see for 2016 as a year particularly strong performance in Red Conger's here with his team and the Americas where we've come in below our fourth quarter numbers and our guidance for site production and delivery costs in the Americas. And we continue to have our low-cost operations in Indonesia and Africa. Volumes were good, consistent with our guidance going into the quarter. So running fundamentals of our business is important and our guys are doing great at doing it. 
Asset transactions that we've announced to date includes the Morenci transaction and 2 smaller transactions. Good values in those. Morenci is scheduled to close in the second quarter. No hitches there, and we originally announced a transactions involving the Serbia exploration project Timok which we're getting both initial values accomplishing some strategic objectives and getting initial development going on the upper zone while we were going to take a significant interest in operational control of the potentially much, much larger lower zone. So that is going good. 
We're advancing discussions on additional transactions. Very pleased with that project. Much more confident today than we were early during the first quarter when the market was in such a concerning situation. But what we're seeing here, and we're in advanced discussions, is the scarcity of quality assets in the copper business is attracting significant interest from potential purchasers who share our longer-term positive view of the marketplace. So we're confident that we're going to achieve the goals that we set out. And beyond that, we have other opportunities that are available to us that we're not currently pursuing but in which parties have stepped up and said they're very interested in those. 
So while we don't have a specific transactions to report today, I'm telling you that we internally are very optimistic, confident that we are going to be able to go forward and meet our goals in a way that is going to be positive for our company and positive for our shareholders. The reason that we can do this is because of the portfolio of assets. We've got pictures here on Page 9 of Morenci, recently expanded, largest copper mine, very profitable in North America, very long life. Cerro Verde as we developed it had the world's largest concentrating facility. And it has ramped up very well and without the kind of typical startup issues you have in terms of cost and schedule and mechanical issues going forward. It was a big project, $4.6 billion, but lots of support from the local community in the region of Peru, great team, has gone very well. 
Grasberg, we continue to have discussions with the government of Indonesia and our contract is remarkable long-term resource. One of the industry's historically largest copper and gold reserves. And it's an asset that is very important to our portfolio, important to the government of Indonesia, important to the province of Papua. And then Tenke Fungurume is the most successful, largest mine in the copper region of Katanga and, and operating extremely well and has a long life with very significant development opportunities associated with it. 
Coming back to Grasberg. We, of course, want to refer back to the important letter that we received on October 7, when the mines minister supported the President indicated that the government would move towards branding our contract extension on terms that were consistent with our existing cap in terms of the financial aspects of it and the enforceability of it. The revised -- revisions to the regulations that were anticipated then, unfortunately have not been adopted. Instead the country is now working on revising its mining law and the related regulations. The government officials continue to express support for the position in the October 7 letter. We have agreed as part of that to divest incremental interest in PT-FI at fair market value up to 30%. Press reports out today about a government position referring to replacement cost and a lower valuation than the $17 billion valuation we submitted in January of this year. The official letter from the government did not give a valuation amount, which is in the press, but it wasn't in the letter. They refer to regulations not specifically replacement costs. 
I want to tell you that in all of our agreements with the government of Indonesia, we have indicated any divestment would be a fair market value that's consistent with our contract and that remains our position.
Slide 10 shows the Cerro Verde project. You can see how well this thing has ramped up. We began first copper in September and month by month, we've increased the throughput through our new concentrated 2 project. In March, we hit above capacity, 373,000 tons a day. A strong performance on capital cost management start up. So that was an issue for us. That was our objective a year ago, to talk to you about at this call about what we're going to do in 2015. Here's an example of how we execute.
Since we did the Phelps Dodge deal, 9 years ago now, I talked I think on every conference call about the strength of Freeport has been in our copper resources. Very large crude and reserves, very large mineralized material at our existing mine so that provide assurance of the opportunity to invest when the markets fit. And then potential that its huge, it goes beyond that. So that's what we still have and this is what's going to allow us to deal with this balance sheet issue by raising capital through property sales or otherwise and then end up with a very substantial copper resource-based company as we go forward. That's our strategy and that's -- this is the reason why we will be able to execute it effectively.
Now to show you -- and I think those of you who follow us know that we have a great copper business. Underneath all this market issue -- issues associated with oil and gas investment, this -- the company has a remarkable copper business. This has shown that by in 2015 when we're still investing in Cerro Verde still aggressively, and we had EBITDA that matched our CapEx. Going into 2016, as we were wrapping up Cerro Verde and even in lower copper prices, averaging $2.17, EBITDA substantially succeeded CapEx. And as we look forward to the year 2016 at varying copper prices, from here forward, first quarter's in the books, but if it's $2 for the rest of the year, we would have $4.6 billion of EBITDA, $2.25, it's $5.7 billion; $2.50, it's $6.8 billion; and our CapEx is only $1.8 billion and as we completed Cerro Verde and as we're continuing to invest in Grasberg underground and managing maintenance capital in a very effective way. So we've got a business that is generating substantial cash flows to help us with our financial objectives.
Now in oil and gas business. The debt level that we have of roughly $20 billion was created by the initial oil and gas investments and subsequent spending in that business on an aggressive growth profile. That was really upset by initially the fall in oil prices and then with copper prices fell, that took away the ability of the copper business to support it with its own cash flows. So that's why we're having to take this really aggressive actions now to rectify our balance sheet. 
We've got a new organizational structure in the oil and gas business. It's now being integrated into our Freeport-McMoRan corporate structure being run as an operating division as opposed to a standalone corporate entity that is -- has been done since the acquisition in 2016. This is allowing us to reduce costs. Last week, we reduced employment by roughly 25%. And we're continuing to look for ways to reduce costs. We're looking at office facilities and other cost elements. 
We're going to align the way we spend money in that business with our corporate objectives in terms of how do we generate cash flows, how do we contribute to our balance sheet improvement activities. We're winding down significant capitals of spending. We have recently completed a series of tieback wells to our production facility that's going to allow us for a period of time to maintain near term production without additional drilling. 
In the Holstein Deep area, we immediately commenced initial production just this month, some additional wells are coming on in the second quarter. As of the Horn Mountain and Marlin Tie Backs, we commenced production on the D-13 King well in the first quarter. The Québec, victory tiebacks are in progress and we have 4 additional drilled wells that are in our inventory, including Horn Mountain Deep that we're going to be able to bring on production without drilling new wells that's going to allow us to maintain production for the foreseeable future. 
And when you step back and look at these assets, the -- they're very attractive. It started with the acquisition prior to the merger of free underutilized Deepwater platforms and the Deepwater and the Gulf of Mexico. The Horn Mountain Holstein projects and Marlin. That's where our tieback activities are going. We also have interest in the nonoperating, new producing projects at Lucius and Heidelberg and a long-term development project in the Vito Area in the Mississippi Canyon. This is the structure of our business. We have specific reduction in California. But these are really good assets. 
We look for potential buyers for the business during the first quarter aggressively. The board had special financial advisors. We worked with our established bankers and canvas the market. And because of the conditions in the marketplace with low oil prices, with credit pressures on companies from the very largest through the business with a lack of credit, we just concluded at this point, that the values that might be available and avail our monetization tracks -- transactions simply didn't reflect the long-term values of these assets. And that's why we've taken the steps to restructure our business. 
We've got an operating team there that's really impressive. They're experienced. They're well recognized in the industry. They've got a great track record, and so we're very comfortable in our ability to manage this business in an effective way and realize long-term values for our business. 
Now turning to Slide 15. You can see the leverage to prices that our oil and gas business has. And at $35 Brent we had $600 million; at $45, it's $1 billion; $1.4 [ph] billion, $55; these are EBITDA numbers and $1.8 billion is $65. We've reduced CapEx for 2017 through $500 million. We do have some idled rig costs of about that amount that we're dealing with, but it is a business that is leveraged oil prices. No guarantees but there's certainly opportunities for oil prices to increase. 
We can maintain production, continue to market behind the marketplace and look for ways for contributing to our strategic objective of improving our balance sheet. We've updated our numbers as far as the outlook for 2016. This does reflect the closing of the Morenci transaction where we're selling an additional 13% interest in Morenci. And so that's the basic adjustment of our copper and other adjustments are more the nature of this typical ongoing adjustment. I'll point out that the unit cost for copper has been dropped to $1.05 consolidated. That's down from $1.10. Reflect some improvement in gold price byproduct, but also the efforts involve our team to reduce cost before byproducts. Strong production costs of $15 a barrel -- $14 a barrel from our oil business, which is down $1. 
Operating cash flows, as we've talked about earlier, at $4.8 billion, $2.25 copper. And each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year for the last 9 months of 2016 is $340 million, very [indiscernible] for us. CapEx are in line with our previous estimates. Sales profile. As we look forward to 2017, we will see copper at $4.6 billion. Those [ph] sales rising as we complete mining at the open pit at Grasberg. Molybdenum sales been adjusted for the market. And as I pointed out earlier, oil sales being maintained at the current level of close to 160 million a day.
EBITDA variations are shown and cash flow variations are shown on Slide 18, starting with EBITDA. This includes first quarter actuals and sensitivities for the remaining 9 months, averaging 2016, 2017 but at $2, it's 5 6; $2.25, 6 7; $2.50, 7 8 for EBITDA and cash flows, varying over prices going from $2 to $2.50, between roughly $3.5 billion and $5 billion. Capital expenditures are dropping, Page 19. We have cut capital in half or 2016. We're cutting it another 50% for 2017. You can see how that splits out between our oil and gas business, our major mining projects, the remaining major mining projects is the Grasberg underground development and then what we've done with maintenance capital.
I keep mentioning we're committed to improving our balance sheet. We are going to get this $20 billion debt level down. We're going to do that by running our business right, constraining cost and capital spending, and also raising capital through asset sales. The improvement in our share price and our bond trading may give us some opportunities for capital market transactions. But for the time being, we're really focus on these asset sales discussions that we're advancing. We have a very manageable near-term the debt maturity schedule. 
We have roughly $3 billion available under our $3.5 billion amended bank credit facility. We have $300 million in cash. Virtually no -- a very low maturities at least in 2016 and manageable maturities in 2017. So from a corporate standpoint, our near-term liquidity is very strong. Come back to saying we're focused on execution at a great quarter in terms of execution for -- to begin the year off with, and I'm very confident we'll continue that track record as we go forward into the year. So that's a quick overview. And I want you to run through it, so that we can have time for your questions and so Tony, I see you're first up."

To reduce capital, we've reduced the mine plans and we are reducing capital. What we have not done yet is deferred the fundamental development of our underground resources. We completed the deep MLZ extension of the DOZ mine. That's really a long-term extension from our initial blockade development beginning in the early 1980s. This is the most recent extension that was completed last year and is ramping up. The underground development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is really beneficial to the asset, beneficial to the government of Indonesia and of course, Freeport. For us to continue with that, so that when the pit is completed, roughly at the end of 2017, we would have that mine ready to begin ramp up. And so we've been very reluctant, remain very reluctant to suspend that. But that is drawn into question seriously by the -- by not having the regulations amended and getting our contract extended. We obviously, are spending that money in expectation and confidence that we will get extended and the government officials keep saying that, but have not taken the actions that are necessary in documenting that yet. Roughly 75% or more of the production from the underground is going to be realized after 2021 when our primary term ends. So we're currently engaged with the government in explaining that to them. We also have the issue there with the smelter that we've agreed to develop, provided that we get our contracts extension.

The bolt failed and it ended up shorting out about 7 of the coils, there's about 648 coils that are part of the slater. As we mentioned, we were initially able to bypass that damaged segment and we were able to run the mill fine about 5% de-rated. We've -- since that period, we've evaluated the longer-term repair and got impaired for it. And determined that we should take it down in April, which we did, just over 8 days ago. We took the mill down, we've got Siemens there to help us and we've got some other contractors. So we're just 8 days into the repair, but it's going very well. We've scheduled about 32 days of downtime for the -- for this repair, but we're pretty confident where we sit right now, that, that'll be closer to 24, 25 days. So in addition to repairing the mill, we're going to look at some of the issues. And we think we can address any of the issues that might have caused that bolt to fail in the first place. And we're also obviously, taking advantage of this downtime to do some opportunity maintenance throughout the plant."

No",516,"Well, thanks, Matthew. Well, the reality of this is and I've been through a number of these cycles and have gone through this, is that decisions to shut down mines are very complicated because of the transition costs that you incurr in having to do it. Not only is there an issue of the -- in this varies country by country depending on labor laws, but the cost of employing severances, but it also often triggers reclamation obligations and shut down obligations. Because a mine is an operating system. And when you operate that system, you're able to manage a lot of environmental issues in a particular way by the way, you process material. And once you shut it down, then you often have to come up with new systems of how to operate water flows and so forth. The -- that's one of the things we face at Sierrita. And those things are complicated. So the barriers to shut down mines that you're seeing across the industry has to do with these transition costs. And sometimes those costs are economically more significant than operating losses at marginal profitability or even losses. Now clearly the lower prices go, the more pressure will be and more shut ins you'll have. We will have some more. But for example, and sometimes it's not the entire mine, it's segments of the mine, which we did in Morenci in 2008, 2009, when we cut back our mill processing and cut back our mine rates and the crushing rock when we put on our SX/EW SX, our lead stacks. For example, we cut back El Abra by half. But the remaining half that we're operating at El Abra is profitable at these prices and at lower prices. So it's a dynamic situation. It will be driven by prices, but what we're seeing is people are really focused on costs. Now the things that I think that we're looking at in a positive way, and I was just -- you know that the market look at is what is the price of replacing the shortfall that's looming for the copper industry. I gave you numbers 10 years out, but you know that the market does not have a significant surplus balance today. Who knows what's going to happen. There's risk in the global marketplace, but there's opportunities and this thing could come back. And even today, the incentive price to develop new production and demand, we know this because we've got all of these resources, we've been studying it for years. It's going to be a very high price $3.30 to develop new resources from known resources. They're not major new discoveries. The expansion projects that are available to the industry are either expensive underground projects or projects that require low grades and lots of infrastructure development. So absence just the calamity in China or the global marketplace, I still am very positive that this copper business is going to be a great business to be in and that Freeport is really going to be a strong leader, player in that industry."

We can't live in that world. And the nature of oil production is such that you just cannot make decisions like that and preserve the reservoir, preserve the asset. So it's -- I recall back in 2008, you may have been in the meeting I had in one time that somebody just said why don't you just shut in all your North American production. The market doesn't need it, and it would balance the market and it's not -- and I answered then was, running these kinds of assets is not like managing a portfolio of stocks and bonds. You can't just sell something and get out of it. You have to manage a lot of complicated operating factors in doing it. I understand your financial analysis, the practicalities of it are that we can generate some cash to help meet our obligations that we have. We're cutting these costs aggressively now. We'll continue to do that and we'll take the actions to preserve these assets and create some incremental value over time. We're working on contingency plans now, for example, of how do we look forward in terms of drilling some of the really attractive tie back opportunities. We're not going to spend some money now, but we're going to be prepared to as markets increased to help arrest the natural decline. But the big difference in these average numbers that you talk about between California, which is a significant production and the deepwater. The deep -- the California doesn't have the decline issues that Deepwater has. And we're able to basically break even out there and preserve all of the resource by continuing to operate. If you want to try and shut in the California production with the nature of the way that it's produced, you're doing that. So the oil and gas business is in tough shape. It's just in tough shape because our plan was to have it fund its own CapEx. And they were all -- besides the acquisition, I mentioned there were all these commitments made to fund and aggressive growth project that was then, the legs were cut out of that by the drop in oil prices. And now that business has committed costs and obligations that's well over its current resources. We know that because we just tried it, we tried to sell those resources. So we've got a profitable copper business. You got to manage this oil and gas business in a different way to reduce costs, focus on how to preserve the asset because the offshore depletion will happen at some point in the future, not in the next period of time because of the success we've had in drilling. But it's a challenge. I mean I'm not going to pull any punches on it. And we're -- we've got a good team. And I'm really, really enjoying working with these guys directly at doing a great job, well respected in the industry, I know that because I talked to a lot of people outside our company about how they run the business. And we're going to find a way to get value out of his assets."

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call. 
In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we've also got Red Conger here and Mark Johnson. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our presentation materials on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for Q&A.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion or $3.35 per share for first quarter 2016. The loss included net charges totaling $4 billion or $3.19 per share, primarily for the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties, idle rig costs and other items. After adjusting for the net special items, the first quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $197 million or $0.16 per share. 
The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter approximated $873 million, and there's a reconciliation of that amount on Page 32 of our slide deck. Consolidated sales totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper during the quarter, just over 200,000 ounces of gold, 17 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.1 billion barrels of oil equivalents. 
Our realized price for copper during the first quarter was $2.17 per pound that was below last year's first quarter average of $2.72 per pound. Gold prices were slightly above last year's average. In the first quarter 2016, our gold prices averaged $1,227 per ounce and our realized price for crude oil during the first quarter of 2016 was $29 per barrel. That was significantly below last year's first quarter price of $44.54 per barrel, which included about $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts. 
We reported very good cost performance during the quarter and on track to meet or exceed our cost guidance for the year. The average cost of production net of by-product credits for our copper mines averaged $1.38 per pound in the first quarter 2016. Those were lower than last year's first quarter of $1.64. We had the benefit of volumes and also the impact of our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. The average cost of $1.38 was below the estimate we've provided in January 2016 of $1.44 per pound. 
We generated operating cash flows totaling $740 million in the first quarter, and capital expenditures were just under $1 billion, at $982 million, during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $20.8 billion in debt, and our consolidated cash was $331 million. Richard's going to be talking on this call about our efforts to reduce debt significantly and our progress on our asset sale program. We ended the quarter with availability under our revolver of totaling $3 billion at quarter end. And at the end of the quarter, we had 1.25 billion common shares outstanding. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation."

It's been a very active and encouraging quarter for us here at Freeport. We're just mailing out our Annual Report, the theme of it's proving our metal. That's the abi",3443,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. It's been a very active and encouraging quarter for us here at Freeport. We're just mailing out our Annual Report, the theme of it's proving our metal. That's the ability to face a demanding situation in a spirited and resilient way. And I can tell you our team here couldn't be approaching its work in a more positive way from that standpoint. I'm very proud of all that our team is doing. 
We have a clearly defined strategy that our board has set and we're really focused on executing it now. We experienced strong operating results in the face of weak commodity prices. And we made a lot of progress in achieving our strategic and financial objectives during this quarter. Our reported earnings were in line with our plans, actually a bit higher because we had somewhat higher copper prices during the quarter. We did have a significant additional impairment charge, which is substantially all in our oil and gas business. And we have taken recent steps to restructure that business to reduce costs and that is progressing well. 
We've got a really good operating team there and some good assets, and we're focused on attacking costs aggressively and begun to do that. We're continuing to look for opportunities to sell our monetized assets in the oil and gas business, but we're now working with -- and it is a tough market, admittedly a tough market to try to do that. But we're working with our operating team on new plans to preserve and enhance value of our assets for the future. 
With our mining business, we're performing well. The Cerro Verde startup has proceeding exceptionally well. We'll talk a bit more about that. Mining CapEx are declining as we've been talking about in the past. Volumes are increasing. Costs are being constrained, and copper prices have risen from the lows in the face of an -- admittedly uncertain global market. But there's been positive movements recently. 
We are continuing with our efforts to improve our balance sheet and have increasing confidence that we're going to be able to do that in an effective way. And after we get our balance sheet situation developed, we're going to have a -- continue to have an industry-leading copper company, and we remain very positive about its long-term fundamentals. 
With the copper market itself, the initial benefit came of course from monetary policies, policies to encourage business activity in China and a dubious position by the U.S. Fed initially created a positive -- more positive environment for copper and other commodities prices. But recent data out of China, the internal economy has been encouraging in the power grid business, automobiles, but recognize that it's a mixed situation there as construction remains subdued. But there is improved market sentiment. Short positions have been closed. Long positions have been taken, which is just a function of the marketplace. And globally, demand is improving modestly. 
So what the net of all this has been that the large anticipated surplus in the copper markets have not materialized. Companies are reducing costs as we are, and we're pleased with our progress there. There is some curtailment not as much as might be expected, but almost 800,000 tons year-to-date. But the pipeline in new supply of projects is declining as companies are deferring projects, cutting CapEx and all of this is resulting in a longer-term outlook for a very positive copper price environment. And that's what we're focused on finding a way to structure our business to take advantage of that. 
Page 5 is a slide that illustrates the theme that I've been talking about for years. Existing base production is declining. Over the next 10 years, Wood Mackenzie predicts an 18% decline in production from just under 20 million tons a year to just over 16 million tons a year. If you take very modest outlooks for global consumption growth, they use 1.7%, you end up with a shortfall of mine supply in relation to consumption of 7 million tons. Right now, Wood Mackenzie estimates that highly probable mine developments only 2 million tons. That leaves 5 million tons to be made up by other projects. The top 10 mines in the world produce about that level. So that shows the extent of the shortfall, and 1/3 of that 5 million has to come from new projects that are not considered probable today, that's over 3 million tons. That's 3 -- that's 3 Escondida's, 8 -- roughly 8 Morenci's. So there's got to be a lot of new mines developed, the [indiscernible] price even in today's world for developing new mines is the prices that are probably 50% higher than the current price. So that's why we're in the business for and we remain confident about it. 
So what are we doing right now? That's what's on everybody's mind and that's what we're focusing on. We are executing our strategy. We're going to strengthen our balance sheet. We're going to maintain a high-quality portfolio of assets, and we're going to position them for value creation. We've adjusted our mine plans, curtailed some high-cost production, have contingency plans for taking further steps, if need be. That's going well. We're completing our major projects. 
With the Cerro Verde project, that's completion of the third of 3 projects that we started in 2011. And all 3 of those have done well and will be beneficial to us in the next -- in the coming years. We financially suspended our dividend. We issued $2 billion of equity in 2015. Our asset sales progress, which we commented on in some detail at our fourth quarter earnings release, is going very well. We are really encouraged by the nature of those discussions. And now, we've taken steps through restructuring our management, oil and gas business, taking cost cuts to align that business with our corporate objectives of improving our balance sheet and reducing the -- by reducing cost approaching future investments in a different way. And so that is what we are doing and what we're all about.
In terms of costs, experience in the mining business for the first quarter, you can see on Slide 7 that we've made progress. We're down -- we achieved levels for -- lower than our January guidance. Consolidated $1.38. We're reducing that further as you'll see for 2016 as a year, particularly strong performance in Red Conger's here with his team in the Americas where we've come in below our fourth quarter numbers in our guidance for site production and delivery costs in the Americas. And we continue to have our low-cost operations in Indonesia and Africa. Volumes were good, consistent with our guidance going into the quarter. So running the fundamentals of our business is important and our guys are doing great at doing it. 
Asset transactions that we've announced to date includes the Morenci transaction and 2 smaller transactions. Good values in those. Morenci is scheduled to close in the second quarter. No hitches there. And we originally announced a transaction involving the Serbia exploration project; Timok, which we're getting both good initial values accomplishing some strategic objectives and getting initial development going on the upper zone while we were going to attain a significant interest in operational control of the potentially much, much larger lower zone. So that is going good. 
We're advancing discussions on additional transactions. Very pleased with that project. Much more confident today than we were early during the first quarter when the market was in such a concerning situation. But what we're seeing here, and we're in advanced discussions, is the scarcity of quality assets in the copper business is attracting significant interest from potential purchasers who share our longer-term positive view of the marketplace. So we're confident that we're going to able to achieve the goals that we set out. And beyond that, we have other opportunities that are available to us that we're not currently pursuing but in which parties have stepped up and said they're very interested in those. 
So while we don't have specific transactions to report today, I'm telling you that we internally are very optimistic, confident that we are going to be able to go forward and meet our goals in a way that's going to be positive for our company and positive for our investors. The reason we can do this is because of the portfolio of assets. We've got pictures here on Page 9 of Morenci, recently expanded, largest copper mine, very profitable in North America, very long life. Cerro Verde, as we developed it, had the world's largest concentrating facility. And it has ramped up very well and without the kind of typical startup issues you have in terms of cost and schedule and mechanical issues going forward. It was a big project, $4.6 billion, but lots of support from the local community in the Arequipa region of Peru, great team, has gone very well. 
Grasberg, where we continue to have discussions with the government of Indonesia on our contract, is remarkable long-term resource. One of the industry's historically largest copper and gold reserves. And it's an asset that is very important to our portfolio, important to the government of Indonesia, important to the province of Papua. And then Tenke Fungurume is the most successful, largest mine in the copper belt region of Katanga and Zambia, and operating extremely well and has a long life with very significant development opportunities associated with it. 
Coming back to Grasberg. We, of course, want to refer back to the important letter that we received on October 7, when the mines minister, with support of the President, indicated that the government would move towards branding our contract extension on terms that were consistent with our existing cap in terms of the financial aspects of it and the enforceability of it. The revised -- revisions to the regulations that were anticipated then unfortunately have not been adopted. Instead, the country is now working on revising its mining law and the related regulations. The government officials continue to express support for the position in the October 7 letter. We have agreed as part of that to divest incremental interest in PT-FI at fair market value up to 30%. Press reports out today about a government position referring to replacement cost and a lower valuation than the $17 billion valuation we submitted in January of this year. The official letter from the government did not give a valuation amount, which in the press, but it wasn't in the letter. They refer to regulations not specifically replacement costs. 
I want to tell you that in all of our agreements with the government of Indonesia, we have indicated any divestment would be a fair market value that's consistent with our contract and that remains our position.
Slide 10 shows the Cerro Verde project. You can just see how well this thing has ramped up. We began first copper in September and month by month, we've increased the throughput through our new concentrated 2 project. In March, we hit above capacity, 373,000 tons a day. A strong performance on capital cost management startup. So that was an issue for us. That was our objective a year ago, to talk to you about at this call about what we're going to do in 2015. Here's an example of how we execute.
Since we did the Phelps Dodge deal 9 years ago now, I talked I think on every conference call about the strength of Freeport has been in our copper resources, very large crude and probable reserves, very large mineralized material at our existing mines that provide assurance of the opportunity to invest when the markets fit. And then potential that is huge, it goes beyond that. So that's what we still have and this is what's going to allow us to deal with this balance sheet issue by raising capital through property sales or otherwise and then end up with a very substantial copper resource-based company as we go forward. That's our strategy and that's -- this is the reason why we will be able to execute it effectively.
Now to show you -- and I think those of you who follow us know we've got a great copper business. Underneath all this market issue -- issues associated with oil and gas investment, this -- the company has a remarkable copper business. This has shown that by in 2015 when we're still investing in Cerro Verde still aggressively and we had EBITDA that matched our CapEx. Going into 2016, as we were wrapping up Cerro Verde and even in lower copper prices, averaging $2.17, EBITDA substantially exceeded CapEx. And as we look forward to the year 2016 at varying copper prices, from here forward, first quarter's in the books. But if it's $2 for the rest of the year, we would have $4.6 billion of EBITDA; $2.25, it's $5.7 billion; $2.50, it's $6.8 billion. And our CapEx is only $1.8 billion as we completed Cerro Verde and as we're continuing to invest in Grasberg underground and managing maintenance capital in a very effective way. So we've got a business that is generating substantial cash flows to help us with our financial objectives.
Now in the oil and gas business. The debt level that we have of roughly $20 billion was created by the initial oil and gas investments and subsequent spending in that business on an aggressive growth profile. That was really upset by initially the fall in oil prices and then when copper prices fell, that took away the ability of the copper business to support it with its own cash flows. So that's why we're having to take this really aggressive actions now to rectify our balance sheet. 
We've got a new organizational structure in the oil and gas business. It's now being integrated into our Freeport-McMoRan corporate structure being run as an operating division as opposed to a standalone corporate entity that is -- has been done since the acquisition in 2013. This is allowing us to reduce costs. Last week, we reduced employment by roughly 25%. And we're continuing to look for ways to reduce costs. We're looking at office facilities and other cost elements. 
We're going to align the way we spend money in that business with our corporate objectives in terms of how do we generate cash flows, how do we contribute to our balance sheet improvement activities. We're winding down significant capitals of spending. We have recently completed a series of tieback wells to our production facility that's going to allow us for a period of time to maintain near-term production without additional drilling. 
In the Holstein Deep area, we've commenced initial production just this month; 2 additional wells are coming on in the second quarter. And Horn Mountain and Marlin tiebacks, we commenced production on the D-13 King well in the first quarter. The Kilo/Oscar, Quebec/Victory tiebacks are in progress. And we have 4 additional drilled wells that are in our inventory, including Horn Mountain Deep that we're going to be able to bring on production without drilling new wells that's going to allow us to maintain production for the foreseeable future. 
And when you step back and look at these assets, the -- they're very attractive. It started with the acquisition prior to the merger of free underutilized deepwater platforms in the Deepwater to Gulf of Mexico, the Horn Mountain, Holstein projects and Marlin. That's where our tieback activities are going. We also have interest in the nonoperating new producing projects at Lucius and Heidelberg and a long-term development project in the Vito area in Mississippi Canyon. This is the structure of our business. We have significant  production in California. But these are really good assets. 
We looked for potential buyers for the business during the first quarter aggressively. The board had special financial advisers. We worked with our established bankers and canvas the market. And because of the conditions in the marketplace, with low oil prices, with credit pressures on the companies from the very largest through the business with a lack of credit, we just concluded at this point that the values that might be available and sale [ph] of monetization tracks -- transactions simply didn't reflect the long-term value of these assets. And that's why we've taken the steps to restructure our business. 
We've got an operating team there that's really impressive. They're experienced. They're well recognized in the industry. They've got a great track record. And so we're very comfortable of our ability to manage this business in an effective way and realize long-term values for our business. 
Now turning to Slide 15. You can see the leverage to prices that our oil and gas business has. And at $35 Brent, we have $600 million; at $45, it's $1 billion; $1.4 billion at $55; these are EBITDA numbers and $1.8 billion at $65. We've reduced CapEx for 2017 to $500 million. We do have some idled rig costs of about that amount that we're dealing with, but it is a business that is leveraged to oil prices. No guarantees, but there's certainly opportunities oil prices to increase. 
We can maintain production, continue to mark the marketplace and look for ways of contributing to our strategic objective of improving our balance sheet. We've updated our numbers for the outlook for 2016. This does reflect the closing of the Morenci transaction where we're selling an additional 13% interest in Morenci. And so that's the basic adjustment for copper, and other adjustments are more in the nature of this typical ongoing adjustments. I'll point out that the unit cost for copper has been dropped to $1.05 consolidated. That's down from a $1.10. Reflect some improvement in gold price byproduct, but also the efforts involve our team to reduced cost before byproducts. Strong production costs of $15 a barrel -- $14 a barrel from our oil business, which is down $1. 
Operating cash flows, as we've talked about earlier, at $4.8 billion, $2.25 copper. And each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year, the last 9 months of 2016 is $340 million variance for us. CapEx are in line with our previous estimates.
Sales profile. As we look forward to 2017, we will see copper at $4.6 billion. Gold sales rising as we complete mining the open pit at Grasberg. Molybdenum sales have been adjusted for the market. And as I pointed out earlier, oil sales being maintained at the current level of close to 160 million a day.
EBITDA variations are shown and cash flow variations are shown on Slide 18, starting with EBITDA. This includes first quarter actuals and sensitivities for the remaining 9 months, averaging 2016/2017, but at $2, it's $5 billion, $6 billion; $2.25, $6 billion, $7 billion; $2.50, $7 billion, $8 billion for EBITDA. And cash flows varying over prices going from $2 to $2.50 between roughly $3.5 billion and $5 billion. Capital expenditures are dropping. Page 19. We have cut capital in half for 2016. We're cutting it another 50% for 2017. You can see how that splits out between our oil and gas business, our major mining projects, the remaining major mining projects is the Grasberg underground development and then what we're doing with maintenance capital.
I keep mentioning we're committed to improving our balance sheet. We are going to get this $20 billion debt level down. We're going to do that by running our business right, constraining cost and capital spending and also raising capital through asset sales. The improvement in our share price and our bond trading may give us some opportunities for capital market transactions. But for the time being, we're really focused on these asset sales discussions that we're advancing. We have a very manageable near-term debt maturity schedule. 
We have roughly $3 billion available under our $3.5 billion amended bank credit facility. We have $300 million in cash, virtually no -- a very low maturities at least in 2016 and manageable maturities in 2017. So from a corporate standpoint, our near-term liquidity is very strong. Come back to saying we're focused on execution, had a great quarter in terms of execution for -- to begin the year off with, and I'm very confident we'll continue that track record as we go forward into the year. So that's a quick overview. And I want you to run through it so that we can have time for your questions. And so Tony, I see you're first up."

To reduce capital, we've revised the mine plans and we are reducing capital. What we have not done yet is defer the fundamental development of our underground resources. We completed the deep MLZ extension of the DOZ mine. That's really a long-term extension from our initial blockade development beginning in the early 1980s. This is the most recent major extension on that, that was completed last year and is ramping up. The underground development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is really beneficial to the asset, beneficial to government of Indonesia and of course, Freeport. For us to continue with that, so that when the pit is completed roughly at the end of 2017, we would have that mine ready to begin ramp up. And so we've been very reluctant, remain very reluctant to suspend that. But that is drawn into question seriously by the -- by not having the regulations amended and getting our contract extended. We obviously are spending that money in expectation and confidence that we will get extended and the government officials keep saying that, but have not taken the actions that are necessary documented yet. Roughly 75% or more of the production from the underground is going to be realized after 2021 when our primary term ends. So we're currently engaged with the government in explaining that to them. We also have the issue there with the smelter that we've agreed to develop, provided we get our contract extension. And we're unable to spend substantial money on advancing the smelter project without having contract extended. So that's the big issues we face. Discussions are ongoing as we speak. And our board is considering what actions we should take for it.
With respect to the mill issue, Mark, why don't I let you explain that briefly."

We've -- since that period, we've evaluated the longer-term repair and got prepared for it and determined that we should take it down in April, which we did. Just over 8 days ago, we took the mill down, we've got Siemens there to help with some other contractors. So we're just 8 days into the repair, but it's going very well. We've scheduled about 32 days of downtime for the -- for this repair, but we're pretty confident where we sit right now that, that will be closer to 24, 25 days. So in addition to repairing the mill, we're going to look at some of the issues. And we think we can address any of the issues that might have caused that bolt to fail in the first place.

I mean, the realities of this is and I've been through a number of these cycles and have gone through this is that decisions to shut down mines are very complicated because of the transition costs that you incur in having to do it. Not only is there an issue of the, and this varies country by country depending on labor laws, but the cost of employee severances, but it also often triggers reclamation obligations and shutdown obligations. Because a mine is an operating system and when you operate that system, you're able to manage a lot of environmental issues in a particular way by the way you process material. And once you shut it down, then you often have to come up with new systems of how to operate water flows and so forth. The -- that's one of the things we faced at Sierrita and those are complicated. So the barriers to shut down mines that you're seeing across the industry have to do with these transition costs. And sometimes those costs are economically more significant than operating losses at marginal profitability or even losses. Now clearly, the lower prices go, the more pressure will be and the more shut-ins you'll have. We would have some more. But for example, at our -- and sometimes it's not the entire mine, it's segments of the mine, which we did in Morenci in 2008, 2009 when we cut back our mill processing and cut back our mine rates and the crushing rock we would put on our SX/EW, our lead stacks. For example, we would cut back El Abra by half, but the remaining half that we're operating at El Abra is profitable at these prices and at lower prices. So it's a dynamic situation. It will be driven by prices, but what we're seeing is people are really focused on costs. Now the thing that I think that we're looking at in a positive way and I was just -- you know that the market looks at is what is the price of replacing the shortfall that's looming for the copper industry. I gave you numbers 10 years out, but you know that the market does not have a significant surplus balance today. Who knows what's going to happen. There's risk in the global marketplace, but there's opportunities. And this thing could come back. And even today, the incentive price to develop new production, and man, we know this because we've got all these resources, we've been studying it for years, it's going to take a very high price, $3, $3.30, to develop new resources from known resources. They're not major new discoveries. The expansion projects that are available to the industry are either expensive underground projects or projects that require low grades and lots of infrastructure development. So absent just the calamity in China or the global marketplace, I still am very positive that this copper business is going to be a great business to be in and that Freeport is going to be a really strong leader, player in that industry."

Or put a different way, a $0.09 upswing in the copper price would give you as much cash flow as oil and gas had in the March quarter admittedly, probably at the bottom of the oil price we all hope. Do you think it's worth you just shutting in all the oil and gas output and preserving the resource and waiting for a better day after the market gives us $0.25 of upside on copper?"

We can't live in that world. And the nature of oil production is such that you just cannot make decisions like that and preserve the reservoir, preserve the asset. So it's -- I recall back in 2008, you may have been at a meeting. I had, one time, when somebody said, why don't you just shut in all your North American production. The market doesn't need it and it would balance the market and it's not -- and my answer then was, running these kinds of assets is not like managing a portfolio of stocks and bonds. You can't just sell something and get out of it. You have to manage a lot of complicated operating factors in doing it. I understand your financial analysis, the practicalities of it are that we can generate some cash to help meet our obligations that we have. We're cutting these costs aggressively now. We'll continue to do that and we'll take the actions to preserve these assets and create some incremental value over time. We're working on contingency plans now, for example, of how do we look forward in terms of drilling some of the really attractive tie back opportunities. We're not going to spend some money now, but we're going to be prepared to as markets increased to help arrest the natural decline. There's a big difference in these average numbers that you talk about between California, which is a significant production, and the Deepwater. The deep -- the California doesn't have the decline issues that the Deepwater has and we're able to basically break even out there and preserve all of the resource by continuing to operate. If you were to try to shut in that California production with the nature of the way that it's produced, you're doing that. So the oil and gas business is in tough shape. It's just in tough shape because our plan was to have it fund its own CapEx. And they were all -- besides the acquisition, I mentioned there were all these commitments made to fund an aggressive growth project. That was then, the legs were cut out of that by the drop in oil prices. And now that business has committed costs and obligations that's well over its current resources. We know that because we just tried to sell those resources. So we've got a profitable copper business. You've got to manage this oil and gas business in a different way to reduce costs, focus on how to preserve the asset because an offshore depletion will happen at some point in the future, not in the next period of time because of the success we've had in drilling. But it's a challenge. I mean, I'm not going to pull any punches on it. And we're -- but we've got a good team. I'm really, really enjoying getting to work with these guys directly. They're doing a great job, they're well respected in the industry. I know that because I talk to a lot of people outside our company about how they run their business. And we're going to find a way to get value out of these assets."

I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we've also got Red Conger here and Mark Johnson. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our presentation materials on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for Q&A.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion or $3.35 per share for first quarter 2016. The loss included net charges totaling $4 billion or $3.19 per share, primarily for the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties, idle rig costs and other items. After adjusting for the net special items, the first quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $197 million or $0.16 per share.  The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter approximated $873 million, and there's a reconciliation of that amount on Page 32 of our slide deck. Consolidated sales totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper during the quarter, just over 200,000 ounces of gold, 17 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.1 billion barrels of oil equivalents. 
Our realized price for copper during the first quarter was $2.17 per pound. That was below last year's first quarter average of $2.72 per pound. Gold prices were slightly above last year's average. In the first quarter 2016, our gold prices averaged $1,227 per ounce and our realized price for crude oil during the first quarter of 2016 was $29 per barrel. That was significantly below last year's first quarter price of $44.54 per barrel, which included about $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts. 
We reported very good cost performance during the quarter and are on track to meet or exceed our cost guidance for the year. The average cost of production net of by-product credits for our copper mines averaged $1.38 per pound in the first quarter 2016. Those were lower than last year's first quarter of $1.64. We had the benefit of volumes and also the impact of our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. The average cost of $1.38 was below the estimate we provided in January 2016 of $1.44 per pound. 
We generated operating cash flows totaling $740 million in the first quarter, and capital expenditures were just under $1 billion, at $982 million, during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $20.8 billion in debt, and our consolidated cash was $331 million. Richard's going to be talking on this call about our efforts to reduce debt significantly and our progress on our asset sale program. We ended the quarter with availability under our revolver of totaling $3 billion at quarter end. And at the end of the quarter, we had 1.25 billion common shares outstanding. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation."

It's been a very active and encouraging quarter for us here at Freeport. We're just mailing out our Annual Report, the theme of it's proving our metal. That's the abi",3439,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. It's been a very active and encouraging quarter for us here at Freeport. We're just mailing out our Annual Report, the theme of it's proving our metal. That's the ability to face a demanding situation in a spirited and resilient way. And I can tell you our team here couldn't be approaching its work in a more positive way from that standpoint. I'm very proud of all that our team is doing. 
We have a clearly defined strategy that our board has set and we're really focused on executing it now. We experienced strong operating results in the face of weak commodity prices. And we made a lot of progress in achieving our strategic and financial objectives during this quarter. Our reported earnings were in line with our plans, actually a bit higher because we had somewhat higher copper prices during the quarter. We did have a significant additional impairment charge, which is substantially all in our oil and gas business. And we have taken recent steps to restructure that business to reduce costs and that is progressing well. 
We've got a really good operating team there and some good assets, and we're focused on attacking costs aggressively and begun to do that. We're continuing to look for opportunities to sell our monetized assets in the oil and gas business, but we're now working with -- and it is a tough market, admittedly a tough market to try to do that. But we're working with our operating team on new plans to preserve and enhance value of our assets for the future.  With our mining business, we're performing well. The Cerro Verde startup has proceeding exceptionally well. We'll talk a bit more about that. Mining CapEx are declining as we've been talking about in the past. Volumes are increasing. Costs are being constrained, and copper prices have risen from the lows in the face of an -- admittedly uncertain global market. But there's been positive movements recently. 
We are continuing with our efforts to improve our balance sheet and have increasing confidence that we're going to be able to do that in an effective way. And after we get our balance sheet situation developed, we're going to have a -- continue to have an industry-leading copper company, and we remain very positive about its long-term fundamentals. With the copper market itself, the initial benefit came of course from monetary policies, policies to encourage business activity in China and a dubious position by the U.S. Fed initially created a positive -- more positive environment for copper and other commodities prices. But recent data out of China, the internal economy has been encouraging in the power grid business, automobiles, but recognize that it's a mixed situation there as construction remains subdued. But there is improved market sentiment. Short positions have been closed. Long positions have been taken, which is just a function of the marketplace. And globally, demand is improving modestly. 
So what the net of all this has been that the large anticipated surplus in the copper markets have not materialized. Companies are reducing costs as we are, and we're pleased with our progress there. Been some curtailment, not as much as might be expected, but almost 800,000 tons year-to-date. But the pipeline in new supply of projects is declining as companies are deferring projects, cutting CapEx and all of this is resulting in a longer-term outlook for a very positive copper price environment. And that's what we're focused on finding a way to structure our business to take advantage of that. 
Page 5 is a slide that illustrates the theme that I've been talking about for years. Existing base production is declining. Over the next 10 years, Wood Mackenzie predicts an 18% decline in production from just under 20 million tons a year to just over 16 million tons a year. If you take very modest outlooks for global consumption growth, they use 1.7%, you end up with a shortfall of mine supply in relation to consumption of 7 million tons. Right now, Wood Mackenzie estimates that highly probable mine developments only 2 million tons. That leaves 5 million tons to be made up by other projects. The top 10 mines in the world produce about that level. So that shows the extent of the shortfall, and 1/3 of that 5 million has to come from new projects that are not considered probable today, that's over 3 million tons. That's 3 -- that's 3 Escondidas, 8 -- roughly 8 Morencis. So there's got to be a lot of new mines developed, an incentive price even in today's world for developing new mines is at prices that are probably 50% higher than the current price. So that's why we're in the business for and we remain confident about it. 
So what are we doing right now? That's what's on everybody's mind and that's what we're focusing on. We are executing our strategy. We're going to strengthen our balance sheet. We're going to maintain a high-quality portfolio of assets, and we're going to position them for value creation. We've adjusted our mine plans, curtailed some high-cost production, have contingency plans for taking further steps, if need be. That's going well. We're completing our major projects. 
With the Cerro Verde project, that's completion of the third of 3 projects that we started in 2011. And all 3 of those have gone well and will be beneficial to us in the next -- in the coming years. We financially suspended our dividend. We issued $2 billion of equity in 2015. Our asset sales progress, which we commented on in some detail at our fourth quarter earnings release, is going very well. We are really encouraged by the nature of those discussions. And now, we've taken steps through restructuring our management, oil and gas business, taking cost cuts to align that business with our corporate objectives of improving our balance sheet and reducing -- by reducing cost approaching future investments in a different way. And so that is what we are doing and what we're all about.
In terms of costs, experience in the mining business for the first quarter, you can see on Slide 7 that we've made progress. We're down -- we achieved levels for -- lower than our January guidance, at consolidated $1.38. We're reducing that further as you'll see for 2016 as a year, particularly strong performance in Red Conger's here with his team in the Americas where we've come in below our fourth quarter numbers in our guidance for site production and delivery costs in the Americas. And we continue to have our low-cost operations in Indonesia and Africa. Volumes were good, consistent with our guidance going into the quarter. So running the fundamentals of our business is important and our guys are doing great doing it. 
Asset transactions that we've announced to date includes the Morenci transaction and 2 smaller transactions. Good values in those. Morenci is scheduled to close in the second quarter. No hitches there. And we originally announced a transaction involving the Serbia exploration project Timok, which we're getting both good initial values accomplishing some strategic objectives and getting initial development going on the upper zone while we were going to attain a significant interest in operational control of the potentially much, much larger lower zone. So that is going good. 
We're advancing discussions on additional transactions. Very pleased with that project. Much more confident today than we were early during the first quarter when the market was in such a concerning situation. But what we're seeing here, and we're in advanced discussions, is the scarcity of quality assets in the copper business is attracting significant interest from potential purchasers who share our longer-term positive view of the marketplace. So we're confident that we're going to able to achieve the goals that we set out. And beyond that, we have other opportunities that are available to us that we're not currently pursuing but in which parties have stepped up and said they're very interested in those.  So while we don't have specific transactions to report today, I'm telling you that we internally are very optimistic, confident that we're going to be able to go forward and meet our goals in a way that's going to be positive for our company and positive for our investors. 
The reason we can do this is because of the portfolio of assets. We've got pictures here on Page 9 of Morenci, recently expanded, largest copper mine, very profitable in North America, very long life. Cerro Verde, as we developed it, had the world's largest concentrating facility. And it has ramped up very well and without the kind of typical startup issues you have in terms of cost and schedule and mechanical issues going forward. It was a big project, $4.6 billion, but lots of support from the local community in the Arequipa region of Peru, great team, has gone very well. 
Grasberg, where we continue to have discussions with the government of Indonesia on our contract, is remarkable long-term resource. One of the industry's historically largest copper and gold reserves. And it's an asset that is very important to our portfolio, important to the government of Indonesia, important to the province of Papua. And then Tenke Fungurume is the most successful, largest mine in the copper belt region of Katanga and Zambia, and operating extremely well and has a long life with very significant development opportunities associated with it. 
Coming back to Grasberg. We, of course, want to refer back to the important letter that we received on October 7, when the mines minister, with support of the President, indicated that the government would move towards granting our contract extension on terms that were consistent with our existing cap in terms of the financial aspects of it and the enforceability of it. The revised -- revisions to the regulations that were anticipated then unfortunately have not been adopted. Instead, the country is now working on revising its mining law and the related regulations. The government officials continued to express support for the position in the October 7 letter. We have agreed as part of that to divest incremental interest in PT-FI at fair market value up to 30%. Press reports out today about a government position referring to replacement cost and a lower valuation than the $17 billion valuation we submitted in January of this year. The official letter from the government did not give a valuation amount, it was in the press, but it wasn't in the letter. They referred to regulations, not specifically replacement cost.  I want to tell you that in all of our agreements with the government of Indonesia, we have indicated any divestment would be a fair market value that's consistent with our contract and that remains our position.
Slide 10 shows the Cerro Verde project. You can just see how well this thing has ramped up. We began first copper in September and month by month, we've increased the throughput through our new concentrator 2 project. In March, we hit above capacity, 373,000 tons a day. A strong performance on capital cost management startup. So that was an issue for us. That was our objective a year ago, to talk to you about at this call about what we're going to do in 2015 [sic] (2016). Here's an example of how we execute.
Since we did the Phelps Dodge deal 9 years ago now, I talked I think on every conference call about the strength of Freeport has been in our copper resources, very large crude and probable reserves, very large mineralized material at our existing mines that provide assurance of the opportunity to invest when the markets fit. And then potential that is huge, that goes beyond that. So that's what we still have and this is what's going to allow us to deal with this balance sheet issue by raising capital through property sales or otherwise and then end up with a very substantial copper resource-based company as we go forward. That's our strategy and that's -- this is the reason why we will be able to execute it effectively.
Now to show you -- and I think those of you who follow us know we've got a great copper business. Underneath all this market issue and issues associated with oil and gas investment, this -- the company has a remarkable copper business. This has shown that by in 2015 when we're still investing in Cerro Verde still aggressively and we had EBITDA that matched our CapEx. Going into 2016, as we were wrapping up Cerro Verde and even lower copper prices, averaging $2.17, EBITDA substantially exceeded CapEx. And as we look forward to the year 2016 at varying copper prices, from here forward, first quarter's in the books. But if it's $2 for the rest of the year, we would have $4.6 billion of EBITDA; $2.25, it's $5.7 billion; $2.50, it's $6.8 billion. And our CapEx is only $1.8 billion as we've completed Cerro Verde and as we're continuing to invest in Grasberg underground and managing maintenance capital in a very effective way. So we've got a business that is generating substantial cash flows to help us with our financial objectives.
Now in the oil and gas business. The debt level that we have of roughly $20 billion was created by the initial oil and gas investments and subsequent spending in that business on an aggressive growth profile. That was really upset by initially the fall in oil prices and then when copper prices fell, that took away the ability of the copper business to support it with its own cash flows. So that's why we're having to take these really aggressive actions now to rectify our balance sheet.  We've got a new organizational structure in the oil and gas business. It's now being integrated into our Freeport-McMoRan corporate structure being run as an operating division as opposed to a standalone corporate entity that is -- has been done since the acquisition in 2013. This is allowing us to reduce costs. Last week, we reduced employment by roughly 25%. And we're continuing to look for ways to reduce costs, through looking at office facilities and other cost elements. 
We're going to align the way we spend money in that business with our corporate objectives in terms of how do we generate cash flows, how do we contribute to our balance sheet improvement activities. We're winding down significant capital spending. We have recently completed a series of tieback wells to our production facility that's going to allow us for a period of time to maintain near-term production without additional drilling. 
In the Holstein Deep area, we've commenced initial production just this month; 2 additional wells are coming on in second quarter. And Horn Mountain and Marlin tiebacks, we commenced production on the D-13 King well in the first quarter. The Kilo/Oscar, Quebec/Victory tiebacks are in progress. And we have 4 additional drilled wells that are in our inventory, including Horn Mountain Deep that we're going to be able to bring on production without drilling new wells that's going to allow us to maintain production for the foreseeable future. 
And when you step back and look at these assets, the -- they're very attractive. It started with the acquisition prior to the merger of 3 underutilized deepwater platforms in the Deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, the Horn Mountain, Holstein projects and Marlin. That's where our tieback activities are going. We also have interest in the nonoperating new producing projects at Lucius and Heidelberg and a long-term development project in the Vito area in Mississippi Canyon. This is the structure of our business. We have significant  production in California. But these are really good assets. 
We looked for potential buyers for the business during the first quarter aggressively. The board had special financial advisers. We worked with our established bankers and canvassed the market. And because of the conditions in the marketplace, with low oil prices, with credit pressures on the companies from the very largest through the business with a lack of credit, we just concluded at this point that the values that might be available in sale [ph] or monetization transactions simply didn't reflect the long-term value of these assets. And that's why we've taken the steps to restructure our business.  We've got an operating team there that's really impressive. They're experienced. They're well recognized in the industry. They've got a great track record. And so we're very comfortable of our ability to manage this business in an effective way and realize long-term values for our business. 
Now turning to Slide 15. You can see the leverage to prices that our oil and gas business has. And at $35 Brent, we have $600 million; at $45, it's $1 billion; $1.4 billion, it's $55; these are EBITDA numbers and $1.8 billion, it's $65. We've reduced CapEx for 2017 to $500 million. We do have some idled rig costs of about that amount that we're dealing with, but it is a business that is leveraged to oil prices. No guarantees, but there's certainly opportunities oil prices to increase. 
We can maintain production, continue to mark the marketplace and look for ways of contributing to our strategic objective of improving our balance sheet. We've updated our numbers for the outlook for 2016. This does reflect the closing of the Morenci transaction where we're selling an additional 13% interest in Morenci. And so that's the basic adjustment for copper, and other adjustments are more in the nature of just typical ongoing adjustments. I'll point out that the unit cost for copper has been dropped to $1.05 consolidated. That's down from a $1.10. Reflect some improvement in gold price byproduct, but also the efforts involve our team to reduced cost before byproducts. Strong production costs of $15 a barrel -- $14 a barrel from our oil business, which is down $1.  Operating cash flows, as we've talked about earlier, at $4.8 billion, $2.25 copper. And each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year, the last 9 months of 2016 is $340 million variance for us. CapEx are in line with our previous estimates. Sales -- as we look forward to 2017, we will see copper at $4.6 billion. Gold sales rising as we complete mining the open pit at Grasberg. Molybdenum sales have been adjusted for the market. And as I pointed out earlier, oil sales being maintained at the current level of close to 160 million a day.
EBITDA variations are shown and cash flow variations are shown on Slide 18, starting with EBITDA. This includes first quarter actuals and sensitivities for the remaining 9 months, averaging 2016/2017, but at $2, it's $5 billion, $6 billion; $2.25, $6 billion, $7 billion; $2.50, $7 billion, $8 billion for EBITDA. And cash flows varying over prices going from $2 to $2.50 between roughly $3.5 billion to $5 billion. 
Capital expenditures are dropping. Page 19. We have cut capital in half for 2016. We're cutting it another 50% for 2017. You can see how that splits out between our oil and gas business, our major mining projects, the remaining major mining projects is the Grasberg underground development and then what we're doing with maintenance capital.
I keep mentioning we're committed to improving our balance sheet. We are going to get this $20 billion debt level down. We're going to do that by running our business right, constraining cost and capital spending and also raising capital through asset sales. The improvement in our share price and our bond trading may give us some opportunities for capital market transactions. But for the time being, we're really focused on these asset sales discussions that we're advancing. We have a very manageable near-term debt maturity schedule. We have roughly $3 billion available under our $3.5 billion amended bank credit facility. We have $300 million in cash, virtually no -- a very low maturities at least in 2016 and manageable maturities in 2017. So from a corporate standpoint, our near-term liquidity is very strong. Come back to saying we're focused on execution, had a great quarter in terms of execution for -- to begin the year off with, and I'm very confident we'll continue that track record as we go forward into the year. 
So that's a quick overview. And I want you to run through it so that we can have time for your questions. And so, Tony, I see you're first up."

To reduce capital, we've revised the mine plans and we are reducing capital. What we have not done yet is defer the fundamental development of our underground resources. We completed the deep MLZ extension of the DOZ mine. That's really a long-term extension from our initial blockade development beginning in the early 1980s. This is the most recent major extension on that, that was completed last year and is ramping up. The underground development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is really beneficial to the asset, beneficial to government of Indonesia and of course, Freeport. For us to continue with that, so that when the pit is completed roughly at the end of 2017, we would have that mine ready to begin ramp up. And so we've been very reluctant, remain very reluctant to suspend that. But that is drawn into question seriously by the -- by not having the regulations amended and getting our contract extended. We obviously are spending that money in expectation and confidence that we will get extended and the government officials keep saying that, but have not taken the actions that are necessary to document it yet. Roughly 75% or more of the production from the underground is going to be realized after 2021 when our primary term ends. So we're currently engaged with the government in explaining that to them. We also have the issue there with the smelter that we've agreed to develop, provided we get our contract extension. And we're unable to spend substantial money on advancing the smelter project without having contract extended. So that's the big issues we face. Discussions are ongoing as we speak. And our board is considering what actions we should take for it. With respect to the mill issue, Mark, why don't I let you explain that briefly."

We've -- since that period, we've evaluated the longer-term repair and got prepared for it and determined that we should take it down in April, which we did. Just over 8 days ago, we took the mill down, we've got Siemens there to help us, some other contractors. So we're just 8 days into the repair, but it's going very well. We've scheduled about 32 days of downtime for the -- for this repair, but we're pretty confident where we sit right now that, that'll be closer to 24, 25 days.

I mean, the realities of this is and I've been through a number of these cycles and have gone through this is that decisions to shut down mines are very complicated because of the transition costs that you incur in having to do it. Not only is there an issue of the, and this varies country by country depending on labor laws, but the cost of employee severances, but it also often triggers reclamation obligations and shutdown obligations. Because a mine is an operating system and when you operate that system, you're able to manage a lot of environmental issues in a particular way by the way you process material. And once you shut it down, then you often have to come up with new systems of how to operate water flows and so forth. The -- that's one of the things we faced at Sierrita and those are complicated. So the barriers to shut down mines that you're seeing across the industry have to do with these transition costs. And sometimes those costs are economically more significant than operating losses at marginal profitability or even losses. Now clearly, the lower prices go, the more pressure will be and the more shut-ins you'll have. We would have some more. But for example, at our -- and sometimes it's not the entire mine, it's segments of the mine, which we did in Morenci in 2008, 2009 when we cut back our mill processing and cut back our mine rates and the crushing rock we would put on our SX/EW stacks, our lead stacks. For example, we would cut back El Abra by half, but the remaining half that we're operating at El Abra is profitable at these prices and at lower prices. So it's a dynamic situation. It will be driven by prices, but what we're seeing is people are really focused on costs. Now the thing that I think that we're looking at in a positive way and I would suggest you know that the market looks at is what is the price of replacing the shortfall that's looming for the copper industry. I gave you numbers 10 years out, but you know that the market does not have a significant surplus balance today. Who knows what's going to happen. There's risk in the global marketplace, but there's opportunities. And this thing could come back. And even today, the incentive price to develop new production, and man, we know this because we've got all these resources, we've been studying it for years, it's going to take a very high price, $3, $3.30, to develop new resources from known resources. They're not major new discoveries. The expansion projects that are available to the industry are either expensive underground projects or projects that require low grades and lots of infrastructure development. So absent just a calamity in China or the global marketplace, I still am very positive that this copper business is going to be a great business to be in and that Freeport is going to be a really strong leader, player in that industry."

And so one thing we're looking is how can we do transactions that retain that ability for Freeport to create value?

We can't live in that world. And the nature of oil production is such that you just cannot make decisions like that and preserve the reservoir, preserve the asset. So it's -- I recall back in 2008, you may have been at a meeting I had one time, when somebody said, why don't you just shut in all your North American production. The market doesn't need it and it would balance the market and it's not -- and my answer then was, running these kinds of assets is not like managing a portfolio of stocks and bonds. You can't just sell something and get out of it. You have to manage a lot of complicated operating factors in doing it. I understand your financial analysis, the practicalities of it are that we can generate some cash to help meet our obligations that we have. We're cutting these costs aggressively now. We'll continue to do that and we'll take the actions to preserve these assets and create some incremental value over time. We're working on contingency plans now, for example, of how do we look forward in terms of drilling some of the really attractive tie back opportunities. We're not going to spend some money now, but we're going to be prepared to as markets increased to help arrest the natural decline. There's a big difference in these average numbers that you talk about between California, which is a significant production, and the Deepwater. The deep -- the California doesn't have the decline issues that the Deepwater has and we're able to basically break even out there and preserve all of the resource by continuing to operate. If you were to try to shut in that California production with the nature of the way that it's produced, you're doing that. So the oil and gas business is in tough shape. It's just in tough shape because our plan was to have it fund its own CapEx. And they were all -- besides the acquisition, I mentioned there were all these commitments made to fund an aggressive growth project. That was then, the legs were cut out of that by the drop in oil prices. And now that business has committed costs and obligations that's well over its current resources. We know that because we just tried to sell those resources. So we've got a profitable copper business. You've got to manage this oil and gas business in a different way to reduce costs, focus on how to preserve the asset because an offshore depletion will happen at some point in the future, not in the next period of time because of the success we've had in drilling. But it's a challenge. I mean, I'm not going to pull any punches on it. And we're -- but we've got a good team. I'm really, really enjoying getting to work with these guys directly. They're doing a great job, they're well respected in the industry. I know that because I talk to a lot of people outside our company about how they run their business. And we're going to find a way to get value out of these assets."

I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we've also got Red Conger here and Mark Johnson. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our presentation materials on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for Q&A.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion or $3.35 per share for first quarter 2016. The loss included net charges totaling $4 billion or $3.19 per share, primarily for the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties, idle rig costs and other items. After adjusting for the net special items, the first quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $197 million or $0.16 per share. The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter approximated $873 million, and there's a reconciliation of that amount on Page 32 of our slide deck. Consolidated sales totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper during the quarter, just over 200,000 ounces of gold, 17 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.1 billion barrels of oil equivalents. 
Our realized price for copper during the first quarter was $2.17 per pound. That was below last year's first quarter average of $2.72 per pound. Gold prices were slightly above last year's average. In the first quarter 2016, our gold prices averaged $1,227 per ounce and our realized price for crude oil during the first quarter of 2016 was $29 per barrel. That was significantly below last year's first quarter price of $44.54 per barrel, which included about $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts. 
We reported very good cost performance during the quarter and are on track to meet or exceed our cost guidance for the year. The average cost of production net of by-product credits for our copper mines averaged $1.38 per pound in the first quarter 2016. Those were lower than last year's first quarter of $1.64. We had the benefit of volumes and also the impact of our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. The average cost of $1.38 was below the estimate we provided in January 2016 of $1.44 per pound. 
We generated operating cash flows totaling $740 million in the first quarter, and capital expenditures were just under $1 billion, at $982 million, during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $20.8 billion in debt, and our consolidated cash was $331 million. Richard's going to be talking on this call about our efforts to reduce debt significantly and our progress on our asset sale program. We ended the quarter with availability under our revolver of totaling $3 billion at quarter end. And at the end of the quarter, we had 1.25 billion common shares outstanding. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation."

That's the abi",3439,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. It's been a very active and encouraging quarter for us here at Freeport. We're just mailing out our Annual Report, the theme of it's proving our metal. That's the ability to face a demanding situation in a spirited and resilient way. And I can tell you our team here couldn't be approaching its work in a more positive way from that standpoint. I'm very proud of all that our team is doing. 
We have a clearly defined strategy that our board has set and we're really focused on executing it now. We experienced strong operating results in the face of weak commodity prices. And we made a lot of progress in achieving our strategic and financial objectives during this quarter. Our reported earnings were in line with our plans, actually a bit higher because we had somewhat higher copper prices during the quarter. We did have a significant additional impairment charge, which is substantially all in our oil and gas business. And we have taken recent steps to restructure that business to reduce costs and that is progressing well. 
We've got a really good operating team there and some good assets, and we're focused on attacking costs aggressively and begun to do that. We're continuing to look for opportunities to sell our monetized assets in the oil and gas business, but we're now working with -- and it is a tough market, admittedly a tough market to try to do that. But we're working with our operating team on new plans to preserve and enhance value of our assets for the future. With our mining business, we're performing well. The Cerro Verde startup has proceeding exceptionally well. We'll talk a bit more about that. Mining CapEx are declining as we've been talking about in the past. Volumes are increasing. Costs are being constrained, and copper prices have risen from the lows in the face of an -- admittedly uncertain global market. But there's been positive movements recently. 
We are continuing with our efforts to improve our balance sheet and have increasing confidence that we're going to be able to do that in an effective way. And after we get our balance sheet situation developed, we're going to have a -- continue to have an industry-leading copper company, and we remain very positive about its long-term fundamentals. With the copper market itself, the initial benefit came of course from monetary policies, policies to encourage business activity in China and a dubious position by the U.S. Fed initially created a positive -- more positive environment for copper and other commodities prices. But recent data out of China, the internal economy has been encouraging in the power grid business, automobiles, but recognize that it's a mixed situation there as construction remains subdued. But there is improved market sentiment. Short positions have been closed. Long positions have been taken, which is just a function of the marketplace. And globally, demand is improving modestly. 
So what the net of all this has been that the large anticipated surplus in the copper markets have not materialized. Companies are reducing costs as we are, and we're pleased with our progress there. Been some curtailment, not as much as might be expected, but almost 800,000 tons year-to-date. But the pipeline in new supply of projects is declining as companies are deferring projects, cutting CapEx and all of this is resulting in a longer-term outlook for a very positive copper price environment. And that's what we're focused on finding a way to structure our business to take advantage of that. 
Page 5 is a slide that illustrates the theme that I've been talking about for years. Existing base production is declining. Over the next 10 years, Wood Mackenzie predicts an 18% decline in production from just under 20 million tons a year to just over 16 million tons a year. If you take very modest outlooks for global consumption growth, they use 1.7%, you end up with a shortfall of mine supply in relation to consumption of 7 million tons. Right now, Wood Mackenzie estimates that highly probable mine developments only 2 million tons. That leaves 5 million tons to be made up by other projects. The top 10 mines in the world produce about that level. So that shows the extent of the shortfall, and 1/3 of that 5 million has to come from new projects that are not considered probable today, that's over 3 million tons. That's 3 -- that's 3 Escondidas, 8 -- roughly 8 Morencis. So there's got to be a lot of new mines developed, an incentive price even in today's world for developing new mines is at prices that are probably 50% higher than the current price. So that's why we're in the business for and we remain confident about it. 
So what are we doing right now? That's what's on everybody's mind and that's what we're focusing on. We are executing our strategy. We're going to strengthen our balance sheet. We're going to maintain a high-quality portfolio of assets, and we're going to position them for value creation. We've adjusted our mine plans, curtailed some high-cost production, have contingency plans for taking further steps, if need be. That's going well. We're completing our major projects. 
With the Cerro Verde project, that's completion of the third of 3 projects that we started in 2011. And all 3 of those have gone well and will be beneficial to us in the next -- in the coming years. We financially suspended our dividend. We issued $2 billion of equity in 2015. Our asset sales progress, which we commented on in some detail at our fourth quarter earnings release, is going very well. We are really encouraged by the nature of those discussions. And now, we've taken steps through restructuring our management, oil and gas business, taking cost cuts to align that business with our corporate objectives of improving our balance sheet and reducing -- by reducing cost approaching future investments in a different way. And so that is what we are doing and what we're all about.
In terms of costs, experience in the mining business for the first quarter, you can see on Slide 7 that we've made progress. We're down -- we achieved levels for -- lower than our January guidance, at consolidated $1.38. We're reducing that further as you'll see for 2016 as a year, particularly strong performance in Red Conger's here with his team in the Americas where we've come in below our fourth quarter numbers in our guidance for site production and delivery costs in the Americas. And we continue to have our low-cost operations in Indonesia and Africa. Volumes were good, consistent with our guidance going into the quarter. So running the fundamentals of our business is important and our guys are doing great doing it. 
Asset transactions that we've announced to date includes the Morenci transaction and 2 smaller transactions. Good values in those. Morenci is scheduled to close in the second quarter. No hitches there. And we originally announced a transaction involving the Serbia exploration project Timok, which we're getting both good initial values accomplishing some strategic objectives and getting initial development going on the upper zone while we were going to attain a significant interest in operational control of the potentially much, much larger lower zone. So that is going good. 
We're advancing discussions on additional transactions. Very pleased with that project. Much more confident today than we were early during the first quarter when the market was in such a concerning situation. But what we're seeing here, and we're in advanced discussions, is the scarcity of quality assets in the copper business is attracting significant interest from potential purchasers who share our longer-term positive view of the marketplace. So we're confident that we're going to able to achieve the goals that we set out. And beyond that, we have other opportunities that are available to us that we're not currently pursuing but in which parties have stepped up and said they're very interested in those. So while we don't have specific transactions to report today, I'm telling you that we internally are very optimistic, confident that we're going to be able to go forward and meet our goals in a way that's going to be positive for our company and positive for our investors. 
The reason we can do this is because of the portfolio of assets. We've got pictures here on Page 9 of Morenci, recently expanded, largest copper mine, very profitable in North America, very long life. Cerro Verde, as we developed it, had the world's largest concentrating facility. And it has ramped up very well and without the kind of typical startup issues you have in terms of cost and schedule and mechanical issues going forward. It was a big project, $4.6 billion, but lots of support from the local community in the Arequipa region of Peru, great team, has gone very well. 
Grasberg, where we continue to have discussions with the government of Indonesia on our contract, is remarkable long-term resource. One of the industry's historically largest copper and gold reserves. And it's an asset that is very important to our portfolio, important to the government of Indonesia, important to the province of Papua. And then Tenke Fungurume is the most successful, largest mine in the copper belt region of Katanga and Zambia, and operating extremely well and has a long life with very significant development opportunities associated with it. 
Coming back to Grasberg. We, of course, want to refer back to the important letter that we received on October 7, when the mines minister, with support of the President, indicated that the government would move towards granting our contract extension on terms that were consistent with our existing cap in terms of the financial aspects of it and the enforceability of it. The revised -- revisions to the regulations that were anticipated then unfortunately have not been adopted. Instead, the country is now working on revising its mining law and the related regulations. The government officials continued to express support for the position in the October 7 letter. We have agreed as part of that to divest incremental interest in PT-FI at fair market value up to 30%. Press reports out today about a government position referring to replacement cost and a lower valuation than the $17 billion valuation we submitted in January of this year. The official letter from the government did not give a valuation amount, it was in the press, but it wasn't in the letter. They referred to regulations, not specifically replacement cost. I want to tell you that in all of our agreements with the government of Indonesia, we have indicated any divestment would be a fair market value that's consistent with our contract and that remains our position.
Slide 10 shows the Cerro Verde project. You can just see how well this thing has ramped up. We began first copper in September and month by month, we've increased the throughput through our new concentrator 2 project. In March, we hit above capacity, 373,000 tons a day. A strong performance on capital cost management startup. So that was an issue for us. That was our objective a year ago, to talk to you about at this call about what we're going to do in 2015 [sic] (2016). Here's an example of how we execute.
Since we did the Phelps Dodge deal 9 years ago now, I talked I think on every conference call about the strength of Freeport has been in our copper resources, very large crude and probable reserves, very large mineralized material at our existing mines that provide assurance of the opportunity to invest when the markets fit. And then potential that is huge, that goes beyond that. So that's what we still have and this is what's going to allow us to deal with this balance sheet issue by raising capital through property sales or otherwise and then end up with a very substantial copper resource-based company as we go forward. That's our strategy and that's -- this is the reason why we will be able to execute it effectively.
Now to show you -- and I think those of you who follow us know we've got a great copper business. Underneath all this market issue and issues associated with oil and gas investment, this -- the company has a remarkable copper business. This has shown that by in 2015 when we're still investing in Cerro Verde still aggressively and we had EBITDA that matched our CapEx. Going into 2016, as we were wrapping up Cerro Verde and even lower copper prices, averaging $2.17, EBITDA substantially exceeded CapEx. And as we look forward to the year 2016 at varying copper prices, from here forward, first quarter's in the books. But if it's $2 for the rest of the year, we would have $4.6 billion of EBITDA; $2.25, it's $5.7 billion; $2.50, it's $6.8 billion. And our CapEx is only $1.8 billion as we've completed Cerro Verde and as we're continuing to invest in Grasberg underground and managing maintenance capital in a very effective way. So we've got a business that is generating substantial cash flows to help us with our financial objectives.
Now in the oil and gas business. The debt level that we have of roughly $20 billion was created by the initial oil and gas investments and subsequent spending in that business on an aggressive growth profile. That was really upset by initially the fall in oil prices and then when copper prices fell, that took away the ability of the copper business to support it with its own cash flows. So that's why we're having to take these really aggressive actions now to rectify our balance sheet. We've got a new organizational structure in the oil and gas business. It's now being integrated into our Freeport-McMoRan corporate structure being run as an operating division as opposed to a standalone corporate entity that is -- has been done since the acquisition in 2013. This is allowing us to reduce costs. Last week, we reduced employment by roughly 25%. And we're continuing to look for ways to reduce costs, through looking at office facilities and other cost elements. 
We're going to align the way we spend money in that business with our corporate objectives in terms of how do we generate cash flows, how do we contribute to our balance sheet improvement activities. We're winding down significant capital spending. We have recently completed a series of tieback wells to our production facility that's going to allow us for a period of time to maintain near-term production without additional drilling. 
In the Holstein Deep area, we've commenced initial production just this month; 2 additional wells are coming on in second quarter. And Horn Mountain and Marlin tiebacks, we commenced production on the D-13 King well in the first quarter. The Kilo/Oscar, Quebec/Victory tiebacks are in progress. And we have 4 additional drilled wells that are in our inventory, including Horn Mountain Deep that we're going to be able to bring on production without drilling new wells that's going to allow us to maintain production for the foreseeable future. 
And when you step back and look at these assets, the -- they're very attractive. It started with the acquisition prior to the merger of 3 underutilized deepwater platforms in the Deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, the Horn Mountain, Holstein projects and Marlin. That's where our tieback activities are going. We also have interest in the nonoperating new producing projects at Lucius and Heidelberg and a long-term development project in the Vito area in Mississippi Canyon. This is the structure of our business. We have significant production in California. But these are really good assets. 
We looked for potential buyers for the business during the first quarter aggressively. The board had special financial advisers. We worked with our established bankers and canvassed the market. And because of the conditions in the marketplace, with low oil prices, with credit pressures on the companies from the very largest through the business with a lack of credit, we just concluded at this point that the values that might be available in sale [ph] or monetization transactions simply didn't reflect the long-term value of these assets. And that's why we've taken the steps to restructure our business. We've got an operating team there that's really impressive. They're experienced. They're well recognized in the industry. They've got a great track record. And so we're very comfortable of our ability to manage this business in an effective way and realize long-term values for our business. 
Now turning to Slide 15. You can see the leverage to prices that our oil and gas business has. And at $35 Brent, we have $600 million; at $45, it's $1 billion; $1.4 billion, it's $55; these are EBITDA numbers and $1.8 billion, it's $65. We've reduced CapEx for 2017 to $500 million. We do have some idled rig costs of about that amount that we're dealing with, but it is a business that is leveraged to oil prices. No guarantees, but there's certainly opportunities oil prices to increase. 
We can maintain production, continue to mark the marketplace and look for ways of contributing to our strategic objective of improving our balance sheet. We've updated our numbers for the outlook for 2016. This does reflect the closing of the Morenci transaction where we're selling an additional 13% interest in Morenci. And so that's the basic adjustment for copper, and other adjustments are more in the nature of just typical ongoing adjustments. I'll point out that the unit cost for copper has been dropped to $1.05 consolidated. That's down from a $1.10. Reflect some improvement in gold price byproduct, but also the efforts involve our team to reduced cost before byproducts. Strong production costs of $15 a barrel -- $14 a barrel from our oil business, which is down $1. Operating cash flows, as we've talked about earlier, at $4.8 billion, $2.25 copper. And each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year, the last 9 months of 2016 is $340 million variance for us. CapEx are in line with our previous estimates. Sales -- as we look forward to 2017, we will see copper at $4.6 billion. Gold sales rising as we complete mining the open pit at Grasberg. Molybdenum sales have been adjusted for the market. And as I pointed out earlier, oil sales being maintained at the current level of close to 160 million a day.
EBITDA variations are shown and cash flow variations are shown on Slide 18, starting with EBITDA. This includes first quarter actuals and sensitivities for the remaining 9 months, averaging 2016/2017, but at $2, it's $5 billion, $6 billion; $2.25, $6 billion, $7 billion; $2.50, $7 billion, $8 billion for EBITDA. And cash flows varying over prices going from $2 to $2.50 between roughly $3.5 billion to $5 billion. 
Capital expenditures are dropping. Page 19. We have cut capital in half for 2016. We're cutting it another 50% for 2017. You can see how that splits out between our oil and gas business, our major mining projects, the remaining major mining projects is the Grasberg underground development and then what we're doing with maintenance capital.
I keep mentioning we're committed to improving our balance sheet. We are going to get this $20 billion debt level down. We're going to do that by running our business right, constraining cost and capital spending and also raising capital through asset sales. The improvement in our share price and our bond trading may give us some opportunities for capital market transactions. But for the time being, we're really focused on these asset sales discussions that we're advancing. We have a very manageable near-term debt maturity schedule. We have roughly $3 billion available under our $3.5 billion amended bank credit facility. We have $300 million in cash, virtually no -- a very low maturities at least in 2016 and manageable maturities in 2017. So from a corporate standpoint, our near-term liquidity is very strong. Come back to saying we're focused on execution, had a great quarter in terms of execution for -- to begin the year off with, and I'm very confident we'll continue that track record as we go forward into the year. 
So that's a quick overview. And I want you to run through it so that we can have time for your questions. And so, Tony, I see you're first up."

To reduce capital, we've revised the mine plans and we are reducing capital. What we have not done yet is defer the fundamental development of our underground resources. We completed the deep MLZ extension of the DOZ mine. That's really a long-term extension from our initial blockade development beginning in the early 1980s. This is the most recent major extension on that, that was completed last year and is ramping up. The underground development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is really beneficial to the asset, beneficial to government of Indonesia and of course, Freeport. For us to continue with that, so that when the pit is completed roughly at the end of 2017, we would have that mine ready to begin ramp up. And so we've been very reluctant, remain very reluctant to suspend that. But that is drawn into question seriously by the -- by not having the regulations amended and getting our contract extended. We obviously are spending that money in expectation and confidence that we will get extended and the government officials keep saying that, but have not taken the actions that are necessary to document it yet. Roughly 75% or more of the production from the underground is going to be realized after 2021 when our primary term ends. So we're currently engaged with the government in explaining that to them. We also have the issue there with the smelter that we've agreed to develop, provided we get our contract extension. And we're unable to spend substantial money on advancing the smelter project without having contract extended. So that's the big issues we face. Discussions are ongoing as we speak. And our board is considering what actions we should take for it. With respect to the mill issue, Mark, why don't I let you explain that briefly."

We've -- since that period, we've evaluated the longer-term repair and got prepared for it and determined that we should take it down in April, which we did.

We've scheduled about 32 days of downtime for the -- for this repair, but we're pretty confident where we sit right now that, that'll be closer to 24, 25 days.

I mean, the realities of this is and I've been through a number of these cycles and have gone through this is that decisions to shut down mines are very complicated because of the transition costs that you incur in having to do it. Not only is there an issue of the, and this varies country by country depending on labor laws, but the cost of employee severances, but it also often triggers reclamation obligations and shutdown obligations. Because a mine is an operating system and when you operate that system, you're able to manage a lot of environmental issues in a particular way by the way you process material. And once you shut it down, then you often have to come up with new systems of how to operate water flows and so forth. The -- that's one of the things we faced at Sierrita and those are complicated. So the barriers to shut down mines that you're seeing across the industry have to do with these transition costs. And sometimes those costs are economically more significant than operating losses at marginal profitability or even losses. Now clearly, the lower prices go, the more pressure will be and the more shut-ins you'll have. We would have some more. But for example, at our -- and sometimes it's not the entire mine, it's segments of the mine, which we did in Morenci in 2008, 2009 when we cut back our mill processing and cut back our mine rates and the crushing rock we would put on our SX/EW stacks, our lead stacks. For example, we would cut back El Abra by half, but the remaining half that we're operating at El Abra is profitable at these prices and at lower prices. So it's a dynamic situation. It will be driven by prices, but what we're seeing is people are really focused on costs. Now the thing that I think that we're looking at in a positive way and I would suggest you know that the market looks at is what is the price of replacing the shortfall that's looming for the copper industry. I gave you numbers 10 years out, but you know that the market does not have a significant surplus balance today. Who knows what's going to happen. There's risk in the global marketplace, but there's opportunities. And this thing could come back. And even today, the incentive price to develop new production, and man, we know this because we've got all these resources, we've been studying it for years, it's going to take a very high price, $3, $3.30, to develop new resources from known resources. They're not major new discoveries. The expansion projects that are available to the industry are either expensive underground projects or projects that require low grades and lots of infrastructure development. So absent just a calamity in China or the global marketplace, I still am very positive that this copper business is going to be a great business to be in and that Freeport is going to be a really strong leader, player in that industry."

We can't live in that world. And the nature of oil production is such that you just cannot make decisions like that and preserve the reservoir, preserve the asset. So it's -- I recall back in 2008, you may have been at a meeting I had one time, when somebody said, why don't you just shut in all your North American production. The market doesn't need it and it would balance the market and it's not -- and my answer then was, running these kinds of assets is not like managing a portfolio of stocks and bonds. You can't just sell something and get out of it. You have to manage a lot of complicated operating factors in doing it. I understand your financial analysis, the practicalities of it are that we can generate some cash to help meet our obligations that we have. We're cutting these costs aggressively now. We'll continue to do that and we'll take the actions to preserve these assets and create some incremental value over time. We're working on contingency plans now, for example, of how do we look forward in terms of drilling some of the really attractive tie back opportunities. We're not going to spend some money now, but we're going to be prepared to as markets increased to help arrest the natural decline. There's a big difference in these average numbers that you talk about between California, which is a significant production, and the Deepwater. The deep -- the California doesn't have the decline issues that the Deepwater has and we're able to basically break even out there and preserve all of the resource by continuing to operate. If you were to try to shut in that California production with the nature of the way that it's produced, you're doing that. So the oil and gas business is in tough shape. It's just in tough shape because our plan was to have it fund its own CapEx. And they were all -- besides the acquisition, I mentioned there were all these commitments made to fund an aggressive growth project. That was then, the legs were cut out of that by the drop in oil prices. And now that business has committed costs and obligations that's well over its current resources. We know that because we just tried to sell those resources. So we've got a profitable copper business. You've got to manage this oil and gas business in a different way to reduce costs, focus on how to preserve the asset because an offshore depletion will happen at some point in the future, not in the next period of time because of the success we've had in drilling. But it's a challenge. I mean, I'm not going to pull any punches on it. And we're -- but we've got a good team. I'm really, really enjoying getting to work with these guys directly. They're doing a great job, they're well respected in the industry. I know that because I talk to a lot of people outside our company about how they run their business.

It's -- the asset where we have the biggest streaming opportunity is Grasberg with Big Gossan associated with it. It's that gold component is what makes Grasberg such a strong, strategic asset for us. It reduces our cost and it's not an inexpensive place to operate. We've got 30,000-plus workers there and one of the world's largest mills in what will be the world's largest underground development. Complicated environmental issues to maintain, complicated community issues, community support issues, logistics issues. And so really, we've concluded, and thank god we didn't succumb to that idea in past years because today that would've been a bad decision. But we really believe having the gold component of Grasberg together with the high copper grades is what makes it such a great, strategic asset for us. So we look at that. We watch what's going on in the industry. We talk to companies involved and bankers. And if something makes sense, we will be -- would be open to it. But today, we've concluded that it does not make sense."

Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release, and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. 
On the call today, are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer of FCX; and Red Conger, President of Americas and Africa. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, we'll open -- after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. 
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $479 million, $0.38 per share for the second quarter of 2016. As detailed in the release, the net loss attributable to the common stock included special items totaling $452 million or $0.36 per share during the second quarter, primarily for the previously reported gross ship settlements and impairment of our oil and gas properties, partly offset by net gains on the sale of assets. After adjusting for these net charges, our second quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $27 million or $0.02 a share. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for second quarter 2016 approximated $966 million. We have a slide in the deck that shows you the roll forward of getting to that number. And during the second quarter, we completed previously announced asset sales for aggregate consideration of $1.3 billion, that included the $1 billion sale of the additional 13% undivided interest in Morenci during May. And also in May, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in TF Holdings Limited for $2.65 billion in cash and consideration of up to $120 million. 
In accordance with accounting guidelines, as you'll see in the release, the results of Tenke are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the quarter, our consolidated sales volumes totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper, 156,000 ounces of gold, 19 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.4 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our average price of copper was $2.18 per pound, that was below last year's second quarter average of $2.71 per pound. Gold averaged 12 92 [ph] during the quarter, that was above last year's quarterly average of 11 74. And our realized price for crude oil of $41 per barrel was below last year's quarterly average price of just under $68 per barrel, which included $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts. 
Unit net cash costs for the quarter averaged $1.33 per pound. That was lower as expected than the year-ago period of $1.50 per pound. And that primarily reflects the higher copper volumes and economies of scales that have come in during the quarter as anticipated and the impact of the ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, partly offset by lower gold and silver credits. We generated operating cash flows during the quarter of $874 million, which exceeded our capital expenditures of $833 million during the quarter. 
As previously reported, we have exchanged some of our senior notes into equity through July 25. Yesterday, we exchanged a total of $369 million and faced amount of bonds at a costs of $311 million or approximately 28 million shares of our common stock in a series of privately negotiated transactions. Our debt at the end of June was $19.3 billion and consolidated cash was approximately $350 million. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and we ended the quarter, we currently have approximately 1.33 billion common shares outstanding, which includes the shares that we issued through yesterday  in connection with the settlement of the debt exchanges. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our slide materials and discussing our operations and outlook."

I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit before we turn to the quarter. And we have some important facts to talk about -- situations to talk about in the quarter",5442,"Thanks, Kathleen, and I thank all of you for joining us today. I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit before we turn to the quarter. And we have some important facts to talk about -- situations to talk about in the quarter and we'll cover those in detail, but it's -- I believe it's important for you to understand that we feel very good about the progress we've made during the first half of the year. 
Late last night, as we put the finishing touches on today's presentation, Kathleen and I were reflecting back about where our company stood a year ago. A year ago, oil prices were in the mid-$60 barrel, copper prices were $2.70. When we're talking about controlling costs and talking about strategic alternatives for our oil and gas business. As 2015 proceeded and going into 2016, oil prices dropped at 1 point below $30 a barrel. Copper prices dropped below $2 a pound. There was a lot of uncertainties about our company because of the debt level witnessed the way our bonds traded and our CBS has traded. 
We took steps. We reorganized our board. The board -- the restructured board emphasized our focus on the future of our company being in the mining business. We restructured our management teams and we took actions. When we had our year-end earnings call, there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to execute the plans that we needed to execute to address our balance sheet issues. A lot of skepticism internally, there was a lot of -- there was a lack of clarity about not where we were going, we knew what we had to do, but how we would get there, how the market would react to it.
So looking back, we said then that we would sell assets, raise capital, targeting $5 billion to $10 billion. And we went to work. As we were doing that, Red and his team and our global operating teams focused on executing our business plans. And when you look at the charts on the side of Page 3 -- Slide 3, you can see how effective we've been doing that. We've reduced our site production delivery cost before byproduct credits by 25 -- 23%. Oil and gas business, we've cut our production costs from $19 a barrel to $15 a barrel. 
We cut CapEx. We completed our major expansion project at Cerro Verde, which a year ago was a significant undertaking and risk for our company. And it is a very complex project. As it was completed, it was the largest processing facility in the history of the mining industry. And it was a big project, 4.5-plus billion dollars. And we reduced CapEx in the oil and gas business. We undertook to sell assets in a market that had uncertainties. We did this to strengthen our balance sheet. But as a surprise to some people, we were able to achieve valuations that reflected a positive view on the long-term copper market. We had that a year ago and we continue to have that today and I'll talk about it. 
Not only does this generate cash to reduce our debt, but it highlights value of Freeport's assets as we go forward. We raised -- we have raised today the $4 billion or in position to complete transactions to raise it by only selling 9% of our copper reserves. We had an effort to sell our oil and gas assets. It was a tough time to do that. We restructured the business to operate within its cash flows. We reorganized our business. We dealt with some major obligations that had been committed to in past times when the strategy was to grow that business aggressively. And we made some tough decisions to restructure drilling contracts and other contracts, and we continue to view strategically how these assets bit into our long-term business and we understand their values. And we will look over time to see how to generate value for our shareholders out of those assets. 
Our copper volumes growing with the successful Cerro Verde start up at 15% quarter-to-quarter, year-on-year increase. And we'll step back and look at how our company is now positioned for free cash flow generation. As we were talking last night, Kathleen and I and our management team feel that we have truly turned the corner for Freeport. And our ability to do that wasn't just clear cut as we started the year. We proved that our assets are attractive. And our strategy, and we'll talk about how our financial strategy fits with our long-term business strategy, is focused on leading us with a core set of assets to build long-term value for shareholders. It would be one thing just to sell assets simply to raise cash. But we've kept the view of what will Freeport be for the long-term and which of our assets will be there to allow us to take advantage of our core competencies at the company, and also to take advantage of what we believe will be a long-term copper market. So that was always in our mind as to what we want to be left with after we sold assets.
So looking on Page 4. We have set a target of reducing our debt to $10 billion. Our debt at June 30 is just below $19 billion, and we have a contract to sell our Tenke asset with the related assets that we'd be selling for $2.8 billion. Now if we look forward at different scenarios of copper prices and with successful execution of our plans, you can see what our debt levels would be at $2 copper, $2.25 copper and $2.50 copper at the end of 2017. That reflects the transactions that we sold that we have contracts for. It does not include any divestment of PT-FI shares and we have a strategy of working with the government of Indonesia to sell an incremental approximately 20% of PT-FI, contingent on our getting our contract extension. 
We will consider further asset steps -- strategic steps. For example, if this doesn't include any sales of our oil and gas business, and I want to emphasize that as we look at any divestment of PT-FI, it's a condition that we sell those assets at fair value to our company. And so as we looked at this and we take into account the risk possibility of copper prices trading down throughout the financial community today and with many of the experts of all the industry, there is a risk that because of the lower growth in China and global economic uncertainties that we may have to deal with lower than today's copper prices in the short-term. 
I'm going to talk about the longer-term view. But we have to live through the short-term to experience the benefits of a positive long-term market. So we sit here with a balancing act. The balancing act was to look at these debt levels, understand what it's going to take operationally to get to those, then think about what next steps should we take to address the uncertainties of the short-term market. And we have still open and on the table for all strategic moves, whether that means selling assets, selling the company, we're focused really on creating value for our shareholders. And to create that long-term value, our recent history with this company shows that we need to have a strong balance sheet to allow us to be positioned to aggressively take care of the long-term values. 
We've had ongoing discussions about other asset sales. We're continuing those. We looked at capital market transactions. And today, we've announced that we have plans to file the necessary documents to allow us to issue another $1.5 billion of stock through and at the market offering. Our company has had success with these in the past. We did 1 in 2008, 2009 prices. We've done 2 of these offerings last year when our financial situation was more dire. What this allows us to do is to assess the market. And if the market is available to us on a day by day basis, to sell shares into the marketplace where there's demand for them. And so we have -- we felt, looking at these numbers, that this was a step that if we can successfully execute it, absent just a collapse in the market, we basically have a path forward of achieving what we set out to achieve. 
There is no requirement to sell further assets. There's no requirement to sell further equity. We've got it now, which we didn't have 6 months ago. Our clear-cut path as to how to get our financial situation to the point where we wanted to get it to it. And we will have done it in a way that we can hold on to what we believe is our highest-quality assets to build the company for the future. 
Now those assets that transactions today, they're listed on Page 5. It includes the successful sale of an incremental interest, an incremental 13% interest to our longtime and highly-valued partner Sumitomo and Morenci. That transaction is closed. We have a series of other smaller transactions. And the Tenke Fungurume transaction, which was -- is where we have a contract. And working with the buyer -- molybdenum, they are proceeding with the necessary regulatory steps in China to get the transaction closed. Their reports are that, that's going very well. They have to have a shareholder vote since there is a minority public ownership. So the shareholder vote doesn't involve uncertainties as to the outcome but procedurally, it has to be conducted. All indications are that this transaction is going to be closed as anticipated in the fall. And so that will generate for us, considering all factors, something between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. We're pleased with that. 
Now what then does Freeport have left? I mean it's a great set of assets. We will have 7 copper mines led by our flagship Morenci in the North America. Once we had 2 molybdenum mines, and we had a great molybdenum business, largest producer, lowest-cost producer. We have 2 pure molybdenum mines in North America and byproduct produced in our other mines. We also have 2 great minds in South America. Cerro Verde, which I'll talk about and El Abra, where we and our partner, CODELCO, are doing studies now for the potential for a major expansion of that property only when market conditions allow.
Now one of the things as we've really gotten into this and evaluated future transactions and buyers, is really a recognition of how much value we create by having these set of assets run together. These are mines, which benefit significantly from the synergies of being able to share people, technology, equipment, to have the flexibility of focusing on growth projects at one of these mines or the other. And looking at how to fit those together in a long-term plan where ultimately growing volumes. They have -- you can see in these bubbles, really huge resources. Over 30 billion pounds of copper reserves each in North America and South America, significant molybdenum beyond proved reserves, huge amounts of mineralized material and future growth projects. 
We have a growth pipeline for this industry with these assets that extends as far as you can see. And we also have the ability of executing these when it make sense. In undertaking low risk, executable transactions without having to do it. We can run a really rational business strategy of generating profits and focusing on long-term growth in a very businesslike and rational way. And when we looked at how those values fit together, we felt really, it makes a lot of sense to keep the assets together for the future. And Red and his team just do an outstanding job in running this business. 
The Grasberg mine in Indonesia is a real special asset. I mean, it is special in many ways because of its physical location, but extraordinary because of high grades of both copper and gold in the same ore. It's a tough mine to run but we've done it for a long time now. We began the development -- we've been there since the early '70s in Indonesia and Papua. And we developed the Grasberg during the 1990s, and now have operated so we can see the end of the life of the open pit and the transition to an underground. We've got issues to deal with. We've always had issues to deal with there operationally, manage the environment, working with the local community, working with the changes in the Indonesian government. But underlying that is an extraordinary asset and we want to work cooperatively with the people of Indonesia and its government in a way to generate benefits that are mutual for both of us. And that's what we're doing. 
Now where are we today with copper markets? The surplus is today are relatively small in the marketplace and lower than people expect it. Not too long ago as the way they were. The new supply with people like us had initiated with products following the financial crisis of 2008, 2009. Some had been delayed. Some had been deferred. But the new supply is basically coming on as expected. A recent feature is that there are significantly lower disruptions than had been experienced in the industry, disruption from labor issues, disruption for mine and operational issues from equipment issues. So we've had a case of where the mine -- the industry has been producing basically what was available to it. 
And even with that, even with the new supply, the lower disruptions, the lowered growth in China, the lower growth globally because all the economic issues affecting the world. The projected medium-term deficits -- in the projected medium-term, it looks like we're going to be having deficits even with very modest demand growth. So rather than the market being overwhelmed with supply, there's ample copper around the world today. So the market is fully supplied, but it's not being overwhelmed with new supplies and continued production even with very modest demand growth.
And as you go forward, existing mines will produce less. People aren't investing in new projects. There's barriers to project development that relate to environmental community, country issues and as we've shown in this process that we've had about selling properties, there is a significantly higher than current price required to develop new production. You just simply can't do it. And we know because we've got huge resources to develop and we're working on plans to development. It will require our copper price, and absent a complete deterioration or significant deterioration, the lapse in China market or global market, we're heading for a time when copper prices are going to be higher. That is illustrated on Page 8. 
Now I want to say what this is and what it isn't. This shows projected existing supply before any disruption allowance from existing mines. It doesn't take into account new projects even those projects that today look probable, but it just shows that over the next 10 years, existing mines production is expected to decline on order of 20%. That's roughly 4 million tons. Today, top 10 mines in the world produce about 5.5 million tons per year. And according to Wood McKinsey, the incentive price for new development is $3.30 per pound. We know how long it takes to develop new mines. With all these resources, 100 billion pounds reserve, 100 billion pounds of mineralized material, more resources beyond that. If we were to start today to say let's develop an ASP to develop a new mine, it's on the order of 10 years before we have any new production. And that can't be changed. That's not economic, that's reality of getting permits, getting mine plans, getting things organized. That's just the way its required. 
Now we did this with Cerro Verde. Cerro Verde is a tremendous asset. It was starting many years ago. It was discovered in the 20th century -- in the 19th century. And it was started as a very small SXCW operation. As we acquired, they were completing a major milling expansion in 2006, a little bit rough start off as we had not known then. And now we've done this $4.5 billion project, own budget. We've taken our mill rate from a year ago from 116,000 tons a day to 352,000 tons a day. Think of that. 352,000 is through the mill. We're mining over 600,000 tons a day. Our sales have gone from 100 million pounds to 270 million pounds. Our unit cost have gone from $1.87 to $1.22. It will be a very long-term contributor to the future of our company. This is an asset that we could sell at a very attractive value. 
We can now conduct just a formal auction of this, it would raise a lot of money. But we believe that this is the kind of core asset that we need to keep in our financial plan now will allow us to keep it. We weren't sure we could do that going into this year to build our company around for the future. We went back and looked at 3 of our key mines Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg. And before we really started on this process, we wanted to show just how the districts that we're operating in have changed over the years and what we have to continue to build them. In 1988, Morenci, as you went in the '80s, the '90s and early 2000s, there were reports talking about the death of the Southwest copper district in the U.S. and Mexico. 
Morenci had relatively small reserves. We've had significant production since then. We have significant remaining reserves and potential beyond those reserves. There will be a time, not in the very near term, but we'll be announcing a major further mill expansion at Morenci to develop the sulfide reserves. Cerro Verde now is essentially fully developed. But as we look below the existing outline for the pit that will support the expansion, there's further resources there. And at Grasberg, Grasberg was discovered in 1988 and developed during the 1990s to become 1 of the mining industries great assets. And we've got 25 years left on our contract and a great future there. 
Then when we look broadly, and as I said, we look at the set of assets in North America and South America as a set of assets managed together to take advantage. We have very large copper sulfate opportunities that have been much better defined since our Phelps Dodge acquisitions through our core drilling and exploration analysis. And it's a consistent story. And mines like Bhagdad, which is our mine with a long life, operational challenges because of principally water availability and some land for tailings and so forth, but have a very significant resource. Recently at a 100-year-old mine in Mexico, Chino, which has been viewed as being at the very end of its life, we've been able to recently produce some incremental volumes while understanding the ore body better. And then identifying the potential for a large-scale sulfide future development at Chino. 
El Abra and Chile, I mentioned earlier, as we first got into this after the Phelps Dodge acquisition, we saw this as a project with a very mid life. Exploration, drilling and analysis that have shown an enormous sulfide resources that require some investments to get water power to it and to develop the mine. But this is a -- this is a Cerro Verde type project for the future. And we're doing to work to position us for it. New Morenci is a mine called Safford, which is also developed by Phelps Dodge right before our acquisition. It has an adjoining more resources that has been known for years. 
As we now approach the completion of the mining of the Oxford material at Safford, we're looking at this Lone Star resource, which has the opportunity to provide additional oxide ore to extend the life of facility at Safford with a huge, huge sulfide resource underlying it. We're doing work to see how to take advantage of that. I mentioned Morenci, Sierrita is a mine with significant molybdenum resource. But again, very large potential resource development. 
All of these developments, I want to talk about them because of how it fits into our near-term financial strategy. We're retaining these opportunities to grow our company in the future. Very simple. We're not going to start spending money on these capital projects until the market justifies it. But we'll have that underlying our company. Now short-term. Kathleen, I talked to Red about his team about what could they do to mitigate production declines without doing major capital expansion projects? How to do it with minimum capital, and they are undertaking a project to deal with steepening pit walls within our company. By optimizing the slopes, it will allow us to target opportunities to minimize stripping and add ore. This would result in lower costs and adding ore available for current production without having to do major development projects.
This is a process that we're approaching very carefully because we want to do it by adhering to our established safety factors for protecting pit walls, but it allows us the potential to accelerate or in the medium-term, add incremental or to our reserves. We're in the early stages of this, but we're very encouraged about what we might be able to do with it, but we'll be reporting to you as we forward. 
Now Grasberg. We are at a stage of this mine where we're completing the mining of the open pit, and you can see the schematic of the ore bodies, we're producing now from the DLC. We've developed the DMLZ extension of the DLC, and it commenced production and it will provide significant ore to us going forward. We are continuing for the development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is the extension of the ore body beyond the pit limits and we're prepared to do that. It would allow us to continue operations beyond the depletion of the pit and begin ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave by having this infrastructure development. We can't mine from the block cave until the pit is complete because we use block caving methods, which results in surface subsidence. 
And an ongoing issue we've had is the need to have an extension of our contract because the funds we're spending to develop the block cave are for production that will largely be produced beyond 2021. And so we've been having this ongoing assessment about whether to continue these capital expenditures. If we were to defer those, there would be significant adverse consequences both for our company and for the government of Indonesia because it would defer the initiation of the ramp up of the block cave going forward in the future. 
Today, we have access to the ore at the very lower limits of the open pit. That means we're not doing much stripping at all. It has very high-grade ore. Our mining rate is 2/3 lower than its maximum, 43% lower. There's limited access to the pit. So that means it creates some operational issues for us. And in this quarter, we had a couple of things to deal with. One, we had as we had talked about in our last call, a mechanical issue to repair with one of our big SAG mills. That was done more quickly than we had anticipated. And we have experience some issues with part of our workforce. And its the workforce that actually operates the big trucks and shovels in the Grasberg open pit. They've had some grievances. There's been some slowdown work there. And it had an impact on this year -- this quarter's volumes. 
A couple of points to emphasize. Well, let me start by saying we are working with the union and the workers to resolve these grievances. We're making progress with that and we believe that we will be successful in dealing with that. But it was lower volumes now. But that ore is not going away. It will be mine and produced in the future. It's a matter of timing. It may mean -- it will likely mean -- it will mean that we'll be continuing to mine from the open pit into the early part of 2018 rather than completing it in 2017. So it's a short-term timing issue. We believe we have it solved. We're really focused on executing there and we believe our team can do it. 
We do have with the Indonesian government an export permit, that will be required by the first week -- roughly the first week of August, its August 8. We have been given assurances from the mines ministry and the highest levels of government that we will be able to get that permit, and we expect to obtain it on a timely basis. Longer term, we are having ongoing discussions, following up on our letter from October of last year about the long-term extension of our contract. Those discussions have been constructive. With the senior officials of the government clearly recognize the need for investment more broadly within Indonesia and to achieve that goal, they have commented publicly on the need to treat existing investors like Freeport fairly. There's been some political realignment within the President, the parliament the first quarter -- the first half of the year. We believe all that is going to be positive. We're getting a resolution and till at the timing for doing that now as opposed to where it's been over the next 6 months is much more positive. And we're going to complete following up on that. So that's kind of where we are at Grasberg. 
And I'll be prepared to follow your -- answer your questions. Slide 14 just shows how really good our mining business is. It shows in 2015 when copper price averaged $2.42. Our EBITDA matched our capital spending. Now in the first half with the completion of Cerro Verde, the drop-off in CapEx even at a copper price of averaging $2.16, EBITDA significantly higher than CapEx. And as we look forward for the full year in 2016 with copper prices averaging for the remainder of the year at $2 to $2.50, we have substantially higher EBITDA than the $1.7 billion of expected CapEx for the year. The adjustments for EBITDA reflect the changes that I previously talked about at Grasberg, the sale of the interest of Morenci and other factors there, but it shows how profitable our business will be now and as we go forward. 
In the oil and gas business, we really had a focus on managing costs and enhancing, protecting the asset values. We reduced costs, outside capital cost by roughly $150 million. That's about 1/3 or more reduction in G&A cost, resulting in other costs. We restructured the really large commitments under the 3 deepwater drill ships that we had contracts for. We talked about that last time and that's in the supplemental slides, if you want to go back and review it. We established production in the deepwater from 5 new wells that were drilled to tied back to our production facilities, with 3 wells that hosting deep and 2 wells in the Horn Mountain area. 
I'm talking about the Holstein production because those wells, the production results have been disappointing for factors related to the quality of the oil and the nature of the reservoirs. And that's just what it is. But overall, the production from wells that we have previously drilled have come on as expected, but unfortunately these did not. But we have had favorable results from the development of the outside operator and large projects at Lucius and Heidelberg. But we have achieved our goal of ending the subsidy of our oil and gas operations from the mining business. And you can see that on Page 16 where we show the oil and gas EBITDA various prices, and CapEx in '17 have been reduced to $600 million. And you can see that what kind of EBITDA we would have at various prices ranging from $500 million at $35 to $1.5 billion at $65. 
The Deepwater business is built around these 3 assets, 3 production facilities, formally owned by BP and Shell. And that they are 100% owned. They have significant process and capacity at significant unused process capacity which creates value for both us and perspective purchasers of these assets. Our outlook for 2016, updated for our expansion in Indonesia continues to show copper sales of $5 billion -- 5 million -- billion pounds. Our Sierrita mines, which we anticipated closing. We went to work and found ways of providing some volumes that are very attractive gross level that offset the lower production in Indonesia and oil production reflects the Indonesia issues that we talked about. 
Molybdenum increases because -- principally cost of Sierrita and because markets have improved some and the oil production is lower. We have sold our interest in the Haynesville gas field. And so those barrels equivalent are out. There's been an operational issue because of the gas plant problem that has to do with Mississippi, that's limited some of our production as well as the start up production at the -- with our 3 new wells. Operating cash flows at $2.25 copper are modeled to be $4.5 billion with substantial leverage of $260 million for each $0.10 a change in the copper price. Unit costs are consistent with previous guidance. And on this basis, it's $1.06 a pound and capital spending is a couple of $100 billion less than previous guidance. 
Our sales profile as we look forward from 2015 to '16, we got 5 billion pounds that I just talked about. That would drop in 2017 principally because of the sale of Tenke is the big factor there that is expected to close later this year and to reduce volumes. You can see the goal coming out of Grasberg as we mined the end of the pit. And what our molybdenum and oil sales will be. Our chart that we show each quarter for EBITDA and cash flows, show at over a range of $2 and $2.50. It shows operating cash flows ranging from $3.5 billion to $5 billion over those copper prices. And then capital expenditures and we're going to manage this in relation to market conditions would be dropping from $6 billion -- $350 million in 2015 to just over $3 billion this year, to $2.3 billion in 2017. So the cash flow numbers that we talked about earlier reflects substantial cash coming out of the operation of our business. 
Kathleen went over with you the 3 8 9 [ph] exchanges, in which we were able to retire roughly $370 million of debt at a cost in terms of a share price of 311 million. We'll continue to look for opportunities like this. And then when we look at our balance sheet and our ability to manage it, not only do we have a plan of getting our debt down, which we will by the end of '17, will be at an acceptable level, to allow us to focus on growth as market conditions allow. We also have ways of dealing with our near-term maturities. Half the proceeds of the Tenke transaction will be used to reduce our bank term loans pursuant to our agreement with the banks. The remaining half will then be available as cash to retire the deal with our 2017 maturities. 
So we've dealt with '16 and '17, and we're going to continue to be looking at capital market transactions to -- with -- let me just say non-equity capital markets transactions in a way to deal and maximize our maturity picture going forward. So this is a little chart we use as we've talked about proving our metal for this year in an enthusiastic and resilient manner. And pleased to report for the first 6 months, we've got a great track record of moving then and moving our sales forward on a clearly defined business and financial strategy. 
So thank you for bearing with me with all of that. And I felt like it was an important quarter to cover these things and now I look forward to your questions."

While we have found some ways and we continue to search for ways to defer capital. We changed the mine plans and have done certain things. What we have not done yet, what we have not done yet is defer the necessary steps that would allow us to begin ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave production once the pit's completed, now that will be early 2018. So the balancing act, and this has been a major point of focus for us in the first half the year. I went to Grasberg and I sat down with our team, we did a detailed review of what it would mean if we were simply to defer the spending of $1 billion a year that we've been spending recently to develop this underground resource. What would happen, it would be significant layoffs. And we're over 90% of the economy in Namika, the resulting social disruptions there, which are of significant concern are unknown. If we're sure we would do what you just said, it would result in a deferral for the ramp up of the Grasberg Block Cave. And once you did mobilize the team that's working on this, re-mobilizing that team and coming back in, would be a significant exercise beyond just the time deferral of spending it. And that would have a major negative impact as I said both on us and on the government. Now we are facing our decision to do this on the assurances that we received from the government in recent years. But most clearly articulated in the October 8 letter last year, that they will extend our contract. In recent -- my recent discussions with the highest level of officials in the government, reaffirmed that commitment to doing them. So we are saying that we need to have that done in the near term, explaining to them the consequences if we -- to them, as well as to us, deferring those expenditures. But to date, we have not made that major decision. So we're online -- that work by the way, has gone exceedingly well. And the underlying economics are strongly in favor of us doing what we're doing."

Part that over time where we may end up having to increase in cost, Kathleen has been working really strongly with Red and his team, reducing major capital in the mining business. And we've done a great job in cutting that back. Over time, we may have to spend more capital in maintaining our facilities and so forth.

So you're exactly right with the plan we have right now, I mean, as I said, Kathleen I feel like we've turned the corner, we can see the way forward without further asset sales, without further equity sales. We still have strategic decisions to make about the oil and gas business, and about PT-FI shares as part of our arrangements with the government. And we've got market uncertainties that we're going to have to monitor as we go along. But as I said, we see clarity now that we didn't have before and that clarity shows us the way to get to where we wanted to get to without having further assets. If we could have an asset sale that could be less dilutive and an equity sale, that's the way we'd evaluate it.

We sold Lundin, our Candelaria mine in Chile. So -- and we love the asset. I mean, really like having this part of the portfolio. So when circumstances required to sell it, everybody was disappointed. We were disappointed, Lundin was disappointed, was disappointed, the government was disappointed. So we've had it and this was not unexpected. So we've had to deal with that disappointment. We have confidence that CMAP, China Molly is a good partner. And they are going to be a good partner for the country and they're taking steps to explain that both to Lundin and to the Gécamines and the government. The government would obviously, like to get some financial compensation out of this. But legally, this is a transaction that does not relate to Tenke Fungurume mining, which have a contract with the government. It's a higher tiered company. And there's no legal basis for anything other than continuation. So the China Molly and the Lundin are having discussions together about the future. Lundin has certain transfer rights that are publicly known. And they mutually made a decision that they would like to have some additional time to consider that -- those transfer rights and the partnership going forward. We don't expect any delay at China Molly's reporting to us that the approval rules that they're getting in the China. They have a strong economic interest in getting this thing closed and we're expecting them to do it. And they really emphasized in their communications process that the benefits to the government of the Congo and employees, and the community will be sustained going forward.

And the fact of that is deferring the time when the decline hits us. So sort of like what we're doing here in the mining business, we're looking at different scenarios of where can you invest over time at the lowest risk, minimizing capital kind of investments to arrest that decline. But we have several years to deal with that. But looking at in the long-term future would require reinvestment to maintain these levels of production. And respectively for, there's ways of growing because we've identified a number of potential drilling opportunities by -- that don't require new platform development because we have all these unused capacity in the existing platforms. So there's great opportunity here. It does require capital and the Deepwater has significant capital. and time lags, before bringing production on stream.

And the initial projections were based on analogists data from the area, from other experiences. And so there was just limited data. And this is common in the industry. And when these wells came on stream that was readily apparent that the crude oil quality in sense of permeability throughout the field was different than expected, the viscosity was measurably higher than the pretest expectations. And so it was the case of where wells weren't able to produce what they were expected to produce used, and it was fairly significant.

I keep telling all these people who are sitting on the other table by negotiating right now I wish I were in your shoes. I wish we had a company where we could be buying assets right now rather than selling them. But the were not the we can't wish that the way we are what we are. But look, Dave, I'd be fine to be in that condition to have good markets, long-term investments. If you generate excess cash over funding those investments give the right capital structure the earlier question about what would be a good debt level to have in that environment if you have excess cash, payer shareholders."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. 
Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filing.
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer of FCX; and Red Conger, President of Americas and Africa. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, we'll open -- after our remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. 
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $479 million, $0.38 per share for the second quarter of 2016. As detailed in the release, the net loss attributable to the common stock included special items totaling $452 million or $0.36 per share during the second quarter, primarily for the previously reported drillship settlements and impairment of our oil and gas properties, partly offset by net gains on the sale of assets. After adjusting for these net charges, our second quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $27 million or $0.02 a share. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for second quarter 2016 approximated $966 million. We have a slide in the deck that shows you the roll forward of getting to that number. And during the second quarter, we completed previously announced asset sales for aggregate consideration of $1.3 billion, that included the $1 billion sale of the additional 13% undivided interest in Morenci during May. And also in May, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in TF Holdings Limited for $2.65 billion in cash and contingent consideration of up to $120 million. 
In accordance with accounting guidelines, as you'll see in the release, the results of Tenke are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the quarter, our consolidated sales volumes totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper, 156,000 ounces of gold, 19 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.4 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our average price of copper was $2.18 per pound that was below last year's second quarter average of $2.71 per pound. Gold averaged $1292 during the quarter that was above last year's quarterly average of $1174. And our realized price for crude oil of $41 per barrel was below last year's quarterly average price of just under $68 per barrel, which included $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts. 
Unit net cash costs for the quarter averaged $1.33 per pound. That was lower as expected than the year ago period of $1.50 per pound. And that primarily reflects the higher copper volumes and economies of scale that have come in during the quarter as anticipated and the impact of ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, partly offset by lower gold and silver credits. We generated operating cash flows during the quarter of $874 million, which exceeded our capital expenditures of $833 million during the quarter. 
As previously reported, we have exchanged some of our senior notes into equity through July 25. Yesterday, we exchanged a total of $369 million in face amount of bonds at a cost of $311 million or approximately 28 million shares of our common stock in a series of privately negotiated transactions. Our debt at the end of June was $19.3 billion and consolidated cash was approximately $350 million. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. And we ended the quarter, currently have approximately 1.33 billion common shares outstanding, which includes the shares that we issued through yesterday in connection with the settlement of the debt exchanges. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to our slide materials and discussing our operations and outlook."

I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit before we turn to the quarter, and we have some important facts to talk about -- situations to talk about with the quarte",5451,"Thanks, Kathleen, and I thank all of you for joining us today. I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit before we turn to the quarter, and we have some important facts to talk about -- situations to talk about with the quarter, and we'll cover those in detail. But it's -- I believe, it's important for you to understand that we feel very good about the progress we've made during the first half of the year. 
Late last night, as we were putting the finishing touches on today's presentation, Kathleen and I were reflecting aback about where our company stood a year ago. A year ago, oil prices were in the mid-$60 barrel, copper prices were $2.70. We were talking about controlling costs and talking about strategic alternatives for our oil and gas business. As 2015 proceeded and going into 2016, oil prices dropped at one point below $30 a barrel, copper prices dropped below $2 a pound. There was a lot of uncertainties about our company because of the debt level witnessed the way our bonds traded and our CDS has traded. 
We took steps. We reorganized our board. The board -- the restructured board emphasized our focus on the future of our company being in the mining business. We restructured our management teams and we took actions. When we had our year-end earnings call, there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to execute the plans that we needed to execute to address our balance sheet issues, a lot of skepticism. And internally, there was a lot of -- there was a lack of clarity about not where we were going, we knew what we had to do, but how we would get there, how the market would react to it.
So looking back, we said then that we would sell assets, raise capital targeting $5 billion to $10 billion. And we went to work. As we were doing that, Red and his team, and our global operating teams focused on executing our business plans. And when you look at the charts on the side of Page 3, Slide 3, you can see how effective we've been doing that. We've reduced our site production and delivery cost before byproduct credits by 25% -- 23%. Oil and gas business, we've cut our production costs from $19 a barrel to $15 a barrel. 
We cut CapEx. We completed our major expansion project at Cerro Verde, which a year ago was a significant undertaking and risk for our company and it is a very complex project. As it was completed, it was the largest processing facility in the history of the mining industry. And it was a big project, $4.5-plus billion. We reduced CapEx in the oil and gas business. We undertook to sell assets in a market that had uncertainties. We did this to strengthen our balance sheet. But as a surprise to some people, we were able to achieve valuations that reflected a positive view of the long-term copper market, we had that a year ago, we continue to have that today, and I'll talk about it. 
Not only does this generate cash to reduce our debt, but it highlights value of Freeport's assets as we go forward. We raised -- we have raised today over $4 billion or in position to complete transactions to raise it by only selling 9% of our copper reserves. We had an effort to sell our oil and gas business or assets. It was a tough time to do that. We restructured the business to operate within its cash flows. We reorganized the business. We dealt with some major obligations that had been committed to in past times when the strategy was to grow that business aggressively, and we made some tough decisions to restructure drilling contracts and other contracts. And we continue to view strategically how these assets fit into our long-term business, and we understand their values. And we will look over time to see how to generate value for our shareholders out of those assets. 
Our copper volumes are growing with the successful Cerro Verde start up at 15% quarter-to-quarter, year-on-year increase. And we'll step back and look at how our company is now positioned for free cash flow generation. As we were talking last night, Kathleen and I and our management team feel that we've truly turned the corner for Freeport. And our ability to do that wasn't just clearcut as we started the year. We've proved that our assets are attractive. And our strategy, and we'll talk about how our financial strategy fits with our long-term business strategy, is focused on leading us with a core set of assets to build long-term value for shareholders. It would be one thing just to sell assets simply to raise cash. But we've kept a view about what will Freeport be for the long-term and which of our assets will be there to allow us to take advantage of our core competencies as a company and also to take advantage of what we believe will be a long-term copper market. So that was always in our mind as to what did we want to be left with after we sold assets.
So looking on Page 4. We have set a target of reducing our debt to $10 billion. Our debt at June 30 is just below $19 billion, and we have a contract to sell our Tenke asset with the related assets that we'd be selling for $2.8 billion. Now if we look forward at different scenarios of copper prices and with successful execution of our plans, you can see what our debt levels would be at $2 copper, $2.25 copper and $2.50 copper at the end of 2017. That reflects the transactions that we sold that we have contracts for. It does not include any divestment of PT-FI shares. And we have a strategy of working with the government of Indonesia to sell an incremental approximately 20% of PT-FI contingent when we're getting our contract extension. 
We will consider further asset steps -- strategic steps. For example, if this doesn't include any sales of our oil and gas business, and I want to emphasize that as we look at any divestment of PT-FI, it's a condition that we sell those assets at a fair value to our company. And so as we looked at this, and if we take into account the risk possibility of copper prices trading down throughout the financial community today and with many of the experts that follow the industry, there is a risk, that because of the lower growth in China and global economic uncertainties, that we may have to deal with lower than today's copper prices in the short term. I'm going to talk about the longer-term view, but we have to live through the short term to experience the benefits of a positive long-term market. 
So we sit here with a balancing act. The balancing act was to look at these debt levels, understand what it's going to take operationally to get to those, then think about what next steps should we take to address the uncertainties of the short-term market. And we are still open and on the table for all strategic moves, whether that means selling assets, selling the company, we're focused really on creating value for our shareholders. And to create that long-term value, our recent history with this company shows us we need to have a strong balance sheet to allow us to be positioned to aggressively take care of the long-term values. 
We've had ongoing discussions about other asset sales. We're continuing those. We look at capital market transactions. And today, we've announced that we have plans to file the necessary documents to allow us to issue another $1.5 billion of stock through and at the market offering. Our company has had success with these in the past. We did one in 2008, 2009 crisis. We've done 2 of these offerings last year when our financial situation was more dire. What this allows us to do is to assess the market and if the market is available to us on a day by day basis to sell shares into the marketplace when there's demand for them. And so we have -- we felt looking at these numbers that this was a step that if we can successfully execute it. Absent just a collapse in the market, we basically have a path forward of achieving what we set out to achieve. 
There is no requirement to sell further assets. There is no requirement to sell further equity. We've got it now, which we didn't have 6 months ago, a clearcut path as to how to get our financial situation to the point where we wanted to get it to. And we will have done it in a way that we can hold on to what we believe is our highest-quality assets to build the company for the future. 
Now those assets -- the transactions to date are listed on Page 5. It includes the successful sale of an incremental interest -- an incremental 13% interest to our long time and highly-valued partner, Sumitomo in Morenci. That transaction is closed. We have a series of other smaller transactions. And the Tenke Fungurume transaction, which is where we have a contract and working with the buyer, China Molybdenum, they are proceeding with the necessary regulatory steps in China to get the transaction closed. Their reports are that that's going very well. They have to have a shareholder vote since there is a minority public ownership. So the shareholder vote doesn't involve uncertainties as to the outcome, but procedurally it has to be conducted. All indications are that this transaction is going to be closed as anticipated in the fall. And so that would generate for us, considering all factors, something between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. I'm pleased with that. 
Now what then does Freeport have left? I mean, it's a great set of assets. We will have 7 copper mines led by our flagship mine Morenci into the North America. We also have 2 molybdenum mines, and we have a great molybdenum business, largest producer, the lowest-cost producer. We have 2 pure molybdenum mines in North America and byproduct produced at our other mines. We also have 2 great mines in South America; Cerro Verde, which I'll talk about; and El Abra, where we and our partner, CODELCO, are doing studies now for the potential for a major expansion of that property only when market conditions allow.
Now one other things as we've really gotten into this and evaluated potential transactions and buyers is really a recognition of how much value we create by having this set of assets run together. These are mines, which benefit significantly from the synergies of being able to share people, technology, equipment to have the flexibility of focusing on growth projects at one of these mines or the other and looking at how to fit those together in a long-term plan for ultimately growing volumes. They have -- you can see in these bubbles, really huge resources, over 30 billion pounds of copper reserves each in North America and South America, significant molybdenum beyond proved reserves, huge amounts of mineralized material and future growth projects. 
We have a growth pipeline for this industry with these assets that extends as far as you can see. And we also have the ability of executing these when it make sense in undertaking low-risk executable transactions without having to do it. We can run a really rational business strategy of generating profits and focusing on long-term growth in a very businesslike and rational way. And when we look at how those values fit together, we felt really it makes a lot of sense to keep the assets together for our future. And Red and his team just do an outstanding job in running this business. 
The Grasberg mine in Indonesia is a real special asset. I mean, it is special in many ways because of its physical location, but extraordinary because of high grades of both copper and gold in the same ore. It's a tough mine to run, but we've done it for a long time now. We began the development -- we've been there since early '70s in Indonesia and Papua. And we've developed the Grasberg during the 1990s and now have operated until we can see the end of the life of the open pit, the transition to an underground. We've got issues to deal with. We've always had issues to deal with there, operationally, managing environment, working with local community, working with the changes in the Indonesian government. But underlying that is an extraordinary asset, and we want to work cooperatively with the people of Indonesia and its government in a way to generate benefits that are mutual for both of us. And that's what we're doing. 
Now where are we today with copper markets? The surpluses today are relatively small in the marketplace and lower than people expect it, not too long ago as to where they were. The new supply that people like us had initiated with projects following the financial crisis of 2008, 2009. Some have been delayed, some have been deferred, but the new supply is basically coming on as expected. A recent feature is that there are significantly lower disruptions than had been experienced in the industry, disruptions from labor issues, disruptions for mine and operational issues, from equipment issues. So we've had a case of where the mine -- the industry has been producing basically what was available to it. And even with that -- even with the new supply, the lower disruptions, the lowered growth in China, the lower growth globally because all the economic issues affecting the world, the projected medium-term deficits -- in the projected medium term, it looks like we're going to be having deficits even with very modest demand growth. So rather than the market being overwhelmed with supply, there's ample copper around the world today, so the market is fully supplied. But it's not being overwhelmed with new supplies and continued production even with very modest demand growth.
And as you go forward, existing mines will produce less. People aren't investing in new projects. There's barriers to project development that relate to environmental, community, country issues. And as we've shown in this process that we've had about selling properties, there is a significantly higher than current price required to develop new production. You just simply can't do it. And we know because we've got huge resources to develop, and we're working on plans to development. It will require higher copper price and absent -- a complete deterioration or significant deterioration, or absent China market or global market, we're heading for a time when copper prices are going to be higher. That is illustrated on Page 8. Now I want to say what this is and what it isn't. This shows projected existing supply before any disruption allowance from existing mines. It doesn't take into account new projects even those projects that today look probable. But it just shows that over the next 10 years, existing mines production is expected to decline on the order of 20%, that's roughly 4 million tons. Today, the top 10 mines in the world produce about 5.5 million tons per year. And according to Wood Mackenzie, the incentive price for new development is $3.30 pound. We know how long it takes to develop new mines. With all these resources, 100 billion pounds reserves, a 100 billion pounds of mineralized material, more resources beyond that. If we were to start today to say let's develop an AFV to develop a new mine, it's on the order of 10 years before we have new production. And that can't be changed. That's not economic fact, that's reality of getting permits, getting mine plans, getting things organized. That's just the way it's required. 
Now we did this with Cerro Verde. Cerro Verde is a tremendous asset. It was started many years ago. It was discovered in the 20th century -- in the 19th century. And it was started as a very small SX/EW operation. As we acquired Phelps Dodge,  they were completing a major milling expansion in 2006, little bit rough start off, as read, not know then. And now we've done this $4.5 billion project on budget. We've taken our mill rate from a year ago from 116,000 tons a day to 352,000 tons a day. Think of that, 352,000 through the mill. We're mining over 600,000 tons a day. Our sales have gone from 100 million pounds to 270 million pounds. Our unit costs have gone from $1.87 to $1.22. It will be a very long-term contributor to the future of our company. This is an asset that we could sell at a very attractive value. 
We could conduct just a formal auction of this, it would raise a lot of money. But we believe that this is the kind of core asset that we need to keep, and our financial plan now will allow us to keep it, we weren't sure we could do that going into this year to build our company around for the future. 
We went back and looked at 3 of our key mines Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg. And before we really started on this process, we wanted to show just how the districts that we operate in have changed over the years and what we have to continue to build on. In 1988, Morenci, as you went to the '80s, the '90s and early 2000s, there were reports talking about the death of the Southwest copper district in the U.S. and Mexico. 
Morenci had relatively small reserves. We've had significant production since then. We have significant remaining reserves and potential beyond those reserves. There will be a time, not in the very near term, but we'll be announcing a major further mill expansion at Morenci to develop the sulfide reserves. Cerro Verde now is essentially fully developed. But as we look below the existing outline for the pit that will support the expansion, there's further resources there. And at Grasberg, you know, Grasberg was discovered in 1988, developed during the 1990s to become one of the mining industries great assets. And we've got 25 years left on our contract and a great future there. 
Then when we look broadly, and as I said, we look at this set of assets in North America and South America as a set of assets managed together to take advantage. We have very large copper sulfate opportunities that have been much better defined since our Phelps Dodge acquisition through our core drilling and exploration analysis and it's a consistent story. And mines like Bhagdad, which is our mine with a long life, operational challenges because of principally water availability and some land for tailings and so forth, but have a very significant resource. Recently, at a 100-year-old mine in New Mexico, Chino, which has been viewed as being at the very end of its life, we've been able to recently produce some incremental volumes while understanding the ore body better. And then identifying the potential for a large-scale sulfide future development at Chino. 
El Abra in Chile, I mentioned earlier, as we've first got into this after the Phelps Dodge acquisition, we saw this as a project with a very limited life. Exploration, drilling and analysis have shown an enormous sulfide resource that requires some investments to get water and power to it and to develop the mine. But this is a -- this is a Cerro Verde-type project for the future, and we're doing the work to position us for it. New Morenci has a mine called Safford, which was also developed by Phelps Dodge right before our acquisition. It has an adjoining ore resource that has been known for years. As we now approach the completion of the mining of the ox ore material at Safford, we're looking at this lone star resource, which has the opportunity to provide additional oxide ore to extend the life of facilities at Safford, but a huge, huge sulfide resource underlying it. We're doing work to see how to take advantage of that. I mentioned Morenci, Sierrita is a mine with significant molybdenum resource. But again, very large potential resource development. 
All of these developments, I want to talk about them because of how it fits into our near-term financial strategy. We're retaining these opportunities to grow our company in the future. Very simple, we're not going to start spending money on these capital projects until the market justifies it. But we'll have that underlying our company. 
Now short term, Kathleen and I talked to Red and his team about what could they do to mitigate production declines without doing major capital expansion projects. How to do it with minimum capital? And they are undertaking a project to deal with steepening pit walls around our company. By optimizing slopes, it will allow us to target opportunities to minimize stripping and add ore. This would result in lower cost and adding ore available for current production without having to do major development project. This is a process that we're approaching very carefully. Because we want to do it by adhering to our established safety factors for protecting pit walls, but it allows us to have the potential to accelerate ore in the medium-term, add incremental ore to our reserves. We're in the early stages of this, but we're very encouraged about what we might be able to do with it, and we'll be reporting to you as we go forward. 
Now at Grasberg. We are at a stage of this mine where we are completing the mining of the open pit. And if you can see the schematic of the ore bodies, we're producing now from the DOZ. We've developed the DMLZ extension of the DOZ. And it has commenced production and it will provide significant ore to us going forward. We are continuing for the development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is the extension of the ore body beyond pit limits, and we're prepared to do that. It would allow us to continue operations beyond the depletion of the pit and begin ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave by having this infrastructure development. We can't mine from the block cave until the pit is complete because we use block caving methods, which results in surface subsidence. 
And an ongoing issue we've had is the need to have an extension of our contract because the funds we're spending to develop the block cave are for productions that at large will be produced beyond 2021. And so we've been having this ongoing assessment about whether to continue these capital expenditures. If we were to defer those, there would be significant adverse consequences, both for our company and for the government of Indonesia, because it would defer the initiation of the ramp up of the block cave going forward in the future. 
Today, we have access to the ore at the very lower limits of the open pit. That means we're not doing much stripping at all. It has very high-grade ore. Our mining rate is 2/3 lower than its maximum, 43% lower. There's limited access to the pit. So that means it creates some operational issues for us. And in this quarter, we had a couple of things to deal with: One, we had as we had talked about on our last call, a mechanical issue to repair with one of our big SAG mills. That was done more quickly than we anticipated. And we have experienced some issues with part of our workforce. And this is the workforce that actually operates the big trucks and shovels in the Grasberg open pit. They've had some grievances. There's been some slowdown in work there. And it had an impact on this year -- this quarter's volumes. 
A couple of points to emphasize. Well, let me start by saying we are working with the union and the workers to resolve these grievances. We're making progress with that, and we believe that we will be successful in dealing with that. But -- it was lower volumes now, but that ore is not going away. It will be mined and produced in the future, it's a matter of timing. It may mean -- it will likely mean -- it will mean that we'll be continuing to mine from the open pit into the early part of 2018 rather than completing it in 2017. So it's a short-term timing issue. We believe we have it solved. We're really focused on executing there and believe our team can do it. 
We do have with the Indonesian government an export permit that will be required by the first week -- roughly first week of August, its August 8. We have been given assurances from the Mines Ministry and the highest levels in government that we will be able to get that permit, and we expect to obtain it on a timely basis. Longer term, we are having ongoing discussions following up on our letter from October of last year about the long-term extension of our contract. Those discussions have been constructive. With the senior officials of the government clearly recognize the need for investment more broadly within Indonesia and to achieve that goal, they have commented publicly on the need to treat existing investors like Freeport fairly. There's been some political realignment within the President, the parliament in the first quarter -- the first half of the year. We believe all that's going to be positive for getting a resolution and feel that the timing for doing that now as opposed to where it's been over the last 6 months is much more positive, and we're going to, I believe, following up on that. So that's kind of where we are at Grasberg. And I'll be prepared to follow your -- answer your questions. 
Slide 14 just shows how really good our mining business is. It shows in 2015, when copper price averaged $2.42, our EBITDA matched our capital spending. Now in the first half, with the completion of Cerro Verde, the drop-off in CapEx even at a copper price of averaging $2.16, EBITDA is significantly higher than CapEx. And as we look forward for the full year in 2016 with copper prices averaging for the remainder of the year at $2 to $2.50, we have a substantially higher EBITDA than the $1.7 billion of expected CapEx for the year. The adjustments for EBITDA reflect the changes that I previously talked about at Grasberg, the sale of the interest of Morenci and other factors there, but it shows how profitable our business will be now and as we go forward. 
In the oil and gas business, we really had a focus on managing costs and enhancing, protecting the asset values. We reduced cost -- outside capital cost by roughly $150 million. That's about 1/3 or more reduction in G&A cost and resulting other cost. We've restructured the really large commitments under the 3 Deepwater drillships that we had contracts for. We talked about that last time and that's in the supplemental slides, if you want to go back and review it. We've established production in the Deepwater from 5 new wells that were drilled to tie back to our production facilities. There were 3 wells at Holstein Deep and 2 wells in the Horn Mountain area. 
We'll talk about the Holstein production because those wells, the production results have been disappointing for factors related to the quality of the oil and the nature of the reservoirs. And that's just what it is. But overall, the production from wells that we've previously drilled have come on as expected, unfortunately these did not. But we have had favorable results from the development of the outside operator and large projects at Lucius and Heidelberg. But we have achieved our goal of ending the subsidy of our oil and gas operations from the mining business. And you can see that on Page 16 where we show the oil and gas EBITDA at various prices, the CapEx in '17 has been reduced to $600 million. And you can see that what kind of EBITDA we would have at various prices ranging from $500 million at $35 to $1.5 billion at $65. 
The Deepwater business is built around these 3 assets -- 3 production facilities, formally owned by BP and Shell. And they are 100% our own. They have significant processing capacity and significant unused processing capacity, which creates value for both us and perspective purchasers of these assets. 
Our outlook for 2016 updated for our experience in Indonesia continues to show copper sales of $5 billion -- 5 million -- 5 billion pounds. Our Sierrita mine, which we anticipated closing and went to work and found ways of providing some volumes that have very attractive cost level that offset the lower production in Indonesia. Gold production reflects the Indonesia issues that we talked about. 
Molybdenum increases because of -- principally because of Sierrita and because markets have improved some and the oil production is lower. We have sold our interest in the Haynesville gas field. And so those barrels equivalent are out. There's been an operational issue because of the gas plant problem in Pascagoula, Mississippi, that's limited some of our production as well as the start up production at the -- with our 3 new wells. Operating cash flows at $2.25 copper are modeled to be $4.5 billion with substantial leverage of $260 million for each $0.10 change in the copper price. Unit costs are consistent with previous guidance. And on this basis, it's $1.06 a pound and capital spending is a couple of $100 billion less than previous guidance. 
Our sales profile as we look forward from 2015 to '16, we got 5 billion pounds that I just talked about. That would drop in 2017 principally because of the sale of Tenke is the big factor there that is expected to close later this year, and we reduced volumes. You can see the goal coming out of Grasberg as we mined the end of the pit. And what our molybdenum and oil sales will be. Our chart that we show each quarter for EBITDA and cash flows show it over a range of $2 and $2.50. It shows operating cash flows ranging from $3.5 billion to $5 billion over those copper prices. And then capital expenditures, and we're going to manage this in relation to market conditions, would be dropping from $6,350,000,000 in 2015 to just over $3 billion this year to $2.3 billion in 2017. So the cash flow numbers that we talked about earlier reflect substantial cash coming out of the operation of our business. 
Kathleen went over with you the 389 [ph] exchanges in which we were able to retire roughly $370 million of debt at a cost in terms of the share price of $311 million. We'll continue to look for opportunities like this. And then when we look at our balance sheet and our ability to manage it, not only do we have a plan of getting our debt down, which we believe by the end of '17 will be at an acceptable level to allow us to focus on growth as market conditions allow, we also have ways of dealing with our near-term maturities. Half of the proceeds of the Tenke transaction will be used to reduce our bank term loans, pursuant to our agreement with the banks. The remaining half will then be available as cash to retire the deal with our 2017 maturities. 
So we've dealt with '16 and '17, and we're going to continue to be looking at capital market transactions to with -- let me just say nonequity capital markets transactions in a way to deal and maximize our maturity picture going forward. 
So this is a little chart we use as we've talked about proving our metal for this year in an enthusiastic and resilient manner. And I'm pleased to report for the first 6 months, we've got a great track record of doing that and moving our sales forward on a really clearly defined business and financial strategy. 
So thank you for bearing with me with all of that. I felt like it was an important quarter to cover these things and now I look forward to your questions."

While we have found some ways, and we continue to search for ways to defer capital, we changed the mine plans and have done certain things. What we have not done yet is defer the necessary steps that would allow us to begin ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave production once the pit is completed, now that will be early 2018. So the balancing act, and this has been a major point of focus for us in the first half the year, I went to Grasberg and I sat down with our team, we did a detailed review of what it would mean if we were simply to defer the spending of the $1 billion a year that we've been spending recently to develop this underground resource. Now what would happen, it would be significant layoffs. And we're over 90% of the economy in Mimika. The resulting social disruptions there, which are of significant concern, are unknown. If for sure we'd do what you just said, it would result in a deferral for the ramp up of the Grasberg Block Cave. And once you demobilize the team that's working on this, remobilizing that team and coming back in would be a significant exercise beyond just the time deferral of spending it. And that would have a major negative impact, as I said, both on us and on the government. Now we are basing our decision to do this on the assurances we've received from the government in recent years, but most clearly articulated in the October 8 letter last year that they will extend our contract, and recent -- my recent discussions with the highest level of officials in the government reaffirm that commitment to doing that. So we are saying that we need to have that done in the near term, explaining to them the consequences if we -- to them, as well as to us, of deferring those expenditures. But to date, we have not made that major decision. So we're online -- that work by the way has gone exceedingly well. And the underlying economics are strongly in favor of us doing what we're doing."

That's G&A and other costs that might be reported as lease operating expenses for example. That reflects a major reduction in employment there. And we're still working on costs for office facilities and other support facilities. So that is sustainable. We had previously, beginning in 2015, although we've had a culture of doing this all along, have been very tough on managing costs in our mining business. Part that over time where we may end up having to increase some costs as Kathleen has been working really strongly with Red and his team about reducing maintenance capital in the mining business. And we've done a great job in cutting that back. Over time, we may have to spend a bit more capital in maintaining our facilities and so forth. But other then the Grasberg investments that I just talked about, we don't see major new capital projects in the mining business until the market warrants it."

But we're still telling the market and tell bankers if you've got ideas for our business, come share them with us. We've had a lot of interest and lot of discussions. And that's when I talked about the balancing act. The balancing act is what we could raise, what we'll be left with to build the company around. And whereas the beginning of the year, we didn't know. We thought we might have to sell some of these core assets. We thought we might have to sell Cerro Verde. We made a lot of interest in it. So you're exactly right with the plan we have now, as I said, Kathleen and I feel like we've turned the corner, we can see the way forward without further asset sales, without further equity sales. We still have strategic decisions to make about the oil and gas business, and about PT-FI shares as part of our arrangements with the government. And we've got market uncertainties that we're going to have to monitor as we go along. But as I said, we see clarity now that we didn't have before and that clarity shows us the way to get to where we wanted to get to without having further assets. So if we can have an asset sale that could be less dilutive than an equity sale, that's the way we'd evaluate it. We want to do -- we want to get to where we need to get to in terms of having a good balance sheet and do it in the most -- the least dilutive fashion that we could get to."

I mean, it was rocky at the start but we've built a great relationship. We've operated the mine in a first-class fashion. We've had a great relationship with Gécamines, a state-owned company that owns an interest in Tenke Fungurume mining, and accepting a relationship with Lundin, our partner there. We sold Lundin our Candelaria mine in Chile. So -- and we love the asset. I mean, we really like having this part of our portfolio. So when circumstances required to sell it, everybody was disappointed. We were disappointed, Lundin was disappointed, Gécamines was disappointed, the government was disappointed. So we've had it and this was not unexpected. So we had to deal with that disappointment. We have confidence that CMAP, China Moly is a good partner. And they are going to be a good partner for the country and they're taking steps to explain that both to Lundin and to the Gécamines and the government. The government would, obviously, like to get some financial compensation out of this. But legally, this is a transaction that does not relate to Tenke Fungurume mining, which has a contract with the government. It's at the higher tier company. And there's no legal basis for anything other than continuation. So the China Moly and Lundin are having discussions together about the future. Lundin has certain transfer rights that are publicly known. And they mutually made a decision that they would like to have some additional time to consider that -- those transfer rights and their partnership going forward. We don't expect any delay that China Moly is reporting to us the approvals that they're getting in China and they have a strong economic interest to getting this thing closed and we expecting them to do it. And they really emphasized in their communications process that the benefits to the Government of the Congo and employees, and the community will be sustained going forward and there's no changes in that."

It's apples and oranges to Grasberg in terms of size, grade, profitability and so forth. And I think the country is taking pride that an Indonesian group is stepping up to buy.

I was just there last week and that's -- that was the key focus of what we're talking about. You're right in saying the nature of oil and gas production in the Deepwater, the Gulf of Mexico involves inherent declines. We have the benefit for several years now of wells that were drilled since we acquired Plains in 2013 that we have hooked up and have begun production on. And the fact of that is deferring the time when the decline hits us. So sort of like what we're doing here in the mining business, we're looking at different scenarios of where can you invest over time at the lowest risk, minimizing capital kinds of investments to arrest that decline. But we have several years to deal with that. But looking out in the long-term future would require reinvestment to maintain these levels of production. And respectively for buyers there's ways of growing it because we've identified a number of potential drilling opportunities by -- that don't require new platform development because we have all this unused capacity in the existing platforms. So there's great opportunity here. It does require capital and the Deepwater has significant capital and time lags before we bring its production on stream. There is -- in this Vito basin area there's tremendous opportunities. And that's what I'm saying and strategically we're seeing our focus is going to be on the copper business. We want to make sure that if we talk to people about buying the assets or joint venture relationships, for people who might want to come in over time and invest with us to help minimize our capital.

And the initial projections were based on analogists data from the area, from other experiences. And so there was just limited data and this is common in the industry. And when these wells came on stream, it was readily apparent that the crude oil quality, the [ph] permeability throughout the field was different than expected, the viscosity was measurably higher than the pretest expectations. And so it was just the case of where the wells weren't able to produce what they were expected to produce, and it was fairly significant.

We've got site collection done. We're working with preliminary engineering, design, we've got a real clear view of what it would be required. But we can't spend significant capital on it without having a contract extension. Just think about it. We start today, the smelter construction period extends at least into 2019. And if you don't have assurance on your contract, they're not going to build a smelter and not have that assurance. The same way with divestiture. We've indicated a willingness to invest even though our contracted work has no requirements that we do legally in terms of trying to meet the aspirations of the people of Indonesia and its government. We've said we would divest an incremental 20-plus percent. But again, that would only happen if we have a contract extension. The valuation of this business, if you just say we got a contract through 2021 is unreasonable based on the investments that we've made. The investments we've made has been to develop this resource for the next 25 years. And for our shareholders, we couldn't sell it without getting a return on those investments and the fair valuation for operations extending over the next 25 years. So that's conditional in the contract as well."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. 
Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer of FCX; and Red Conger, President of Americas and Africa. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, we'll open -- after our remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. 
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $479 million, $0.38 per share for the second quarter of 2016. As detailed in the release, the net loss attributable to common stock included special items totaling $452 million or $0.36 per share during the second quarter, primarily for the previously reported drillship settlements and impairment of our oil and gas properties, partly offset by net gains on the sale of assets. After adjusting for these net charges, our second quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $27 million or $0.02 a share. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for second quarter 2016 approximated $966 million. We have a slide in the deck that shows you the roll forward of getting to that number. And during the second quarter, we completed previously announced asset sales for aggregate consideration of $1.3 billion, that included the $1 billion sale of the additional 13% undivided interest in Morenci during May. And also in May, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in TF Holdings Limited for $2.65 billion in cash and contingent consideration of up to $120 million. 
In accordance with accounting guidelines, as you'll see in the release, the results of Tenke are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the quarter, our consolidated sales volumes totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper, 156,000 ounces of gold, 19 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.4 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our average price of copper was $2.18 per pound that was below last year's second quarter average of $2.71 per pound. Gold averaged $1292 during the quarter that was above last year's quarterly average of $1174. And our realized price for crude oil of $41 per barrel was below last year's quarterly average price of just under $68 per barrel, which included $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts. 
Unit net cash costs for the quarter averaged $1.33 per pound. That was lower as expected than the year ago period of $1.50 per pound. And that primarily reflects the higher copper volumes and economies of scale that have come in during the quarter as anticipated and the impact of ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, partly offset by lower gold and silver credits. We generated operating cash flows during the quarter of $874 million, which exceeded our capital expenditures of $833 million during the quarter. 
As previously reported, we have exchanged some of our senior notes into equity through July 25. Yesterday, we exchanged a total of $369 million in face amount of bonds at a cost of $311 million or approximately 28 million shares of our common stock in a series of privately negotiated transactions. Our debt at the end of June was $19.3 billion and consolidated cash was approximately $350 million. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. And we ended the quarter, currently have approximately 1.33 billion common shares outstanding, which includes the shares that we issued through yesterday in connection with the settlement of the debt exchanges. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to our slide materials and discussing our operations and outlook."

I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit before we turn to the quarter, and we have some important facts to talk about -- situations to talk about with the quarter,",5467,"Thanks, Kathleen, and thank all of you for joining us today. I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit before we turn to the quarter, and we have some important facts to talk about -- situations to talk about with the quarter, and we'll cover those in detail. But it's -- I believe, it's important for you to understand that we feel very good about the progress we've made during the first half of the year. 
Late last night, as we were putting the finishing touches on today's presentation, Kathleen and I were reflecting aback about where our company stood a year ago. A year ago, oil prices were in the mid-$60 a barrel, copper prices were $2.70. We were talking about controlling costs and talking about strategic alternatives for our oil and gas business. As 2015 proceeded and going into 2016, oil prices dropped, at one point, below $30 a barrel, copper prices dropped below $2 a pound. There was a lot of uncertainties about our company because of the debt level, witness the way our bonds traded and our CDS has traded. 
We took steps. We reorganized our board. The board -- the restructured board emphasized our focus on the future of our company being in the mining business. We restructured our management team and we took actions. When we had our year-end earnings call, there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to execute the plans that we needed to execute to address our balance sheet issues, a lot of skepticism. And internally, there was a lot of -- there was a lack of clarity about -- not where we were going, we knew what we had to do, but how we would get there, how the market would react to it.
So looking back, we said then that we would sell assets, raise capital targeting $5 billion to $10 billion. And we went to work. As we were doing that, Red and his team and our global operating teams focused on executing our business plans. And when you look at the charts on the side of Page 3, Slide 3, you can see how effective we've been doing that. We've reduced our site production and delivery costs before byproduct credits by 25% -- 23%. Oil and gas business, we've cut our production costs from $19 a barrel to $15 a barrel. 
We cut CapEx. We completed our major expansion project at Cerro Verde, which a year ago was a significant undertaking and risk for our company and it is a very complex project. As it was completed, it was the largest processing facility in the history of the mining industry. And it was a big project, $4.5-plus billion. We reduced CapEx in the oil and gas business. We undertook to sell assets in a market that had uncertainties. We did this to strengthen our balance sheet. But it was a surprise to some people, we were able to achieve valuations that reflected a positive view of the long-term copper market, we had that a year ago, we continue to have that today, and I'll talk about it. 
Not only does this generate cash to reduce our debt but it highlights value of Freeport's assets as we go forward. We raised -- we have raised to date over $4 billion, or in position to complete transactions to raise it, by only selling 9% of our copper reserves. We had an effort to sell our oil and gas business or assets. It was a tough time to do that. We restructured the business to operate within its cash flows. We reorganized the business. We dealt with some major obligations that had been committed to in past times when the strategy was to grow that business aggressively, and we made some tough decisions to restructure drilling contracts and other contracts. And we continue to view strategically how these assets fit into our long-term business, and we understand their values. And we will look over time to see how to generate value for our shareholders out of those assets. 
Our copper volumes are growing with the successful Cerro Verde start up, with 15% quarter-to-quarter, year-on-year increase. And we'll step back and look at how our company is now positioned for free cash flow generation. As we were talking last night, Kathleen and I and our management team feel that we have truly turned the corner for Freeport. And our ability to do that wasn't just clear-cut as we started the year. We've proved that our assets are attractive. And our strategy, and we'll talk about how our financial strategy fits with our long-term business strategy, is focused on leaving us with a core set of assets to build long-term value for shareholders. It would be one thing just to sell assets simply to raise cash. But we've kept a view about what will Freeport be for the long-term and which of our assets will be there to allow us to take advantage of our core competencies as a company and also to take advantage of what we believe will be a long-term copper market. So that was always in our mind as to what did we want to be left with after we sold assets.
So looking on Page 4. We have set a target of reducing our debt to $10 billion. Our debt at June 30 is just below $19 billion, and we have a contract to sell our Tenke asset with the related assets that we'd be selling for $2.8 billion. Now if we look forward at different scenarios of copper prices and with successful execution of our plans, you can see what our debt levels would be at $2 copper, $2.25 copper and $2.50 copper at the end of 2017. That reflects the transactions that we sold that we have contracts for. It does not include any divestment of PT-FI shares. And we have a strategy of working with the government of Indonesia to sell an incremental approximately 20% of PT-FI contingent on our getting our contract extension. 
We will consider further asset steps -- strategic steps. For example, this doesn't include any sales of our oil and gas business. And I want to emphasize that as we look at any divestment of PT-FI, it's a condition that we sell those assets at fair value to our company. And so as we looked at this, we take into account the risk possibility of copper prices trading down throughout the financial community today and with many of the experts that follow the industry, there is a risk that because of slower growth in China and global economic uncertainties that we may have to deal with lower than today's copper prices in the short term. I'm going to talk about the longer-term view, but we have to live through the short term to experience the benefits of a positive long-term market. 
So we sit here with a balancing act. The balancing act was to look at these debt levels, understand what it's going to take operationally to get to those, then think about what next steps should we take to address the uncertainties of the short-term market. And we are still open and on the table for all strategic moves, whether that means selling assets, selling the company. We're focused really on creating value for our shareholders and to create that long-term value, our recent history with this company shows us we need to have a strong balance sheet to allow us to be positioned to aggressively take care of the long-term values. 
We've had ongoing discussions about some other asset sales. We're continuing those. We looked at capital market transactions. And today, we've announced that we have plans to file the necessary documents to allow us to issue another $1.5 billion of stock through and at the market offering. Our company has had success with these in the past. We did one in the 2008, 2009 crisis. We've done 2 of these offerings last year when our financial situation was more dire. What this allows us to do is to assess the market and if the market is available to us on a day-by-day basis to sell shares into the marketplace when there's demand for them. And so we have -- we felt, looking at these numbers, that this was a step that, if we can successfully execute it, absent just a collapse in the market, we basically have a path forward of achieving what we set out to achieve. 
There is no requirement to sell further assets. There is no requirement to sell further equity. We've got a, now, which we didn't have 6 months ago, a clear-cut path as to how to get our financial situation to the point where we wanted to get it to. And we will have done it in a way that we can hold on to what we believe is our highest-quality assets to build the company for the future. 
Now those assets -- the transactions to date are listed on Page 5. It includes the successful sale of an incremental interest -- an incremental 13% interest to our long time and highly-valued partner, Sumitomo in Morenci. That transaction is closed. We have a series of other smaller transactions. And the Tenke Fungurume transaction, which is where we have a contract and working with the buyer, China Molybdenum, they are proceeding with the necessary regulatory steps in China to get the transaction closed. Their reports are that, that's going very well. They have to have a shareholder vote since there is a minority public ownership. So the shareholder vote doesn't involve uncertainties as to the outcome, but procedurally it has to be conducted. All indications are that this transaction is going to be closed as anticipated in the fall. And so that would generate for us, considering all factors, something between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. I'm pleased with that. 
Now what then does Freeport have left? I mean, it's a great set of assets. We will have 7 copper mines led by our flagship mine, Morenci, in North America. We also have 2 molybdenum mines, and we have a great molybdenum business, largest producer, lowest-cost producer. And we have 2 pure molybdenum mines in North America and byproduct produced at our other mines. We also have 2 great mines in South America; Cerro Verde, which I'll talk about; and El Abra, where we and our partner, CODELCO, are doing studies now for the potential for a major expansion of that property only when market conditions allow.
Now one of the things, as we've really gotten into this and evaluated potential transactions and buyers, is really a recognition of how much value we create by having this set of assets run together. These are mines, which benefit significantly from the synergies of being able to share people, technology, equipment to have the flexibility of focusing on growth projects at one of these mines or the other and looking at how to fit those together in a long-term plan for, ultimately, growing volumes. They have -- you can see in these bubbles, really huge resources, over 30 billion pounds of copper reserves each in North America and South America, significant molybdenum beyond proved reserves, huge amounts of mineralized material and future growth projects. 
We have a growth pipeline for this industry with these assets that extends as far as you can see. And we also have the ability of executing these when it makes sense in undertaking low-risk executable transactions without having to do it. We can run a really rational business strategy of generating profits and focusing on long-term growth in a very businesslike and rational way. And when we looked at how those values fit together, we felt really it makes a lot of sense to keep the assets together for our future. And Red and his team just do an outstanding job in running this business. 
The Grasberg mine in Indonesia is a real special asset. I mean, it is special in many ways because of its physical location, but extraordinary because of the high grades of both copper and gold in the same ore. It's a tough mine to run, but we've done it for a long time now. We began the development -- we've been there since the early '70s in Indonesia and Papua. And we've developed the Grasberg during the 1990s and now have operated until we can see the end of the life of the open pit, the transition to an underground. We've got issues to deal with. We've always had issues to deal with there, operationally, managing the environment, working with the local community, working with the changes in the Indonesian government. But underlying that is an extraordinary asset, and we want to work cooperatively with the people of Indonesia and its government in a way to generate benefits that are mutual for both of us. And that's what we're doing. 
Now where are we today with copper markets? The surpluses today are relatively small in the marketplace and lower than people expected not too long ago as to where they were. The new supply that people like us had initiated with projects following the financial crisis of 2008, 2009. Some have been delayed, some have been deferred, but the new supply is basically coming on as expected. A recent feature is that there are significantly lower disruptions than had been experienced in the industry, disruptions from labor issues, disruptions from mine and operational issues, from equipment issues. So we've had a case of where the mine -- the industry has been producing, basically, what was available to it. And even with that -- even with the new supply, the lower disruptions, the lowered growth in China, the lower growth globally because all the economic issues affecting the world, the projected medium-term deficits -- in the projected medium term, it looks like we're going to be having deficits even with very modest demand growth. So rather than the market being overwhelmed with supply, there's ample copper around the world today, so the market is fully supplied. But it's not being overwhelmed with new supplies and continued production even with very modest demand growth.
And as you go forward, existing mines will produce less. People aren't investing in new projects. There's barriers to project development that relate to environmental, community, country issues. And as we've shown in this process that we've had about selling properties, there is a significantly higher than current price required to develop new production. You just simply can't do it. And we know because we've got huge resources to develop, and we're working on plans to development. It will require higher copper price and absent a complete deterioration or significant deterioration, or absent China market or the global market, we're heading for a time when copper prices are going to be higher. That is illustrated on Page 8. Now I want to say what this is and what it isn't. This shows projected existing supply before any disruption allowance from existing mines. It doesn't take into account new projects even those projects that today look probable. But it just shows that over the next 10 years, existing mines' production is expected to decline on the order of 20%, that's roughly 4 million tons. Today, the top 10 mines in the world produce about 5.5 million tons per year. And according to Wood Mackenzie, the incentive price for new development is $3.30 pound. We know how long it takes to develop new mines. With all these resources, 100 billion pounds of reserves, a 100 billion pounds of mineralized material, more resources beyond that. If we were to start today to say let's develop an AFV to develop a new mine, it's on the order of 10 years before we have new production. And that can't be changed. That's not economic fact, that's the reality of getting permits, getting mine plans, getting things organized. That's just the way it's required. 
Now we did this with Cerro Verde. Cerro Verde is a tremendous asset. It was started many years ago. It was discovered in the 20th century -- in the 19th century. And it was started as a very small SX/EW operation. As we acquired Phelps Dodge, they were completing a major milling expansion in 2006, a little bit of a rough start off, as Red and I know then. And now we've done this $4.5 billion project on budget. We've taken our mill rate from a year ago from 116,000 tons a day to 352,000 tons a day. Think of that, 352,000 is through the mill. We're mining over 600,000 tons a day. Our sales have gone from 100 million pounds to 270 million pounds. Our unit costs have gone from $1.87 to $1.22. It will be a very long-term contributor to the future of our company. This is an asset that we could sell at a very attractive value. 
We could conduct just a formal auction of this, it would raise a lot of money. But we believe that this is the kind of core asset that we need to keep and our financial plan now will allow us to keep it. We weren't sure we could do that going into this year, to build our company around for the future. 
We went back and looked at 3 of our key mines Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg. And before we really started on this process, we wanted to show just how the districts that we operate in have changed over the years and what we have to continue to build on. In 1988, Morenci, as you went into the '80s, the '90s and early 2000s, there were reports talking about the death of the Southwest copper district in the U.S. and Mexico. 
Morenci had relatively small reserves. We've had significant production since then. We have significant remaining reserves and potential beyond those reserves. There will be a time, not in the very near term, but we'll be announcing a major further mill expansion at Morenci to develop the sulfide reserves. Cerro Verde now is essentially fully developed. But as we look below the existing outline for the pit that will support the expansion, there's further resources there. And at Grasberg, you know, Grasberg was discovered in 1988, developed during the 1990s to become one of the mining industries great assets. And we've got 25 years left on our contract and a great future there. 
Then when we look broadly, and as I said, we look at this set of assets in North America and South America as a set of assets managed together to take advantage. We have very large copper sulfate opportunities that have been much better defined since our Phelps Dodge acquisition through our core drilling and exploration analysis and it's a consistent story. At mines like Bagdad, which is our mine with a long life, operational challenges because of, principally, water availability and some land for tailings and so forth, but has a very significant resource. Recently, at a 100-year-old mine in New Mexico, Chino, which has been viewed as being at the very end of its life, we've been able to recently produce some incremental volumes while understanding the ore body better. And then identifying the potential for a large-scale sulfide future development at Chino. 
El Abra in Chile, I mentioned earlier, as we first got into this, after the Phelps Dodge acquisition, we saw this as a project with a very limited life. Exploration, drilling and analysis have shown an enormous sulfide resource that requires some investments to get water and power to it and to develop the mine. But this is a -- this is a Cerro Verde-type project for the future, and we're doing the work to position us for it. New Morenci is a mine called Safford, which was also developed by Phelps Dodge right before our acquisition. It has an adjoining ore resource that has been known for years. As we now approach the completion of the mining of the material at Safford, we're looking at this Lone Star resource, which has the opportunity to provide additional oxide ore to extend the life of the facilities at Safford, but a huge, huge sulfide resource underlying it. We're doing work to see how to take advantage of that. I mentioned Morenci, Sierrita is a mine with a significant molybdenum resource. But again, very large potential resource development. 
All of these developments, I want to talk about them because of how it fits into our near-term financial strategy. We're retaining these opportunities to grow our company in the future. Very simple, we're not going to start spending money on these capital projects until the market justifies it. But we'll have that underlying our company. 
Now short term, Kathleen and I talked to Red about his team -- about what could they do to mitigate production declines without doing major capital expansion projects. How to do it with minimal capital? And they are undertaking a project to deal with steepening pit walls around our company. By optimizing slopes, it will allow us to target opportunities to minimize stripping and add ore. This would result in lower costs and adding ore available for current production without having to do a major development project. This is a process that we're approaching very carefully. Because we want to do it by adhering to our established safety factors for protecting pit walls, but it allows us to have the potential to accelerate ore in the medium-term, add incremental ore to our reserves. We're in the early stages of this, but we're very encouraged about what we might be able to do with it, and we'll be reporting to you as we go forward. 
Now at Grasberg. We are at a stage of this mine where we are completing the mining of the open pit. And if you can see the schematic of the ore bodies, we're producing now from the DOZ. We've developed the DMLZ extension of the DOZ. And it has commenced production and it will provide significant ore to us going forward. We are continuing for the development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is the extension of the ore body beyond the pit limits and we're prepared to do that. It would allow us to continue operations beyond the depletion of the pit and begin ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave by having this infrastructure development. We can't mine from the block cave until the pit is complete because we use block caving methods, which results in surface subsidence. 
And an ongoing issue we've had is the need to have an extension of our contract because the funds we're spending to develop the block cave are for productions that will largely be produced beyond 2021. And so we've been having this ongoing assessment about whether to continue these capital expenditures. If we were to defer those, there would be significant adverse consequences, both for our company and for the government of Indonesia, because it would defer the initiation of the ramp up of the block cave going forward in the future. 
Today, we have access to the ore at the very lower limits of the open pit. That means we're not doing much stripping at all. It has very high-grade ore. Our mining rate is 2/3 lower than its maximum, 43% [ph] lower. There's limited access to the pit. So that means it creates some operational issues for us. And in this quarter, we had a couple of things to deal with: One, we had as we had talked about on our last call, a mechanical issue to repair with one of our big SAG mills. That was done more quickly than we anticipated. And we have experienced some issues with part of our workforce. And this is the workforce that actually operates the big trucks and shovels in the Grasberg open pit. They've had some grievances. There's been some slowdown in work there. And it had an impact on this year -- this quarter's volumes. 
A couple of points to emphasize. Well, let me start by saying we are working with the union and the workers to resolve these grievances and we're making progress with that. And we believe that we will be successful in dealing with that. But -- it was lower volumes now, but that ore is not going away. It will be mined and produced in the future, it's a matter of timing. It may mean -- it will likely mean -- it will mean that we'll be continuing to mine from the open pit into the early part of 2018 rather than completing it in 2017. So it's a short-term timing issue. We believe we have it solved. We're really focused on executing there and believe our team can do it. 
We do have with the Indonesian government an export permit that will be required by the first week -- roughly first week of August, it's August 8. We have been given assurances from the Mines Ministry and the highest levels in government that we will be able to get that permit and we expect to obtain it on a timely basis. Longer term, we are having ongoing discussions following up on our letter from October of last year about the long-term extension of our contract. Those discussions have been constructive. With the senior officials of the government clearly recognize the need for investment more broadly within Indonesia and to achieve that goal, they have commented publicly on the need to treat existing investors like Freeport fairly. There's been some political realignment within the President, the parliament in the first quarter -- the first half of the year. We believe all that's going to be positive for getting a resolution and feel that the timing for doing that now as opposed to where it's been over the last 6 months is much more positive, and we're going to complete following up on that. So that's kind of where we are with Grasberg. And I'll be prepared to follow your -- to answer your questions. 
Slide 14 just shows how really good our mining business is. It shows in 2015, when copper price averaged $2.42, our EBITDA matched our capital spending. Now in the first half, with the completion of Cerro Verde, the drop-off in CapEx, even at a copper price of averaging $2.16, EBITDA is significantly higher than CapEx. And as we look forward for the full year in 2016 with copper prices averaging for the remainder of the year at $2 to $2.50, we have a substantially higher EBITDA than the $1.7 billion of expected CapEx for the year. The adjustments for EBITDA reflect the changes that I previously talked about at Grasberg, the sale of the interest of Morenci and other factors there, but it shows how profitable our business will be now and as we go forward. 
In the oil and gas business, we really had to focus on managing costs and enhancing and protecting the asset values. We reduced costs -- outside capital costs by roughly $150 million. That's about 1/3 or more reduction in G&A costs and resulting other cost. We've restructured the really large commitments under the 3 Deepwater drillships that we had contracts for. We talked about that last time and that's in the supplemental slides, if you want to go back and review it. We've established production in the Deepwater from 5 new wells that were drilled to tie back to our production facilities. There were 3 wells at Holstein Deep and 2 wells in the Horn Mountain area. 
We'll talk about the Holstein production because those wells, the production results have been disappointing, disappointing for factors related to the quality of the oil and the nature of the reservoirs. And that's just what it is. But overall, the production from wells that we've previously drilled have come on as expected; unfortunately, these did not. But we have had favorable results from the development of the outside operator and large projects at Lucius and Heidelberg. But we have achieved our goal of ending the subsidy of our oil and gas operations from the mining business. And you can see that on Page 16 where we show the oil and gas EBITDA at various prices, the CapEx in '17 has been reduced to $600 million. And you can see that -- what kind of EBITDA we would have at various prices ranging from $500 million at $35 to $1.5 billion at $65. 
The Deepwater business is built around these 3 assets -- 3 production facilities, formerly owned by BP and Shell. And they are 100% owned. They have significant processing capacity and significant unused processing capacity, which creates value for both us and perspective purchasers of these assets. 
Our outlook for 2016, updated for our experience in Indonesia, continues to show copper sales of $5 billion -- or 5 million -- 5 billion pounds. Our Sierrita mine, which we anticipated closing and went to work and found ways of providing some volumes at a very attractive cost level that offset the lower production in Indonesia. Gold production reflects the Indonesia issues that we talked about. 
Molybdenum increases because of -- principally because of Sierrita and because markets have improved some and the oil production is lower. We have sold our interest in the Haynesville gas field. And so those barrels equivalent are out. There's been an operational issue because of the gas plant problem in Pascagoula, Mississippi, that's limited some of our production, as well as the start up production at the -- with our 3 new wells. Operating cash flows at $2.25 copper are modeled to be $4.5 billion with substantial leverage of $260 million for each $0.10 change in copper price. Unit costs are consistent with previous guidance. And on this basis, at a $1.06 a pound and capital spending is a couple of hundred billion dollars less than previous guidance. 
Our sales profile as we look forward from 2015 to '16, we've got 5 billion pounds that I just talked about. That would drop in 2017 principally because of the sale of Tenke, is the big factor there, that is expected to close later this year and would reduce volumes. You can see the gold coming out of Grasberg as we mined the end of the pit. And what our molybdenum and oil sales will be. Our chart that we show each quarter for EBITDA and cash flows show it over a range of $2 and $2.50. It shows operating cash flows ranging from $3.5 billion to $5 billion over those copper prices. And then capital expenditures, and we're going to manage this in relation to market conditions, would be dropping from $6,350,000,000 in 2015 to just over $3 billion this year to $2.3 billion in 2017. So the cash flow numbers that we talked about earlier reflect substantial cash coming out of the operation of our business. 
Kathleen went over with you the 3(a)(9) exchanges in which we were able to retire roughly $370 million of debt at a cost in terms of the share price of $311 million. We'll continue to look for opportunities like this. And then when we look at our balance sheet and our ability to manage it, not only do we have a plan of getting our debt down, which we believe by the end of '17 will be at an acceptable level to allow us to focus on growth as market conditions allow. We also have ways of dealing with our near-term maturities. Half of the proceeds of the Tenke transaction will be used to reduce our bank term loans pursuant to our agreement with the bank. The remaining half will then be available as cash to retire the deal with our 2017 maturities. 
So we've dealt with '16 and '17, and we're going to continue to be looking at capital market transactions to with -- let me just say non-equity capital markets transactions in a way to deal and maximize our maturity picture going forward. 
So this is a little chart we use as we've talked about proving our metal for this year in an enthusiastic and resilient manner. And I'm pleased to report for the first 6 months, we've had a great track record of doing that and moving our sales forward on a really clearly defined business and financial strategy. 
So thank you for bearing with me with all of that. I felt like it was an important quarter to cover these things and now I look forward to your questions."

Yes, that's a good point. While we have found some ways and we continue to search for ways to defer capital, we changed some mine plans and have done certain things, what we have not done yet is defer the necessary steps that would allow us to begin ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave production once the pit is completed, now that will be early 2018. So the balancing act, and this has been a major point of focus for us in the first half the year, I went to Grasberg and I sat down with our team, we did a detailed review of what it would mean if we were simply to defer the spending of the $1 billion a year that we've been spending recently to develop this underground resource. Now what would happen, it would be significant layoffs. And we're over 90% of the economy in Mimika. The resulting social disruptions there, which are a significant concern, are unknown. If for sure we'd do what you just said, it would result in a deferral for the ramp up of the Grasberg Block Cave. And once you demobilize the team that's working on this, remobilizing that team and coming back in would be a significant exercise beyond just the time deferral of spending it. And that would have a major negative impact, as I said, both on us and on the government. Now we are basing our decision to do this on the assurances we've received from the government in recent years, but most clearly articulated in the October 8 letter last year that they will extend our contract, and recent -- my recent discussions with the highest level of officials in the government reaffirm that commitment to doing that. So we are saying that we need to have that done in the near term, explaining to them the consequences if we -- to them, as well as to us, of deferring those expenditures. But to date, we have not made that major decision. So we're online -- that work by the way has gone exceedingly well. And the underlying economics are strongly in favor of us doing what we're doing."

But we're still telling the market and tell bankers if you've got ideas for our business, come share them with us. We've had a lot of interest and lot of discussions. And that's when I talk about the balancing act. The balancing act is what we could raise, what will we be left with to build the company around. And whereas the beginning of the year, we didn't know. We thought we might have to sell some of these core assets. We thought we might have to sell Cerro Verde. We had a lot of interest in it. So you're exactly right with the plan we have now, as I said, Kathleen and I feel like we've turned the corner, we can see the way forward without further asset sales, without further equity sales. We still have strategic decisions to make about the oil and gas business, and about PT-FI shares as part of our arrangements with the government. And we've got market uncertainties that we're going to have to monitor as we go along. But as I said, we see clarity now that we didn't have before and that clarity shows us the way to get to where we wanted to get to without having further assets. If we can have an asset sale that could be less dilutive than an equity sale, that's the way we'd evaluate it. We want to do -- we want to get to where we need to get to in terms of having a good balance sheet and do it in the most -- the least dilutive fashion that we could get to."

I mean, it was rocky at the start but we've built a great relationship. We've operated the mine in a first-class fashion. We've had a great relationship with Gécamines, a state-owned company that owns an interest in Tenke Fungurume mining, and an exceptional relationship with Lundin, our partner there. We sold Lundin our Candelaria mine in Chile. So -- and we love the asset. I mean, we really like having this part of our portfolio. So when circumstances required to sell it, everybody was disappointed. We were disappointed, Lundin was disappointed, Gécamines was disappointed, the government was disappointed. So we've had it and this was not unexpected. So we had to deal with that disappointment. We have confidence that CMAP, China Moly is a good partner. And they are going to be a good partner for the country and they're taking steps to explain that both to Lundin and to the Gécamines and the government. The government would, obviously, like to get some financial compensation out of this. But legally, this is a transaction that does not relate to Tenke Fungurume mining, which has the contract with the government. It's at the higher tier company. And there's no legal basis for anything other than continuation. So the China Moly and Lundin are having discussions together about the future. Lundin has certain transfer rights that are publicly known. And they mutually made a decision that they would like to have some additional time to consider that -- those transfer rights and their partnership going forward. We don't expect any delay. China Moly is reporting to us the approvals that they're getting in China and they have a strong economic interest to getting this thing closed and we expect them to do it. And they really emphasized in their communications process that the benefits to the Government of the Congo and employees and the community will be sustained going forward and there's no changes in that."

It's apples and oranges to Grasberg in terms of size, grade, profitability and so forth. And I think the country is taking pride that an Indonesian group is stepping up to buy.

But now, we're reaching the end of the oxide life of Safford, we have those facilities. And we can work our way into Lone Star by mining the oxide cat there, which will allow us to use these facilities that are available in the adjoining Safford mine. And that would, ultimately, expose an enormous sulfide resource big, low-grade, which would allow us to take a step towards getting the benefits from it and then have the opportunity to do a large-scale concentrator development.

I was just there last week and that's -- that was the key focus of what we were talking about. You're right in saying the nature of oil and gas production in the Deepwater, the Gulf of Mexico involves inherent declines. We have the benefit for several years now of wells that were drilled since we acquired Plains in 2013 that we have hooked up and have begun production on. And the effect of that is deferring the time when the decline hits us. So sort of like what we're doing here in the mining business, we're looking at different scenarios of where can you invest over time at the lowest risk, minimizing capital kinds of investments to arrest that decline. But we have several years to deal with that. But looking out in the long-term future would require reinvestment to maintain these levels of production. And respectively for buyers there's ways of growing it because we've identified a number of potential drilling opportunities by -- that don't require new platform development because we have all this unused capacity in the existing platforms. So there's great opportunity here. It does require capital in the Deepwater, significant capital and time lags before we bring in production on stream. There is -- in this Vito basin area there's tremendous opportunities. And that's what I'm saying and strategically we're saying our focus is going to be on the copper business. We want to make sure that if we talk to people about buying the assets or joint venture relationships for people who might want to come in over time and invest with us to help minimize our capital.

Well, the big issue had to do with these 3 new wells that we had at what we call Holstein Deep. These wells were drilled, the logs on the well -- the electric logs that analyze the reservoirs prior to getting production were very strong. Unfortunately, there was limits because the nature of the wells, the depths and so forth of where certain aspects about the quality of the oil, the permeability, the viscosity, were simply not available. And the initial projections were based on analogous data from the area, from other experiences. And so there was just limited data and this is common in the industry. And when these wells came on stream, it was readily apparent that the crude oil quality, the in situ permeability throughout the field was different than expected, the viscosity was measurably higher than pretest expectations. And so it was just a case of where the wells weren't able to produce what they were expected to produce, and it was fairly significant. At the outset, the 3 wells, we were looking at 24,000 barrels a day, that we had lowered it a bit for our second quarter plans.

We've been very clear with the government. We can't build a smelter without a contract extension. I mean, that is a major construction progress [ph]. We've done a lot of work on it. We've got site selection done. We're working with preliminary engineering, design, we've got a real clear view of what it would be required. But we can't spend significant capital on it without having a contract extension. Just think about it. We start today, the smelter construction period extends at least into 2019. And if you don't have assurance on your contract, they're not going to build a smelter and not have that assurance. The same way with divestiture. We've indicated a willingness to invest even though our contracted work has no requirements that we do, legally. In terms of trying to meet the aspirations of the people of Indonesia and its government, we've said we would divest an incremental 20-plus percent. But again, that would only happen if we have a contract extension. The valuation of this business, if you just say we've got a contract through 2021, is unreasonable based on the investments that we've made. The investments we've made has been to develop this resource for the next 25 years. And for our shareholders, we couldn't sell it without getting a return on those investments and a fair valuation for operations extending over the next 25 years. So that's conditional in the contract as well."

The resource has grown so much, the way that we process it has been established. So these numbers are pretty relatively consistent with what we had before these exceptional years in 2016, 2017.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. 
Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer of FCX; and Red Conger, President of Americas and Africa. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, we'll open -- after our remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. 
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $479 million, $0.38 per share for the second quarter of 2016. As detailed in the release, the net loss attributable to common stock included special items totaling $452 million or $0.36 per share during the second quarter, primarily for the previously reported drillship settlements and impairment of our oil and gas properties, partly offset by net gains on the sale of assets. After adjusting for these net charges, our second quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $27 million or $0.02 a share. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for second quarter 2016 approximated $966 million. We have a slide in the deck that shows you the roll forward of getting to that number. And during the second quarter, we completed previously announced asset sales for aggregate consideration of $1.3 billion, that included the $1 billion sale of the additional 13% undivided interest in Morenci during May. And also in May, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in TF Holdings Limited for $2.65 billion in cash and contingent consideration of up to $120 million. 
In accordance with accounting guidelines, as you'll see in the release, the results of Tenke are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the quarter, our consolidated sales volumes totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper, 156,000 ounces of gold, 19 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.4 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our average price of copper was $2.18 per pound that was below last year's second quarter average of $2.71 per pound. Gold averaged $1292 during the quarter that was above last year's quarterly average of $1174. And our realized price for crude oil of $41 per barrel was below last year's quarterly average price of just under $68 per barrel, which included $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts. 
Unit net cash costs for the quarter averaged $1.33 per pound. That was lower as expected than the year ago period of $1.50 per pound. And that primarily reflects the higher copper volumes and economies of scale that have come in during the quarter as anticipated and the impact of ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, partly offset by lower gold and silver credits. We generated operating cash flows during the quarter of $874 million, which exceeded our capital expenditures of $833 million during the quarter. 
As previously reported, we have exchanged some of our senior notes into equity through July 25. Yesterday, we exchanged a total of $369 million in face amount of bonds at a cost of $311 million or approximately 28 million shares of our common stock in a series of privately negotiated transactions. Our debt at the end of June was $19.3 billion and consolidated cash was approximately $350 million. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. And we ended the quarter, currently have approximately 1.33 billion common shares outstanding, which includes the shares that we issued through yesterday in connection with the settlement of the debt exchanges. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to our slide materials and discussing our operations and outlook."

I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit before we turn to the quarter, and we have some important facts to talk about -- situations to talk about with the quarter,",5470,"Thanks, Kathleen, and thank all of you for joining us today. I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit before we turn to the quarter, and we have some important facts to talk about -- situations to talk about with the quarter, and we'll cover those in detail. But it's -- I believe, it's important for you to understand that we feel very good about the progress we've made during the first half of the year. 
Late last night, as we were putting the finishing touches on today's presentation, Kathleen and I were reflecting aback about where our company stood a year ago. A year ago, oil prices were in the mid-$60 a barrel, copper prices were $2.70. We were talking about controlling costs and talking about strategic alternatives for our oil and gas business. As 2015 proceeded and going into 2016, oil prices dropped, at one point, below $30 a barrel, copper prices dropped below $2 a pound. There was a lot of uncertainties about our company because of the debt level, witness the way our bonds traded and our CDS has traded. 
We took steps. We reorganized our board. The board -- the restructured board emphasized our focus on the future of our company being in the mining business. We restructured our management team and we took actions. When we had our year-end earnings call, there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to execute the plans that we needed to execute to address our balance sheet issues, a lot of skepticism. And internally, there was a lot of -- there was a lack of clarity about -- not where we were going, we knew what we had to do, but how we would get there, how the market would react to it.
So looking back, we said then that we would sell assets, raise capital targeting $5 billion to $10 billion. And we went to work. As we were doing that, Red and his team and our global operating teams focused on executing our business plans. And when you look at the charts on the side of Page 3, Slide 3, you can see how effective we've been doing that. We've reduced our site production and delivery costs before byproduct credits by 25% -- 23%. Oil and gas business, we've cut our production costs from $19 a barrel to $15 a barrel. 
We cut CapEx. We completed our major expansion project at Cerro Verde, which a year ago was a significant undertaking and risk for our company and it is a very complex project. As it was completed, it was the largest processing facility in the history of the mining industry. And it was a big project, $4.5-plus billion. We reduced CapEx in the oil and gas business. We undertook to sell assets in a market that had uncertainties. We did this to strengthen our balance sheet. But it was a surprise to some people, we were able to achieve valuations that reflected a positive view of the long-term copper market, we had that a year ago, we continue to have that today, and I'll talk about it. 
Not only does this generate cash to reduce our debt but it highlights value of Freeport's assets as we go forward. We raised -- we have raised to date over $4 billion, or in position to complete transactions to raise it, by only selling 9% of our copper reserves. We had an effort to sell our oil and gas business or assets. It was a tough time to do that. We restructured the business to operate within its cash flows. We reorganized the business. We dealt with some major obligations that had been committed to in past times when the strategy was to grow that business aggressively, and we made some tough decisions to restructure drilling contracts and other contracts. And we continue to view strategically how these assets fit into our long-term business, and we understand their values. And we will look over time to see how to generate value for our shareholders out of those assets. 
Our copper volumes are growing with the successful Cerro Verde start up, with 15% quarter-to-quarter, year-on-year increase. And we'll step back and look at how our company is now positioned for free cash flow generation. As we were talking last night, Kathleen and I and our management team feel that we have truly turned the corner for Freeport. And our ability to do that wasn't just clear-cut as we started the year. We've proved that our assets are attractive. And our strategy, and we'll talk about how our financial strategy fits with our long-term business strategy, is focused on leaving us with a core set of assets to build long-term value for shareholders. It would be one thing just to sell assets simply to raise cash. But we've kept a view about what will Freeport be for the long term and which of our assets will be there to allow us to take advantage of our core competencies as a company and also to take advantage of what we believe will be a long-term copper market. So that was always in our mind as to what did we want to be left with after we sold assets.
So looking on Page 4. We have set a target of reducing our debt to $10 billion. Our debt at June 30 is just below $19 billion, and we have a contract to sell our Tenke asset with the related assets that we'd be selling for $2.8 billion. Now if we look forward at different scenarios of copper prices and with successful execution of our plans, you can see what our debt levels would be at $2 copper, $2.25 copper and $2.50 copper at the end of 2017. That reflects the transactions that we sold that we have contracts for. It does not include any divestment of PT-FI shares. And we have a strategy of working with the government of Indonesia to sell an incremental approximately 20% of PT-FI contingent on our getting our contract extension. 
We will consider further asset steps -- strategic steps. For example, this doesn't include any sales of our oil and gas business. And I want to emphasize that as we look at any divestment of PT-FI, it's a condition that we sell those assets at fair value to our company. And so as we looked at this, we take into account the risk possibility of copper prices trading down throughout the financial community today and with many of the experts that follow the industry, there is a risk that because of slower growth in China and global economic uncertainties that we may have to deal with lower than today's copper prices in the short term. I'm going to talk about the longer-term view, but we have to live through the short term to experience the benefits of a positive long-term market. 
So we sit here with a balancing act. The balancing act was to look at these debt levels, understand what it's going to take operationally to get to those, then think about what next steps should we take to address the uncertainties of the short-term market. And we are still open and on the table for all strategic moves, whether that means selling assets, selling the company. We're focused really on creating value for our shareholders and to create that long-term value, our recent history with this company shows us we need to have a strong balance sheet to allow us to be positioned to aggressively take care of the long-term values. 
We've had ongoing discussions about some other asset sales. We're continuing those. We looked at capital market transactions. And today, we've announced that we have plans to file the necessary documents to allow us to issue another $1.5 billion of stock through and at the market offering. Our company has had success with these in the past. We did one in the 2008, 2009 crisis. We've done 2 of these offerings last year when our financial situation was more dire. What this allows us to do is to assess the market and if the market is available to us on a day-by-day basis to sell shares into the marketplace when there's demand for them. And so we have -- we felt, looking at these numbers, that this was a step that, if we can successfully execute it, absent just a collapse in the market, we basically have a path forward of achieving what we set out to achieve. 
There is no requirement to sell further assets. There is no requirement to sell further equity. We've got a, now, which we didn't have 6 months ago, a clear-cut path as to how to get our financial situation to the point where we wanted to get it to. And we will have done it in a way that we can hold on to what we believe is our highest-quality assets to build the company for the future. 
Now those assets -- the transactions to date are listed on Page 5. It includes the successful sale of an incremental interest -- an incremental 13% interest to our long time and highly valued partner, Sumitomo in Morenci. That transaction is closed. We have a series of other smaller transactions. And the Tenke Fungurume transaction, which is where we have a contract and working with the buyer, China Molybdenum, they are proceeding with the necessary regulatory steps in China to get the transaction closed. Their reports are that, that's going very well. They have to have a shareholder vote since there is a minority public ownership. So the shareholder vote doesn't involve uncertainties as to the outcome, but procedurally it has to be conducted. All indications are that this transaction is going to be closed as anticipated in the fall. And so that would generate for us, considering all factors, something between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. I'm pleased with that. 
Now what then does Freeport have left? I mean, it's a great set of assets. We will have 7 copper mines led by our flagship mine, Morenci, in North America. We also have 2 molybdenum mines, and we have a great molybdenum business, largest producer, lowest-cost producer. And we have 2 pure molybdenum mines in North America and byproduct produced at our other mines. We also have 2 great mines in South America; Cerro Verde, which I'll talk about; and El Abra, where we and our partner, CODELCO, are doing studies now for the potential for a major expansion of that property only when market conditions allow.
Now one of the things, as we've really gotten into this and evaluated potential transactions and buyers, is really a recognition of how much value we create by having this set of assets run together. These are mines, which benefit significantly from the synergies of being able to share people, technology, equipment to have the flexibility of focusing on growth projects at one of these mines or the other and looking at how to fit those together in a long-term plan for, ultimately, growing volumes. They have -- you can see in these bubbles, really huge resources, over 30 billion pounds of copper reserves each in North America and South America, significant molybdenum beyond proved reserves, huge amounts of mineralized material and future growth projects. 
We have a growth pipeline for this industry with these assets that extends as far as you can see. And we also have the ability of executing these when it makes sense in undertaking low-risk executable transactions without having to do it. We can run a really rational business strategy of generating profits and focusing on long-term growth in a very businesslike and rational way. And when we looked at how those values fit together, we felt really it makes a lot of sense to keep the assets together for our future. And Red and his team just do an outstanding job in running this business. 
The Grasberg mine in Indonesia is a real special asset. I mean, it is special in many ways because of its physical location, but extraordinary because of the high grades of both copper and gold in the same ore. It's a tough mine to run, but we've done it for a long time now. We began the development -- we've been there since the early '70s in Indonesia and Papua. And we've developed the Grasberg during the 1990s and now have operated until we can see the end of the life of the open pit, the transition to an underground. We've got issues to deal with. We've always had issues to deal with there, operationally, managing the environment, working with the local community, working with the changes in the Indonesian government. But underlying that is an extraordinary asset, and we want to work cooperatively with the people of Indonesia and its government in a way to generate benefits that are mutual for both of us. And that's what we're doing. 
Now where are we today with copper markets? The surpluses today are relatively small in the marketplace and lower than people expected not too long ago as to where they were. The new supply that people like us had initiated with projects following the financial crisis of 2008, 2009. Some have been delayed, some have been deferred, but the new supply is basically coming on as expected. A recent feature is that there are significantly lower disruptions than had been experienced in the industry, disruptions from labor issues, disruptions from mine and operational issues, from equipment issues. So we've had a case of where the mine -- the industry has been producing, basically, what was available to it. And even with that -- even with the new supply, the lower disruptions, the lowered growth in China, the lower growth globally because all the economic issues affecting the world, the projected medium-term deficits -- in the projected medium term, it looks like we're going to be having deficits even with very modest demand growth. So rather than the market being overwhelmed with supply, there's ample copper around the world today, so the market is fully supplied. But it's not being overwhelmed with new supplies and continued production even with very modest demand growth.
And as you go forward, existing mines will produce less. People aren't investing in new projects. There's barriers to project development that relate to environmental, community, country issues. And as we've shown in this process that we've had about selling properties, there is a significantly higher than current price required to develop new production. You just simply can't do it. And we know because we've got huge resources to develop, and we're working on plans to development. It will require higher copper price and absent a complete deterioration or significant deterioration, or absent China market or the global market, we're heading for a time when copper prices are going to be higher. That is illustrated on Page 8. Now I want to say what this is and what it isn't. This shows projected existing supply before any disruption allowance from existing mines. It doesn't take into account new projects even those projects that today look probable. But it just shows that over the next 10 years, existing mines' production is expected to decline on the order of 20%, that's roughly 4 million tons. Today, the top 10 mines in the world produce about 5.5 million tons per year. And according to Wood Mackenzie, the incentive price for new development is $3.30 pound. We know how long it takes to develop new mines. With all these resources, 100 billion pounds of reserves, a 100 billion pounds of mineralized material, more resources beyond that. If we were to start today to say let's develop an AFV to develop a new mine, it's on the order of 10 years before we have new production. And that can't be changed. That's not economic fact, that's the reality of getting permits, getting mine plans, getting things organized. That's just the way it's required. 
Now we did this with Cerro Verde. Cerro Verde is a tremendous asset. It was started many years ago. It was discovered in the 20th century -- in the 19th century. And it was started as a very small SX/EW operation. As we acquired Phelps Dodge, they were completing a major milling expansion in 2006, a little bit of a rough start off, as Red and I know then. And now we've done this $4.5 billion project on budget. We've taken our mill rate from a year ago from 116,000 tons a day to 352,000 tons a day. Think of that, 352,000 is through the mill. We're mining over 600,000 tons a day. Our sales have gone from 100 million pounds to 270 million pounds. Our unit costs have gone from $1.87 to $1.22. It will be a very long-term contributor to the future of our company. This is an asset that we could sell at a very attractive value. 
We could conduct just a formal auction of this, it would raise a lot of money. But we believe that this is the kind of core asset that we need to keep and our financial plan now will allow us to keep it. We weren't sure we could do that going into this year, to build our company around for the future. 
We went back and looked at 3 of our key mines Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg. And before we really started on this process, we wanted to show just how the districts that we operate in have changed over the years and what we have to continue to build on. In 1988, Morenci, as you went into the '80s, the '90s and early 2000s, there were reports talking about the death of the Southwest copper district in the U.S. and Mexico. 
Morenci had relatively small reserves. We've had significant production since then. We have significant remaining reserves and potential beyond those reserves. There will be a time, not in the very near term, but we'll be announcing a major further mill expansion at Morenci to develop the sulfide reserves. Cerro Verde now is essentially fully developed. But as we look below the existing outline for the pit that will support the expansion, there's further resources there. And at Grasberg, you know, Grasberg was discovered in 1988, developed during the 1990s to become one of the mining industries great assets. And we've got 25 years left on our contract and a great future there. 
Then when we look broadly, and as I said, we look at this set of assets in North America and South America as a set of assets managed together to take advantage. We have very large copper sulfate opportunities that have been much better defined since our Phelps Dodge acquisition through our core drilling and exploration analysis and it's a consistent story. At mines like Bagdad, which is our mine with a long life, operational challenges because of, principally, water availability and some land for tailings and so forth, but has a very significant resource. Recently, at a 100-year-old mine in New Mexico, Chino, which has been viewed as being at the very end of its life, we've been able to recently produce some incremental volumes while understanding the ore body better. And then identifying the potential for a large-scale sulfide future development at Chino. 
El Abra in Chile, I mentioned earlier, as we first got into this, after the Phelps Dodge acquisition, we saw this as a project with a very limited life. Exploration, drilling and analysis have shown an enormous sulfide resource that requires some investments to get water and power to it and to develop the mine. But this is a -- this is a Cerro Verde-type project for the future, and we're doing the work to position us for it. New Morenci is a mine called Safford, which was also developed by Phelps Dodge right before our acquisition. It has an adjoining ore resource that has been known for years. As we now approach the completion of the mining of the material at Safford, we're looking at this Lone Star resource, which has the opportunity to provide additional oxide ore to extend the life of the facilities at Safford, but a huge, huge sulfide resource underlying it. We're doing work to see how to take advantage of that. I mentioned Morenci, Sierrita is a mine with a significant molybdenum resource. But again, very large potential resource development. 
All of these developments, I want to talk about them because of how it fits into our near-term financial strategy. We're retaining these opportunities to grow our company in the future. Very simple, we're not going to start spending money on these capital projects until the market justifies it. But we'll have that underlying our company. 
Now short term, Kathleen and I talked to Red about his team -- about what could they do to mitigate production declines without doing major capital expansion projects. How to do it with minimal capital? And they are undertaking a project to deal with steepening pit walls around our company. By optimizing slopes, it will allow us to target opportunities to minimize stripping and add ore. This would result in lower costs and adding ore available for current production without having to do a major development project. This is a process that we're approaching very carefully. Because we want to do it by adhering to our established safety factors for protecting pit walls, but it allows us to have the potential to accelerate ore in the medium term, add incremental ore to our reserves. We're in the early stages of this, but we're very encouraged about what we might be able to do with it, and we'll be reporting to you as we go forward. 
Now at Grasberg. We are at a stage of this mine where we are completing the mining of the open pit. And if you can see the schematic of the ore bodies, we're producing now from the DOZ. We've developed the DMLZ extension of the DOZ. And it has commenced production and it will provide significant ore to us going forward. We are continuing for the development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is the extension of the ore body beyond the pit limits and we're prepared to do that. It would allow us to continue operations beyond the depletion of the pit and begin ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave by having this infrastructure development. We can't mine from the block cave until the pit is complete because we use block caving methods, which results in surface subsidence. 
And an ongoing issue we've had is the need to have an extension of our contract because the funds we're spending to develop the block cave are for productions that will largely be produced beyond 2021. And so we've been having this ongoing assessment about whether to continue these capital expenditures. If we were to defer those, there would be significant adverse consequences, both for our company and for the government of Indonesia, because it would defer the initiation of the ramp up of the block cave going forward in the future. 
Today, we have access to the ore at the very lower limits of the open pit. That means we're not doing much stripping at all. It has very high-grade ore. Our mining rate is 2/3 lower than its maximum, 43% [ph] lower. There's limited access to the pit. So that means it creates some operational issues for us. And in this quarter, we had a couple of things to deal with: One, we had as we had talked about on our last call, a mechanical issue to repair with one of our big SAG mills. That was done more quickly than we anticipated. And we have experienced some issues with part of our workforce. And this is the workforce that actually operates the big trucks and shovels in the Grasberg open pit. They've had some grievances. There's been some slowdown in work there. And it had an impact on this year -- this quarter's volumes. 
A couple of points to emphasize. Well, let me start by saying we are working with the union and the workers to resolve these grievances and we're making progress with that. And we believe that we will be successful in dealing with that. But -- it was lower volumes now, but that ore is not going away. It will be mined and produced in the future, it's a matter of timing. It may mean -- it will likely mean -- it will mean that we'll be continuing to mine from the open pit into the early part of 2018 rather than completing it in 2017. So it's a short-term timing issue. We believe we have it solved. We're really focused on executing there and believe our team can do it. 
We do have with the Indonesian government an export permit that will be required by the first week -- roughly first week of August, it's August 8. We have been given assurances from the Mines Ministry and the highest levels in government that we will be able to get that permit and we expect to obtain it on a timely basis. Longer term, we are having ongoing discussions following up on our letter from October of last year about the long-term extension of our contract. Those discussions have been constructive. With the senior officials of the government clearly recognize the need for investment more broadly within Indonesia and to achieve that goal, they have commented publicly on the need to treat existing investors like Freeport fairly. There's been some political realignment within the President, the parliament in the first quarter -- the first half of the year. We believe all that's going to be positive for getting a resolution and feel that the timing for doing that now as opposed to where it's been over the last 6 months is much more positive, and we're going to complete following up on that. So that's kind of where we are with Grasberg. And I'll be prepared to follow your -- to answer your questions. 
Slide 14 just shows how really good our mining business is. It shows in 2015, when copper price averaged $2.42, our EBITDA matched our capital spending. Now in the first half, with the completion of Cerro Verde, the drop-off in CapEx, even at a copper price of averaging $2.16, EBITDA is significantly higher than CapEx. And as we look forward for the full year in 2016 with copper prices averaging for the remainder of the year at $2 to $2.50, we have a substantially higher EBITDA than the $1.7 billion of expected CapEx for the year. The adjustments for EBITDA reflect the changes that I previously talked about at Grasberg, the sale of the interest of Morenci and other factors there, but it shows how profitable our business will be now and as we go forward. 
In the oil and gas business, we really had to focus on managing costs and enhancing and protecting the asset values. We reduced costs -- outside capital costs by roughly $150 million. That's about 1/3 or more reduction in G&A costs and resulting other cost. We've restructured the really large commitments under the 3 Deepwater drillships that we had contracts for. We talked about that last time and that's in the supplemental slides, if you want to go back and review it. We've established production in the Deepwater from 5 new wells that were drilled to tie back to our production facilities. There were 3 wells at Holstein Deep and 2 wells in the Horn Mountain area. 
We'll talk about the Holstein production because those wells, the production results have been disappointing, disappointing for factors related to the quality of the oil and the nature of the reservoirs. And that's just what it is. But overall, the production from wells that we've previously drilled have come on as expected; unfortunately, these did not. But we have had favorable results from the development of the outside operator and large projects at Lucius and Heidelberg. But we have achieved our goal of ending the subsidy of our oil and gas operations from the mining business. And you can see that on Page 16 where we show the oil and gas EBITDA at various prices, the CapEx in '17 has been reduced to $600 million. And you can see that -- what kind of EBITDA we would have at various prices ranging from $500 million at $35 to $1.5 billion at $65. 
The Deepwater business is built around these 3 assets -- 3 production facilities, formerly owned by BP and Shell. And they are 100% owned. They have significant processing capacity and significant unused processing capacity, which creates value for both us and perspective purchasers of these assets. 
Our outlook for 2016, updated for our experience in Indonesia, continues to show copper sales of $5 billion -- or 5 million -- 5 billion pounds. Our Sierrita mine, which we anticipated closing and went to work and found ways of providing some volumes at a very attractive cost level that offset the lower production in Indonesia. Gold production reflects the Indonesia issues that we talked about. 
Molybdenum increases because of -- principally because of Sierrita and because markets have improved some and the oil production is lower. We have sold our interest in the Haynesville gas field. And so those barrels equivalent are out. There's been an operational issue because of the gas plant problem in Pascagoula, Mississippi, that's limited some of our production, as well as the start up production at the -- with our 3 new wells. Operating cash flows at $2.25 copper are modeled to be $4.5 billion with substantial leverage of $260 million for each $0.10 change in copper price. Unit costs are consistent with previous guidance. And on this basis, at a $1.06 a pound and capital spending is a couple of hundred billion dollars less than previous guidance. 
Our sales profile as we look forward from 2015 to '16, we've got 5 billion pounds that I just talked about. That would drop in 2017 principally because of the sale of Tenke, is the big factor there, that is expected to close later this year and would reduce volumes. You can see the gold coming out of Grasberg as we mined the end of the pit. And what our molybdenum and oil sales will be. Our chart that we show each quarter for EBITDA and cash flows show it over a range of $2 and $2.50. It shows operating cash flows ranging from $3.5 billion to $5 billion over those copper prices. And then capital expenditures, and we're going to manage this in relation to market conditions, would be dropping from $6,350,000,000 in 2015 to just over $3 billion this year to $2.3 billion in 2017. So the cash flow numbers that we talked about earlier reflect substantial cash coming out of the operation of our business. 
Kathleen went over with you the 3(a)(9) exchanges in which we were able to retire roughly $370 million of debt at a cost in terms of the share price of $311 million. We'll continue to look for opportunities like this. And then when we look at our balance sheet and our ability to manage it, not only do we have a plan of getting our debt down, which we believe by the end of '17 will be at an acceptable level to allow us to focus on growth as market conditions allow. We also have ways of dealing with our near-term maturities. Half of the proceeds of the Tenke transaction will be used to reduce our bank term loans pursuant to our agreement with the bank. The remaining half will then be available as cash to retire the deal with our 2017 maturities. 
So we've dealt with '16 and '17, and we're going to continue to be looking at capital market transactions to with -- let me just say non-equity capital markets transactions in a way to deal and maximize our maturity picture going forward. 
So this is a little chart we use as we've talked about proving our metal for this year in an enthusiastic and resilient manner. And I'm pleased to report for the first 6 months, we've had a great track record of doing that and moving our sales forward on a really clearly defined business and financial strategy. 
So thank you for bearing with me with all of that. I felt like it was an important quarter to cover these things and now I look forward to your questions."

While we have found some ways and we continue to search for ways to defer capital, we changed some mine plans and have done certain things, what we have not done yet is defer the necessary steps that would allow us to begin ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave production once the pit is completed, now that will be early 2018. So the balancing act, and this has been a major point of focus for us in the first half the year, I went to Grasberg and I sat down with our team, we did a detailed review of what it would mean if we were simply to defer the spending of the $1 billion a year that we've been spending recently to develop this underground resource. Now what would happen, it would be significant layoffs. And we're over 90% of the economy in Mimika. The resulting social disruptions there, which are a significant concern, are unknown. If for sure we'd do what you just said, it would result in a deferral for the ramp up of the Grasberg Block Cave. And once you demobilize the team that's working on this, remobilizing that team and coming back in would be a significant exercise beyond just the time deferral of spending it. And that would have a major negative impact, as I said, both on us and on the government. Now we are basing our decision to do this on the assurances we've received from the government in recent years, but most clearly articulated in the October 8 letter last year that they will extend our contract, and recent -- my recent discussions with the highest level of officials in the government reaffirm that commitment to doing that. So we are saying that we need to have that done in the near term, explaining to them the consequences if we -- to them, as well as to us, of deferring those expenditures. But to date, we have not made that major decision. So we're online -- that work by the way has gone exceedingly well. And the underlying economics are strongly in favor of us doing what we're doing."

I mean, we started off the year saying that every asset we had was up for consideration for sale. And we made progress. We continue to have discussions. But we're still telling the market and tell bankers if you've got ideas for our business, come share them with us. We've had a lot of interest and lot of discussions. And that's when I talk about the balancing act. The balancing act is what we could raise, what will we be left with to build the company around. And whereas the beginning of the year, we didn't know. We thought we might have to sell some of these core assets. We thought we might have to sell Cerro Verde. We had a lot of interest in it. So you're exactly right with the plan we have now, as I said, Kathleen and I feel like we've turned the corner, we can see the way forward without further asset sales, without further equity sales. We still have strategic decisions to make about the oil and gas business, and about PT-FI shares as part of our arrangements with the government. And we've got market uncertainties that we're going to have to monitor as we go along. But as I said, we see clarity now that we didn't have before and that clarity shows us the way to get to where we wanted to get to without having further assets. If we can have an asset sale that could be less dilutive than an equity sale, that's the way we'd evaluate it. We want to do -- we want to get to where we need to get to in terms of having a good balance sheet and do it in the most -- the least dilutive fashion that we could get to."

Do they have any sort of legitimate claim and what that might cost, if anything, to push that aside? Could that delay the deal?

I mean, it was rocky at the start but we've built a great relationship. We've operated the mine in a first-class fashion. We've had a great relationship with Gécamines, a state-owned company that owns an interest in Tenke Fungurume mining, and an exceptional relationship with Lundin, our partner there. We sold Lundin our Candelaria mine in Chile. So -- and we love the asset. I mean, we really like having this part of our portfolio. So when circumstances required to sell it, everybody was disappointed. We were disappointed, Lundin was disappointed, Gécamines was disappointed, the government was disappointed. So we've had it and this was not unexpected. So we had to deal with that disappointment. We have confidence that CMAP, China Moly is a good partner. And they are going to be a good partner for the country and they're taking steps to explain that both to Lundin and to the Gécamines and the government. The government would, obviously, like to get some financial compensation out of this. But legally, this is a transaction that does not relate to Tenke Fungurume mining, which has the contract with the government. It's at the higher tier company. And there's no legal basis for anything other than continuation. So the China Moly and Lundin are having discussions together about the future. Lundin has certain transfer rights that are publicly known. And they mutually made a decision that they would like to have some additional time to consider that -- those transfer rights and their partnership going forward. We don't expect any delay. China Moly is reporting to us the approvals that they're getting in China and they have a strong economic interest to getting this thing closed and we expect them to do it. And they really emphasized in their communications process that the benefits to the Government of the Congo and employees and the community will be sustained going forward and there's no changes in that."

And as we look at what the debt levels will be, it won't be any arbitrary ratios or so forth, but it would be based on the, then, assessment of what market risk or our market conditions are. And I'm looking forward to the time when Freeport returns again to thinking about increasing dividends and returning cash to shareholders.

It's apples and oranges to Grasberg in terms of size, grade, profitability and so forth. And I think the country is taking pride that an Indonesian group is stepping up to buy.

But now, we're reaching the end of the oxide life of Safford, we have those facilities. And we can work our way into Lone Star by mining the oxide cat there, which will allow us to use these facilities that are available in the adjoining Safford mine. And that would, ultimately, expose an enormous sulfide resource big, low-grade, which would allow us to take a step towards getting the benefits from it and then have the opportunity to do a large-scale concentrator development. There's also a sulfide deposit at depth at Safford. And so how we deal with those together, gives us a way to phase into it that's not available with other projects."

I was just there last week and that's -- that was the key focus of what we were talking about. You're right in saying the nature of oil and gas production in the Deepwater, the Gulf of Mexico involves inherent declines. We have the benefit for several years now of wells that were drilled since we acquired Plains in 2013 that we have hooked up and have begun production on. And the effect of that is deferring the time when the decline hits us. So sort of like what we're doing here in the mining business, we're looking at different scenarios of where can you invest over time at the lowest risk, minimizing capital kinds of investments to arrest that decline. But we have several years to deal with that. But looking out in the long-term future would require reinvestment to maintain these levels of production. And respectively for buyers there's ways of growing it because we've identified a number of potential drilling opportunities by -- that don't require new platform development because we have all this unused capacity in the existing platforms. So there's great opportunity here. It does require capital in the Deepwater, significant capital and time lags before we bring in production on stream. There is -- in this Vito basin area there's tremendous opportunities. And that's what I'm saying and strategically we're saying our focus is going to be on the copper business. We want to make sure that if we talk to people about buying the assets or joint venture relationships for people who might want to come in overtime and invest with us to help minimize our capital. These are good assets and there's great opportunities for it."

Well, the big issue had to do with these 3 new wells that we had at what we call Holstein Deep. These wells were drilled, the logs on the well -- the electric logs that analyze the reservoirs prior to getting production were very strong. Unfortunately, there was limits because the nature of the wells, the depths and so forth of where certain aspects about the quality of the oil, the permeability, the viscosity, were simply not available. And the initial projections were based on analogous data from the area, from other experiences. And so there was just limited data and this is common in the industry. And when these wells came on stream, it was readily apparent that the crude oil quality, the in situ permeability throughout the field was different than expected, the viscosity was measurably higher than pretest expectations. And so it was just a case of where the wells weren't able to produce what they were expected to produce, and it was fairly significant. At the outset, the 3 wells, we were looking at 24,000 barrels a day, that we had lowered it a bit for our second quarter plans.

We were always going to have these exceptional years in 2016, 2017 because we're down at the bottom of the pit. High grades, no stripping, et cetera. So historically, we never expected, as we first got into these expanded operations at Grasberg in 1998, to be able to have this level of production of copper and gold after the pit expired. The resource has grown so much, the way that we process it has been established. So these numbers are pretty relatively consistent with what we had before these exceptional years in 2016, 2017. Though the resource is very large in terms of both the copper and gold production. The unit cost will be low. It's a world-class asset beyond 2017."

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release and the slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.
Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. 
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we also have several members of our senior operating team in the room, including, Red Congers, Mark Johnson and Mike Kendrick. 
I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after the prepared remarks, we'll turn the call over for questions and answers.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $217 million or $0.16 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Our results for the quarter included net gains totaling $39 million or $0.03 per share, which reflected a nonrecurring tax credit, partly offset by the impairment of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for this net gain, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $178 million or $0.13 per share. 
Our EBITDA or earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization for the third quarter totaled $1.35 billion. Our consolidated sales, including the volumes from Tenke Fungurume, which is being reported as a discontinued operations, following our agreement to sell our interest totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper in the quarter; 317,000 ounces of gold; 16 million pounds of molybdenum; and 12 million barrels of oil equivalents. Our copper and gold sales were lower than our July estimates, principally reflecting lower mining rates of the Grasberg mine, which reflected the timing of access to higher grade ore, which we expect to recover in future periods. 
Our average copper price during the quarter was $2.18 per pound. That was below the year-ago average of $2.38. Gold prices averaged $1,327 per ounce during the quarter, which was above last year's third quarter of $11.17 per ounce. Our average net unit cash costs, net of by-product credits, totaled $1.14 per pound of copper in the third quarter. We continued our trend of reducing cash costs. They were $1.52 per pound in the third quarter of 2015. 
Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $980 million. Those cash flows exceeded capital expenditures of $494 million during the quarter. As we previously reported, we commenced the registered offering at the market equity offering of up to $1.5 billion of common stock during the third quarter. And during the quarter, we sold 33.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $415 million, which averaged $12.39 per share.
We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of $19 billion and our cash grew to $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. We had no borrowings under our revolving $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and as you'll see in the slides, we have very little in way of near-term maturities.
We had 1.36 billion common shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. As you'll see in our release and as Richard will be discussing more in-depth in his presentation, we have significant asset sale transactions that we expected to complete during the fourth quarter, a total of $5.2 billion, which includes the previously announced transaction for our Tenke Fungurume stake as well as assets -- oil and gas assets, including the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our onshore California properties. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to materials -- slide presentation materials on our website."
273607,403656762,1060138,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Freeport-McMoRan Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sun rise here in Phoenix, and that's a good way to start our call off. We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago when our",4241,"Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sun rise here in Phoenix, and that's a good way to start our call off. 
We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago when our board acted to restructure our board and return our focus to our global leading copper business. And during 2016, we have made some significant accomplishments and we've positioned our company for the future with these significant copper resources and with an improved balance sheet. 
But before I really talk about that, I want to address right at the outset the reason why our copper production volumes in the -- this quarter fell short of the estimates. As you know, we are mining in the last phase of the Grasberg open pit. In some way it's hard to believe, but we started developing it in 1990s. And here we are at the very end of the pit. It is, at this point, physically, a very confined area right at the bottom of the pit. The ore body extends lower where the mine is at as an underground operation. But we have current mining in an area that's constricted, but it has extraordinarily high grades of copper and gold. And these grades are increasing as we mine. 
During the quarter, our planned mining rate, the actual physical material we moved, that was about 15% short of what we had planned. And as a result of that, we simply did not access as much of this high grade ores as we expected and what our plans projected. We'll talk more about this later, and we're certainly disappointed with this mining rate. A lot of it has to do with some worker issues that we're addressing, and we believe we can manage as we go forward. But we have the equipment to mine, the designs, the people and the ore grades to allow us to mine this material. And so what we're faced now is the fact that we didn't get to it this quarter, it means that it's a timing issue. We will get to it as we go forward. We'll make up a lot of it in 2017. It'll have an impact in the fourth quarter, and we should finish mining it early in 2018. So this is not a valuation issue or really significant economic issue, but more of a timing issue. 
Now looking back, the fourth quarter of 2015 was a very difficult time. But as we went into 2016, the first half of the quarter was really, really tough as you'll remember. We set on, on a path to cut our debt. In response to one of your questions in our year-end earnings call, we -- you pressed me to say what was our target for debt reduction, and I said $5 billion to $10 billion. At that point, to be really candid with you, the market was tough that we didn't -- I really didn't have a clear-cut view of how we were going to do it, but we were committed to do it. But we set on this path, now we believe we have clear sight to reducing our debt by $10 billion. And we executed this plan in a way, after looking on a lot of alternatives, that will enable us to retain a core set of assets that will build a great company around. It's characterized by long lives, good cost positions, long-term growth options when markets indicate that future investments will be needed and it will be, and a balance of geographic diversity. 
And so we're really pleased to hear that we are -- we have a clear path now for achieving these objectives. As an organization, we were already on a solid path to cut our costs in our capital spending. And our global team has really stepped up to this challenge. We delivered completion of the Cerro Verde project on time and on budget. It was a very big, complicated project. And we've moved quickly to adjust our operating plans and our capital spending at each one of our operations to respond to the situation. And our team has had a long history with this. The organization has operated low-grade mines in the U.S. for over 100 years. And this has made the team that Red leads and Mark Johnson leads, really good operators in dealing with this kind of environment. 
We operate all of our mines, and so we can benchmark our operations and share best practices and people and resources around the company and across the portfolio. Our net unit cost average, $1.14 per pound during the quarter, and this is 25% below last year's third quarter. And before by-product credits, costs were down 20% over the year. And at each one of our sites, we have really focused on cash flow generation, and we look at our performance, net of sustaining capital cost. And we've been very tough on capital at this point. And despite these low prices, our team is very enthusiastic and focused and energized to maximize cash flows. 
During 2015, our CapEx exceeded our cash flows. That was primarily because of the oil and gas business. We worked hard to reverse this and generated $500 million in cash flows above CapEx in the third quarter. And we expect to be able -- we expect and are confident that we can continue to generate free cash flow over the next several quarters even at low prices because we're going to constrain capital spending until the market warrants new investments. And that will contribute to our debt reduction -- achieve our debt reduction targets. 
Year-to-date, we have announced $6.6 billion in anticipated proceeds from asset sales transactions. This does not include potential additional consideration of $680 million. We've, to date, received proceeds of $1.4 billion and expect to receive $5.2 billion by year-end from transactions that are under contract, which we expect to close. So these steps will enable us to achieve our deleveraging objective of cutting our debt in half by the end of 2017. But keeping a really strong set of assets that, over the long run, will enable our shareholders to benefit as the market recovers. 
Slide 4 is a summary of our recent announcements of our oil and gas transactions. You recall that at the end of 2015, we announced a process to evaluate options for this business, our board engaged special financial advisers and we went into the marketplace to see in the first quarter if we could find a buyer for the whole business. And that was a really tough time to try to find someone to buy a set of assets like we had in the oil and gas business. It could have been worse. And by the end of the quarter, the first quarter of this year, we had concluded that we would likely retain these assets for a longer period of time. And that we'll hold onto them and wait for market recovery. 
At that point, we reorganized our management of our oil and gas business. We changed it from being a stand-alone, separate business to being a separate division of our company. We put together, from the existing group, a really effective operating management team. And so that was the plan going into it. After the first quarter, and after we had announced what we were going to do, parties emerged with renewed interests, who are talking to us about buying sets of those assets. And so we continued our process of discussions. I can assure you that we talk -- we gave everyone in the marketplace the opportunity to come in and talk with us. People knew it. Bankers were out knocking on doors. And so we really had a process that exposed these assets to the marketplace. And at the end of the day, we had a competitive process. And we reached the transaction in September to sell our production in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico to Anadarko. And then in October, we've now announced the transaction to sell our production onshore in California. 
In the aggregate, we will receive $2.6 billion in gross proceeds and $300 million in contingent consideration. And I will assure you, we thought long and hard and had active discussions with our board about selling these assets during this period of weak oil prices and taking into account the current outlook for oil prices. And -- but the nature of this oil and gas business is such that because of depletion, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, it would require, over time, continued reinvestment to maintain the assets. If you didn't do that, they simply go away. And then you have very significant reclamation obligations. And the government's rules for providing financial assurance for those reclamation obligations are changing, and the requirements are likely to be more significant. And so we took all that into account and concluded that these transactions were consistent with our strategy and will allow us to focus on what our future is going to be. 
Now you know I can tell you, I've read analysts who assigned a much higher-value to these assets, and what we sold them to, a theoretical value. Buyers weren't willing to pay that after a very extensive process that we went through. We're convinced we got very attractive prices for us. The purchasers will likely do well with these assets because they're good assets. But for our company, considering the total implications financially of continuing to be in that business and all of them, I'm very comfortable with what we did and really pleased that we were able -- we were really able to get that done. 
So that is summarized on Page 4. And we'd be happy to answer any questions about it. Now we continue looking at Page 5 to progress. The sale of our Tenke asset. You all heard me say, this is an asset that we sold with great reluctance. It's a great long-term asset, and it fit very well in our portfolio. And I'm very proud of our team when we started out in 2008 in developing it in a very challenging environment and going through the financial crisis and working on all the issues of doing business there. It's been a real pleasure to do business in the DRC and work with the people there and do whatever our team has done. But it's also an asset that value is going to be realized over very long periods of time. And we were able to find a buyer at a valuation that's attractive in relation to near-term cash flows. And China Molybdenum, privately-owned Chinese companies that's making global investments in the mining industry, is progressing their transaction. The process has gone smoothly. It is a public company, not a state-owned company. And they have gotten their shareholder approval and other regulatory approvals within China that was necessary to go forward with the transaction. 
And where we are today, there's still a condition remaining to close is resolving a transfer right that our minority partner lending mining has in the property, and the contract is called a right of first offer, or ROFO. And we've been working with China Moly and Lundin to resolve this. We currently extended the time frame for resolving it to November 15. 
You've also read that Gecamines, the state-owned mining company in the DRC, has asserted that it has preemptive rights to this transaction. The transaction itself involves entities outside of the DRC at a different corporate level. We disagree with Gecamines assertion on this, and our legal advisors support our conclusion. But we are working with China Molybdenum, with Lundin, with Gecamines and with the government, so that we can all find a way forward to work together to resolve this issue. China Molybdenum has strongly expressed their commitment to closing this transaction as soon as possible, and we're working together to find the appropriate resolution for the Lundin ROFO. We still expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
It's $2.6 billion in proceeds and $120 million in contingent consideration. And we're also given them exclusive right to acquire an exploration property we have in the DRC and a downstream cobalt business. So all of that is working to get closed in the fourth quarter. 
So putting this all together, on Slide 6, you can see the aggregate steps that we have taken. If we look at the completion of these asset sales transactions, completion of the previously announced $1.5 billion at the market offering, which, to date, we've completed about 25% of that $1.5 billion amount, execution of our operating plans, we expect to achieve our debt targets by the end of 2017. And we're well on our way of doing this. 
We have the portfolio of remaining assets that we want to keep. We're not planning additional divestments. We may take some steps to deal with the remaining assets in our oil and gas business. And we are prepared to divest at Grasberg an additional roughly 20% interest pursuant to our discussions with the Indonesian government that is contingent on conditional, getting our long-term rights extended on the basis of giving us fiscal and legal surety. But we have -- we're committed to the government, selling additional 20% interest that's not in these numbers. So at the end of the day, we will have a reasonable balance sheet, an industry-leading portfolio of copper assets that would be available for a long-term development. And these are the sort of assets in the copper business that at best are very, very difficult to replicate, if at all possible. 
So looking at those assets, on Page 7 is an overview. We have -- we will have 7 copper mines, which will be led by Morenci -- 7 copper mines in North America, which will be led by our flagship, Morenci mine, which is a fabulous operations. These mines are very long-lived. It gives us long-term optionality on copper prices and future investment opportunities. We will have 2 mines in South America. The Cerro Verde mine, which today, has the largest processing facilities globally and is operating very well. And the El Abra mine in Chile, which has a very significant long-term growth opportunities for us as well as Grasberg. We've managed these assets successfully over a long period of time in different price environments. And withnin these mines, we have significant growth opportunities that we'd be prepared to pursue when the time is right. 
And we showed this on Page 8. And this is our copper sulfide development opportunities. In alphabetical listing, not a priority listing, we're still assessing from a priority standpoint, which ones we would tag first. And even though we're not spending capital on these projects, we are spending efforts to develop plans for future investments. And they are sulfide opportunities that we have identified through our exploration drilling and exploration analysis, very large ore bodies where we can take advantage of existing infrastructure to add on to processing facilities that will allow us to develop these in a profitable way. 
Now copper market commentary. Copper price in today's levels is still very low. It reflects the global economy and the slowdown in China. But stepping back, the surpluses that were previously predicted are lower than what was expected. We've had recent supply growth, and there are still a couple of projects being completed. We were a big part of that. We had 3 big projects that we started in the 2010 time frame that have been completed now. And with the current projects being finished, the recent supply growth is not sustainable. These long periods of low prices will impact future supplies, with McKinsey showing up 4 million ton decline from existing mines in the next coming years, 2025. The top 10 mines in the world today produced less than 5.5 million tons of copper a year, and when McKinsey feels the incentive price to develop new mines supplies on the order of $3.30. 
Inventory has risen during the quarter. There are reasons for that. The levels still remain relatively low by historical standards. And when you look at the total marketplace, relatively, they say absolutely small increases in demand are supply disruptions that well move the market to deficit in a short period of time. Page 10 is a slide, I don't think we've used recently, but we've used over the years, which shows the 10 largest mines in the world in terms of reserves and copper production. We have 3 of those mines at Grasberg, Cerro Verde and Morenci. You can see what I refer to earlier, these top 10 mines in 2016, we'll be using less than 5.5 million tons a year, replace 4 million tons in the future in terms of what you're looking at, it's really a significant challenge for the industry. 
Other than [indiscernible] Grasberg is the most recent discovery in 1988. Many of these mines were discovered back in the 1800s. And here, our Grasberg for completing mining at the open pit this year. So the point is mining world-class mines is extremely rare, and now we're in a period of time where -- and this is where we've gone through it over the last 15 years, extensive exploration when prices were high, companies were investing. So even with all this investment, finding big new mines is really tough. And having this -- these kinds of mines in our portfolio is going to prove very valuable, 100% over time because. There's not any -- we haven't had any big technology revolution in the copper mining business. We've made progress with technology and so forth. But copper, as a commodity is very tough to replace. We haven't seen any shale oil type developments in our business. In fact, we're seeing affecting opportunity dry up, new opportunities are low grade, sulfide opportunities which require lots of infrastructure and development and mining a lot of material to get a copper like we're getting at Cerro Verde. 
Now what are we going to be doing in the meantime before we start reinvesting again? We're going to look for every opportunity we can to continue to reduce cost and increase production. One of these things and our are challenged now, you're seeing our data. We will have a falloff in production at Grasberg in 2018 as we make the transition from the pit to the underground at the Grasberg Block Cave. And so we challenge ourselves to mitigate these production declines while we spend a minimal amount of capital. In the meantime, one of the things we're looking at is pit wall designs to optimize our slopes to steepen pit angles to minimize stripping and add ore. And this can reduce costs as we add ore. And we're having a straight cut here in doing this in a safe way. But this is just one example of what we're doing to see if we can find ways of maximizing production safely at a time when we're going to be making this transition and what we'll be reporting to you on this as we go forward.
I mentioned Page 12, talks about Grasberg. We had to deal with labor grievances. We've had to deal with some bonus issues and some issues about management, supervisory relationships with the workforce. We had a 10-day work stoppage in late September, but this had caused us issues relating to worker productivity for a longer time. And it's the principle reason why we had a shortfall in the mining rate. As I've talked about earlier, this is a timing issue. The ore remains there. We're not seeing any questions about the grades in the ore or its availability. And so we've developed new plans, which we shared with you for how we will make up for this ore that we had failed to melt -- to mine in the third quarter. And this carries over because grades are increasing and so forth as we delayed this, it has an impact on the fourth quarter. 
But anyway, extend by some period of time, how long we'll be in the pint, it now goes into 2018. But we will mine this ore and the economic impact will not be significant. We continue to have discussions with the government. There are 2 really key issues. One is an existing regulation in Indonesia that prohibits exports of ores. And the government has defined copper concentrate as an ore, even though it's a commercial project -- product, which captures more than 90% of value copper metal. But under their regulations, they call it an ore, existing regulations prohibit the export of ores beyond January 2017. There's a recognition in government that this needs to be addressed. And I believe it will be. And we're working actively with the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and other government officials on this issue. And then beyond that, the key issue for us is having the extension of our operating rights beyond the primary term of our existing contracts which extends to 2021. 
Under the terms of that contract, we're entitled to 2 10-year extensions on the same terms as it is on the contract. And the government has agreed that it will not unreasonably delay or withhold approving that extension, but it hasn't been approved yet. So those are the 2 things that we're working with. There's been a lot of political changes in Indonesia that have affected this. But we have a -- we're committed to having a good working relationship with the new minister, the new vice minister and the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and with the President and other government officials. And so we are working amicably to address these issues. It's important for Indonesia as well as for us, and particularly important for the promise of Papua. 
Page 13 shows our adjusted mining plan. We see the schematic of the pit in the underground Grasberg Block Cave. The existing underground production coming from the DOZ and the DMLZ mine. So we are -- we will adjust this every quarter and you can see what our new outlook for copper and gold production is coming out of Grasberg. We have in the appendix, longer-term projections, so you can see that. Our outlook for 2016 now is for 4.8 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.26 million ounces of gold, 73 [ph] million pounds of molybdenum. For the year site cost, net of by-product credits, $1.20. Operating cash flows at $2.10 copper, in the fourth quarter will be $3.6 billion. Each $0.10 change in the fourth quarter have a delta of $150 million. And our CapEx for the year of $2.8 billion, including over $1 billion for oil and gas, which was actually a carryover from spending that was done in 2015. Our sales profile for next -- going to the 2017 is shown on Slide 15. 
You can see both our copper production. Now this takes out Tenke and the incremental interest that we sold at Morenci to Sumitomo earlier in the year. But the gold carryover from lower volumes in 2016, into 2017 and into 2018. Page 16 shows 2017 EBITDA and cash flows. This excludes all the oil and gas business essentially with the deepwater in California sales. It's excludes Tenke. It excludes the incremental interest at Morenci. And you can see EBITDA at $2, being just under $5 billion [ph], 2 25 just under 6, and 50 just under 7. And operating cash flows, $2.6 billion [ph], $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion within this range of copper prices. It excludes working capital changes. We expect a positive working capital impact in 2017. 
Capital spending. You can see just how our efforts we undertook cut capital is unfolding. I mentioned the $2.8 billion for 2016 falling to $1.7 billion in 2017. That's essentially the spending that we'll be doing, developing the underground in Grasberg as well as the constrained sustaining capital for the rest of our business. 18 [ph] summarizes where we are with our debt structure. You can see 9 30 [ph], we had $19 million of debt and $1.1 billion [ph] of cash. Pro forma for the asset sales transactions, but with no additional equity from the ATM offering. We would end the year with $3.3 billion in cash and our maturities for 2017 are $1.3 billion. So we have ample cash to deal with our near-term liquidity and a good set of assets of dealing with our long-term balance sheet issues. 
So we talked in the beginning of the year about execution. And we are continually focused on that. As I mentioned, we're disappointed about the mining rate issues at Grasberg. But we're working on that every day. We're working on securing our long-term rights in Indonesia every day. We feel good about our plans for debt reduction, building long-term value, and safety in our business is a challenging part of it. We certainly had our challenges in the third quarter. But that is the first thing we talk about whenever we meet with our team. And that overrides everything that we do. 
So thank you for bearing with me on this overview and I look forward to your questions."

And the implication seems to be that the problems over the third quarter that you saw are going to be hamper production in the fourth quarter, effective push some of that back into next year. Can you clarify, are you more constrained in what you can produce over fourth quarter because of these lingering issues? Or does this move around out of any kind of conservatism? I'm just trying to understand how much of this shift as you respond to conditions at the mine? And how much, if any, is any market conditions, positioning as you negotiate with Indonesians, et cetera."

As we progress our mine plan at this stage, we get to higher grades as we go forward. So the fact that we were not able to mine the material that we plan to mine in the first quarter means that it simply going to take longer to get to the higher grade material that we originally planned to mine in the fourth quarter. And that gets pushed out. We can't do more to get to it quicker because we're constrained by physical space. So our plan called for us to do everything that we can do all along. And when it gets pushed back, it gets pushed back over time physically. So it's not a -- it's really not a strategic or tactical decision, but it's a physical consequence of what we face. Now we know we got to be diligent about keeping our equipment operating and available and so forth, because delays in that can have an impact in the future. We were working hard to address these issues of concern by our workers. We've made some responsive steps to the issues they raised in terms of the bonus, in terms of the relationships between supervisors and the workers. And that's an ongoing process that we'll have to work with. It's a complicated labor situation there in Papua with the nature of the workforce and how it's changed over the years. All of this requires a lot of attention and a lot of work. What it doesn't change is that high grade ore is there. I mean that remains there, and it's a question of getting to it as quickly as we can. We want to do it, safety is the first issue. But we're not trying to do any of this in terms of positioning with the government of Indonesia. We won't operate in an efficient straightforward way, but that's been in our history and that's going to be our future. While we're doing this, I might add that our work in underground development is going extraordinary well. I mean we're meeting our targets in terms of development and putting things in place. We're getting approvals from the government to do what we need to do. That's a big project, the discounting gets out of the spotlight here, but it's in total, over time a $15 billion [ph] investment project and we're spending roughly $1 billion a year and that's the future for us and our partner, Rio Tinto, as we move forward. So as we're dealing with these important issues near-term in a bit, we're also keeping great focus on the underground development. And it's going very well."

As soon as the pit is complete, then we start the process of initiating the Block Cave, and then that ramps up the process that takes place of capacity coming online as we develop more drawpoints. So it's on track. The DMLZ, we initiated the cave earlier this year. And that continues to advance and we're well positioned for that mine to continue to grow in capacity.

So we're just prepared to work with the government in whatever approach they decide to use. The challenge of not addressing our contract until 2019 is one, we are simply unable to invest in the smelter without having our long-term contract assured. I mean, that's a huge investment, a significant investment. And we simply just can't do it without knowing that we'll continue to operate beyond 2021. We've also agreed to divest an additional 20%, which is a significant amount of value. And clearly, we could not invest without having any certainty about our position to operate beyond 2021.

How many push backs in the mine we want in a year. I'd say we've historically been very aggressive on that. We've had push backs on what we do over 18 [ph] benches in the year. We base a lot of our mine plans basin that opportunity that takes into account the limited mining space. And we're looking at somewhere to 15 to 16 as we complete the pit, 15 to 16 benches for the year. So it's something that we've been able to do before that accounts for space and equipment sequencing. We feel comfortable we did make some adjustments to our mining rates in the fourth quarter. Our previous forecasts had slightly higher mining rates. We're currently projecting that for the remainder of the quarter that we're going to do in the order of 180,000 tons a day. We feel comfortable with that plan. We had some things that we'll manage on a day-to-day basis. We're working closely with our supervisor and in communication plants in the workers. So it's -- there's multi elements of how we are approaching the productivity issues in the pit. We've also brought some resources from Red's team over there. We've got a group of guys there now that are helping us, just looked at sequencing and making sure that the pit blasting is going on as scheduled. So we're throwing a lot of resources at it. We understand the importance of it. We are, like I said, focus of the quality of mining.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release and the slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.
Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. 
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we also have several members of our senior operating team in the room, including, Red Congers, Mark Johnson and Mike Kendrick. 
I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after the prepared remarks, we'll turn the call over for questions and answers.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $217 million or $0.16 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Our results for the quarter included net gains totaling $39 million or $0.03 per share, which reflected a nonrecurring tax credit, partly offset by the impairment of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for this net gain, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $178 million or $0.13 per share. 
Our EBITDA or earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization for the third quarter totaled $1.35 billion. Our consolidated sales, including the volumes from Tenke Fungurume, which is being reported as a discontinued operations, following our agreement to sell our interest totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper in the quarter; 317,000 ounces of gold; 16 million pounds of molybdenum; and 12 million barrels of oil equivalents. Our copper and gold sales were lower than our July estimates, principally reflecting lower mining rates of the Grasberg mine, which reflected the timing of access to higher grade ore, which we expect to recover in future periods. 
Our average copper price during the quarter was $2.18 per pound. That was below the year-ago average of $2.38. Gold prices averaged $1,327 per ounce during the quarter, which was above last year's third quarter of $11.17 per ounce. Our average net unit cash costs, net of by-product credits, totaled $1.14 per pound of copper in the third quarter. We continued our trend of reducing cash costs. They were $1.52 per pound in the third quarter of 2015. 
Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $980 million. Those cash flows exceeded capital expenditures of $494 million during the quarter. As we previously reported, we commenced the registered offering at the market equity offering of up to $1.5 billion of common stock during the third quarter. And during the quarter, we sold 33.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $415 million, which averaged $12.39 per share.
We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of $19 billion and our cash grew to $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. We had no borrowings under our revolving $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and as you'll see in the slides, we have very little in way of near-term maturities.
We had 1.36 billion common shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. As you'll see in our release and as Richard will be discussing more in-depth in his presentation, we have significant asset sale transactions that we expected to complete during the fourth quarter, a total of $5.2 billion, which includes the previously announced transaction for our Tenke Fungurume stake as well as assets -- oil and gas assets, including the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our onshore California properties. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to materials -- slide presentation materials on our website."
273607,403656762,1060401,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Freeport-McMoRan Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sun rise here in Phoenix, and that's a good way to start our call off. We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago when our",4251,"Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sun rise here in Phoenix, and that's a good way to start our call off. 
We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago when our board acted to restructure our board and return our focus to our global leading copper business. And during 2016, we have made some significant accomplishments and we've positioned our company for the future with these significant copper resources and with an improved balance sheet. 
But before I really talk about that, I want to address right at the outset the reason why our copper production volumes in the -- this quarter fell short of the estimates. As you know, we are mining in the last phase of the Grasberg open pit. In some way it's hard to believe, but we started developing it in 1990s. And here we are at the very end of the pit. It is, at this point, physically, a very confined area right at the bottom of the pit. The ore body extends lower where the mine is at as an underground operation. But we have current mining in an area that's constricted, but it has extraordinarily high grades of copper and gold. And these grades are increasing as we mine. 
During the quarter, our planned mining rate, the actual physical material we moved, that was about 15% short of what we had planned. And as a result of that, we simply did not access as much of this high grade ores as we expected and what our plans projected. We'll talk more about this later, and we're certainly disappointed with this mining rate. A lot of it has to do with some worker issues that we're addressing, and we believe we can manage as we go forward. But we have the equipment to mine, the designs, the people and the ore grades to allow us to mine this material. And so what we're faced now is the fact that we didn't get to it this quarter, it means that it's a timing issue. We will get to it as we go forward. We'll make up a lot of it in 2017. It'll have an impact in the fourth quarter, and we should finish mining it early in 2018. So this is not a valuation issue or really significant economic issue, but more of a timing issue. 
Now looking back, the fourth quarter of 2015 was a very difficult time. But as we went into 2016, the first half of the quarter was really, really tough as you'll remember. We set on, on a path to cut our debt. In response to one of your questions in our year-end earnings call, we -- you pressed me to say what was our target for debt reduction, and I said $5 billion to $10 billion. At that point, to be really candid with you, the market was tough that we didn't -- I really didn't have a clear-cut view of how we were going to do it, but we were committed to do it. But we set on this path, now we believe we have clear sight to reducing our debt by $10 billion. And we executed this plan in a way, after looking on a lot of alternatives, that will enable us to retain a core set of assets that will build a great company around. It's characterized by long lives, good cost positions, long-term growth options when markets indicate that future investments will be needed and it will be, and a balance of geographic diversity. 
And so we're really pleased to hear that we are -- we have a clear path now for achieving these objectives. As an organization, we were already on a solid path to cut our costs in our capital spending. And our global team has really stepped up to this challenge. We delivered completion of the Cerro Verde project on time and on budget. It was a very big, complicated project. And we've moved quickly to adjust our operating plans and our capital spending at each one of our operations to respond to the situation. And our team has had a long history with this. The organization has operated low-grade mines in the U.S. for over 100 years. And this has made the team that Red leads and Mark Johnson leads, really good operators in dealing with this kind of environment. 
We operate all of our mines, and so we can benchmark our operations and share best practices and people and resources around the company and across the portfolio. Our net unit cost average, $1.14 per pound during the quarter, and this is 25% below last year's third quarter. And before by-product credits, costs were down 20% over the year. And at each one of our sites, we have really focused on cash flow generation, and we look at our performance, net of sustaining capital cost. And we've been very tough on capital at this point. And despite these low prices, our team is very enthusiastic and focused and energized to maximize cash flows. 
During 2015, our CapEx exceeded our cash flows. That was primarily because of the oil and gas business. We worked hard to reverse this and generated $500 million in cash flows above CapEx in the third quarter. And we expect to be able -- we expect and are confident that we can continue to generate free cash flow over the next several quarters even at low prices because we're going to constrain capital spending until the market warrants new investments. And that will contribute to our debt reduction -- achieve our debt reduction targets. 
Year-to-date, we have announced $6.6 billion in anticipated proceeds from asset sales transactions. This does not include potential additional consideration of $680 million. We've, to date, received proceeds of $1.4 billion and expect to receive $5.2 billion by year-end from transactions that are under contract, which we expect to close. So these steps will enable us to achieve our deleveraging objective of cutting our debt in half by the end of 2017. But keeping a really strong set of assets that, over the long run, will enable our shareholders to benefit as the market recovers. 
Slide 4 is a summary of our recent announcements of our oil and gas transactions. You recall that at the end of 2015, we announced a process to evaluate options for this business, our board engaged special financial advisers and we went into the marketplace to see in the first quarter if we could find a buyer for the whole business. And that was a really tough time to try to find someone to buy a set of assets like we had in the oil and gas business. It could have been worse. And by the end of the quarter, the first quarter of this year, we had concluded that we would likely retain these assets for a longer period of time. And that we'll hold onto them and wait for market recovery. 
At that point, we reorganized our management of our oil and gas business. We changed it from being a stand-alone, separate business to being a separate division of our company. We put together, from the existing group, a really effective operating management team. And so that was the plan going into it. After the first quarter, and after we had announced what we were going to do, parties emerged with renewed interests, who are talking to us about buying sets of those assets. And so we continued our process of discussions. I can assure you that we talk -- we gave everyone in the marketplace the opportunity to come in and talk with us. People knew it. Bankers were out knocking on doors. And so we really had a process that exposed these assets to the marketplace. And at the end of the day, we had a competitive process. And we reached the transaction in September to sell our production in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico to Anadarko. And then in October, we've now announced the transaction to sell our production onshore in California. 
In the aggregate, we will receive $2.6 billion in gross proceeds and $300 million in contingent consideration. And I will assure you, we thought long and hard and had active discussions with our board about selling these assets during this period of weak oil prices and taking into account the current outlook for oil prices. And -- but the nature of this oil and gas business is such that because of depletion, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, it would require, over time, continued reinvestment to maintain the assets. If you didn't do that, they simply go away. And then you have very significant reclamation obligations. And the government's rules for providing financial assurance for those reclamation obligations are changing, and the requirements are likely to be more significant. And so we took all that into account and concluded that these transactions were consistent with our strategy and will allow us to focus on what our future is going to be. 
Now you know I can tell you, I've read analysts who assigned a much higher-value to these assets, and what we sold them to, a theoretical value. Buyers weren't willing to pay that after a very extensive process that we went through. We're convinced we got very attractive prices for us. The purchasers will likely do well with these assets because they're good assets. But for our company, considering the total implications financially of continuing to be in that business and all of them, I'm very comfortable with what we did and really pleased that we were able -- we were really able to get that done. 
So that is summarized on Page 4. And we'd be happy to answer any questions about it. Now we continue looking at Page 5 to progress. The sale of our Tenke asset. You all heard me say, this is an asset that we sold with great reluctance. It's a great long-term asset, and it fit very well in our portfolio. And I'm very proud of our team when we started out in 2008 in developing it in a very challenging environment and going through the financial crisis and working on all the issues of doing business there. It's been a real pleasure to do business in the DRC and work with the people there and do whatever our team has done. But it's also an asset that value is going to be realized over very long periods of time. And we were able to find a buyer at a valuation that's attractive in relation to near-term cash flows. And China Molybdenum, privately-owned Chinese companies that's making global investments in the mining industry, is progressing their transaction. The process has gone smoothly. It is a public company, not a state-owned company. And they have gotten their shareholder approval and other regulatory approvals within China that was necessary to go forward with the transaction. 
And where we are today, there's still a condition remaining to close is resolving a transfer right that our minority partner lending mining has in the property, and the contract is called a right of first offer, or ROFO. And we've been working with China Moly and Lundin to resolve this. We currently extended the time frame for resolving it to November 15. 
You've also read that Gecamines, the state-owned mining company in the DRC, has asserted that it has preemptive rights to this transaction. The transaction itself involves entities outside of the DRC at a different corporate level. We disagree with Gecamines assertion on this, and our legal advisors support our conclusion. But we are working with China Molybdenum, with Lundin, with Gecamines and with the government, so that we can all find a way forward to work together to resolve this issue. China Molybdenum has strongly expressed their commitment to closing this transaction as soon as possible, and we're working together to find the appropriate resolution for the Lundin ROFO. We still expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
It's $2.6 billion in proceeds and $120 million in contingent consideration. And we're also given them exclusive right to acquire an exploration property we have in the DRC and a downstream cobalt business. So all of that is working to get closed in the fourth quarter. 
So putting this all together, on Slide 6, you can see the aggregate steps that we have taken. If we look at the completion of these asset sales transactions, completion of the previously announced $1.5 billion at the market offering, which, to date, we've completed about 25% of that $1.5 billion amount, execution of our operating plans, we expect to achieve our debt targets by the end of 2017. And we're well on our way of doing this. 
We have the portfolio of remaining assets that we want to keep. We're not planning additional divestments. We may take some steps to deal with the remaining assets in our oil and gas business. And we are prepared to divest at Grasberg an additional roughly 20% interest pursuant to our discussions with the Indonesian government that is contingent on conditional, getting our long-term rights extended on the basis of giving us fiscal and legal surety. But we have -- we're committed to the government, selling additional 20% interest that's not in these numbers. So at the end of the day, we will have a reasonable balance sheet, an industry-leading portfolio of copper assets that would be available for a long-term development. And these are the sort of assets in the copper business that at best are very, very difficult to replicate, if at all possible. 
So looking at those assets, on Page 7 is an overview. We have -- we will have 7 copper mines, which will be led by Morenci -- 7 copper mines in North America, which will be led by our flagship, Morenci mine, which is a fabulous operations. These mines are very long-lived. It gives us long-term optionality on copper prices and future investment opportunities. We will have 2 mines in South America. The Cerro Verde mine, which today, has the largest processing facilities globally and is operating very well. And the El Abra mine in Chile, which has a very significant long-term growth opportunities for us as well as Grasberg. We've managed these assets successfully over a long period of time in different price environments. And within these mines, we have significant growth opportunities that we'd be prepared to pursue when the time is right. 
And we showed this on Page 8. And this is our copper sulfide development opportunities. In alphabetical listing, not a priority listing, we're still assessing from a priority standpoint, which ones we would tag first. And even though we're not spending capital on these projects, we are spending efforts to develop plans for future investments. And they are sulfide opportunities that we have identified through our exploration drilling and exploration analysis, very large ore bodies where we can take advantage of existing infrastructure to add on to processing facilities that will allow us to develop these in a profitable way. 
Now copper market commentary. Copper price in today's levels is still very low. It reflects the global economy and the slowdown in China. But stepping back, the surpluses that were previously predicted are lower than what was expected. We've had recent supply growth, and there are still a couple of projects being completed. We were a big part of that. We had 3 big projects that we started in the 2010 time frame that have been completed now. And with the current projects being finished, the recent supply growth is not sustainable. These long periods of low prices will impact future supplies, with McKinsey showing up 4 million ton decline from existing mines in the next coming years, 2025. The top 10 mines in the world today produced less than 5.5 million tons of copper a year, and when McKinsey feels the incentive price to develop new mines supplies on the order of $3.30. 
The inventory has risen during the quarter. There are reasons for that. The levels still remain relatively low by historical standards, and when you look at the total marketplace, relatively are, let' say, absolutely small increases in demand or supply disruptions that well move the market to deficit in a short period of time. 
Page 10 is a slide I don't think we've used recently, but we've used over the years, which shows the 10 largest mines in the world in terms of reserves and copper production. We have 3 of those mines at Grasberg, Cerro Verde and Morenci. You can see what I referred to earlier, these top 10 mines in 2016 are -- will reduce in less than 5.5 million tons a year, so they replace 4 million tons in the future in terms of what you're looking at is really a significant challenge for the industry. 
Other than Oyu Tolgoi and Los Pelambres, Grasberg is the most recent discovery in 1988. Many of these mines were discovered back in the 1800s. And here, our Grasberg, completing mining at the open pit this year. So the point is mining world-class mines is extremely rare, and now we're in a period of time where -- and this is where we've gone through, over the last 15 years, extensive exploration when prices were high and companies were investing. So even with all this investment, finding big new mines is really tough. And having this -- these kinds of mines in our portfolio is going to prove very valuable, 100% over time, because there's not any -- we haven't had any big technology revolution in the copper mining business. We've made progress with technology and so forth. But copper, as a commodity, is very tough to replace. We haven't seen any shale oil-type developments in our business. In fact, we're seeing [indiscernible] opportunities dry up, new opportunities are low grade, sulfide opportunities which require lots of infrastructure and development and mining a lot of material to get a copper like we're getting at Cerro Verde. 
Now what are we going to be doing in the meantime before we start reinvesting again? We're going to look for every opportunity we can to continue to reduce cost and increase production. One of these things and are challenged now, you're seeing our data, we will have a falloff in production at Grasberg in 2018 as we make the transition from the pit to the underground at the Grasberg Block Cave. And so we challenge ourselves to mitigate these production declines while we spend a minimal amount of capital. In the meantime, one of the things we're looking at is pit wall designs to optimize our slopes to steepen pit angles to minimize stripping and add ore. And this can reduce costs as we add ore. And we're having a straight adherence in doing this in a safe way. But this is just one example of what we're doing to see if we can find ways of maximizing production safely at a time when we're going to be making this transition, and we'll be reporting to you on this as we go forward.
I mentioned -- Page 12 talks about Grasberg. We had to deal with labor grievances. It had to deal with some bonus issues and some issues about management, supervisory relationships with the workforce. We had a 10-day work stoppage in late September, but this had caused us issues relating to worker productivity for a longer period of time and was the principle reason why we had a shortfall in the mining rate. As I've talked about earlier, this is a timing issue. The ore remains there. We're not seeing any questions about the grades in the ore or its availability. And so we've developed new plans, which we shared with you for how we will make up for this ore that we had failed to melt -- to mine in the third quarter. And this carries over because grades are increasing and so forth as we delay this, it will -- it has an impact on the fourth quarter.  But -- and it'll extend by some period of time how long it will be in the pit, it now goes into 2018. But we will mine this ore, and the economic impact will not be significant. 
We continue to have discussions with the government. There are 2 really key issues. One is an existing regulation in Indonesia that prohibits exports of ores. And the government has defined copper concentrate as an ore, even though it's a commercial project -- product, which captures more than 90% of value copper metal. But under their regulations, they call it an ore, existing regulations prohibit the export of ores beyond January 2017. There's a recognition in the government that this needs to be addressed, and I believe it will be. And we're working actively with the Ministry of Energy and Mines and other government officials on this issue. And then beyond that, the key issue for us is having the extension of our operating rights beyond the primary term of our existing contracts, which extends to 2021. Under the terms of that contract, we're entitled to 2 10-year extensions on the same terms as it is on the contract. And the government has agreed that it will not unreasonably delay or withhold approving that extension, but it hasn't been approved yet. So those are the 2 things that we're working with. There's been a lot of political changes in Indonesia that have affected this. But we have a -- we're committed to having a good working relationship with the new minister, the new vice minister and the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and with the President and other government officials. And so we are working amicably to address these issues. It's important for Indonesia as well as for us, and particularly important for the promise of Papua. 
Page 13 shows our adjusted mining plan. We see the schematic of the pit in the underground Grasberg Block Cave. The existing underground production coming from the DOZ and the DMLZ mine. So we are -- we will adjust this every quarter, and you can see what our new outlook for copper and gold production is coming out of Grasberg. We have, in the appendix, longer-term projections, so you can see that. 
Our outlook for 2016 now is for 4.8 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.26 million ounces of gold, 73 million pounds of molybdenum. For the year, site cost, net of by-product credits of $1.20. Operating cash flows at $2.10 copper in the fourth quarter will be $3.6 billion. Each $0.10 change in the fourth quarter have a delta of $150 million. And our CapEx for the year of $2.8 billion, including over $1 billion for oil and gas, which was actually a carryover from spending that was done in 2015. 
Our sales profile for next -- going into 2017 is shown on Slide 15. You can see both our copper production. Now this takes out Tenke and the incremental interest that we sold at Morenci to Sumitomo earlier in the year. But the gold carryover from lower volumes in 2016 into 2017 and into 2018. 
Page 16 shows 2017 EBITDA and cash flow. This excludes all the oil and gas business essentially with the Deepwater in California sales. It's excludes Tenke. It excludes the incremental interest at Morenci. And you can see EBITDA at $2, being just under $5 billion; $2.25, just under $6 billion; and $2.50, just under $7 billion. And operating cash flows of $2.6 billion, $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion within this range of copper prices. It excludes working capital changes. We expect a positive working capital impact in 2017. 
Capital spending. You can see just how our efforts we undertook to cut capital unfolding. I mentioned the $2.8 billion for 2016 falling to $1.7 billion in 2017. That's essentially the spending that we'll be doing, developing the underground in Grasberg as well as the constrained sustaining capital for the rest of our business. 
18 summarizes where we are with our debt structure. You can see, 9/30, we had $19 million of debt and $1.1 billion of cash. Pro forma for the asset sales transactions, but with no additional equity from the ATM offering, we would end the year with $3.3 billion in cash, and our maturities for 2017 are $1.3 billion. So we have ample cash to deal with our near-term liquidity and a good set of assets of dealing with our long-term balance sheet issues. 
So we talked in the beginning of the year about execution. And we are continually focused on that. As I mentioned, we're disappointed about the mining rate issues at Grasberg. But we're working on that every day. We're working on securing our long-term rights in Indonesia every day. We feel good about our plans for debt reduction, building long-term value, and safety in our business is the challenging part of it. We certainly had our challenges in the third quarter. But that is the first thing we talk about whenever we meet with our team, and that overrides everything that we do. 
So thank you for bearing with me on this overview, and I look forward to your questions."

And the implication seems to be that the problems over the third quarter that you saw are going to be hamper production in the fourth quarter, effectively push some of that back into next year. Can you clarify, are you more constrained in what you can produce over fourth quarter because of these lingering issues? Or does this move around out of any kind of conservatism? I'm just trying to understand how much of this shift is you responding to conditions at the mine. And how much, if any, is any market conditions, positioning as you negotiate with Indonesians, et cetera."

As we progress our mine plan at this stage, we get to higher grades as we go forward. So the fact that we were not able to mine the material that we plan to mine in the third quarter means it just simply going to take longer to get to the higher-grade material that we originally planned to mine in the fourth quarter. And that gets pushed out. We can't do more to get to it quicker because we're constrained by physical space. So our plan call for us to do everything that we could do all along. And when it gets pushed back, it gets pushed back over time physically. So it's not a -- it's really not a strategic or tactical decision, but it's a physical consequence of what we face. Now we know we got to be diligent about keeping our equipment operating and available and so forth, because delays in that can have an impact in the future. We were working hard to address these issues of concern by our workers. We've made some responsive steps to the issues they raised in terms of the bonus, in terms of the relationships between supervisors and the workers. And that's an ongoing process that we'll have to work with. It's a complicated labor situation there in Papua with the nature of the workforce and how it's changed over the years. All of this requires a lot of attention and a lot of work. What it doesn't change is that high-grade ore that is there. I mean, that remains there, and it's a question of getting to it as quickly as we can. We want to do it. Safety is the first issue. But we're not trying to do any of this in terms of positioning with the government of Indonesia. We won't operate in an efficient, straightforward way, but that's been our history and that's going to be our future. While we're doing this, I might add that our work in underground development is going extraordinary well. I mean, we're meeting our targets in terms of development and putting things in place. We're getting approvals from the government to do what we need to do. That's a big project. The discounting gets out of the spotlight here. But it's, in total over time, a $15 billion investment project, and we're spending roughly $1 billion a year. And that's the future for us and our partner, Rio Tinto, as we go forward. So as we're dealing with these important issues near term in a bit, we are also keeping great focus on the underground development, and it's going very well."

As soon as the pit is complete, then we start the process of initiating the Block Cave. And then that ramps up the process that takes place with capacity coming online as we develop more draw points, so it's on track. The Deep MLZ, we initiated the cave earlier this year.

There's also a process of where the President can issue executive orders called perfuse. So the government has alternatives of how to deal with this. It's going to be in my -- it's going to be a challenge to get a new mining law done by early January, considering what's happened to date. So we are just prepared to work with the government in whatever approach they decide to use. The challenge of not addressing our contract until 2019 is, one, we are simply unable to invest in the smelter without having our long-term contract assured. I mean, that's a huge investment, a significant investment, and we simply just can't do it without knowing that we will continue to operate beyond 2021.

So even if we had all the cash in the world, we wouldn't be pursuing these projects as we speak right now. Now the development of sales varies depending on ore body. Let's say, for example, El Abra, which has -- and we didn't know about this when we acquired Phelps Dodge, but a subsequent exploration has shown enormous sulfide resource there. And to date, that operations has been an SXEW operations: oxide, sulfide. So this would be a Cerro Verde type project with a very large mill required. You'd have a desalinization plant and the transport of water to more than 10,000 feet. So it's a big capital project. At Lone Star, we have an existing operation there at Stafford. And that would be done in stages of where we would have an oxide development, which would actually be stripping us down to a sulfide project which require a major mill investment. At Baghdad. We have a big sulfide resource to require mill expansion, sailings expansion and investment in water access. So everyone of these assets has its own story, and there's trade off, lots of advantages in U.S. today that weren't there historically in terms of energy costs, labor flexibility.

This is Mark Johnson, is that even though we've had some production delays, deferrals, a couple of things that we have accomplished is that the high walls of the mining are very robust. We implemented a very comprehensive final pit blasting, final wall blasting process, which is -- will provide us possibly some upside on keeping the pits towards what Richard had shown on one of the slides. That could provide some upside as to the amount of metal we can get from the pit. We're also putting to place a 50 watering system that essentially we're keeping the pit completely dewatered right now without pumping, and that's kind of unique within the mining industry, and it's going to provide some opportunities for us as we're in the pit bottom to have that [indiscernible] in the way that we have. It's going to provide some upside. So one of the other aspects that we're dealing with is that the workforce is aware of the upcoming transition of the workers from the open pit to the underground. I think it's created a little bit of apprehension within the workforce, but we're working closely with the workers and the Union to make sure that everybody understands that they're all going to have an opportunity elsewhere within our mining areas. We've got jobs opening up in the underground and some of the other logistics and levy construction, but that's one aspect, too, that we're dealing with. We've got about 1,600 people in the pit. We'll need about 600 beyond the finishing of the pit mining for reclamation effort for a number of years. So we're working very closely with the workers to explain what their future looks like within PT-FI, but it's another aspect of some of the issues that we've had over the last couple of quarters."

And what we look at a lot is our sinking rate, how many pushbacks we mine in a year. I'd say we've historically been very aggressive on that. We've had pushbacks when we do over 18 benches a year. We base a lot of our mine plans based on that ability which takes into account the limited mining space. And we're looking at somewhere to 15 to 16 as we complete the pit, 15 to 16 benches a year. So it's something that we've been able to do before that accounts for space and equipment sequencing. We feel comfortable we did make some adjustments to our mining rates in the fourth quarter. Our previous forecast had slightly higher mining rates. We're currently projecting that for the remainder of the quarter that we're going to do in the order of 180,000 tons a day. We feel comfortable with that plan. We have some things that we'll manage on a day-to-day basis. We're working closely with our supervisors and in communication plans with the workers. So it's -- there's multi-elements of how we are approaching the productivity issues in the pit. We've also brought some resources from Red's team over there. We've got a group of guys there now that are helping us, just looked at sequencing and making sure that the pit blasting is going on as scheduled. So we're throwing a lot of resources at it. We understand the importance of it. We are, like I said, focused on the quality of mining. We want to ensure that everything we're doing doesn't limit our ability to complete the pit in a safe and efficient manner. We are one of the deepest pits in the world with very steep high walls. We've been able to manage that very well, and we'll continue to focus on that also."

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release and the slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.
Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. 
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we also have several members of our senior operating team in the room, including Red Congers, Mark Johnson and Mike Kendrick. 
I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after the prepared remarks, we'll turn the call over for questions and answers.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $217 million or $0.16 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Our results for the quarter included net gains totaling $39 million or $0.03 per share, which reflected nonrecurring tax credits, partly offset by the impairment of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for this net gain, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $178 million or $0.13 per share. 
Our EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the third quarter totaled $1.35 billion. Our consolidated sales, including the volumes from Tenke Fungurume, which is being reported as a discontinued operations following our agreement to sell our interest, totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper in the quarter, 317,000 ounces of gold, 16 million pounds of molybdenum and 12 million barrels of oil equivalents. Our copper and gold sales were lower than our July estimates, principally reflecting lower mining rates at the Grasberg mine, which affected the timing of access to higher-grade ore, which we expect to recover in future periods. 
Our average copper price during the quarter was $2.18 per pound. That was below the year-ago average of $2.38. Gold prices averaged $1,327 per ounce during the quarter, which was above last year's third quarter of $1,117 per ounce. Our average net unit cash costs, net of by-product credits, totaled $1.14 per pound of copper in the third quarter. We continued our trend of reducing cash costs. They were $1.52 per pound in the third quarter of 2015. 
Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $980 million. Those cash flows exceeded capital expenditures of $494 million during the quarter. As we previously reported, we commenced a registered offering, at-the-market equity offering, of up to $1.5 billion of common stock during the third quarter. And during the quarter, we sold 33.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $415 million, which averaged $12.39 per share.
We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of $19 billion, and our cash grew to $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. We had no borrowings under our revolving $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and as you'll see in the slides, we have very little in the way of near-term maturities.
We had 1.36 billion common shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. As you'll see in our release and as Richard will be discussing more in depth in his presentation, we have significant asset sale transactions that we expect to complete during the fourth quarter, a total of $5.2 billion, which includes the previously announced transaction for our Tenke Fungurume stake as well as assets -- oil and gas assets, including the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our onshore California properties. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to materials -- slide presentation materials on our website."
273607,403656762,1060555,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Freeport-McMoRan Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sunrise here in Phoenix, and that's a good way to start our call off. We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago when our b",4252,"Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sunrise here in Phoenix, and that's a good way to start our call off. 
We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago when our board acted to restructure our board and return our focus to our global leading copper business. And during 2016, we have made some significant accomplishments and we've positioned our company for the future with these significant copper resources and with an improved balance sheet. 
But before I really talk about that, I want to address right at the outset the reason why our copper production volumes in the -- this quarter fell short of the estimates. As you know, we are mining in the last phase of the Grasberg open pit. In some way it's hard to believe, but we started developing it in 1990. And here we are at the very end of the pit. It is, at this point, physically, a very confined area right at the bottom of the pit. The ore body extends lower, but we’re going to mine that as an underground operation. But we have current mining in an area that's constricted, but it has extraordinarily high grades of copper and gold. And these grades are increasing as we mine. 
During the quarter, our planned mining rate, the actual physical material we moved, that was about 15% short of what we had planned. And as a result of that, we simply did not access as much of this high grade ore as we expected and what our plans projected. We'll talk more about this later, and we're certainly disappointed with this mining rate. A lot of it has to do with some worker issues that we're addressing, and we believe we can manage as we go forward. But we have the equipment, the mine designs, the people and the ore grades to allow us to mine this material. And so what we're faced now is the fact that we didn't get to it this quarter, it means that it's a timing issue. We will get to it as we go forward. We'll make up a lot of it in 2017. It'll have an impact in the fourth quarter, and we should finish mining it early in 2018. So this is not a valuation issue or a really significant economic issue, but more of a timing issue. 
Now looking back, the fourth quarter of 2015 was a very difficult time. But as we went into 2016, the first half of the quarter was really, really tough as you'll remember. We set out on a path to cut our debt. In response to one of your questions in our year-end earnings call, we -- you pressed me to say what was our target for debt reduction, and I said $5 billion to $10 billion. At that point, to be really candid with you, the market was tough that we didn't -- I really didn't have a clear-cut view of how we were going to do it, but we were committed to do it. But we set on this path, now we believe we have clear sight to reducing our debt by $10 billion. And we executed this plan in a way, after looking on a lot of alternatives, that will enable us to retain a core set of assets that we’ll build a great company around. It's characterized by long lives, good cost positions, long-term growth options when markets indicate that future investments will be needed and it will be, and a balance of geographic diversity. 
And so we're really pleased here that we are -- we have a clear path now for achieving these objectives. As an organization, we were already on a solid path to cut our costs and our capital spending. And our global team has really stepped up to this challenge. We delivered completion of the Cerro Verde project on time and on budget. It was a very big, complicated project. And we've moved quickly to adjust our operating plans and our capital spending at each one of our operations to respond to the situation. And our team has had a long history with this. The organization has operated low-grade mines in the U.S. for over 100 years. And this has made the team that Red leads and Mark Johnson leads really good operators in dealing with this kind of environment. 
We operate all of our mines, and so we can benchmark our operations and share best practices and people and resources around the company and across the portfolio. Our net unit cost average, $1.14 per pound during the quarter, and this is 25% below last year's third quarter. And before by-product credits, costs were down 20% over the year. And at each one of our sites, we have really focused on cash flow generation, and we look at our performance net of sustaining capital cost. And we've been very tough on capital at this point. And despite these low prices, our team is very enthusiastic and focused and energized to maximize cash flows. 
During 2015, our CapEx exceeded our cash flows. That was primarily because of the oil and gas business. We worked hard to reverse this and generated $500 million in cash flows above CapEx in the third quarter. And we expect to be able -- we expect and are confident that we can continue to generate free cash flow over the next several quarters even at low prices because we're going to constrain capital spending until the market warrants new investments. And that will contribute to our debt reduction -- achieve our debt reduction targets. 
Year-to-date, we have announced $6.6 billion in anticipated proceeds from asset sales transactions. This does not include potential additional consideration of $680 million. We've, to date, received proceeds of $1.4 billion and expect to receive $5.2 billion by year-end from transactions that are under contract which we expect to close. So these steps will enable us to achieve our deleveraging objective of cutting our debt in half by the end of 2017 but keeping a really strong set of assets that, over the long run, will enable our shareholders to benefit as the market recovers. 
Slide 4 is a summary of our recent announcements of our oil and gas transactions. You recall that at the end of 2015, we announced a process to evaluate options for this business. Our board engaged special financial advisers and we went into the marketplace to see in the first quarter if we could find a buyer for the whole business. Now that was a really tough time to try to find someone to buy a set of assets like we had in the oil and gas business. It couldn’t have been worse. And by the end of the quarter, the first quarter of this year, we had concluded that we would likely retain these assets for a longer period of time. And that we'll hold onto them and wait for a market recovery. 
At that point, we reorganized our management of our oil and gas business. We changed it from being a stand-alone, separate business to being a division of our company. We put together from the existing group a really effective operating management team. And so that was the plan going into it. After the first quarter, and after we had announced what we were going to do, parties emerged with renewed interests who are talking to us about buying sets of those assets. And so we continued our process of discussions. I can assure you that we talk -- we gave everyone in the marketplace the opportunity to come in and talk with us. People knew it. Bankers were out knocking on doors. And so we really had a process that exposed these assets to the marketplace. And at the end of the day, we had a competitive process. And we reached a transaction in September to sell our production in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico to Anadarko. And then in October, we've now announced the transaction to sell our production onshore in California. 
In the aggregate, we will receive $2.6 billion in gross proceeds and $300 million in contingent consideration. And I will assure you, we thought long and hard and had active discussions with our board about selling these assets during this period of weak oil prices and taking into account the current outlook for oil prices. And -- but the nature of this oil and gas business is such that because of depletion, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, it would require, over time, continued reinvestment to maintain the assets. If you didn't do that, they simply go away. And then you have very significant reclamation obligations. And the government's rules for providing financial assurance for those reclamation obligations are changing and requirements are likely to be more significant. And so we took all that into account and concluded that these transactions were consistent with our strategy and will allow us to focus on what our future is going to be. 
Now you know I can tell you, I've read analysts who assigned a much higher value to these assets than what we sold them to, a theoretical value. Buyers weren't willing to pay that after a very extensive process that we went through. I’m convinced we got very attractive prices for us. The purchasers will likely do well with these assets because they're good assets. But for our company, considering the total implications financially of continuing to be in that business and hold them, I'm very comfortable with what we did and really pleased that we were able -- we were really able to get that done. 
So that is summarized on Page 4. And we'd be happy to answer any questions about it. Now we continue looking at Page 5 to progress. The sale of our Tenke asset. You all heard me say, this is an asset that we sold with great reluctance. It's a great long-term asset, and it fit very well in our portfolio. And I'm very proud of our team when we started out in 2008 in developing it in a very challenging environment and going through the financial crisis and working on all the issues of doing business there. It's been a real pleasure to do business in the DRC and work with the people there and do whatever our team has done. But it's also an asset that value is going to be realized over very long periods of time. And we were able to find a buyer at a valuation that's attractive in relation to near-term cash flows. And China Molybdenum, privately owned Chinese companies that's making global investments in the mining industry, is progressing their transaction. The process has gone smoothly. It is a public company, not a state-owned company. And they have gotten their shareholder approval and other regulatory approvals within China that was necessary to go forward with the transaction. 
And where we are today, there's still a condition remaining to close is resolving a transfer right that our minority partner, Lundin Mining, has in the property, and the contract is called a right of first offer, or ROFO. And we've been working with China Moly and Lundin to resolve this. We’ve currently extended the time frame for resolving it to November 15. You've also read that Gecamines, the state-owned mining company in the DRC, has asserted that it has preemptive rights to this transaction. The transaction itself involves entities outside of the DRC at a different corporate level. We disagree with Gecamines’ assertion on this, and our legal advisors support our conclusion. But we are working with China Molybdenum, with Lundin, with Gecamines and with the government so that we can all find a way forward to work together to resolve this issue. China Molybdenum has strongly expressed their commitment to closing this transaction as soon as possible, and we're working together to find the appropriate resolution for the Lundin ROFO. We still expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
It's $2.6 billion in proceeds and $120 million in contingent consideration. And we're also giving them exclusive right to acquire an exploration property we have in the DRC in a downstream cobalt business. So all of that is working to get closed in the fourth quarter. 
So putting this all together, on Slide 6, you can see the aggregate steps that we have taken. If we look at the completion of these asset sales transactions, completion of the previously announced $1.5 billion at-the-market offering, which, to date, we've completed about 25% of that $1.5 billion amount, execution of our operating plans, we expect to achieve our debt targets by the end of 2017. And we're well on our way of doing this. 
We have the portfolio of remaining assets that we want to keep. We're not planning additional divestments. We may take some steps to deal with the remaining assets in our oil and gas business. And we are prepared to divest at Grasberg an additional roughly 20% interest pursuant to our discussions with the Indonesian government that is contingent on, conditional on getting our long-term rights extended on the basis of giving us fiscal and legal surety. But we have -- we're committed to the government, selling additional 20% interest that's not in these numbers. So at the end of the day, we will have a reasonable balance sheet, an industry-leading portfolio of copper assets that would be available for a long-term development. And these are the sort of assets in the copper business that at best are very, very difficult to replicate, if at all possible. 
So looking at those assets, on Page 7 is an overview. We have -- we will have 7 copper mines, which will be led by Morenci -- 7 copper mines in North America, which will be led by our flagship Morenci mine, which is a fabulous operations. These mines are very long-lived. It gives us long-term optionality on copper prices and future investment opportunities. We will have 2 mines in South America: the Cerro Verde mine, which today has the largest processing facilities globally and is operating very well, and the El Abra mine in Chile, which has a very significant long-term growth opportunities for us, as well as Grasberg. We've managed these assets successfully over a long period of time in different price environments. And within these mines, we have significant growth opportunities that we'd be prepared to pursue when time is right. 
And we showed this on Page 8. And this is our copper sulfide development opportunities. In alphabetical listing, not a priority listing. We're still assessing from a priority standpoint which ones we would attack first. And even though we're not spending capital on these projects, we are spending efforts to develop plans for future investments. And they are sulfide opportunities that we have identified through our exploration drilling and exploration analysis, very large ore bodies where we can take advantage of existing infrastructure to add on to processing facilities that will allow us to develop these in a profitable way. 
Now copper market commentary. Copper price in today's levels is still very low. It reflects the global economy and the slowdown in China. But stepping back, the surpluses that were previously predicted are lower than what was expected. We've had recent supply growth, and there are still a couple of projects being completed. We were a big part of that. We had 3 big projects that we started in the 2010 time frame that have been completed now. And with the current projects being finished, the recent supply growth is not sustainable. These long periods of low prices will impact future supplies, with McKinsey showing a 4 million ton decline from existing mines in the next coming years, about 2025. The top 10 mines in the world today produced less than 5.5 million tons of copper a year, and when McKinsey feels the incentive price to develop new mines supplies on the order of $3.30. 
The inventory has risen during the quarter. There are reasons for that. The levels still remain relatively low by historical standards, and when you look at the total marketplace, relatively, or just say, absolutely small increases in demand or supply disruptions that well move the market to deficit in a short period of time. 
Page 10 is a slide I don't think we've used recently, but we've used over the years which shows the 10 largest mines in the world in terms of reserves and copper production. We have 3 of those mines at Grasberg, Cerro Verde and Morenci. You can see what I referred to earlier, these top 10 mines in 2016 are -- will be producing less than 5.5 million tons a year, so to replace 4 million tons in the future in terms of what you're looking at is really a significant challenge for the industry. 
Other than Oyu Tolgoi and Los Pelambres, Grasberg is the most recent discovery, in 1988. Many of these mines were discovered back in the 1800s. And here, or at Grasberg, completing mining of the open pit this year. So the point is mining world-class mines is extremely rare, and now we're in a period of time where -- and this is where we've gone through, over the last 15 years, extensive exploration when prices were high and companies were investing. So even with all this investment, finding big new mines is really tough. And having this -- these kinds of mines in our portfolio is going to prove very valuable, I’m convinced, over time, because there's not any -- we haven't had any big technology revolution in the copper mining business. We've made progress with technology and so forth. But copper, as a commodity, is very tough to replace. We haven't seen any shale oil-type developments in our business. In fact, we're seeing SXEW opportunities dry up, new opportunities are low grade, sulfide opportunities which require lots of infrastructure and development and mining a lot of material to get a copper like we're getting at Cerro Verde. 
Now what are we going to be doing in the meantime before we start reinvesting again? We're going to look for every opportunity we can to continue to reduce cost and increase production. One of these things and our challenge now, you're seeing our data, we will have a falloff in production at Grasberg in 2018 as we make the transition from the pit to the underground at the Grasberg Block Cave. And so we challenge ourselves to mitigate these production declines while we spend a minimal amount of capital. In the meantime, one of the things we're looking at is pit wall designs to optimize our slopes to steepen pit angles to minimize stripping and add ore. And this can reduce costs as we add ore. And we're having a strict adherence in doing this in a safe way. But this is just one example of what we're doing to see if we can find ways of maximizing production safely at a time when we're going to be making this transition, and we'll be reporting to you on this as we go forward.
I mentioned -- Page 12 talks about Grasberg. We had to deal with labor grievances. It had to deal with some bonus issues and some issues about management, supervisory relationships with the workforce. We had a 10-day work stoppage in late September, but this had caused us issues relating to worker productivity for a longer period of time and was the principle reason why we had a shortfall in our mining rate. As I've talked about earlier, this is a timing issue. The ore remains there. We're not seeing any questions about the grades in the ore or its availability. And so we've developed new plans, which we shared with you for how we will make up for this ore that we had failed to melt -- to mine in the third quarter. And this carries over because grades are increasing and so forth as we delay this, it will -- it has an impact on the fourth quarter.  But -- and it'll extend by some period of time how long we’ll be in the pit. It now goes into 2018. But we will mine this ore, and the economic impact will not be significant. 
We continue to have discussions with the government. There are 2 really key issues. One is an existing regulation in Indonesia that prohibits exports of ores. And the government has defined copper concentrate as an ore, even though it's a commercial project -- product, which captures more than 90% of the value copper metal. But under their regulations, they call it an ore, existing regulations prohibit the export of ores beyond January 2017. There's a recognition in the government that this needs to be addressed, and I believe it will be. And we're working actively with the Ministry of Energy and Mines and other government officials on this issue. And then beyond that, the key issue for us is having the extension of our operating rights beyond the primary term of our existing contracts, which extends to 2021. Under the terms of that contract, we're entitled to 2 10-year extensions on the same terms as it is on the contract. And the government has agreed that it will not unreasonably delay or withhold approving that extension, but it hasn't been approved yet. So those are the 2 things that we're working with. There's been a lot of political changes in Indonesia that have affected this. But we have a -- we're committed to having a good working relationship with the new minister, the new vice minister and the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and with the President and other government officials. And so we are working amicably to address these issues. It's important for Indonesia as well as for us, and particularly important for the province of Papua. 
Page 13 shows our adjusted mining plan. We see the schematic of the pit in the underground Grasberg Block Cave. The existing underground production coming from the DOZ and the DMLZ mine. So we are -- we will adjust this every quarter, and you can see what our new outlook for copper and gold production is coming out of Grasberg. We have, in the appendix, longer-term projections, so you can see that. 
Our outlook for 2016 now is for 4.8 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.26 million ounces of gold, 73 million pounds of molybdenum. For the year, site cost, net of by-product credits of $1.20. Operating cash flows at $2.10 copper in the fourth quarter will be $3.6 billion. Each $0.10 change in the fourth quarter have a delta of $150 million. And our CapEx for the year of $2.8 billion, including over $1 billion for oil and gas, which was actually a carryover from spending that was done in 2015. 
Our sales profile for next -- going into 2017 is shown on Slide 15. You can see both our copper production. Now this takes out Tenke and the incremental interest that we sold at Morenci to Sumitomo earlier in the year. But the gold carryover from lower volumes in 2016 into 2017 and into 2018. 
Page 16 shows 2017 EBITDA and cash flow. This excludes all the oil and gas business essentially with the Deepwater and California sales. It's excludes Tenke. It excludes the incremental interest at Morenci. And you can see EBITDA at $2, being just under $5 billion; $2.25, just under $6 billion; and $2.50, just under $7 billion. And operating cash flows of $2.6 billion, $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion within this range of copper prices. It excludes working capital changes. We expect a positive working capital impact in 2017. 
Capital spending. You can see just how our efforts we undertook to cut capital is unfolding. I mentioned the $2.8 billion for 2016 falling to $1.7 billion in 2017. That's essentially the spending that we'll be doing developing the underground in Grasberg as well as the constrained sustaining capital for the rest of our business. 
18 summarizes where we are with our debt structure. You can see, 9/30, we had $19 billion of debt and $1.1 billion of cash. Pro forma for the asset sales transactions, but with no additional equity from the ATM offering, we would end the year with $3.3 billion in cash, and our maturities for 2017 are $1.3 billion. So we have ample cash to deal with our near-term liquidity and a good set of assets of dealing with our long-term balance sheet issues. 
So we talked in the beginning of the year about execution. And we are continually focused on that. As I mentioned, we're disappointed about the mining rate issues at Grasberg but are working on that every day. We're working on securing our long-term rights in Indonesia every day. We feel good about our plans for debt reduction, building long-term value, and safety in our business is a challenging part of it. We certainly had our challenges in the third quarter. But that is the first thing we talk about whenever we meet with our team, and that overrides everything that we do. 
So thank you for bearing with me on this overview, and I look forward to your questions."

You had the labor stoppage. And the implication seems to be that the problems over the third quarter that you saw are going to be hamper production in the fourth quarter, effectively push some of that back into next year. Can you clarify, are you more constrained in what you can produce over fourth quarter because of these lingering issues? Or does this move around out of any kind of conservatism? I'm just trying to understand how much of this shift is you responding to conditions at the mine and how much, if any, is any market conditions, positioning as you negotiate with Indonesians, et cetera."

As we progress our mine plan at this stage, we get to higher grades as we go forward. So the fact that we were not able to mine the material that we had planned to mine in the third quarter means it just simply going to take longer to get to the higher-grade material that we originally planned to mine in the fourth quarter. And that gets pushed out. We can't do more to get to it quicker because we're constrained by physical space. So our plan call for us to do everything that we could do all along. And when it gets pushed back, it gets pushed back over time physically. So it's not a -- it's really not a strategic or tactical decision, but it's a physical consequence of what we face. Now we know we’ve got to be diligent about keeping our equipment operating and available and so forth, because delays in that can have an impact in the future. We were working hard to address these issues of concern by our workers. We've made some responsive steps to the issues they raised in terms of the bonus, in terms of the relationships between supervisors and the workers. And that's an ongoing process that we'll have to work with. It's a complicated labor situation there in Papua with the nature of the workforce and how it's changed over the years. All of this requires a lot of attention and a lot of work. What it doesn't change is that high-grade ore that is there. I mean, that remains there, and it's a question of getting to it as quickly as we can. We want to do it. Safety is the first issue. But we're not trying to do any of this in terms of positioning with the government of Indonesia. We want operate in an efficient, straightforward way. That's been our history and that's going to be our future. While we're doing this, I might add that our work in underground development is going extraordinary well. I mean, we're meeting our targets in terms of development and putting things in place. We're getting approvals from the government to do what we need to do. That's a big project that just kind of gets out of the spotlight here. But it's, in total over time, a $15 billion investment project, and we're spending roughly $1 billion a year. And that's the future for us and our partner, Rio Tinto, as we go forward. So as we're dealing with these important issues near term in the pit, we are also keeping great focus on the underground development, and it's going very well."

The present law in 2009 took several years and was very complicated to get negotiated. The government can deal with these issues also through changing regulations. The existing mining law has the flexibility of extending our contract, of allowing exports and so forth without changing the law but changing regulations, which is in the authority of the administration. There's also a process of where the President can issue executive orders called perfuse. So the government has alternatives of how to deal with this. It's going to be in my -- it's going to be a challenge to get a new mining law done by early January, considering what's happened to date. So we are just prepared to work with the government in whatever approach they decide to use. The challenge of not addressing our contract until 2019 is, one, we are simply unable to invest in the smelter without having our long-term contract assured. I mean, that's a huge investment, a significant investment, and we simply just can't do it without knowing that we will continue to operate beyond 2021. We've also agreed to divest an additional 20%, which is a significant amount of value. And clearly, we could not invest with having uncertainty about our position to operate beyond 2021. So offsetting this -- and that's a regulation, that's not in the law, this 2-year deal -- is these things that -- resolution -- there'll be pressures to have a resolution with that before 2019."

So even if we had all the cash in the world, we wouldn't be pursuing these projects as we speak right now. Now the development of sales varies depending on the ore body. Let's say, for example, El Abra, which has -- and we didn't know about this when we acquired Phelps Dodge, but a subsequent exploration has shown an enormous sulfide resource there. And to date, that operations has been an SXEW operations: oxide, sulfide. So this would be a Cerro Verde type project with a very large mill required. You'd have a desalinization plant and the transport of water to more than 10,000 feet. So it's a big capital project. At Lone Star, we have an existing operation there at Safford. And that would be done in stages of where we would have an oxide development, which would actually be stripping us down to a sulfide project which would require a major mill investment. At Baghdad, we have a big sulfide resource to require mill expansion, tailings expansion and investment in water access. So every one of these assets has its own story, and there's tradeoffs, lots of advantages in U.S. today that weren't there historically in terms of energy costs, labor flexibility.

Then we were faced with these issues related principally to the workers, and that had the consequence that it had. So we took it into account. Yes, we said we were 15% short of our mine rate. So that's what it was, and it had a consequence of changing our production profile. Do we have risk going forward? Yes. I mean, we -- going forward, we will need to operate our equipment well. We've had a long history of doing that. We will have to deal with our workforce. We’ve been doing our utmost to do that. But yes, I mean, that's always one of the risks of our business. We have a great history of meeting those risks, but it's particularly significant in terms of near-term cash flows because of the grades and physical situation of the Grasberg pit. But yes, it's a risk."

So -- but we're very confident that, while we could have blips in the volumes, we're very confident that over this period of time, relatively short period of time, we'll be able to access very significant volumes of both copper and gold. So it's not a question of day-by-day predictions or forecast.

This is Mark Johnson, is that even though we've had some production delays, deferrals, a couple of things that we have accomplished is that the high walls of the mining are very robust. We implemented a very comprehensive final pit blasting, final wall blasting process, which is -- will provide us possibly some upside on keeping the pits similar to what Richard had shown on one of the slides. That could provide some upside as to the amount of metal we can get from the pit. We've also put into place a pit dewatering system that essentially we're keeping the pit completely dewatered right now without pumping, and that's kind of unique within the mining industry, and it's going to provide some opportunities for us as we're in the pit bottom to have that water managed in the way that we have is going to provide some upside. So one of the other aspects that we're dealing with is that the workforce is aware of the upcoming transition of the workers from the open pit to the underground. I think it's created a little bit of apprehension within the workforce that we're working closely with the workers and the Union to make sure that everybody understands that they're all going to have an opportunity elsewhere within our mining areas. We've got jobs opening up in the underground and some of the other logistics and levee construction, but that's one aspect, too, that we're dealing with. We've got about 1,600 people in the pit. We'll need about 600 beyond the finishing of the pit mining for reclamation effort for a number of years. So we're working very closely with the workers to explain what their future looks like within PT-FI, but it's another aspect of some of the issues that we've had over the last couple of quarters."

And what we look at a lot is our sinking rate, how many pushbacks we mine in a year. I'd say we've historically been very aggressive on that. We've had pushbacks where we do over 18 benches a year. We base a lot of our mine plans based on that ability which takes into account the limited mining space. And we're looking at somewhere to 15 to 16 as we complete the pit, 15 to 16 benches a year. So it's something that we've been able to do before that accounts for space and equipment sequencing. We feel comfortable we did make some adjustments to our mining rates in the fourth quarter. Our previous forecast had slightly higher mining rates. We're currently projecting that for the remainder of the quarter that we're going to do in the order of 180,000 tons a day. We feel comfortable with that plan. We have some things that we'll manage on a day-to-day basis. We're working closely with our supervisors and in communication plans with the workers. So it's -- there's multi-elements of how we are approaching the productivity issues in the pit. We've also brought some resources from Red's team over there. We've got a group of guys there now that are helping us, just looked at sequencing and making sure that the pit blasting is going on as scheduled. So we're throwing a lot of resources at it. We understand the importance of it. We are, like I said, focused on the quality of mining. We want to ensure that everything we're doing doesn't limit our ability to complete the pit in a safe and efficient manner. We are one of the deepest pits in the world. Very steep, high walls.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release and the slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.
Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. 
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. 
On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we also have several members of our senior operating team in the room, including Red Congers, Mark Johnson and Mike Kendrick. 
I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after the prepared remarks, we'll turn the call over for questions and answers.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $217 million or $0.16 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Our results for the quarter included net gains totaling $39 million or $0.03 per share, which reflected nonrecurring tax credits, partly offset by the impairment of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for this net gain, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $178 million or $0.13 per share. 
Our EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the third quarter totaled $1.35 billion. Our consolidated sales, including the volumes from Tenke Fungurume, which is being reported as a discontinued operations following our agreement to sell our interest, totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper in the quarter, 317,000 ounces of gold, 16 million pounds of molybdenum and 12 million barrels of oil equivalents. Our copper and gold sales were lower than our July estimates, principally reflecting lower mining rates at the Grasberg mine, which affected the timing of access to higher-grade ore, which we expect to recover in future periods. 
Our average copper price during the quarter was $2.18 per pound. That was below the year-ago average of $2.38. Gold prices averaged $1,327 per ounce during the quarter, which was above last year's third quarter of $1,117 per ounce. Our average net unit cash costs, net of by-product credits, totaled $1.14 per pound of copper in the third quarter. We continued our trend of reducing cash costs. They were $1.52 per pound in the third quarter of 2015. 
Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $980 million. Those cash flows exceeded capital expenditures of $494 million during the quarter. As we previously reported, we commenced a registered offering, at-the-market equity offering, of up to $1.5 billion of common stock during the third quarter. And during the quarter, we sold 33.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $415 million, which averaged $12.39 per share.
We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of $19 billion, and our cash grew to $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. We had no borrowings under our revolving $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and as you'll see in the slides, we have very little in the way of near-term maturities.
We had 1.36 billion common shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. As you'll see in our release and as Richard will be discussing more in depth in his presentation, we have significant asset sale transactions that we expect to complete during the fourth quarter, a total of $5.2 billion, which includes the previously announced transaction for our Tenke Fungurume stake as well as assets -- oil and gas assets, including the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our onshore California properties. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to materials -- slide presentation materials on our website."
273607,403656762,1060809,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Freeport-McMoRan Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sunrise here in Phoenix, and that's a good way to start our call off. We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago when our b",4252,"Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sunrise here in Phoenix, and that's a good way to start our call off. 
We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago when our board acted to restructure our board and return our focus to our global leading copper business. And during 2016, we have made some significant accomplishments and we've positioned our company for the future with these significant copper resources and with an improved balance sheet. 
But before I really talk about that, I want to address right at the outset the reason why our copper production volumes in the -- this quarter fell short of the estimates. As you know, we are mining in the last phase of the Grasberg open pit. In some way it's hard to believe, but we started developing it in 1990. And here we are at the very end of the pit. It is, at this point, physically, a very confined area right at the bottom of the pit. The ore body extends lower, but we’re going to mine that as an underground operation. But we have current mining in an area that's constricted, but it has extraordinarily high grades of copper and gold. And these grades are increasing as we mine. 
During the quarter, our planned mining rate, the actual physical material we moved, that was about 15% short of what we had planned. And as a result of that, we simply did not access as much of this high grade ore as we expected and what our plans projected. We'll talk more about this later, and we're certainly disappointed with this mining rate. A lot of it has to do with some worker issues that we're addressing, and we believe we can manage as we go forward. But we have the equipment, the mine designs, the people and the ore grades to allow us to mine this material. And so what we're faced now is the fact that we didn't get to it this quarter, it means that it's a timing issue. We will get to it as we go forward. We'll make up a lot of it in 2017. It'll have an impact in the fourth quarter, and we should finish mining it early in 2018. So this is not a valuation issue or a really significant economic issue, but more of a timing issue. 
Now looking back, the fourth quarter of 2015 was a very difficult time. But as we went into 2016, the first half of the quarter was really, really tough as you'll remember. We set out on a path to cut our debt. In response to one of your questions in our year-end earnings call, we -- you pressed me to say what was our target for debt reduction, and I said $5 billion to $10 billion. At that point, to be really candid with you, the market was tough that we didn't -- I really didn't have a clear-cut view of how we were going to do it, but we were committed to do it. But we set on this path, now we believe we have clear sight to reducing our debt by $10 billion. And we executed this plan in a way, after looking on a lot of alternatives, that will enable us to retain a core set of assets that we’ll build a great company around. It's characterized by long lives, good cost positions, long-term growth options when markets indicate that future investments will be needed and it will be, and a balance of geographic diversity. 
And so we're really pleased here that we are -- we have a clear path now for achieving these objectives. As an organization, we were already on a solid path to cut our costs and our capital spending. And our global team has really stepped up to this challenge. We delivered completion of the Cerro Verde project on time and on budget. It was a very big, complicated project. And we've moved quickly to adjust our operating plans and our capital spending at each one of our operations to respond to the situation. And our team has had a long history with this. The organization has operated low-grade mines in the U.S. for over 100 years. And this has made the team that Red leads and Mark Johnson leads really good operators in dealing with this kind of environment. 
We operate all of our mines, and so we can benchmark our operations and share best practices and people and resources around the company and across the portfolio. Our net unit cost average, $1.14 per pound during the quarter, and this is 25% below last year's third quarter. And before by-product credits, costs were down 20% over the year. And at each one of our sites, we have really focused on cash flow generation, and we look at our performance net of sustaining capital cost. And we've been very tough on capital at this point. And despite these low prices, our team is very enthusiastic and focused and energized to maximize cash flows. 
During 2015, our CapEx exceeded our cash flows. That was primarily because of the oil and gas business. We worked hard to reverse this and generated $500 million in cash flows above CapEx in the third quarter. And we expect to be able -- we expect and are confident that we can continue to generate free cash flow over the next several quarters even at low prices because we're going to constrain capital spending until the market warrants new investments. And that will contribute to our debt reduction -- achieve our debt reduction targets. 
Year-to-date, we have announced $6.6 billion in anticipated proceeds from asset sales transactions. This does not include potential additional consideration of $680 million. We've, to date, received proceeds of $1.4 billion and expect to receive $5.2 billion by year-end from transactions that are under contract which we expect to close. So these steps will enable us to achieve our deleveraging objective of cutting our debt in half by the end of 2017 but keeping a really strong set of assets that, over the long run, will enable our shareholders to benefit as the market recovers. 
Slide 4 is a summary of our recent announcements of our oil and gas transactions. You recall that at the end of 2015, we announced a process to evaluate options for this business. Our board engaged special financial advisers and we went into the marketplace to see in the first quarter if we could find a buyer for the whole business. Now that was a really tough time to try to find someone to buy a set of assets like we had in the oil and gas business. It couldn’t have been worse. And by the end of the quarter, the first quarter of this year, we had concluded that we would likely retain these assets for a longer period of time. And that we'll hold onto them and wait for a market recovery. 
At that point, we reorganized our management of our oil and gas business. We changed it from being a stand-alone, separate business to being a division of our company. We put together from the existing group a really effective operating management team. And so that was the plan going into it. After the first quarter, and after we had announced what we were going to do, parties emerged with renewed interests who are talking to us about buying sets of those assets. And so we continued our process of discussions. I can assure you that we talk -- we gave everyone in the marketplace the opportunity to come in and talk with us. People knew it. Bankers were out knocking on doors. And so we really had a process that exposed these assets to the marketplace. And at the end of the day, we had a competitive process. And we reached a transaction in September to sell our production in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico to Anadarko. And then in October, we've now announced the transaction to sell our production onshore in California. 
In the aggregate, we will receive $2.6 billion in gross proceeds and $300 million in contingent consideration. And I will assure you, we thought long and hard and had active discussions with our board about selling these assets during this period of weak oil prices and taking into account the current outlook for oil prices. And -- but the nature of this oil and gas business is such that because of depletion, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, it would require, over time, continued reinvestment to maintain the assets. If you didn't do that, they simply go away. And then you have very significant reclamation obligations. And the government's rules for providing financial assurance for those reclamation obligations are changing and requirements are likely to be more significant. And so we took all that into account and concluded that these transactions were consistent with our strategy and will allow us to focus on what our future is going to be. 
Now you know I can tell you, I've read analysts who assigned a much higher value to these assets than what we sold them to, a theoretical value. Buyers weren't willing to pay that after a very extensive process that we went through. I’m convinced we got very attractive prices for us. The purchasers will likely do well with these assets because they're good assets. But for our company, considering the total implications financially of continuing to be in that business and hold them, I'm very comfortable with what we did and really pleased that we were able -- we were really able to get that done. 
So that is summarized on Page 4. And we'd be happy to answer any questions about it. Now we continue looking at Page 5 to progress. The sale of our Tenke asset. You all heard me say, this is an asset that we sold with great reluctance. It's a great long-term asset, and it fit very well in our portfolio. And I'm very proud of our team when we started out in 2008 in developing it in a very challenging environment and going through the financial crisis and working on all the issues of doing business there. It's been a real pleasure to do business in the DRC and work with the people there and do whatever our team has done. But it's also an asset that value is going to be realized over very long periods of time. And we were able to find a buyer at a valuation that's attractive in relation to near-term cash flows. And China Molybdenum, privately owned Chinese companies that's making global investments in the mining industry, is progressing their transaction. The process has gone smoothly. It is a public company, not a state-owned company. And they have gotten their shareholder approval and other regulatory approvals within China that was necessary to go forward with the transaction. 
And where we are today, there's still a condition remaining to close is resolving a transfer right that our minority partner, Lundin Mining, has in the property, and the contract is called a right of first offer, or ROFO. And we've been working with China Moly and Lundin to resolve this. We’ve currently extended the time frame for resolving it to November 15. You've also read that Gecamines, the state-owned mining company in the DRC, has asserted that it has preemptive rights to this transaction. The transaction itself involves entities outside of the DRC at a different corporate level. We disagree with Gecamines’ assertion on this, and our legal advisors support our conclusion. But we are working with China Molybdenum, with Lundin, with Gecamines and with the government so that we can all find a way forward to work together to resolve this issue. China Molybdenum has strongly expressed their commitment to closing this transaction as soon as possible, and we're working together to find the appropriate resolution for the Lundin ROFO. We still expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
It's $2.6 billion in proceeds and $120 million in contingent consideration. And we're also giving them exclusive right to acquire an exploration property we have in the DRC in a downstream cobalt business. So all of that is working to get closed in the fourth quarter. 
So putting this all together, on Slide 6, you can see the aggregate steps that we have taken. If we look at the completion of these asset sales transactions, completion of the previously announced $1.5 billion at-the-market offering, which, to date, we've completed about 25% of that $1.5 billion amount, execution of our operating plans, we expect to achieve our debt targets by the end of 2017. And we're well on our way of doing this. 
We have the portfolio of remaining assets that we want to keep. We're not planning additional divestments. We may take some steps to deal with the remaining assets in our oil and gas business. And we are prepared to divest at Grasberg an additional roughly 20% interest pursuant to our discussions with the Indonesian government that is contingent on, conditional on getting our long-term rights extended on the basis of giving us fiscal and legal surety. But we have -- we're committed to the government, selling additional 20% interest that's not in these numbers. So at the end of the day, we will have a reasonable balance sheet, an industry-leading portfolio of copper assets that would be available for a long-term development. And these are the sort of assets in the copper business that at best are very, very difficult to replicate, if at all possible. 
So looking at those assets, on Page 7 is an overview. We have -- we will have 7 copper mines, which will be led by Morenci -- 7 copper mines in North America, which will be led by our flagship Morenci mine, which is a fabulous operations. These mines are very long-lived. It gives us long-term optionality on copper prices and future investment opportunities. We will have 2 mines in South America: the Cerro Verde mine, which today has the largest processing facilities globally and is operating very well, and the El Abra mine in Chile, which has a very significant long-term growth opportunities for us as well as Grasberg. We've managed these assets successfully over a long period of time in different price environments. And within these mines, we have significant growth opportunities that we'd be prepared to pursue when time is right. 
And we showed this on Page 8. And this is our copper sulfide development opportunities. In alphabetical listing, not a priority listing. We're still assessing from a priority standpoint which ones we would attack first. And even though we're not spending capital on these projects, we are spending efforts to develop plans for future investments. And they are sulfide opportunities that we have identified through our exploration drilling and exploration analysis, very large ore bodies where we can take advantage of existing infrastructure to add on to processing facilities that will allow us to develop these in a profitable way. 
Now copper market commentary. Copper price in today's levels is still very low. It reflects the global economy and the slowdown in China. But stepping back, the surpluses that were previously predicted are lower than what was expected. We've had recent supply growth, and there are still a couple of projects being completed. We were a big part of that. We had 3 big projects that we started in the 2010 time frame that have been completed now. And with the current projects being finished, the recent supply growth is not sustainable. These long periods of low prices will impact future supplies, with McKinsey showing a 4 million ton decline from existing mines in the next coming years, about 2025. The top 10 mines in the world today produced less than 5.5 million tons of copper a year, and when McKinsey feels the incentive price to develop new mines supplies on the order of $3.30. 
The inventory has risen during the quarter. There are reasons for that. The levels still remain relatively low by historical standards, and when you look at the total marketplace, relatively, or just say, absolutely small increases in demand or supply disruptions that well move the market to deficit in a short period of time. 
Page 10 is a slide I don't think we've used recently, but we've used over the years which shows the 10 largest mines in the world in terms of reserves and copper production. We have 3 of those mines at Grasberg, Cerro Verde and Morenci. You can see what I referred to earlier, these top 10 mines in 2016 are -- will be producing less than 5.5 million tons a year, so to replace 4 million tons in the future in terms of what you're looking at is really a significant challenge for the industry. 
Other than Oyu Tolgoi and Los Pelambres, Grasberg is the most recent discovery, in 1988. Many of these mines were discovered back in the 1800s. And here, or at Grasberg, completing mining of the open pit this year. So the point is mining world-class mines is extremely rare, and now we're in a period of time where -- and this is where we've gone through, over the last 15 years, extensive exploration when prices were high and companies were investing. So even with all this investment, finding big new mines is really tough. And having this -- these kinds of mines in our portfolio is going to prove very valuable, I’m convinced, over time, because there's not any -- we haven't had any big technology revolution in the copper mining business. We've made progress with technology and so forth. But copper, as a commodity, is very tough to replace. We haven't seen any shale oil-type developments in our business. In fact, we're seeing SXEW opportunities dry up, new opportunities are low grade, sulfide opportunities which require lots of infrastructure and development and mining a lot of material to get a copper like we're getting at Cerro Verde. 
Now what are we going to be doing in the meantime before we start reinvesting again? We're going to look for every opportunity we can to continue to reduce cost and increase production. One of these things and our challenge now, you're seeing our data, we will have a falloff in production at Grasberg in 2018 as we make the transition from the pit to the underground at the Grasberg Block Cave. And so we challenge ourselves to mitigate these production declines while we spend a minimal amount of capital. In the meantime, one of the things we're looking at is pit wall designs to optimize our slopes to steepen pit angles to minimize stripping and add ore. And this can reduce costs as we add ore. And we're having a strict adherence in doing this in a safe way. But this is just one example of what we're doing to see if we can find ways of maximizing production safely at a time when we're going to be making this transition, and we'll be reporting to you on this as we go forward.
I mentioned -- Page 12 talks about Grasberg. We had to deal with labor grievances. It had to deal with some bonus issues and some issues about management, supervisory relationships with the workforce. We had a 10-day work stoppage in late September, but this had caused us issues relating to worker productivity for a longer period of time and was the principle reason why we had a shortfall in our mining rate. As I've talked about earlier, this is a timing issue. The ore remains there. We're not seeing any questions about the grades in the ore or its availability. And so we've developed new plans, which we shared with you for how we will make up for this ore that we had failed to melt -- to mine in the third quarter. And this carries over because grades are increasing and so forth as we delay this, it will -- it has an impact on the fourth quarter.  But -- and it'll extend by some period of time how long we’ll be in the pit. It now goes into 2018. But we will mine this ore, and the economic impact will not be significant. 
We continue to have discussions with the government. There are 2 really key issues. One is an existing regulation in Indonesia that prohibits exports of ores. And the government has defined copper concentrate as an ore, even though it's a commercial project -- product, which captures more than 90% of the value copper metal. But under their regulations, they call it an ore, existing regulations prohibit the export of ores beyond January 2017. There's a recognition in the government that this needs to be addressed, and I believe it will be. And we're working actively with the Ministry of Energy and Mines and other government officials on this issue. And then beyond that, the key issue for us is having the extension of our operating rights beyond the primary term of our existing contracts, which extends to 2021. Under the terms of that contract, we're entitled to 2 10-year extensions on the same terms as it is on the contract. And the government has agreed that it will not unreasonably delay or withhold approving that extension, but it hasn't been approved yet. So those are the 2 things that we're working with. There's been a lot of political changes in Indonesia that have affected this. But we have a -- we're committed to having a good working relationship with the new minister, the new vice minister and the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and with the President and other government officials. And so we are working amicably to address these issues. It's important for Indonesia as well as for us, and particularly important for the province of Papua. 
Page 13 shows our adjusted mining plan. We see the schematic of the pit in the underground Grasberg Block Cave. The existing underground production coming from the DOZ and the DMLZ mine. So we are -- we will adjust this every quarter, and you can see what our new outlook for copper and gold production is coming out of Grasberg. We have, in the appendix, longer-term projections, so you can see that. 
Our outlook for 2016 now is for 4.8 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.26 million ounces of gold, 73 million pounds of molybdenum. For the year, site cost, net of by-product credits of $1.20. Operating cash flows at $2.10 copper in the fourth quarter will be $3.6 billion. Each $0.10 change in the fourth quarter have a delta of $150 million. And our CapEx for the year of $2.8 billion, including over $1 billion for oil and gas, which was actually a carryover from spending that was done in 2015. 
Our sales profile for next -- going into 2017 is shown on Slide 15. You can see both our copper production. Now this takes out Tenke and the incremental interest that we sold at Morenci to Sumitomo earlier in the year. But the gold carryover from lower volumes in 2016 into 2017 and into 2018. 
Page 16 shows 2017 EBITDA and cash flow. This excludes all the oil and gas business essentially with the Deepwater and California sales. It's excludes Tenke. It excludes the incremental interest at Morenci. And you can see EBITDA at $2, being just under $5 billion; $2.25, just under $6 billion; and $2.50, just under $7 billion. And operating cash flows of $2.6 billion, $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion within this range of copper prices. It excludes working capital changes. We expect a positive working capital impact in 2017. 
Capital spending. You can see just how our efforts we undertook to cut capital is unfolding. I mentioned the $2.8 billion for 2016 falling to $1.7 billion in 2017. That's essentially the spending that we'll be doing developing the underground in Grasberg as well as the constrained sustaining capital for the rest of our business. 
18 summarizes where we are with our debt structure. You can see, 9/30, we had $19 billion of debt and $1.1 billion of cash. Pro forma for the asset sales transactions, but with no additional equity from the ATM offering, we would end the year with $3.3 billion in cash, and our maturities for 2017 are $1.3 billion. So we have ample cash to deal with our near-term liquidity and a good set of assets of dealing with our long-term balance sheet issues. 
So we talked in the beginning of the year about execution. And we are continually focused on that. As I mentioned, we're disappointed about the mining rate issues at Grasberg but are working on that every day. We're working on securing our long-term rights in Indonesia every day. We feel good about our plans for debt reduction, building long-term value, and safety in our business is a challenging part of it. We certainly had our challenges in the third quarter. But that is the first thing we talk about whenever we meet with our team, and that overrides everything that we do. 
So thank you for bearing with me on this overview, and I look forward to your questions."

You had the labor stoppage. And the implication seems to be that the problems over the third quarter that you saw are going to be hamper production in the fourth quarter, effectively push some of that back into next year. Can you clarify, are you more constrained in what you can produce over fourth quarter because of these lingering issues? Or does this move around out of any kind of conservatism?

As we progress our mine plan at this stage, we get to higher grades as we go forward. So the fact that we were not able to mine the material that we had planned to mine in the third quarter means it just simply going to take longer to get to the higher-grade material that we originally planned to mine in the fourth quarter. And that gets pushed out. We can't do more to get to it quicker because we're constrained by physical space. So our plan call for us to do everything that we could do all along. And when it gets pushed back, it gets pushed back over time physically. So it's not a -- it's really not a strategic or tactical decision, but it's a physical consequence of what we face. Now we know we’ve got to be diligent about keeping our equipment operating and available and so forth, because delays in that can have an impact in the future. We were working hard to address these issues of concern by our workers. We've made some responsive steps to the issues they raised in terms of the bonus, in terms of the relationships between supervisors and the workers. And that's an ongoing process that we'll have to work with. It's a complicated labor situation there in Papua with the nature of the workforce and how it's changed over the years. All of this requires a lot of attention and a lot of work. What it doesn't change is that high-grade ore that is there. I mean, that remains there, and it's a question of getting to it as quickly as we can. We want to do it. Safety is the first issue. But we're not trying to do any of this in terms of positioning with the government of Indonesia. We want to operate in an efficient, straightforward way. That's been our history and that's going to be our future. While we're doing this, I might add that our work in underground development is going extraordinary well. I mean, we're meeting our targets in terms of development and putting things in place. We're getting approvals from the government to do what we need to do. That's a big project that just kind of gets out of the spotlight here. But it's, in total over time, a $15 billion investment project, and we're spending roughly $1 billion a year. And that's the future for us and our partner, Rio Tinto, as we go forward. So as we're dealing with these important issues near term in the pit, we are also keeping great focus on the underground development, and it's going very well."

And as has been the case, there are a lot of different views expressed publicly by members of the DPR and certain members of the government. But we believe in our discussion there is a recognition that this needs to be addressed and will be addressed. The discussions that we've had, the President has been very positive about the need for foreign investment, the need to treat existing investors well. The Vice President recently made some comments along this line. We've had this situation of a reshuffling of the cabinet and the unusual situation of a -- with respect to the minister. And so we are just having to deal with all of that, and we keep emphasizing with the government our history of investments. The fact that we're providing work for over 30,000 people in Papua, the benefits that our operations have provided and will continue to provide to the government. And the government's fiscal situation is such that this is important, and then moreover, the role we play in Papua. We're over 90% of the economy in the region where we operate, a majority of the GNP in the province itself. So all of these things are things that we talk about and have talked about for a long period of time, and that's what's going to lead to a positive resolution of this for us. But the timing of it, Tony, I -- It’ll happen, but it may go to the wire."

The present law in 2009 took several years and was very complicated to get negotiated. The government can deal with these issues also through changing regulations. The existing mining law has the flexibility of extending our contract, of allowing exports and so forth without changing the law but changing regulations, which is in the authority of the administration. There's also a process of where the President can issue executive orders called perfuse. So the government has alternatives of how to deal with this. It's going to be in my -- it's going to be a challenge to get a new mining law done by early January, considering what's happened to date. So we are just prepared to work with the government in whatever approach they decide to use. The challenge of not addressing our contract until 2019 is, one, we are simply unable to invest in the smelter without having our long-term contract assured. I mean, that's a huge investment, a significant investment, and we simply just can't do it without knowing that we will continue to operate beyond 2021. We've also agreed to divest an additional 20%, which is a significant amount of value. And clearly, we could not invest with having uncertainty about our position to operate beyond 2021. So offsetting this -- and that's a regulation, that's not in the law, this 2-year deal -- is these things that -- resolution -- there'll be pressures to have a resolution with that before 2019."

So even if we had all the cash in the world, we wouldn't be pursuing these projects as we speak right now. Now the development of sales varies depending on the ore body. Let's say, for example, El Abra, which has -- and we didn't know about this when we acquired Phelps Dodge, but a subsequent exploration has shown an enormous sulfide resource there. And to date, that operations has been an SXEW operations: oxide, sulfide. So this would be a Cerro Verde type project with a very large mill required. You'd have a desalinization plant and the transport of water to more than 10,000 feet. So it's a big capital project. At Lone Star, we have an existing operation there at Safford. And that would be done in stages of where we would have an oxide development, which would actually be stripping us down to a sulfide project which would require a major mill investment. At Baghdad, we have a big sulfide resource to require mill expansion, tailings expansion and investment in water access. So every one of these assets has its own story, and there's tradeoffs, lots of advantages in U.S. today that weren't there historically in terms of energy costs, labor flexibility.

Given where we were 3 months ago with the mine plan at Grasberg and where we are today, it seems like there's a lot of a shortfall, and I know that production stoppages for 10 days are sort of unforeseen. But it seems like you would have anticipated that the physical area of the bottom of the pit would be smaller, and that the -- it seems like the shortfall in production that you're anticipating is more than just unexpected stuff. So my question is sort of what happened that you sort of weren't expecting? And is there a chance that, that could happen in '17 as well?"

We absolutely knew that we had limited amounts of area, and we projected based on our past experience, on equipment availability and workforce productivity what we would achieved. Then we were faced with these issues related principally to the workers, and that had the consequence that it had. So we took it into account. Yes, we said we were 15% short of our mine rate. So that's what it was, and it had a consequence of changing our production profile. Do we have risk going forward? Yes. I mean, we -- going forward, we will need to operate our equipment well. We've had a long history of doing that. We will have to deal with our workforce. We’ve been doing our utmost to do that. But yes, I mean, that's always one of the risks of our business. We have a great history of meeting those risks, but it's particularly significant in terms of near-term cash flows because of the grades and physical situation of the Grasberg pit. But yes, it's a risk."

So even a small amount of downtime on a truck or a shovel can have more impactful variances than what you would have seen historically in a -- in another pit or historically at Grasberg. So -- but we're very confident that, while we could have blips in the volumes, we're very confident that over this period of time, relatively short period of time, we'll be able to access very significant volumes of both copper and gold. So it's not a question of day-by-day predictions or forecast. It's really looking over this period, and we feel very confident we'll be able to -- we have the plans in place to obtain these volumes."

This is Mark Johnson, is that even though we've had some production delays, deferrals, a couple of things that we have accomplished is that the high walls of the mining are very robust. We implemented a very comprehensive final pit blasting, final wall blasting process, which is -- will provide us possibly some upside on keeping the pits similar to what Richard had shown on one of the slides. That could provide some upside as to the amount of metal we can get from the pit. We've also put into place a pit dewatering system that essentially we're keeping the pit completely dewatered right now without pumping, and that's kind of unique within the mining industry, and it's going to provide some opportunities for us as we're in the pit bottom to have that water managed in the way that we have is going to provide some upside. So one of the other aspects that we're dealing with is that the workforce is aware of the upcoming transition of the workers from the open pit to the underground. I think it's created a little bit of apprehension within the workforce that we're working closely with the workers and the Union to make sure that everybody understands that they're all going to have an opportunity elsewhere within our mining areas. We've got jobs opening up in the underground and some of the other logistics and levee construction, but that's one aspect, too, that we're dealing with. We've got about 1,600 people in the pit. We'll need about 600 beyond the finishing of the pit mining for reclamation effort for a number of years. So we're working very closely with the workers to explain what their future looks like within PT-FI, but it's another aspect of some of the issues that we've had over the last couple of quarters."

And what we look at a lot is our sinking rate, how many pushbacks we mine in a year. I'd say we've historically been very aggressive on that. We've had pushbacks where we do over 18 benches a year. We base a lot of our mine plans based on that ability which takes into account the limited mining space. And we're looking at somewhere to 15 to 16 as we complete the pit, 15 to 16 benches a year. So it's something that we've been able to do before that accounts for space and equipment sequencing. We feel comfortable we did make some adjustments to our mining rates in the fourth quarter. Our previous forecast had slightly higher mining rates. We're currently projecting that for the remainder of the quarter that we're going to do in the order of 180,000 tons a day. We feel comfortable with that plan. We have some things that we'll manage on a day-to-day basis. We're working closely with our supervisors and in communication plans with the workers. So it's -- there's multi-elements of how we are approaching the productivity issues in the pit. We've also brought some resources from Red's team over there. We've got a group of guys there now that are helping us, just looked at sequencing and making sure that the pit blasting is going on as scheduled. So we're throwing a lot of resources at it. We understand the importance of it. We are, like I said, focused on the quality of mining. We want to ensure that everything we're doing doesn't limit our ability to complete the pit in a safe and efficient manner. We are one of the deepest pits in the world. Very steep, high walls. We've been able to manage that very well, and we'll continue to focus on that also."
