I'll begin on Slide 4 which highlights another record year in 2015. Our 10th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings. 
During the year, we delivered strong volume growth in our global commodities business, double-digit revenue growth in data and listings, synergy realization ahead of faith, margin expansion, outstanding earnings growth and strong returns on invested capital. And we delivered of these results while investing in our diverse global businesses, making strategic acquisitions of Interactive Data Corporation and Trayport, and generating over $1.3 billion in operating cash flows, which enabled us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders.
Consolidated net revenues grew 8% in 2015 versus the prior year. Transaction revenues were flat versus 2014 despite solid growth in our commodities and cash equities market. We grew our data services and listings revenues 26% and 10%, respectively. This solid revenue growth coupled with expense discipline enables adjusted operating margins to expand 4 points over the prior year to 59%. All of these allowed us to deliver $12.15 in adjusted earnings per share, a 26% increase versus 2014.
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll discuss our fourth quarter performance. Revenues of $875 million included $50 million from Interactive Data Corporation and Trayport, which we closed in mid-December. Our revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again driven by strong growth in data and listings. Commodity futures and U.S. cash equities revenues also grew well in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses were $364 million, including $33 million from Interactive Data Corporation and Trayport. Adjusted operating margins were 58%. Our expense discipline and top line revenue growth helped us deliver a record $3.27 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, a 26% year-to-year increase.
Please move to Slide 6, where you can see further delineation of the diverse revenue streams that contributed to our record fourth quarter. While transaction and clearing revenues were flat year-to-year, both commodity and U.S. cash equity grew 3%. It's also worth noting that while total financial revenue declined in the fourth quarter due to lower equity option in CDS revenue, revenue in our interstate futures was up 5% versus last year. Data revenues increased 35% in the quarter, including the addition of Interactive Data Corporation and Trayport. Excluding the $50 million in revenue that contributed, our data revenues would still have reason 9%. Finally, listings revenues set another record and was up 8%.
Slide 7 shows revenue mix on the left side of the slide and on the right, our fourth quarter adjusted operating. We provided a pro forma version of this chart, which includes Interactive Data Corporation and Trayport for the whole fourth quarter on Slide 18 in the appendix. As shown on the left side of Slide 7, transaction revenues made up 59% of our fourth quarter revenues and data services comprise 29%. On a pro forma basis though, you'll see that data services would've made up 43% of revenues and transaction revenues only 48%. Going forward, we expect data revenues of $470 million to $480 million in the first quarter of 2016 with additional sequential growth as we move through 2016.
I also want to mention that we intend to enhance our financial reporting starting in the first quarter of 2016 when we expect to report 2 business segments, a trading and risk management segment, which includes our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses; and a data and listings segment, which includes our subscription-based revenues. We'll provide more detail to ensure that you have good transparency as we make that transition during the first quarter.
Shifting to the right side of the slide, you see the fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $364 million, including $33 million related to Interactive Data Corporation and Trayport. Excluding those expenses, our adjusted operating expenses would've declined 2% year-to-year due to real estate consolidation and further integration of our corporate function. This strong expense management once again reflects an acceleration of the realization of synergy and provides a solid foundation to deliver the remaining synergies related to the combination of ICE, NYSE, Interactive Data Corporation and our other recent acquisitions.
For 2016, we expect operating expenses between $2 billion and $2.03 billion. This includes another $75 million in synergies, which is roughly 1/3 of the total expense reduction we intend to deliver over the next 3 years. The expense guidance also include approximately $45 million largely related to compensation increases and roughly $30 million from investments in new product development about the new ICE U.S. Treasury Index series as well as technology upgrades and enhancements to our cybersecurity platform. The rest of our 2016 guidance can be found on Slide 19 in the appendix. We have also included an update regarding our synergy realization on Slide 20 in the appendix. You will see that we ended 2015 with $480 million in realized synergies. 
Let's move forward now to Slide 8, where I will review our solid cash generation and capital returns for the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash during 2015, which will enable us to invest in growth, fund acquisitions and return $1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Importantly, the cash generative nature of our diverse global business gives us the confidence that we can invest in our business and delever to maintain our strong credit rating while still delivering on our objectives to grow our dividend as we grow. Along those lines, this morning we announced a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend, following the 15% increase we implemented in last year's second quarter. This increase ultimately means that we will pay out 20% more to shareholders in 2016 than we did in 2015 in the form of dividend.
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 9 with a review of our capital structure and return on invested capital. At December 31, we had $627 million in unrestricted cash, including the debt related to the acquisition of Interactive Data Corporation, our total debt was $7.3 billion at the end of 2015 and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA was 2.89x. As noted above, we are confident that we can quickly reduce our leverage.
On the right side of the slide, we see our return on invested capital, which was nearly 8.5% in 2015 and remains above our key competitors and above our cost of capital. Our ROIC has steadily improved since closing the NYSE acquisition in 2013 and was on track to approach 10% as we move through 2016. As you would expect though, ROIC would dip as we incorporate our investments in Interactive Data and Trayport. Importantly though, we expect to continue to generate ROIC above our cost of capital and to reestablish the upper trend in the 2017 and beyond.
Our fourth quarter and 2015 results are a testament to the focus and execution across our business. We delivered record revenue, strong operating margin expansion and once again, double-digit earnings growth while continuing to strategically diversify our business to serve our customers' growing demands for information and risk management.
And importantly, we are off to a strong start in our transaction-based businesses in January and expect our data and listings businesses to generate solid growth once again in 2016. This solid revenue base coupled with the general and expense management should once again enable us to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016.
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

We're pleased to report that 2015 was the best year in our company's history. It was our 10th anniversary as a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and it was our 10th consecutive year of delivering record revenues and record earnings.
I'll take a few minutes to update you on our growth drivers before we move into our question-and-answer session. Starting on Slide 10, which illustrates our unparalleled track record of growth over the last decade. Starting as an over-the-counter energy trading platform then evolving to futures exchanges and clearinghouses, we've now expanded into being a leader in data connectivity and listings. We've evolved our business model to stay close to our customers' changing needs. And in that process, we've moved from a 90% transaction-based revenue model to a balanced mix of transaction and subscription-based revenues across a diverse range of marketing services. Because our team and its culture is central to our strong results, I want to take a moment to highlight the promotions that we announced last week.
Ben Jackson, who previously led ICE Futures U.S. for us, is now our Chief Commercial Officer, where he's leading the integration of our acquisitions to ensure that we meet our targets of ever-increasing results. Ben is deeply steeped in the ICE culture and will help export that important operating philosophy to our new colleagues. 
Lynn Martin, our Global Head of Data has expanded her scope to include responsibility for uniting Interactive Data Corporation with the ICE and NYSE data operations. Lynn joined us to be NYSE acquisition were she led Liffe U.S. She's already working closely with the team at Interactive Data to ensure that we benefit from our combined strengths.
And Glenn, who was ICE's Vice President of Regulation is now the President of ICE Futures U.S. has a strong legal and compliance background, and has experience in working with our customers to address regulatory and market issues. These promotions set us up for the next phase of growth by leveraging the deep expertise that we have across our global team. 
Turning to Slide 11, you'll find a summary of our diverse growth drivers across a broad range of markets. Many are secular trends and others are organic growth initiatives, but all other results of our customers' changing needs. I'll walk through these in the next few slides starting with the solid performance of our financial markets in 2015. 
In our European interest rate markets, we saw significant build in open interest during the year. Rising open interest was coupled with a 30% increase in daily volume in the fourth quarter. And that has continued into 2016 as daily volumes in our rates markets grew 27%. The increased activities in interest rate rating is being driven by customers returning to the market in Europe as central banks are becoming more vocal and action-oriented. While the U.S., U.K. and European central banks may be on different paths, the changing expectations create dynamic rates and currency environments the drive trading and clearing activity. Also in our financial markets, credit default swap clearing contributed over $100 million of revenue in 2015. This business continues to open new opportunities for us across the swaps clearing landscape as further mandates across credit and interest rate swaps come into effect later this year. 
Slide 12 is a snapshot of our strength of our energy markets. The importance of risk management at all energy price levels is evident as you can see, well into the second year of oil price declines, the depth and breadth of our market along with uncertainty around oil prices and geopolitical events drove record revenues, which increased 14% in 2015. And this resulted in the ICE Brent contract achieving its 19th consecutive annual volume record. This strong performance continued to January with daily volume in our oil markets up over 20% for the month, including another record month for ICE Brent crude volumes. We maintain a close dialogue with our customers in the energy markets amidst shifting dynamics of supply and demand and the challenges of declining prices. Expectations for the level of oil prices, the strength of the dollar, central bank actions and global economic trends continue to drive uncertainty and the increasing volumes in our commodities market reflect these conditions. We also continue to grow by introducing new products into market such as ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore, which were successfully launched in mid-November. 
Now turning to our global data business on Slide 13. You can see the of services that we now provide. Similar to the development of our diverse and clearing operations, the development of our data services business offers a meaningful opportunity to leverage our global network. Our data services provide transparency, information, analysis and connectivity, all of which is consumed by market participants to transect across markets and instruments.
Our customers rely on data, trading and risk management platforms, which are often interdependent across their workflow. And when these services are well coordinated, they create a strong value proposition. While Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, ICE and NYSE data are each strong businesses in their own right, we believe they'll be much more valuable to our customers and to our shareholders on a combined basis. 
Our customers' needs are not limited to exchange traded data, the broader market for fixed income is vast and Interactive Data Corporation is centered on the changes taking place in this over-the-counter market. You'll recall that the drivers of our acquisitions are based on newer secular trends, these include the standardization of products for electronic trading and clearing and the need to trade with algorithms and quantitatively-driven program. The increased use of technologies is growing demand for data input, including the connectivity to consume this information. An increase or comments for independent evaluation required by financial reform raise the demand for autonomous data. 
Finally, the trend towards growing indexation and patent investing is seen in our strong ETF market performance. Supports the access to data that can be licensed and packaged. We believe that data and data connectivity are deeply linked to the global markets that they serve. In order to lead in customer service and innovation, we're making investments in these areas. 
For that, and on Slide 14, I want to provide an update on our early progress with Interactive Data. In January, we began integrating the corporate services functions so that we can move forward, serving our customers as 1 team. And as a result, we become even more confident about our combination. A great example of our potential together is last week's announcement of the launch of the ICE U.S. Treasury Index family with BlackRock agreeing to transition 4 of its flagship fixed income iShare ETFs to reference these indices. The new ICE Fixed Income indices rely on pricing input from Interactive Data. Also yesterday, we announced that AllianceBernstein shows our best execution service to evaluate its fixed income trade execution quality, a service that utilizes the new Interactive Data, realtime pricing algorithms. We see further significant opportunities with both active and passive fund managers by leveraging the strong relationships that we have gained with them at the New York Stock Exchange, and we look forward to continuing to update our investors and our team as this integration progresses.
I'll move now to Slide 15. 2015 was another exciting year for NYSE listings, culminating in record quarterly revenue. We were pleased to welcome great companies like First Data, Square and Ferrari during the fourth quarter. NYSE again led in global proceeds rates for the fifth consecutive year. 
Later this month, we expect to begin rolling out the new NYSE Pillar trading platform for our NYSE Arca markets. This is just 1 example of our commitment to incorporating leading technology into our unique market offerings. I'll also note the strong proportion performance of NYSE Arca, where exchange traded product volume rose 25% in 2015. As the leader in ETF listings, we've undertaken a study to support the long-term growth of the market for our issuers by identifying improvements to the trading ecosystem. 
Last week, we released the study conducted with Mackenzie, outlining a number of proposed market enhancements, many of which are already underway. Our listed customers continue to tell us that they prioritize proper price discovery in their shares over speed as is offered by our designated marketmaker model. Whether through industry coordination or by our own actions, New York Stock Exchange will continue to lead positive change for listed companies and their investors. 
Turning to Slide 16, you can see that we're a growth company. In 2015, we grew our top line and our bottom line, and we're growing our dividend as we grow our earnings. ICE is driven by change, which brings opportunities to better serve our customers, and I'd like to pause and thank those customers for their business in 2015. And I look forward to building on our track record with our newly expanded team in this new year. 
I'll now turn the call back to today's operator, Rocco, and he'll be happy to moderate your questions."

Since the IDC acquisition and the announcement and based on some of your commentary, the BlackRock win, AllianceBernstein, just wanted to get your sense, I know it's still early, but when you think about the growth opportunity in that part of the business, you've given some of the early traction that you're seeing, you know with the customer base and you've pretty broadened your customer base.

And so that part of the revenue is really almost an annuity type business. What we're working on and have the team working on now is really expanding the scope of services and expanding the footprint and customer base and we feel pretty confident that we're going to significantly increase the revenue growth and earnings potential of that company by new products, new services, new geographies and what have you. And the reason I wanted to highlight in my prepared remarks that there are 2 new services that we just put out and we've literally put Lynn Martin in there a little more than 30 days ago, that demonstrate the kind of thing that we think we can do. With very, very strong synergies with the New York Stock Exchange, the deep relationships that we've gotten over the last couple of years around the NYSE, we've taken our ETF management business and we're combining it with the Interactive Data business. These are businesses that produce realtime pricing and equities and now in fixed income for end-users, for the management of exchange traded products and the like. And in addition, we mentioned that for nonexchange traded products, we now have the realtime valuation services that are new and robust. And so we feel relatively confident with the thesis on which we made the acquisition. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're actually more confident now that we've started to put our teams together and unlock our customer relationships."

So the $45 million is kind of what I'll refer to as business as usual investment in our people and investment in the places where we work, et cetera. It's a little bit more than 2% of our overall expense base. That's to be expected plus or minus a point in any given year. These are investments in people that if you look back over the last 3 years, we spent about $90 million delivering almost $300 million in incremental revenue, which is about 70%, just under 70% incremental margin. So we think those are good investments. We think they've proven to be good investments and they're good investments going forward. The $30 million is really more targeted. It's targeted at a lot of things that Jeff talked about in his script, not the least of which was the recent announcement with Interactive Data Corporation on the index that we did with BlackRock. There are also investments in there to further enhance our cybersecurities capabilities. We have always been a technology company. We've always been very focused on information security and stability of our systems, design our own system, we manage our own data centers and so that's an area where we think the additional investment pays off in the long-term by continued to provide systems that are up for our customers to the trading in the risk management that they need to do. So that's how I would generally characterize it. And I think you're exactly right. Those investments are being made against the backdrop of a very diverse set of commodity and Futures & Options product, all of which have strong open interest bases and an expectation that our data listings business will continue to grow."

Well we've already seen synergies in combining Interactive Data with other businesses beyond the indices and execution quality product offerings that I mentioned. Our SuperDerivatives valuation business, which is really designed to value very difficult and complicated contracts is quickly finding synergies with Interactive Data in the customer base where we can package really valuation services together. I think another part of data is how you deliver it and one of the -- the 1 real piece of infrastructure that we kept when we unwound the NYSE technology business was the safety network, which is just what its acronym implies, a very safe network for which, as Scott mentioned, we are increasingly putting more cybersecurity and protections around and the ability to deliver through that network into our data centers. And so we believe that in addition to the product that the delivery mechanism will be a value to our customers as well. All of that, for the 30-or-so days that we've really been focused on it feels pretty good and we've seen some early wins in that regard. I think I've made comments before in public forums that the trend in our industry is for more execution competition. Some of that is happening because regulators are vulcanizing markets by wanting more local regulation particularly at local regulation of the banking sector. And for many years, our industry went electronic and took for granted the fact that we could trade globally. Well, now there are speed bumps around the world as there are reporting requirements and other kinds of things that are fracturing markets. Beyond that, there's actually a trend in Europe that Europe is trying to specifically potentially fracture markets with. And as those markets fracture, the need for putting the information back together on behalf of market participants and having it delivered in a safe manner that's reliable and timely and what have you is really where the pocket is going to go and that's where we're skating. And we've amazingly seen some very, very early signs of success just in a few short number of days."

We expect that it will begin rolling out in the next few weeks. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to start with the Arca platform. The early results of that is that is a very, very predictable, reliable and fast platform that it's simple and easy to understand. Our experience in the derivatives market have suggested that, that is a winning formula for people that honestly just have predictability of how our markets going to operate and then can make their own investments and build their own systems and tools around that predictable nature. We're not going to change any pricing. I mean, that market is a highly competitive market and prices continue to be adjusted by competitors and peers and others and we'll respond to that but we feel pretty good at rolling out Pillar. We think it's going to be a dramatic improvement with the same value proposition. We do -- we have seen business in 2015 in our mind lead the dark pool market and come back to listed trading. And NYSE has gotten -- it's above its fair share of that market movement. And if you look at them, the market share trends, they're very, very positive for NYSE and that's with our own legacy platforms. So we feel pretty good moving into '16. It will take a while to put everything on Pillar. We're going to be relatively slow and deliberate as we found out this summer when the New York Stock Exchange had an outage.

And I guess 2-part question. It sounds like these opportunities came about pretty quickly into the integration process. So when you look out, are there a lot more similar opportunities like that particularly around the analytics piece, the index one I think is a little bit more self-explanatory, but on the execution part of it, so that's Part A. And then Part B, can you talk a little bit about how the pricing structure works, length of the contract, is it kind of a base or is it a fee-based just help us better understand what opportunities that could be?"

In my mind, a lot of the opportunity set that we're seeing really comes from the fact that the buy side was able to rely on certain services that came from the global banking industry that were relatively casual and informal. But today, due to regulatory reform and internal audit practices, need to be more rigorous. So for example it might have been perfectly acceptable a few years ago to call a bank counterparty and ask what they think what you think the mark should be on a particular instrument and rely on that. Today, the regulators and the auditors wanted independent validation. Increasingly, as people are taking the obligation to get the best execution seriously as the SEC is paying more attention to best ex requirements in the fixed income space, asset managers and other are making investments to make sure that they are compliant and that they are able to represent that end-users that they're using best practices. So it's a relatively new market as you probably know. The fixed income space is evolving. Some of these things that I mentioned are really just the tip of the iceberg. In other words, they haven't really resulted in formal rulemakings or obligations but people see them coming and are getting ahead of them. So we think it's a very early days and a big market. We have always had some execution capabilities in the fixed income space because of our Credit X acquisition. A lot of people that do credit default swaps, do underlying bond, transactions, so we have a very good dialogue with a lot of end-users. People that are in the market every day and we're exploring all of those channels right now, and Lynn Martin and her team are working to organize that absolute that we can speak with 1 voice. In terms of how we charge form. It's pretty early days right now. We're having a lot of conversations. As you probably know, the passive index managers are very, very price competitive with one another, particularly for relatively standardized pools of trading. And so they're looking for how they can best manage the services that going to supporting that. We're pretty familiar with that. We've been talking them around NYSE Arca and their listing activities for years. And so we want to be -- we want to put a compelling package together for them that is value-added for our shareholders. And so we're having a lot of conversations how to do that, how to partner with these guys to give them a better offering, but still return great returns for our shareholders. So early days yet, but we'll probably have more to say about it and Scott will have to figure out a way to talk to you about that so that you have some predictability and metrics as we go forward."

Our thought really is to bring our culture into it, which is ""Okay, how do we innovate off of that and provide more products and services and higher value to those end users?"" Because what we've always seen in data is that if we provide more value then people are happy to pay more for it. We have never really, and I think you know that about us, we don't know go in and just jack up prices, per se. Our philosophy is, let's give people a better package and then they'll be happy to pay for it. And so in that regard, we don't get a lot of pushback on our pricing and yet we've been able to really raise the profitability of these businesses. The AllianceBernstein product that I mentioned in the prepared remarks is based off of the realtime bond pricing platform, which is new. It's something that Interactive Data had under construction at the time we acquired it. We're working to accelerate that and to get more and more instruments and more sophistication around that. And we think there's a number of different channels where that can be deployed. Right now, obviously, the AllianceBernstein deal is a deployment that results in financial gain for us but that data is floating around the ecosystem right now in a relatively uncoordinated way, and people are starting to rely on it, and we're going to figure out how to better channel that and monetize it for our shareholders."

And so at this moment in time, we have no reason to believe that those indices aren't going to continue to be anything other than a customer to us. There's a lot of index activity in the fixed income space. It's an unbelievably large space in terms of number of instruments and issuance and the global nature of the debt markets around the world. So the various fund managers are providing lots of different instruments to allow investors to participate in those markets.

So Ben Jackson is now reporting directly to me and really we've passed with the job of looking at our total portfolio, looking at our footprint and helping us to figure out how to best organize that. And that work is just starting. We don't have anything to say right now. I will say that there are a lot of interesting parts and pieces in the businesses that you just described that we want to take a hard look at to see where they might fit with other things we do before we make any kind of decisions on our long-term deployment and that's what Ben is doing with us. I think what's been interesting about the NYSE is that it fits so nicely now with the Interactive Data. As we've mentioned, this assumes that we need to run ETFs inside the NYSE are highly complementary with Interactive Data. The sale of data the way we move, marshal data around having the New York Stock Exchange data is a door opener for our sales force. It's obviously, we can easily help people price equities, having our commodity data in this era where there's tremendous conversation at all levels of boardrooms about commodities. All that package together is really valuable. So New York Stock Exchange, while it may have a different name and other than -- it's not cold ICE, the reality is that company is being integrated in a way that is really raising our earnings capabilities across the firm. And not the least of which is that New York Stock Exchange is a cash generative business that fits in the United States so that we get U.S. cash, which is allowing us to quickly pay down debt and delever and will allow us to return capital to shareholders faster. We are in -- we are a global company with an enviable position in that we're not struggling to figure out how to move money around the world in order to return capital to shareholders. And so it's paid some very, very strong and interesting dividends that I think is really working for the firm right now. And not -- by the way, it's convenient for people to write about the New York Stock Exchange, not you, Rich, but for people to write about the New York Stock Exchange once at 85% market share and now it only has 25% market share. Woe is me. The reality is last year was the highest earnings of New York Stock Exchange in its over 225-year history. And this month, I suspect that this is probably 1 of the highest earnings months in its history. It's a company that is doing incredibly well from a financial standpoint. And I think as we continue to shed legacy platform and simplify it and make it better, easier to understand and more approachable to investors and listed companies that it's going to continue to do well. Notwithstanding the fact that it is in a highly competitive environment with very strong competitors. But it's been doing very well and it is not a business that we would want to see leave our portfolio."

So my point is, I think that it's such a strong value proposition for us and such an interesting thing for those managers that the conversations are happening at levels above your typical salesperson. It's easy once that door has opened for us to figure out creative ways of packaging things and we've just started this. But so far, been very, very well received and actually had some inbound calls from people saying, can you come in here and let's sit down and talk about how we probably might work better together.

We're waiting to see how long it gets delayed. I just want to hear your thoughts on the delay, when do you think the delay gives your customers more time to speak with regulators?

One of the things that we've seen now is that when MiFID 2 was passed, I got the sense the politicians went, their constituents would you like to have everything unbundled? Would you like to be able to choose where you could trade, and where you clear and where you buy research and have complete choice in what you do and everybody said yes. Would you like to make sure that the banks are not cornering markets and taking speculative positions that drive prices the wrong way? People said yes. And the question wasn't as is how is that actually going to impact the market and what is it going to cost you? And now that the regulation is out there, people are looking at it and saying, oh my gosh, it's going to fragment markets, it's going to drive up my cost, it's going to limit potentially make it more difficult for me to hedge, it may move markets to other jurisdictions. And so there is a much more active dialogue going on around MiFID II and not just the areas that I described being in totality of the bill. And I would say to you that Lord Hill was the Finance Minister there or the Infrastructure Minister that's overseeing financial services is got an open ear and wants them -- my impression is that he wants them to make these markets work. And it was more impactful in the dialogue when the ultimate end users talk in and talk about the concerns that it is what exchanges an brokers and a perceptual providers go in because we look to the politicians like we're just trying to protect our interest, when in reality, they're starting to hear these kinds of issues from the end-users. And so obviously, it has slowed down and part of the reason that it is slowed down is there is an active dialogue going on around it as the how to improve the language and make it work. And so in that regard, I relatively hopeful and respectful that the bill will get better with time. It's hard to know one that would actually be implemented. Some of these of things require investment and not just investment by the industry but also investment by government in order to monitor and maintain some of these of things. So until Europe has landed on a specific set of language, the people can understand and then figure out a timetable on how it can be implemented. It's hard to know exactly what the timing is. But the good news is, there is an active dialogue and it's a pretty broad and involving lots of different constituencies."

NYSE does not have any kind of speed bump, any kind of artificial delays. I just want to correct one thing in your question. NYSE and ICE are not against IEX becoming a regulated exchange. And in fact, the National Stock Exchange recently had an application, became a stock exchange and we were not against that. What our concern is, is that there is a law on the books that requires that NYSE and all other regulated exchanges deliver our results as soon as technically practicable and we've been held to that standard for years. And what IEX is asking for an exemption that would solely be for IEX, not for the industry, solely IEX would be the only one that would be exempted from that law. And IEX is attempting to patent the system that is seeking to exempt. So it is looking for the ability to have a regulated monopoly status to the other exchanges they have that we do not have. And so we -- I have advocated that and worked behind the scenes with lots of people to say we should take a look at market structure. We should look at slowing down. The ideas that they're promulgating are not bad ideas at all, but the methods that they're going about it, we are objecting to. This is solely for their benefit and not for the benefit of the industry. And frankly, if that were to go forward, IEX would actually hurt the other people in the industry. Normally, when there's innovation, the innovation helps people but it doesn't actually hurt the people that are left behind. And so that is our objection, that's what we want the SEC to take a hard look at. If the industry can come together and work on our change to Reg NMS, we're very supportive. If the SEC wants our support our needs our help in changing Reg NMS to allow things to slow down to change the way that data moves around, the change the obligation of exchanges, we're all in for that.

And while you mentioned 1 competitor, there are others that are coming at this because it's a growing area of business. And in a competitive space, people are looking to get their market share. One thing that we've heard from many of the ETFs sponsors is they like frankly the competition, they feel it's benefiting them. And secondly, that they do want to have some diversity of providers. In case there is a technical problem or some other structural problems so that they have tested other systems and would be able to move business around quickly. So some of it is really just -- some of the movements that you see is really people doing BCP planning so that because these franchises are becoming ever more important. And so we understand and actually help some people to do that because we want to be able to have them -- have those businesses, those that can move our way. The -- I don't know want to say than it is not particularly expensive to list an ETF. You're talking about things in the sense of $25,000 a year or less. So while it is highly competitive, that is really not the metric that is going to allow an ETF provider of any size and scale to determine where to list. And what I'm investing in, what you can see us doing is really improving the package of services that we can have to literally partner with these firms, to be part of their workflow and to make life easy for them because we understand this business. And even more so now in the fixed income space. And we are an advocate for them and want to continue to be an advocate with public policy and with their marketing and sales effort that goes way beyond what a $25,000 investment would have for an ETF. So we feel good about our positioning, but it's certainly competitive."

So it hasn't -- that phenomena had not led to a decrease in a number of customers that actually led to more interest and an increase in the number of customers. I think more people are paying attention to those prices and trying to figure out when to lock in low prices or whether or not they're going to be high prices. And so there's a lot of trading activity. Open interest as you know from covering this for a long time, I'm sure that open interest in certain commodities, particularly in oil, will go up and down with the steepness of the curve. It went back it predates or goes into contango. There are different carry economics that go on that affect open interest but actually accelerate trading, which is what they care about. So we care about our open interest and we monitor it and we'll watch it and use it as a predictor but you have to look at it in context with is the curve getting flatter or steeper. And so we are very, very comfortable right now that, that is still a growing franchise. And as I mentioned, we have record volumes in January. And there's tremendous interest in energy commodity space globally right now. We would expect that growth to continue."

I'll begin on Slide 4 which highlights another record year in 2015. Our 10th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings. 
During the year, we delivered strong volume growth in our global commodities business, double-digit revenue growth in data and listings, synergy realization ahead of faith, margin expansion, outstanding earnings growth and strong returns on invested capital. And we delivered these results while investing in our diverse global businesses, making strategic acquisitions of Interactive Data Corporation and Trayport, and generating over $1.3 billion in operating cash flows, which enabled us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders.
Consolidated net revenues grew 8% in 2015 versus the prior year. Transaction revenues were flat versus 2014, despite solid growth in our commodities and cash equities market. We grew our data services and listings revenues 26% and 10%, respectively. This solid revenue growth coupled with expense discipline enables adjusted operating margins to expand 4 points over the prior year to 59%. All of these allowed us to deliver $12.15 in adjusted earnings per share, a 26% increase versus 2014.
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll discuss our fourth quarter performance. Revenues of $875 million included $50 million from Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport, which we closed in mid-December. Our revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again driven by strong growth in data and listings. Commodity futures and U.S. cash equities revenues also grew well in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses were $364 million, including $33 million from Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport. Adjusted operating margins were 58%. Our expense discipline and top line revenue growth helped us deliver a record $3.27 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, a 26% year-to-year increase.
Please move to Slide 6, where you can see further delineation of the diverse revenue streams that contributed to our record fourth quarter. While transaction and clearing revenues were flat year-to-year, both commodities and U.S. cash equities grew 3%. It's also worth noting that while total financial revenue declined in the fourth quarter due to lower equity option in CDS revenue, revenue in our interstate futures complex was up 5% versus last year. Data revenues increased 35% in the quarter, including the addition of Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport. Excluding the $50 million in revenue they contributed, our data revenues would still have risen 9%. Finally, listings revenues set another record and was up 8%.
Slide 7 shows revenue mix on the left side of the slide, and on the right, our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses. We provided a pro forma version of this chart, which includes Interactive Data Corp and Trayport for the whole fourth quarter on Slide 18 in the appendix. As shown on the left side of Slide 7, transaction revenues made up 59% of our fourth quarter revenues and data services comprised 29%. On a pro forma basis though, you'll see that data services would've made up 43% of revenues and transaction revenues only 48%. Going forward, we expect data revenues of $470 million to $480 million in the first quarter of 2016, with additional sequential growth as we move through 2016.
I also want to mention that we intend to enhance our financial reporting starting in the first quarter of 2016 when we expect to report 2 business segments, a trading and risk management segment, which includes our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses and a data and listings segment, which includes our subscription-based revenues. We'll provide more detail to ensure that you have good transparency as we make that transition during the first quarter.
Shifting to the right side of the slide, you see the fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $364 million, including $33 million related to Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport. Excluding those expenses, our adjusted operating expenses would've declined 2% year-to-year due to real estate consolidation and further integration of our corporate function. This strong expense management once again reflects an acceleration of the realization of synergy and provides a solid foundation to deliver the remaining synergies related to the combination of ICE, NYSE, Interactive Data Corp. And our other recent acquisitions.
For 2016, we expect operating expenses between $2 billion and $2.03 billion. This includes another $75 million in synergies, which is roughly 1/3 of the total expense reduction we intend to deliver over the next 3 years. The expense guidance also includes approximately $45 million largely related to compensation increases and roughly $30 million from investments in new product development, like the new ICE U.S. Treasury Index series as well as technology upgrades and enhancements to our cybersecurity platform. The rest of our 2016 guidance can be found on Slide 19 in the appendix. We've also included an update regarding our synergy realization on Slide 20 in the appendix. You will see that we ended 2015 with $480 million in realized synergies.
Let's move forward now to Slide 8, where I will review our solid cash generation and capital return for the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash during 2015, which will enable us to invest in growth, fund acquisitions and return $1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Importantly, the cash generative nature of our diverse global business gives us the confidence that we can invest in our business and delever to maintain our strong credit rating while still delivering on our objectives to grow our dividend as we grow. Along those lines, this morning we announced a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend, following the 15% increase we implemented in last year's second quarter. This increase ultimately means that we will pay out 20% more to shareholders in 2016 than we did in 2015 in the form of dividend.
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 9 with a review of our capital structure and return on invested capital. At December 31, we had $627 million in unrestricted cash, including the debt related to the acquisition of Interactive Data Corp., our total debt was $7.3 billion at the end of 2015 and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA was 2.89x. As noted above, we are confident that we can quickly reduce our leverage.
On the right side of the slide, we see our return on invested capital, which was nearly 8.5% in 2015 and remains above our key competitors and above our cost of capital. Our ROIC has steadily improved since closing the NYSE acquisition in 2013 and was on track to approach 10% as we move through 2016. As you would expect though, ROIC will dip as we incorporate our investments in Interactive Data and Trayport. Importantly though, we expect to continue to generate ROIC above our cost of capital and to reestablish the upper trend in the 2017 and beyond.
Our fourth quarter, in 2015 results, are a testament to the focus and execution across our business. We delivered record revenue, strong operating margin expansion, and once again, double-digit earnings growth while continuing to strategically diversify our business to serve our customers' growing demands for information and risk management.
And importantly, we are off to a strong start in our transaction-based businesses in January and expect our data and listings businesses to generate solid growth once again in 2016. This solid revenue base coupled with vigilant expense management should once again enable us to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016.
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

We're pleased to report that 2015 was the best year in our company's history. It was our 10th anniversary as a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and it was our 10th consecutive year of delivering record revenues and record earnings.
I'll take a few minutes to update you on our growth drivers before we move into our question-and-answer session. Starting on Slide 10, which illustrates our unparalleled track record of growth over the last decade. Starting as an over-the-counter energy trading platform then evolving to futures exchanges and clearinghouses, we've now expanded into being a leader in data, connectivity and listings. We've evolved our business model to stay close to our customers' changing needs. And in that process, we've moved from a 90% transaction-based revenue model to a balanced mix of transaction and subscription-based revenues across a diverse range of market and services. Because our team and its culture is central to our strong results, I want to take a moment to highlight the promotions that we announced last week.
Ben Jackson, who previously led ICE Futures U.S. for us, is now our Chief Commercial Officer, where he's leading the integration of our acquisitions to ensure that we meet our targets of ever-increasing results. Ben is deeply steeped in the ICE culture and will help export that important operating philosophy to our new colleagues.
Lynn Martin, our Global Head of Data has expanded her scope to include responsibility for uniting Interactive Data Corporation with the ICE and NYSE data operations. Lynn joined us through the NYSE acquisition were she led Liffe U.S. She's already working closely with the team at Interactive Data to ensure that we benefit from our combined strengths.
Trabue Bland, who is ICE's Vice President of Regulation is now the President of ICE Futures U.S. Trabue has a strong legal and compliance background, and has experience in working with our customers to address regulatory and market issues. These promotions set us up for the next phase of growth by leveraging the deep expertise that we have across our global team.
Turning to Slide 11, you'll find a summary of our diverse growth drivers across a broad range of markets. Many are secular trends and others are organic growth initiatives, but all other results of our customers' changing needs. I'll walk through these in the next few slides starting with the solid performance of our financial markets in 2015.
In our European interest rate markets, we saw significant build in open interest during the year. Rising open interest was coupled with a 30% increase in daily volume in the fourth quarter. And that has continued into 2016, as daily volumes in our rates markets grew 27%. The increased activities in interest rate trading is being driven by customers returning to the market in Europe as central banks are becoming more vocal and action-oriented. While the U.S., U.K. and European central banks maybe on different paths, the changing expectations create dynamic rates and currency environments that drive trading and clearing activity. Also in our financial markets, credit default swap clearing contributed over $100 million of revenue in 2015. This business continues to open new opportunities for us across the swaps clearing landscape, as further mandates across credit and interest rate swaps come into effect later this year.
Slide 12 is a snapshot of the strength of our energy markets. The importance of risk management at all energy price levels is evident, as you can see well into the second year of oil price declines, the depth and breadth of our market along with uncertainty around oil prices and geopolitical events drove record oil revenues, which increased 14% in 2015. And this resulted in the ICE Brent contract achieving its 19th consecutive annual volume record. The strong performance continued into January with daily volume in our oil markets up over 20% for the month, including another record month for ICE Brent crude volumes. We maintain a close dialogue with our customers in the energy markets amidst shifting dynamics of supply and demand and the challenges of declining prices. Expectations for the level of oil prices, the strength of the dollar, central bank actions and global economic trends continue to drive uncertainty and the increasing volumes in our commodities market reflect these conditions. We also continue to grow by introducing new products in new market, such as ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore, which were successfully launched in mid-November.
Now turning to our global data business on Slide 13. You can see the breadth of services that we now provide. Similar to the development of our diverse exchange and clearing operations, the development of our data services business offers a meaningful opportunity to leverage our global network. Our data services provide transparency, information, analysis and connectivity, all of which is consumed by market participants to transact across markets and instruments.
Our customers rely on data, trading and risk management platforms, which are often interdependent across their workflow. And when these services are well coordinated, they create a strong value proposition. While Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, ICE and NYSE data are each strong businesses in their own right, we believe they'll be much more valuable to our customers and to our shareholders on a combined basis.
Our customers' needs are not limited to exchange traded data. The broader market for fixed income is vast and Interactive Data Corporation is centered on the changes taking place in this over-the-counter market. You'll recall that the drivers of our acquisitions are based on newer secular trends. These include the standardization of products for electronic trading and clearing and the need to trade with algorithms and quantitatively driven program. The increased use of technologies is creating demand for data input, including the connectivity to consume this information. And the increased requirements for independent valuation required by financial reform raise the demand for autonomous data.
Finally, the trend towards growing indexation and passive investing as seen in our strong ETF market performance supports the access to data that can be licensed and packaged. We believe the data and data connectivity are deeply linked to the global market that they serve. And in order to lead in customer service and innovation, we're making investments in these areas.
For that, and on Slide 14, I want to provide an update on our early progress with Interactive Data. In January, we began integrating the corporate services functions so that we can move forward, serving our customers as one team. And as a result, we become even more confident about our combination. A great example of our potential together is last week's announcement of the launch of the ICE U.S. Treasury Index family with BlackRock agreeing to transition 4 of its flagship, fixed income iShare ETFs to reference these indices. The new ICE fixed income indices rely on pricing input from Interactive Data. Also yesterday, we announced that AllianceBernstein shows our best execution service to evaluate its fixed income trade execution quality, a service that utilizes the new Interactive Data realtime pricing algorithm. We see further strategic opportunities with both active and passive fund managers by leveraging the strong relationships that we have gained with them at the New York Stock Exchange, and we look forward to continuing to update our investors and our team as this integration progresses.
I'll move now to Slide 15. 2015 was another exciting year for NYSE listings, culminating in record quarterly revenue. We were pleased to welcome great companies like First Data, Square and Ferrari during the fourth quarter. NYSE again led in global proceeds race for the fifth consecutive year. 
Later this month, we expect to begin rolling out the new NYSE Pillar trading platform for our NYSE Arca markets. This is just one example of our commitment to incorporating leading technology into our unique market offerings. I'll also note the strong performance of NYSE Arca, where exchange traded product volume rose 25% in 2015. As the leader in ETF listings, we've undertaken a study to support the long-term growth of the market for our issuers, by identifying improvements to the trading ecosystem.
Last week, we released the study conducted with Mackenzie, outlying a number of proposed market enhancements, many of which are already underway. Our listed customers continue to tell us that they prioritize proper price discovery in their shares over speed as is offered by our designated marketmaker model. Whether through industry coordination or by our own actions, New York Stock Exchange will continue to lead positive change for listed companies and their investors.
Turning to Slide 16, you can see that we're a growth company. In 2015, we grew our top line and our bottom line, and we're growing our dividend as we grow our earnings. ICE is driven by change, which brings opportunities to better serve our customers, and I'd like to pause and thank those customers for their business in 2015. And I look forward to building on our track record with our newly expanded team in this new year.
I'll now turn the call back to today's operator, Rocco, and he'll be happy to moderate your questions."

And the reason I wanted to highlight in my prepared remarks that there are 2 new services that we just put out and we've literally put Lynn Martin in there, a little more than 30 days ago, that demonstrate the kind of thing that we think we can do. With very, very strong synergies with the New York Stock Exchange, the deep relationships that we've gotten over the last couple of years around the NYSE, we've taken our ETF management business and we're combining it with the Interactive Data business. These are businesses that produce realtime pricing in equities and now in fixed income for end-users, for the management of exchange-traded products and the like. And in addition, we mentioned that for nonexchange traded products, we now have the realtime valuation services that are new and robust. And so we feel relatively confident with the thesis on which we made the acquisition.

So the $45 million is kind of what I'll refer to as business as usual investment in our people and investment in the places where we work, et cetera. It's a little bit more than 2% of our overall expense base. That's to be expected plus or minus a point in any given year. These are investments in people that if you look back over the last 3 years, we spent about $90 million delivering almost $300 million in incremental revenue, which is about 70%, just under 70% incremental margin. So we think those are good investments. We think they've proven to be good investments and they're good investments going forward. The $30 million is really more targeted. It's targeted at a lot of things that Jeff talked about in his script, not the least of which was the recent announcement with Interactive Data Corp. on the index that we did with BlackRock. There are also investments in there to further enhance our cybersecurity capabilities. We have always been a technology company. We've always been very focused on information, security and stability of our systems. We design our own systems. We manage our own data centers. And so that's an area where we think the additional investment pays off in the long-term by continuing to provide systems that are up for our customers to do the trading and the risk management that they need to do. So that's how I would generally characterize it. And I think you're exactly right. Those investments are being made against the backdrop of a very diverse set of commodity and Futures & Options product, all of which have strong open interest bases and an expectation that our data and listings businesses will continue to grow."

Well, we've already seen synergies in combining Interactive Data with some of our businesses beyond the indices and execution quality product offerings that I mentioned. Our SuperDerivatives valuation business, which is really designed to value very difficult and complicated contracts is quickly finding synergies with Interactive Data in the customer base where we can package really valuation services together. I think another part of data is how you deliver it and one of the -- the 1 real piece of infrastructure that we kept when we unwound the NYSE technology business was the safety network, which is just what its acronym implies, a very safe network for which, as Scott mentioned, we're increasingly putting more cybersecurity and protections around and the ability to deliver through that network into our data centers. And so we believe that in addition to the product that the delivery mechanism will be a value to our customers as well. So all of that for the 30-or-so days that we've really been focused on it feels pretty good and we've seen some early wins in that regard. I think I've made comments before in public forums that the trend in our industry is for more execution competition. Some of that is happening because regulators are vulcanizing markets by wanting more local regulation particularly at local regulation of the banking sector. And for many years, our industry went electronic and took for granted the fact that we could trade globally. Well, now there are speed bumps around the world as there are reporting requirements and other kinds of things that are fracturing markets. Beyond that, there's actually a trend in Europe that Europe is trying to specifically, potentially fracture markets with MiFID II. And as those markets fracture, the need for putting the information back together on behalf of market participants and having it delivered in a safe manner, that's reliable and timely and what have you, is really where the pocket is going to go and that's where we're skating. And we've amazingly seen some very, very early signs of success just in a few short number of days."

We expect that it will begin rolling out in the next few weeks. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to start with the Arca platform. The early results of that is that is a very, very predictable, reliable and fast platform that it's simple and easy to understand. Our experience in the derivatives market have suggested that, that is a winning formula for people that honestly just have predictability of how our markets going to operate, and then can make their own investments and build their own systems and tools around that predictable nature. We're not going to change any pricing. I mean, that market is a highly competitive market and prices continue to be adjusted by competitors and peers and others and we'll respond to that, but we feel pretty good at rolling out Pillar. We think it's going to be a dramatic improvement with the same value proposition. We do -- we have seen business in 2015 in our mind lead the dark pool market and come back to listed trading. And NYSE has gotten -- it's above its fair share of that market movement. And if you look at the market share trends, they're very, very positive for NYSE and that's with our own legacy platforms. So we feel pretty good moving into '16. It will take a while to put everything on Pillar. We're going to be relatively slow and deliberate as we found out this summer when the New York Stock Exchange had an outage, it's a major market disruption for the markets. And so we have a heightened sense of caution, if you will, that we recognize the high place that we hold in the ecosystem. And so we're going to be deliberate, but the system looks good and is ready to go."

In my mind, a lot of the opportunity set that we're seeing really comes from the fact that the buy side was able to rely on certain services that came from the global banking industry, that were relatively casual and informal. But today, due to regulatory reform and internal audit practices, we need to be more rigorous. So, for example, it might have been perfectly acceptable a few years ago to call a bank counterparty and ask what they think -- what you think the mark should be on a particular instrument and rely on that. Today, the regulators and the auditors wanted independent validation. Increasingly, as people are taking the obligation to get best execution, seriously as the SEC is paying more attention to best ex requirements in the fixed income space, asset managers and other are making investments to make sure that they are compliant and that they are able to represent for end-users that they're using best practices. So it's a relatively new market as you probably know. The fixed income space is evolving. Some of these things that I mentioned are really just the tip of the iceberg. In other words, they haven't really resulted in formal rulemakings or obligations, but people see them coming and are getting ahead of them. So we think it's a very early days and a big market. We have always had some execution capabilities in the fixed income space because of our Creditex acquisition. A lot of people that do credit default swaps, do underlying bond, transactions, so we have a very good dialogue with a lot of end-users, people that are in the market every day. And we're exploiting all of those channels right now, and Lynn Martin and her team are working to organize that up so that we can speak with 1 voice. In terms of how we charge form. It's pretty early days right now. We're having a lot of conversations. As you probably know, the passive index managers are very, very price competitive with one another, particularly for relatively standardized pools of trading. And so they're looking for how they can best manage the services that go in to supporting that. We're pretty familiar with that. We've been talking to them around NYSE Arca and their listing activities for years. And so we want to be -- we want to put a compelling package together for them that is value-added for our shareholders. And so we're having a lot of conversations about how to do that, how to partner with these guys to give them a better offering, but still return great returns for our shareholders. So early days yet, but we'll probably have more to say about it and Scott will have to figure out a way to talk to you about that, so that you have some predictability and metrics as we go forward."

Our thought really is to bring our culture into it, which is ""Okay, how do we innovate off of that and provide more products and services and higher value to those end users?"" Because what we've always seen in data is that if we provide more value then people are happy to pay more for it. We have never really -- and I think you know that about us, we don't go in and just jack up prices, per se. Our philosophy is, let's give people a better package and then they'll be happy to pay for it. And so in that regard, we don't get a lot of pushback on our pricing and yet we've been able to really raise the profitability of these businesses. The AllianceBernstein product that I mentioned in the prepared remarks is based off of the realtime bond pricing platform, which is new. It's something that Interactive Data had under construction at the time we acquired it. We're working to accelerate that and to get more and more instruments and more sophistication around that. And we think there's a number of different channels where that can be deployed. Right now, obviously, the AllianceBernstein deal is a deployment that results in financial gain for us, but that data is floating around the ecosystem right now in a relatively uncoordinated way, and people are starting to rely on it, and we're going to figure out how to better channel that and monetize it for our shareholders."

The data in many of those indices belongs to Interactive Data. And the history, if you will, also belongs to Interactive Data. So we believe customers who are benchmarking to indices, it's going to be important if they have some continuity in their marketing materials and to the way they talk to their investors and their board. And so at this moment in time, we have no reason to believe that those indices aren't going to continue to be anything other than a customer to us. There's a lot of index activity in the fixed income space. It's an unbelievably large space in terms of number of instruments and issuance and the global nature of the debt markets around the world. So the various fund managers are providing lots of different instruments to allow investors to participate in those markets.

I will say that there are a lot of interesting parts and pieces in the businesses that you just described that we want to take a hard look at to see where they might fit with other things we do before we make any kind of decisions on their long-term deployment, and that's what Ben is doing with us. I think what's been interesting about the NYSE is that it fits so nicely now with the Interactive Data, as we've mentioned, the systems that we need to run ETFs inside the NYSE are highly complementary with Interactive Data. The sale of data, the way we move marshal data around, having the New York Stock Exchange data is a door opener for our sales force. It's -- obviously, we can easily help people price equities, having our commodity data in this era where there's tremendous conversation at all levels of boardrooms about commodities. All that package together is really valuable. So New York Stock Exchange, while it may have a different name -- and other than, it's not cold ICE, the reality is that company is being integrated in a way that is really raising our earnings capabilities across the firm. And not the least of which is that New York Stock Exchange is a cash generative business that fits in the United States so that we get U.S. cash, which is allowing us to quickly pay down debt and delever, and will allow us to return capital to shareholders faster. We are in an -- we are global company with an enviable position and that we're not struggling to figure out how to move money around the world in order to return capital to shareholders. And so it's paid some very, very strong and interesting dividends that I think is really working for the firm right now. And not -- by the way, it's convenient for people to write about the New York Stock Exchange -- not you, Rich, but for people to write about the New York Stock Exchange to say, ""It once had 85% market share and now it only has 25% market share."" Woe is me. The reality is that last year was the highest earnings of the New York Stock Exchange in its over 225-year history. And this month, I suspect that this is probably one of the highest earnings months in its history. It's a company that is doing incredibly well from a financial standpoint. And I think as we continue to shed legacy platform and simplify it and make it better and easier to understand and more approachable to investors and listed companies, that it's going to continue to do well. Notwithstanding the fact that it is in a highly competitive environment with very strong competitors. But it's been doing very well and it is not a business that we would want to see leave our portfolio."

And so I can go in or other senior people at ICE are meeting with people at the highest levels of those asset managers and having holistic conversations about how we could work better together to overall help them meet their regulatory obligations, to do a better job for their investing public and manage their cost in a way that's predictable that keeps them competitive with one another. So my point is, I think that is such a strong value proposition for us and, such an interesting thing for those managers that conversations are happening at levels above your typical salesperson. It's easy once that door is open for us to figure out creative ways of packaging things and we've just started this. But so far have been very, very well received and actually had some inbound calls from people saying, ""Can you come in here and let's sit down and talk about how we might work better together.""

And as an investor, I don't think you care whether the dollar is saved. You just care that the dollars get saved. So that's how we're going to be thinking about it and talking about it as we move forward, $220 million to go as we enter '16, 1/3 done this year."

Perfect. And then just a follow-up question. As I turn to regulation, just around MiFID II, around the possibly of some of these large commodity trading firms, including many of your customers potentially getting caught under the scoop of MiFID II and being forced to hold more capital, so it just seems like we're on this weird period of limbo. We're waiting to see how long weird will be laid. I just want to get your thoughts on the delay, when do you think the delay gives your customers more time to speak with regulators? And if you generally feel more confident that the delay would lead to a bit more practical and workable regulation?"
1081952,316157990,926746,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Executives","Well, the short answer is exactly what you said is yes. One of the things that we've seen now is that when MiFID II was passed, I got the sense that politicians went and asked their constituents, ""Would you like to have everything unbundled? Would you lik",463,"Well, the short answer is exactly what you said is yes. One of the things that we've seen now is that when MiFID II was passed, I got the sense that politicians went and asked their constituents, ""Would you like to have everything unbundled? Would you like to be able to choose where you trade, and where you clear and where you buy research and have complete choice in what you do."" and everybody said yes. Would you like to make sure that the banks are not cornering markets and taking a speculative position that drive prices the wrong way? People said yes. And the question that wasn't asked is, ""How was that actually going to impact the market and what is it going to cost you?"" And now that the regulation is out there, people are looking at it and saying, ""Oh my gosh."" It's going to fragment markets, it's going to drive up my cost, it's going to limit -- potentially it will make it more difficult for me to hedge, it may move markets to other jurisdictions. And so there is a much more active dialogue going on around MiFID II in not just the areas that I described being in totality of the bill. And I would say to you that Lord Hill, who was the Finance Minister there or the Infrastructure Minister that's overseeing financial services is got an open ear and wants them -- my impression is that he wants to make these markets work. And it is much more impactful in the dialogue when the ultimate end-users go in and talk about their concerns than it is when exchanges and brokers and infrastructure providers go in, because we look to the politicians like we're just trying to protect our interest, when in reality, they're starting to hear these kinds of issues from the end-users. And so obviously, it has slowed down and part of the reason that it is slowed down is that there is an active dialogue going on around it as to how to improve the language and make it work. And so in that regard, I relatively hopeful and respectful that the bill will get better with time. It's hard to know when it will actually be implemented. Some of these things require investment and not just investment by the industry but also investment by government in order to monitor and maintain some of these things. So until Europe has landed on a specific set of language, the people can understand and then figure out a timetable on how it can be implemented, it's hard to know exactly what the timing is. But the good news is that there is an active dialogue and it's pretty broad and involving lots of different constituencies."

That creation has clearly struck a chord given the overall response throughout the comment period. I guess, however, out of all the comment letters, there's really only a handful that have come out against IEX apart from competitors in large market making firms, such as Citadel. So I guess the question is, what are the majority of people missing from a fairness perspective? Is it just a rule base as defined by Reg NMS? Or do you think scrapping IEX registered exchange status will damage market structure?

NYSE does not have any kind of speed bump, any kind of artificial delays. I just want to correct one thing in your question. NYSE and ICE are not against IEX becoming a regulated exchange. And in fact, the National Stock Exchange recently had an application became a stock exchange, and we were not against that. What our concern is, is that there is a law on the books that requires that NYSE and all other regulated exchanges deliver our results as soon as technically practicable, and we've been held to that standard for years. And what IEX is asking is for an exemption that would solely be for IEX, not for the industry, solely IEX would be the only one that would be exempted from that law. And IEX is attempting to patent the system that is seeking to exempt. So it is looking for the ability to have a regulated monopoly status that the other exchanges do not have. And so we -- I have advocated that and worked behind the scenes with lots of people to say we should take a look at market structure, we should look at slowing down. The ideas that they're promulgating are not bad ideas at all, but the methods that they're going about it, we are objecting to. This is solely for their benefit and not for the benefit of the industry. And frankly, if that were to go forward, IEX would actually hurt the other people in the industry. Normally, when there's innovation, the innovation helps people, but it doesn't actually hurt the people that are left behind. And so that is our objection, that's what we want the SEC to take a hard look at. If the industry can come together and work on our change to Reg NMS, we would be very supportive. If the SEC wants our support or needs our help in changing Reg NMS to allow things to slow down to change the way the data moves around, to change the obligation of exchanges, we're all in for that. But not a one-off deal that benefits somebody that's trying to patent and receive a regulated monopoly. And I don't think it's fair. I just don't think it's -- it is un-American and it's not fair, and it's not the way that our systems should work."

And while you mentioned 1 competitor, there are others that are all coming at this because it's a growing area of business. And in a competitive space, people are looking to get their market share. One thing that we've heard from many of the ETFs sponsors is they like, frankly, the competition; they feel it's benefiting them. And secondly that they do want to have some diversity of providers. In case there is a technical problem or some other structural problems so that they have tested other systems and would be able to move business around quickly. So some of it is really just -- some of the movements that you see is really people doing a BCP planning so that because these franchises are becoming ever more important. And so we understand and actually help some people to do that because we want to be able to have them -- have those businesses, those that can move our way. The -- I don't know what to say other than it is not particularly expensive to list an ETF. You're talking about things in the sense of $25,000 a year or less. So while it is highly competitive, that is really not the metric that is going to allow an ETF provider of any size and scale to determine where to list. And what I'm investing in, what you can see us doing is really improving the package of services that we can have to literally partner with these firms, to be part of their workflow and to make life easy for them because we understand this business, and even more so now in the fixed income space. And we are an advocate for them and want to continue to be an advocate with public policy and with their marketing and sales effort that goes way beyond what that $25,000 investment would have for an ETF. So we feel good about our positioning, but it's certainly competitive."

So it hasn't -- that phenomena had not led to a decrease in a number of customers that actually led to more interest than an increase in the number of customers. I think more people are paying attention to those prices and trying to figure out when to lock in low prices or whether or not they're going to be high prices. And so there's a lot of trading activity. Open interest as you know from covering this for a long time, I'm sure that open interest in certain commodities, particularly in oil, will go up and down with the steepness of the curve. It it back predates or goes into contango, there are different Kerry economics that go on, that affect open interest but actually accelerate trading, which is what we care about. So we care about our open interest and we monitor it and we'll watch it and use it as a predictor, but you have to look at it in context with -- is the curve getting flatter or steeper. And so we are very, very comfortable right now that, that is still a growing franchise. And as I mentioned, we have record volumes in January, and there's tremendous interest in energy, commodity space globally right now. We would expect that growth to continue."

I'll begin on Slide 4 which highlights another record year in 2015. Our 10th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings. 
During the year, we delivered strong volume growth in our global commodities business, double-digit revenue growth in data and listings, synergy realization ahead of faith, margin expansion, outstanding earnings growth and strong returns on invested capital. And we delivered these results while investing in our diverse global businesses, making strategic acquisitions of Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport, and generating over $1.3 billion in operating cash flows, which enabled us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders.
Consolidated net revenues grew 8% in 2015 versus the prior year. Transaction revenues were flat versus 2014, despite solid growth in our commodities and cash equities market. We grew our data services and listings revenues 26% and 10%, respectively. This solid revenue growth coupled with expense discipline enabled adjusted operating margins to expand 4 points over the prior year to 59%. All of this allowed us to deliver $12.15 in adjusted earnings per share, a 26% increase versus 2014.
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll discuss our fourth quarter performance. Revenues of $875 million included $50 million from Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport, which we closed in mid-December. Our revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again driven by strong growth in data and listings. Commodity futures and U.S. cash equities revenues also grew well in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses were $364 million, including $33 million from Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport. Adjusted operating margins were 58%. Our expense discipline and top line revenue growth helped us deliver a record $3.27 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, a 26% year-to-year increase.
Please move to Slide 6, where you can see further delineation of the diverse revenue streams that contributed to our record fourth quarter. While transaction and clearing revenues were flat year-to-year, both commodities and U.S. cash equities grew 3%. It's also worth noting that while total financial revenue declined in the fourth quarter due to lower equity option in CDS revenue, revenue in our interstate futures complex was up 5% versus last year. Data revenues increased 35% in the quarter, including the addition of Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport. Excluding the $50 million in revenue they contributed, our data revenues would still have risen 9%. Finally, listings revenues set another record and was up 8%.
Slide 7 shows revenue mix on the left side of the slide, and on the right, our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses. We provided a pro forma version of this chart, which includes Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport for the full fourth quarter on Slide 18 in the appendix. As shown on the left side of Slide 7, transaction revenues made up 59% of our fourth quarter revenues and data services comprised 29%. On a pro forma basis, though, you'll see that data services would've made up 43% of revenues and transaction revenues only 48%. Going forward, we expect data revenues of $470 million to $480 million in the first quarter of 2016, with additional sequential growth as we move through 2016.
I also want to mention that we intend to enhance our financial reporting starting in the first quarter of 2016 when we expect to report 2 business segments, a trading and risk management segment, which includes our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses and a data and listings segment, which includes our subscription-based revenues. We'll provide more detail to ensure that you have good transparency as we make that transition during the first quarter.
Shifting to the right side of the slide, you see the fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $364 million, including $33 million related to Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport. Excluding those expenses, our adjusted operating expenses would've declined 2% year-to-year due to real estate consolidation and further integration of our corporate function. This strong expense management once again reflects an acceleration of the realization of synergy and provides a solid foundation to deliver the remaining synergies related to the combination of ICE, NYSE, Interactive Data Corp. and our other recent acquisitions.
For 2016, we expect operating expenses between $2 billion and $2.03 billion. This includes another $75 million in synergies, which is roughly 1/3 of the total expense reduction we intend to deliver over the next 3 years. The expense guidance also includes approximately $45 million largely related to compensation increases and roughly $30 million from investments in new product development, like the new ICE U.S. Treasury Index series as well as technology upgrades and enhancements to our cybersecurity platform. The rest of our 2016 guidance can be found on Slide 19 in the appendix. We've also included an update regarding our synergy realization on Slide 20 in the appendix where you will see that we ended 2015 with $480 million in realized synergies.
Let's move forward now to Slide 8, where I will review our solid cash generation and capital return for the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash during 2015, which will enable us to invest in growth, fund acquisitions and return $1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Importantly, the cash generative nature of our diverse global business gives us the confidence that we can invest in our business and delever to maintain our strong credit rating while still delivering on our objectives to grow our dividend as we grow. Along those lines, this morning we announced a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend, following the 15% increase we implemented in last year's second quarter. This increase ultimately means that we will pay out 20% more to shareholders in 2016 than we did in 2015 in the form of dividend.
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 9 with a review of our capital structure and return on invested capital. At December 31, we had $627 million in unrestricted cash. Including the debt related to the acquisition of Interactive Data Corp., our total debt was $7.3 billion at the end of 2015 and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA was 2.89x. As noted above, we are confident that we can quickly reduce our leverage.
On the right side of the slide, you see our return on invested capital, which was nearly 8.5% in 2015 and remains above our key competitors and above our cost of capital. Our ROIC has steadily improved since closing the NYSE acquisition in 2013 and was on track to approach 10% as we move through 2016. As you would expect, though, ROIC will dip as we incorporate our investments in Interactive Data and Trayport. Importantly though, we expect to continue to generate ROIC above our cost of capital and to reestablish the upper trend into 2017 and beyond.
Our fourth quarter, and 2015 results, are a testament to the focus and execution across our business. We delivered record revenue, strong operating margin expansion, and once again, double-digit earnings growth while continuing to strategically diversify our business to serve our customers' growing demands for information and risk management.
And importantly, we are off to a strong start in our transaction-based businesses in January and expect our data and listings businesses to generate solid growth once again in 2016. This solid revenue base coupled with vigilant expense management should once again enable us to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016.
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

We're pleased to report that 2015 was the best year in our company's history. It was our 10th anniversary as a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and it was our 10th consecutive year of delivering record revenues and record earnings.
I'll take a few minutes to update you on our growth drivers before we move into our question-and-answer session. Starting on Slide 10, which illustrates our unparalleled track record of growth over the last decade. Starting as an over-the-counter energy trading platform then evolving to futures exchanges and clearinghouses, we've now expanded into being a leader in data, connectivity and listings. We've evolved our business model to stay close to our customers' changing needs. And in that process, we've moved from a 90% transaction-based revenue model to a balanced mix of transaction and subscription-based revenues across a diverse range of markets and services. Because our team and its culture is central to our strong results, I want to take a moment to highlight the promotions that we announced last week.
Ben Jackson, who previously led ICE Futures U.S. for us, is now our Chief Commercial Officer, where he's leading the integration of our acquisitions to ensure that we meet our targets of ever-increasing results. Ben is deeply steeped in the ICE culture and will help export that important operating philosophy to our new colleagues.
Lynn Martin, our Global Head of Data has expanded her scope to include responsibility for uniting Interactive Data Corporation with the ICE and NYSE data operations. Lynn joined us through the NYSE acquisition were she led Liffe U.S. She's already working closely with the team at Interactive Data to ensure that we benefit from our combined strengths.
Trabue Bland, who is ICE's Vice President of Regulation is now the President of ICE Futures U.S. Trabue has a strong legal and compliance background, and has experience in working with our customers to address regulatory and market issues. These promotions set us up for the next phase of growth by leveraging the deep expertise that we have across our global team.
Turning to Slide 11, you'll find a summary of our diverse growth drivers across a broad range of markets. Many are secular trends and others are organic growth initiatives, but all are the results of our customers' changing needs. I'll walk through these in the next few slides starting with the solid performance of our financial markets in 2015.
In our European interest rate markets, we saw significant build in open interest during the year. Rising open interest was coupled with a 30% increase in daily volume in the fourth quarter. And that has continued into 2016, as daily volumes in our rates markets grew 27%. The increased activities in interest rate trading is being driven by customers returning to the market in Europe as central banks are becoming more vocal and action-oriented. While the U.S., U.K. and European central banks may be on different paths, the changing expectations create dynamic rates and currency environments that drive trading and clearing activity. Also in our financial markets, credit default swap clearing contributed over $100 million of revenue in 2015. This business continues to open new opportunities for us across the swaps clearing landscape, as further mandates across credit and interest rate swaps come into effect later this year.
Slide 12 is a snapshot of the strength of our energy markets. The importance of risk management at all energy price levels is evident, as you can see well into the second year of oil price declines, the depth and breadth of our market along with uncertainty around oil prices and geopolitical events drove record oil revenues, which increased 14% in 2015. And this resulted in the ICE Brent contract achieving its 19th consecutive annual volume record. The strong performance continued into January with daily volume in our oil markets up over 20% for the month, including another record month for ICE Brent crude volumes. We maintain a close dialogue with our customers in the energy markets amidst shifting dynamics of supply and demand and the challenges of declining prices. Expectations for the level of oil prices, the strength of the dollar, central bank actions and global economic trends continue to drive uncertainty and the increasing volumes in our commodities market reflect these conditions. We also continue to grow by introducing new products in new market, such as ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore, which were successfully launched in mid-November.
Now turning to our global data business on Slide 13. You can see the breadth of services that we now provide. Similar to the development of our diverse exchange and clearing operations, the development of our data services business offers a meaningful opportunity to leverage our global network. Our data services provide transparency, information, analysis and connectivity, all of which is consumed by market participants to transact across markets and instruments.
Our customers rely on data, trading and risk management platforms, which are often interdependent across their workflow. And when these services are well coordinated, they create a strong value proposition. While Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, ICE and NYSE data are each strong businesses in their own right, we believe they'll be much more valuable to our customers and to our shareholders on a combined basis.
Our customers' needs are not limited to exchange traded data. The broader market for fixed income is vast and Interactive Data Corporation is centered on the changes taking place in this over-the-counter market. You'll recall that the drivers of our acquisitions are based on newer secular trends. These include the standardization of products for electronic trading and clearing and the need to trade with algorithms and quantitatively driven programs. The increased use of technologies is creating demand for data input, including the connectivity to consume this information. And the increased requirements for independent valuation required by financial reform raise the demand for autonomous data.
Finally, the trend towards growing indexation and passive investing as seen in our strong ETF market performance supports the access to data that can be licensed and packaged. We believe the data and data connectivity are deeply linked to the global market that they serve. And in order to lead in customer service and innovation, we're making investments in these areas.
For that, and on Slide 14, I want to provide an update on our early progress with Interactive Data. In January, we began integrating the corporate services functions so that we can move forward, serving our customers as one team. And as a result, we become even more confident about our combination. A great example of our potential together is last week's announcement of the launch of the ICE U.S. Treasury Index family with BlackRock agreeing to transition 4 of its flagship, fixed income iShare ETFs to reference these indices. The new ICE fixed income indices rely on pricing input from Interactive Data. Also yesterday, we announced that AllianceBernstein chose our best execution service to evaluate its fixed income trade execution quality, a service that utilizes the new Interactive Data realtime pricing algorithm. We see further strategic opportunities with both active and passive fund managers by leveraging the strong relationships that we have gained with them at the New York Stock Exchange, and we look forward to continuing to update our investors and our team as this integration progresses.
I'll move now to Slide 15. 2015 was another exciting year for NYSE listings, culminating in record quarterly revenue. We were pleased to welcome great companies like First Data, Square and Ferrari during the fourth quarter. NYSE again led in global proceeds raised for the fifth consecutive year. 
Later this month, we expect to begin rolling out the new NYSE Pillar trading platform for our NYSE Arca markets. This is just one example of our commitment to incorporating leading technology into our unique market offerings. I'll also note the strong performance of NYSE Arca, where exchange-traded product volume rose 25% in 2015. As the leader in ETF listings, we've undertaken a study to support the long-term growth of the market for our issuers, by identifying improvements to the trading ecosystem.
Last week, we released the study conducted with Mackenzie, outlying a number of proposed market enhancements, many of which are already underway. Our listed customers continue to tell us that they prioritize proper price discovery in their shares over speed as is offered by our designated marketmaker model. Whether through industry coordination or by our own actions, New York Stock Exchange will continue to lead positive change for listed companies and their investors.
Turning to Slide 16, you can see that we're a growth company. In 2015, we grew our top line and our bottom line, and we're growing our dividend as we grow our earnings. ICE is driven by change, which brings opportunities to better serve our customers, and I'd like to pause and thank those customers for their business in 2015. And I look forward to building on our track record with our newly expanded team in this new year.
I'll now turn the call back to today's operator, Rocco, and he'll be happy to moderate your questions."

IDC tends to typically sign longer-term agreements that have some kind of escalator in them and has a very, very high renewal rate, well above 90% on -- by any measure of renewal. And so that part of the revenue is really almost an annuity-type business. What we're working on and have the team working on now is really expanding the scope of services and expanding the footprint and customer base and we feel pretty confident that we're going to significantly increase the revenue growth and earnings potential of that company by new products, new services, new geographies and what have you. And the reason I wanted to highlight in my prepared remarks that there are 2 new services that we just put out and we've literally put Lynn Martin in there, a little more than 30 days ago, that demonstrate the kind of thing that we think we can do. With very, very strong synergies with the New York Stock Exchange, the deep relationships that we've gotten over the last couple of years around the NYSE, we've taken our ETF management business and we're combining it with the Interactive Data business. These are businesses that produce realtime pricing in equities and now in fixed income for end-users, for the management of exchange-traded products and the like. And in addition, we mentioned that for nonexchange-traded products, we now have the realtime valuation services that are new and robust. And so we feel relatively confident with the thesis on which we made the acquisition. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're actually more confident now that we've started to put our teams together and unlock our customer relationships."

So the $45 million is kind of what I'll refer to as business as usual investment in our people and investment in the places where we work, et cetera. It's a little bit more than 2% of our overall expense base. That's to be expected plus or minus a point in any given year. These are investments in people that if you look back over the last 3 years, we spent about $90 million delivering almost $300 million in incremental revenue, which is about 70%, just under 70% incremental margin. So we think those are good investments. We think they've proven to be good investments and they're good investments going forward. The $30 million is really more targeted. It's targeted at a lot of things that Jeff talked about in his script, not the least of which was the recent announcement with Interactive Data Corp. on the index that we did with BlackRock. There are also investments in there to further enhance our cybersecurity capabilities. We have always been a technology company. We've always been very focused on information, security and stability of our systems. We design our own systems. We manage our own data centers. And so that's an area where we think the additional investment pays off in the long-term by continuing to provide systems that are up for our customers to do the trading and the risk management that they need to do. So that's how I would generally characterize it. And I think you're exactly right. Those investments are being made against the backdrop of a very diverse set of commodity and Futures & Options product, all of which have strong open interest bases and an expectation that our data and listings businesses will continue to grow."

Well, we've already seen synergies in combining Interactive Data with some of our businesses beyond the indices and execution quality product offerings that I mentioned. Our SuperDerivatives valuation business, which is really designed to value very difficult and complicated contracts is quickly finding synergies with Interactive Data in the customer base where we can package really valuation services together. I think another part of data is how you deliver it and one of the -- the 1 real piece of infrastructure that we kept when we unwound the NYSE technology business was the safety network, which is just what its acronym implies, a very safe network for which, as Scott mentioned, we're increasingly putting more cybersecurity and protections around and the ability to deliver through that network into our data centers. And so we believe that in addition to the product that the delivery mechanism will be a value to our customers as well. So all of that for the 30-or-so days that we've really been focused on it feels pretty good and we've seen some early wins in that regard. I think I've made comments before in public forums that the trend in our industry is for more execution competition. Some of that is happening because regulators are vulcanizing markets by wanting more local regulation particularly at local regulation of the banking sector. And for many years, our industry went electronic and took for granted the fact that we could trade globally. Well, now there are speed bumps around the world as there are reporting requirements and other kinds of things that are fracturing markets. Beyond that, there's actually a trend in Europe that Europe is trying to specifically, potentially fracture markets with MiFID II. And as those markets fracture, the need for putting the information back together on behalf of market participants and having it delivered in a safe manner, that's reliable and timely and what have you, is really where the puck is going to go and that's where we're skating. And we've amazingly seen some very, very early signs of success just in a few short number of days."

We expect that it will begin rolling out in the next few weeks. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to start with the Arca platform. The early results of that is that is a very, very predictable, reliable and fast platform that is simple and easy to understand. Our experience in the derivatives market have suggested that, that is a winning formula for people that honestly just have predictability of how our market's going to operate, and then can make their own investments and build their own systems and tools around that predictable nature. We're not going to change any pricing. I mean, that market is a highly competitive market and prices continue to be adjusted by competitors and peers and others and we'll respond to that, but we feel pretty good at rolling out Pillar. We think it's going to be a dramatic improvement for the same value proposition. We do -- we have seen business in 2015 in our mind lead the dark pool market and come back to listed trading. And NYSE has gotten -- it's above its fair share of that market movement. And if you look at the market share trends, they're very, very positive for NYSE and that's with our old legacy platforms. So we feel pretty good moving into '16. It will take a while to put everything on Pillar. We're going to be relatively slow and deliberate as we found out this summer when the New York Stock Exchange had an outage, it's a major market disruption for the markets. And so we have a heightened sense of caution, if you will, that we recognize the high place that we hold in the ecosystem. And so we're going to be deliberate, but the system looks good and is ready to go."

In my mind, a lot of the opportunity set that we're seeing really comes from the fact that the buy side was able to rely on certain services that came from the global banking industry, that were relatively casual and informal. But today, due to regulatory reform and internal audit practices, we need to be more rigorous. So, for example, it might have been perfectly acceptable a few years ago to call a bank counterparty and ask what they think -- what you think the mark should be on a particular instrument and rely on that. Today, the regulators and the auditors want an independent validation. Increasingly, as people are taking the obligation to get best execution, seriously as the SEC is paying more attention to best ex requirements in the fixed income space, asset managers and other are making investments to make sure that they are compliant and that they are able to represent to the end-users that they're using best practices. So it's a relatively new market as you probably know. The fixed income space is evolving. Some of these things that I mentioned are really just the tip of the iceberg. In other words, they haven't really resulted in formal rulemakings or obligations, but people see them coming and are getting ahead of them. So we think it's very early days and a big market. We have always had some execution capabilities in the fixed income space because of our Creditex acquisition. A lot of people that do credit default swaps, do underlying bond transactions, so we have a very good dialogue with a lot of end-users, people that are in the market every day. And we're exploiting all of those channels right now, and Lynn Martin and her team are working to organize that up so that we can speak with 1 voice. In terms of how we charge form. It's pretty early days right now. We're having a lot of conversations. As you probably know, the passive index managers are very, very price competitive with one another, particularly for relatively standardized pools of trading. And so they're looking for how they can best manage the services that go in to supporting that. We're pretty familiar with that. We've been talking to them around NYSE Arca and their listing activities for years. And so we want to be -- we want to put a compelling package together for them that is value-added for our shareholders. And so we're having a lot of conversations about how to do that, how to partner with these guys to give them a better offering, but still return great returns for our shareholders. So early days yet, but we'll probably have more to say about it and Scott will have to figure out a way to talk to you about that, so that you have some predictability and metrics as we go forward."

We have never really -- and I think you know that about us, we don't go in and just jack up prices, per se. Our philosophy is, let's give people a better package and then they'll be happy to pay for it. And so in that regard, we don't get a lot of pushback on our pricing and yet we've been able to really raise the profitability of these businesses. The AllianceBernstein product that I mentioned in the prepared remarks is based off of the realtime bond pricing platform, which is new. It's something that Interactive Data had under construction at the time we acquired it. We're working to accelerate that and to get more and more instruments and more sophistication around that. And we think there's a number of different channels where that can be deployed. Right now, obviously, the AllianceBernstein deal is a deployment that results in financial gain for us, but that data is floating around the ecosystem right now in a relatively uncoordinated way, and people are starting to rely on it, and we're going to figure out how to better channel that and monetize it for our shareholders."

The data in many of those indices belongs to Interactive Data. And the history, if you will, also belongs to Interactive Data. So we believe customers who are benchmarking to indices, it's going to be important that they have some continuity in their marketing materials and to the way they talk to their investors and their boards. And so at this moment in time, we have no reason to believe that those indices aren't going to continue to be anything other than a customer to us. There's a lot of index activity in the fixed income space. It's an unbelievably large space in terms of number of instruments and issuance and the global nature of the debt markets around the world. So the various fund managers are providing lots of different instruments to allow investors to participate in those markets.

And that work is just starting. So we don't have anything to say right now. I will say that there are a lot of interesting parts and pieces in the businesses that you just described that we want to take a hard look at to see where they might fit with other things we do before we make any kind of decisions on their long-term deployment, and that's what Ben is doing with us. I think what's been interesting about the NYSE is that it fits so nicely now with the Interactive Data, as we've mentioned, the systems that we need to run ETFs inside the NYSE are highly complementary with Interactive Data. The sale of data, the way we move marshal data around, having the New York Stock Exchange data is a door opener for our sales force. It's -- obviously, we can easily help people price equities, having our commodity data in this era where there's tremendous conversation at all levels of boardrooms about commodities. All that packaged together is really valuable. So New York Stock Exchange, while it may have a different name -- and other than, it's not called ICE, the reality is that company is being integrated in a way that is really raising our earnings capabilities across the firm. And not the least of which is that New York Stock Exchange is a cash generative business that sits in the United States so that we get U.S. cash, which is allowing us to quickly pay down debt and delever, and will allow us to return capital to shareholders faster. We are in an -- we are global company with an enviable position in that we're not struggling to figure out how to move money around the world in order to return capital to shareholders. And so it's paid some very, very strong and interesting dividends that I think is really working for the firm right now. And not -- by the way, it's convenient for people to write about the New York Stock Exchange -- not you, Rich, but for people to write about the New York Stock Exchange to say, ""It once had 85% market share and now it only has 25% market share. Woe is me."" The reality is that last year was the highest earnings of the New York Stock Exchange in its over 225-year history. And this month, I suspect that this is probably one of the highest earnings months in its history. It's a company that is doing incredibly well from a financial standpoint. And I think as we continue to shed legacy platforms and simplify it and make it better and easier to understand and more approachable to investors and listed companies, that it's going to continue to do well.

You're providing the index, the listings, the trading, even some of the trading data. So that I'm assuming it provides you a lot of leverage in multiple areas. So it sounds like the licensing side is probably the more competitive pressure point. I guess when you're having the conversations with firms, like asset managers, are they actually structured from a sales perspective where they can talk holistically about the business thinking across those things, so the packages really resonate with them where you could maybe use listings as a loss leader to help on the index side or on the trading side over time? Or is that going to be something that probably takes time for them to get up to speed on?"

And there are -- the way to -- for those managers to do well with growing AUM is to make sure that they manage their cost. And so that sentiment is at the highest level of those firms. And so I can go in or other senior people at ICE are meeting with people at the highest levels of those asset managers and having holistic conversations about how we could work better together to overall help them meet their regulatory obligations, to do a better job for their investing public and manage their cost in a way that's predictable that keeps them competitive with one another. So my point is, I think that is such a strong value proposition for us and, such an interesting thing for those managers that conversations are happening at levels above your typical salesperson. It's easy once that door is open for us to figure out creative ways of packaging things and we've just started this. But so far have been very, very well received and actually had some inbound calls from people saying, ""Can you come in here and let's sit down and talk about how we might work better together."" And we're lucky that the New York Stock Exchange and the people around Arca have done a very good job of managing the listings of those companies so they've built a track record of knowledge that we can lever off of."

Perfect. And then just a follow-up question. As I turn to regulation, just around MiFID II, around the possibly of some of these large commodity trading firms, including many of your customers potentially getting caught under the scope of MiFID II and being forced to hold more capital, so it just seems like we're in this weird period of limbo. We're waiting to see how long MiFID II will be delayed. I just want to get your thoughts on the delay, when do you think the delay gives your customers more time to speak with regulators? And if you generally feel more confident that the delay would lead to a bit more practical and workable regulation?"

One of the things that we've seen now is that when MiFID II was passed, I got the sense that politicians went and asked their constituents, ""Would you like to have everything unbundled? Would you like to be able to choose where you trade, and where you clear and where you buy research and have complete choice in what you do."" And everybody said yes. Would you like to make sure that the banks are not cornering markets and taking a speculative position that drive prices the wrong way? People said yes. And the question that wasn't asked is, ""How was that actually going to impact the market and what is it going to cost you?"" And now that the regulation is out there, people are looking at it and saying, ""Oh my gosh."" It's going to fragment markets, it's going to drive up my cost, it's going to limit -- potentially it will make it more difficult for me to hedge, it may move markets to other jurisdictions. And so there is a much more active dialogue going on around MiFID II in not just the areas that I described being in totality of the bill. And I would say to you that Lord Hill, who was the Finance Minister there or the Infrastructure Minister that's overseeing financial services is -- got an open ear and wants them -- my impression is that he wants to make these markets work. And it is much more impactful in the dialogue when the ultimate end-users go in and talk about their concerns than it is when exchanges and brokers and infrastructure providers go in, because we look to the politicians like we're just trying to protect our interest, when in reality, they're starting to hear these kinds of issues from the end-users. And so obviously, it has slowed down and part of the reason that it is slowed down is that there is an active dialogue going on around it as to how to improve the language and make it work. And so in that regard, I'm relatively hopeful and respectful that the bill will get better with time. It's hard to know when it will actually be implemented. Some of these things require investment and not just investment by the industry but also investment by government in order to monitor and maintain some of these things. So until Europe has landed on a specific set of language, the people can understand and then figure out a timetable on how it can be implemented, it's hard to know exactly what the timing is. But the good news is that there is an active dialogue and it's pretty broad and involving lots of different constituencies."

NYSE does not have any kind of speed bump, any kind of artificial delays. I just want to correct one thing in your question. NYSE and ICE are not against IEX becoming a regulated exchange. And in fact, the National Stock Exchange recently had an application became a stock exchange, and we were not against that. What our concern is, is that there is a law on the books that requires that NYSE and all other regulated exchanges deliver our results as soon as technically practicable, and we've been held to that standard for years. And what IEX is asking is for an exemption that would solely be for IEX, not for the industry, solely IEX would be the only one that would be exempted from that law. And IEX is attempting to patent the system that it is seeking to exempt. So it is looking for the ability to have a regulated monopoly status that the other exchanges do not have. And so we -- I have advocated that and worked behind the scenes with lots of people to say we should take a look at market structure, we should look at slowing down. The ideas that they're promulgating are not bad ideas at all, but the methods that they're going about it, we are objecting to. This is solely for their benefit and not for the benefit of the industry. And frankly, if that were to go forward, IEX would actually hurt the other people in the industry. Normally, when there's innovation, the innovation helps people, but it doesn't actually hurt the people that are left behind. And so that is our objection, that's what we want the SEC to take a hard look at. If the industry can come together and work on our change to Reg NMS, we would be very supportive. If the SEC wants our support or needs our help in changing Reg NMS to allow things to slow down to change the way the data moves around, to change the obligation of exchanges, we're all in for that. But not a one-off deal that benefits somebody that's trying to patent and receive a regulated monopoly. And I don't think it's fair. I just don't think it's -- it is un-American and it's not fair, and it's not the way that our systems should work."

And while you mentioned 1 competitor, there are others that are all coming at this because it's a growing area of business. And in a competitive space, people are looking to get their market share. One thing that we've heard from many of the ETF sponsors is they like, frankly, the competition; they feel it's benefiting them. And secondly that they do want to have some diversity of providers. In case there is a technical problem or some other structural problems so that they have tested other systems and would be able to move business around quickly. So some of it is really just -- some of the movements that you're seeing is really people doing a BCP planning so that -- because these franchises are becoming ever more important. And so we understand and actually helped some people to do that because we want to be able to have them -- have those businesses, those that can move our way. The -- I don't know what to say other than it is not particularly expensive to list an ETF. You're talking about things in the sense of $25,000 a year or less. So while it is highly competitive, that is really not the metric that is going to allow an ETF provider of any size and scale to determine where to list. And what I'm investing in, what you can see us doing is really improving the package of services that we can have to literally partner with these firms, to be part of their workflow and to make life easy for them because we understand this business, and even more so now in the fixed income space. And we are an advocate for them and want to continue to be an advocate with public policy and with their marketing and sales efforts that goes way beyond what a $25,000 investment would have for an ETF. So we feel good about our positioning, but it's certainly competitive."

So it hasn't -- that phenomena has not led to a decrease in a number of customers, it's actually led to more interest, then an increase in the number of customers. I think more people are paying attention to those prices and trying to figure out when to lock in low prices or whether or not they're going to be high prices. And so there's a lot of trading activity. Open interest as you know from covering this for a long time, I'm sure that open interest in certain commodities, particularly in oil, will go up and down with the steepness of the curve. When it back predates or goes into contango, there are different Kerry[ph] economics that go on, that affect open interest but actually accelerate trading, which is what we care about. So we care about our open interest and we monitor it and we'll watch it and use it as a predictor, but you have to look at it in context with -- is the curve getting flatter or steeper. And so we are very, very comfortable right now that, that is still a growing franchise. And as I mentioned, we have record volumes in January, and there's tremendous interest in energy, commodity space globally right now. We would expect that growth to continue."

I'll begin on Slide 4 which highlights another record year in 2015. Our 10th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings. 
During the year, we delivered strong volume growth in our global commodities business, double-digit revenue growth in data and listings, synergy realization ahead of faith, margin expansion, outstanding earnings growth and strong returns on invested capital. And we delivered these results while investing in our diverse global businesses, making strategic acquisitions of Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport, and generating over $1.3 billion in operating cash flows, which enabled us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders.
Consolidated net revenues grew 8% in 2015 versus the prior year. Transaction revenues were flat versus 2014, despite solid growth in our commodities and cash equities market. We grew our data services and listings revenues 26% and 10%, respectively. This solid revenue growth coupled with expense discipline enabled adjusted operating margins to expand 4 points over the prior year to 59%. All of this allowed us to deliver $12.15 in adjusted earnings per share, a 26% increase versus 2014.
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll discuss our fourth quarter performance. Revenues of $875 million included $50 million from Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport, which we closed in mid-December. Our revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again driven by strong growth in data and listings. Commodity futures and U.S. cash equities revenues also grew well in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses were $364 million, including $33 million from Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport. Adjusted operating margins were 58%. Our expense discipline and top line revenue growth helped us deliver a record $3.27 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, a 26% year-to-year increase.
Please move to Slide 6, where you can see further delineation of the diverse revenue streams that contributed to our record fourth quarter. While transaction and clearing revenues were flat year-to-year, both commodities and U.S. cash equities grew 3%. It's also worth noting that while total financial revenue declined in the fourth quarter due to lower equity option in CDS revenue, revenue in our interstate futures complex was up 5% versus last year. Data revenues increased 35% in the quarter, including the addition of Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport. Excluding the $50 million in revenue they contributed, our data revenues would still have risen 9%. Finally, listings revenues set another record and was up 8%.
Slide 7 shows revenue mix on the left side of the slide, and on the right, our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses. We provided a pro forma version of this chart, which includes Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport for the full fourth quarter on Slide 18 in the appendix. As shown on the left side of Slide 7, transaction revenues made up 59% of our fourth quarter revenues and data services comprised 29%. On a pro forma basis, though, you'll see that data services would've made up 43% of revenues and transaction revenues only 48%. Going forward, we expect data revenues of $470 million to $480 million in the first quarter of 2016, with additional sequential growth as we move through 2016.
I also want to mention that we intend to enhance our financial reporting starting in the first quarter of 2016 when we expect to report 2 business segments, a trading and risk management segment, which includes our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses and a data and listings segment, which includes our subscription-based revenues. We'll provide more detail to ensure that you have good transparency as we make that transition during the first quarter.
Shifting to the right side of the slide, you see the fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $364 million, including $33 million related to Interactive Data Corp. and Trayport. Excluding those expenses, our adjusted operating expenses would've declined 2% year-to-year due to real estate consolidation and further integration of our corporate function. This strong expense management once again reflects an acceleration of the realization of synergy and provides a solid foundation to deliver the remaining synergies related to the combination of ICE, NYSE, Interactive Data Corp. and our other recent acquisitions.
For 2016, we expect operating expenses between $2 billion and $2.03 billion. This includes another $75 million in synergies, which is roughly 1/3 of the total expense reduction we intend to deliver over the next 3 years. The expense guidance also includes approximately $45 million largely related to compensation increases and roughly $30 million from investments in new product development, like the new ICE U.S. Treasury Index series as well as technology upgrades and enhancements to our cybersecurity platform. The rest of our 2016 guidance can be found on Slide 19 in the appendix. We've also included an update regarding our synergy realization on Slide 20 in the appendix where you will see that we ended 2015 with $480 million in realized synergies.
Let's move forward now to Slide 8, where I will review our solid cash generation and capital return for the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash during 2015, which will enable us to invest in growth, fund acquisitions and return $1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Importantly, the cash generative nature of our diverse global business gives us the confidence that we can invest in our business and delever to maintain our strong credit rating while still delivering on our objectives to grow our dividend as we grow. Along those lines, this morning we announced a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend, following the 15% increase we implemented in last year's second quarter. This increase ultimately means that we will pay out 20% more to shareholders in 2016 than we did in 2015 in the form of dividend.
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 9 with a review of our capital structure and return on invested capital. At December 31, we had $627 million in unrestricted cash. Including the debt related to the acquisition of Interactive Data Corp., our total debt was $7.3 billion at the end of 2015 and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA was 2.89x. As noted above, we are confident that we can quickly reduce our leverage.
On the right side of the slide, you see our return on invested capital, which was nearly 8.5% in 2015 and remains above our key competitors and above our cost of capital. Our ROIC has steadily improved since closing the NYSE acquisition in 2013 and was on track to approach 10% as we move through 2016. As you would expect, though, ROIC will dip as we incorporate our investments in Interactive Data and Trayport. Importantly though, we expect to continue to generate ROIC above our cost of capital and to reestablish the upper trend into 2017 and beyond.
Our fourth quarter, and 2015 results, are a testament to the focus and execution across our business. We delivered record revenue, strong operating margin expansion, and once again, double-digit earnings growth while continuing to strategically diversify our business to serve our customers' growing demands for information and risk management.
And importantly, we are off to a strong start in our transaction-based businesses in January and expect our data and listings businesses to generate solid growth once again in 2016. This solid revenue base coupled with vigilant expense management should once again enable us to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016.
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

We're pleased to report that 2015 was the best year in our company's history. It was our 10th anniversary as a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and it was our 10th consecutive year of delivering record revenues and record earnings.
I'll take a few minutes to update you on our growth drivers before we move into our question-and-answer session. Starting on Slide 10, which illustrates our unparalleled track record of growth over the last decade. Starting as an over-the-counter energy trading platform then evolving to futures exchanges and clearinghouses, we've now expanded into being a leader in data, connectivity and listings. We've evolved our business model to stay close to our customers' changing needs. And in that process, we've moved from a 90% transaction-based revenue model to a balanced mix of transaction and subscription-based revenues across a diverse range of markets and services. Because our team and its culture is central to our strong results, I want to take a moment to highlight the promotions that we announced last week.
Ben Jackson, who previously led ICE Futures U.S. for us, is now our Chief Commercial Officer, where he's leading the integration of our acquisitions to ensure that we meet our targets of ever-increasing results. Ben is deeply steeped in the ICE culture and will help export that important operating philosophy to our new colleagues.
Lynn Martin, our Global Head of Data has expanded her scope to include responsibility for uniting Interactive Data Corporation with the ICE and NYSE data operations. Lynn joined us through the NYSE acquisition were she led Liffe U.S. She's already working closely with the team at Interactive Data to ensure that we benefit from our combined strengths.
Trabue Bland, who is ICE's Vice President of Regulation is now the President of ICE Futures U.S. Trabue has a strong legal and compliance background, and has experience in working with our customers to address regulatory and market issues. These promotions set us up for the next phase of growth by leveraging the deep expertise that we have across our global team.
Turning to Slide 11, you'll find a summary of our diverse growth drivers across a broad range of markets. Many are secular trends and others are organic growth initiatives, but all are the results of our customers' changing needs. I'll walk through these in the next few slides starting with the solid performance of our financial markets in 2015.
In our European interest rate markets, we saw significant build in open interest during the year. Rising open interest was coupled with a 30% increase in daily volume in the fourth quarter. And that has continued into 2016, as daily volumes in our rates markets grew 27%. The increased activities in interest rate trading is being driven by customers returning to the market in Europe as central banks are becoming more vocal and action-oriented. While the U.S., U.K. and European central banks may be on different paths, the changing expectations create dynamic rates and currency environments that drive trading and clearing activity. Also in our financial markets, credit default swap clearing contributed over $100 million of revenue in 2015. This business continues to open new opportunities for us across the swaps clearing landscape, as further mandates across credit and interest rate swaps come into effect later this year.
Slide 12 is a snapshot of the strength of our energy markets. The importance of risk management at all energy price levels is evident, as you can see well into the second year of oil price declines, the depth and breadth of our market along with uncertainty around oil prices and geopolitical events drove record oil revenues, which increased 14% in 2015. And this resulted in the ICE Brent contract achieving its 19th consecutive annual volume record. The strong performance continued into January with daily volume in our oil markets up over 20% for the month, including another record month for ICE Brent crude volumes. We maintain a close dialogue with our customers in the energy markets amidst shifting dynamics of supply and demand and the challenges of declining prices. Expectations for the level of oil prices, the strength of the dollar, central bank actions and global economic trends continue to drive uncertainty and the increasing volumes in our commodities market reflect these conditions. We also continue to grow by introducing new products in new market, such as ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore, which were successfully launched in mid-November.
Now turning to our global data business on Slide 13. You can see the breadth of services that we now provide. Similar to the development of our diverse exchange and clearing operations, the development of our data services business offers a meaningful opportunity to leverage our global network. Our data services provide transparency, information, analysis and connectivity, all of which is consumed by market participants to transact across markets and instruments.
Our customers rely on data, trading and risk management platforms, which are often interdependent across their workflow. And when these services are well coordinated, they create a strong value proposition. While Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, ICE and NYSE data are each strong businesses in their own right, we believe they'll be much more valuable to our customers and to our shareholders on a combined basis.
Our customers' needs are not limited to exchange traded data. The broader market for fixed income is vast and Interactive Data Corporation is centered on the changes taking place in this over-the-counter market. You'll recall that the drivers of our acquisitions are based on newer secular trends. These include the standardization of products for electronic trading and clearing and the need to trade with algorithms and quantitatively driven programs. The increased use of technologies is creating demand for data input, including the connectivity to consume this information. And the increased requirements for independent valuation required by financial reform raise the demand for autonomous data.
Finally, the trend towards growing indexation and passive investing as seen in our strong ETF market performance supports the access to data that can be licensed and packaged. We believe the data and data connectivity are deeply linked to the global market that they serve. And in order to lead in customer service and innovation, we're making investments in these areas.
For that, and on Slide 14, I want to provide an update on our early progress with Interactive Data. In January, we began integrating the corporate services functions so that we can move forward, serving our customers as one team. And as a result, we become even more confident about our combination. A great example of our potential together is last week's announcement of the launch of the ICE U.S. Treasury Index family with BlackRock agreeing to transition 4 of its flagship, fixed income iShare ETFs to reference these indices. The new ICE fixed income indices rely on pricing input from Interactive Data. Also yesterday, we announced that AllianceBernstein chose our best execution service to evaluate its fixed income trade execution quality, a service that utilizes the new Interactive Data realtime pricing algorithm. We see further strategic opportunities with both active and passive fund managers by leveraging the strong relationships that we have gained with them at the New York Stock Exchange, and we look forward to continuing to update our investors and our team as this integration progresses.
I'll move now to Slide 15. 2015 was another exciting year for NYSE listings, culminating in record quarterly revenue. We were pleased to welcome great companies like First Data, Square and Ferrari during the fourth quarter. NYSE again led in global proceeds raised for the fifth consecutive year. 
Later this month, we expect to begin rolling out the new NYSE Pillar trading platform for our NYSE Arca markets. This is just one example of our commitment to incorporating leading technology into our unique market offerings. I'll also note the strong performance of NYSE Arca, where exchange-traded product volume rose 25% in 2015. As the leader in ETF listings, we've undertaken a study to support the long-term growth of the market for our issuers, by identifying improvements to the trading ecosystem.
Last week, we released the study conducted with Mackenzie, outlying a number of proposed market enhancements, many of which are already underway. Our listed customers continue to tell us that they prioritize proper price discovery in their shares over speed as is offered by our designated marketmaker model. Whether through industry coordination or by our own actions, New York Stock Exchange will continue to lead positive change for listed companies and their investors.
Turning to Slide 16, you can see that we're a growth company. In 2015, we grew our top line and our bottom line, and we're growing our dividend as we grow our earnings. ICE is driven by change, which brings opportunities to better serve our customers, and I'd like to pause and thank those customers for their business in 2015. And I look forward to building on our track record with our newly expanded team in this new year.
I'll now turn the call back to today's operator, Rocco, and he'll be happy to moderate your questions."

IDC tends to typically sign longer-term agreements that have some kind of escalator in them and has a very, very high renewal rate, well above 90% on -- by any measure of renewal. And so that part of the revenue is really almost an annuity-type business. What we're working on and have the team working on now is really expanding the scope of services and expanding the footprint and customer base and we feel pretty confident that we're going to significantly increase the revenue growth and earnings potential of that company by new products, new services, new geographies and what have you. And the reason I wanted to highlight in my prepared remarks that there are 2 new services that we just put out and we've literally put Lynn Martin in there, a little more than 30 days ago, that demonstrate the kind of thing that we think we can do. With very, very strong synergies with the New York Stock Exchange, the deep relationships that we've gotten over the last couple of years around the NYSE, we've taken our ETF management business and we're combining it with the Interactive Data business. These are businesses that produce realtime pricing in equities and now in fixed income for end-users, for the management of exchange-traded products and the like. And in addition, we mentioned that for nonexchange-traded products, we now have the realtime valuation services that are new and robust. And so we feel relatively confident with the thesis on which we made the acquisition. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're actually more confident now that we've started to put our teams together and unlock our customer relationships."

So the $45 million is kind of what I'll refer to as business as usual investment in our people and investment in the places where we work, et cetera. It's a little bit more than 2% of our overall expense base. That's to be expected plus or minus a point in any given year. These are investments in people that if you look back over the last 3 years, we spent about $90 million delivering almost $300 million in incremental revenue, which is about 70%, just under 70% incremental margin. So we think those are good investments. We think they've proven to be good investments and they're good investments going forward. The $30 million is really more targeted. It's targeted at a lot of things that Jeff talked about in his script, not the least of which was the recent announcement with Interactive Data Corp. on the index that we did with BlackRock. There are also investments in there to further enhance our cybersecurity capabilities. We have always been a technology company. We've always been very focused on information, security and stability of our systems. We design our own systems. We manage our own data centers. And so that's an area where we think the additional investment pays off in the long-term by continuing to provide systems that are up for our customers to do the trading and the risk management that they need to do. So that's how I would generally characterize it. And I think you're exactly right. Those investments are being made against the backdrop of a very diverse set of commodity and Futures & Options product, all of which have strong open interest bases and an expectation that our data and listings businesses will continue to grow."

Well, we've already seen synergies in combining Interactive Data with some of our businesses beyond the indices and execution quality product offerings that I mentioned. Our SuperDerivatives valuation business, which is really designed to value very difficult and complicated contracts is quickly finding synergies with Interactive Data in the customer base where we can package really valuation services together. I think another part of data is how you deliver it and one of the -- the 1 real piece of infrastructure that we kept when we unwound the NYSE technology business was the safety network, which is just what its acronym implies, a very safe network for which, as Scott mentioned, we're increasingly putting more cybersecurity and protections around and the ability to deliver through that network into our data centers. And so we believe that in addition to the product that the delivery mechanism will be a value to our customers as well. So all of that for the 30-or-so days that we've really been focused on it feels pretty good and we've seen some early wins in that regard. I think I've made comments before in public forums that the trend in our industry is for more execution competition. Some of that is happening because regulators are vulcanizing markets by wanting more local regulation particularly at local regulation of the banking sector. And for many years, our industry went electronic and took for granted the fact that we could trade globally. Well, now there are speed bumps around the world as there are reporting requirements and other kinds of things that are fracturing markets. Beyond that, there's actually a trend in Europe that Europe is trying to specifically, potentially fracture markets with MiFID II. And as those markets fracture, the need for putting the information back together on behalf of market participants and having it delivered in a safe manner, that's reliable and timely and what have you, is really where the puck is going to go and that's where we're skating. And we've amazingly seen some very, very early signs of success just in a few short number of days."

We expect that it will begin rolling out in the next few weeks. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to start with the Arca platform. The early results of that is that is a very, very predictable, reliable and fast platform that is simple and easy to understand. Our experience in the derivatives market have suggested that, that is a winning formula for people that honestly just have predictability of how our market's going to operate, and then can make their own investments and build their own systems and tools around that predictable nature. We're not going to change any pricing. I mean, that market is a highly competitive market and prices continue to be adjusted by competitors and peers and others and we'll respond to that, but we feel pretty good at rolling out Pillar. We think it's going to be a dramatic improvement for the same value proposition. We do -- we have seen business in 2015 in our mind lead the dark pool market and come back to listed trading. And NYSE has gotten -- it's above its fair share of that market movement. And if you look at the market share trends, they're very, very positive for NYSE and that's with our old legacy platforms. So we feel pretty good moving into '16. It will take a while to put everything on Pillar. We're going to be relatively slow and deliberate as we found out this summer when the New York Stock Exchange had an outage, it's a major market disruption for the markets. And so we have a heightened sense of caution, if you will, that we recognize the high place that we hold in the ecosystem. And so we're going to be deliberate, but the system looks good and is ready to go."

In my mind, a lot of the opportunity set that we're seeing really comes from the fact that the buy side was able to rely on certain services that came from the global banking industry, that were relatively casual and informal. But today, due to regulatory reform and internal audit practices, we need to be more rigorous. So for example, it might have been perfectly acceptable a few years ago to call a bank counterparty and ask what they think -- what you think the mark should be on a particular instrument and rely on that. Today, the regulators and the auditors want an independent validation. Increasingly, as people are taking the obligation to get best execution, seriously as the SEC is paying more attention to best ex requirements in the fixed income space, asset managers and other are making investments to make sure that they are compliant and that they are able to represent to the end-users that they're using best practices. So it's a relatively new market as you probably know. The fixed income space is evolving. Some of these things that I mentioned are really just the tip of the iceberg. In other words, they haven't really resulted in formal rulemakings or obligations, but people see them coming and are getting ahead of them. So we think it's very early days and a big market. We have always had some execution capabilities in the fixed income space because of our Creditex acquisition. A lot of people that do credit default swaps, do underlying bond transactions, so we have a very good dialogue with a lot of end-users, people that are in the market every day. And we're exploiting all of those channels right now, and Lynn Martin and her team are working to organize that up so that we can speak with 1 voice. In terms of how we charge form. It's pretty early days right now. We're having a lot of conversations. As you probably know, the passive index managers are very, very price competitive with one another, particularly for relatively standardized pools of trading. And so they're looking for how they can best manage the services that go in to supporting that. We're pretty familiar with that. We've been talking to them around NYSE Arca and their listing activities for years. And so we want to be -- we want to put a compelling package together for them that is value-added for our shareholders. And so we're having a lot of conversations about how to do that, how to partner with these guys to give them a better offering, but still return great returns for our shareholders. So early days yet, but we'll probably have more to say about it and Scott will have to figure out a way to talk to you about that, so that you have some predictability and metrics as we go forward."

We have never really -- and I think you know that about us, we don't go in and just jack up prices, per se. Our philosophy is, let's give people a better package and then they'll be happy to pay for it. And so in that regard, we don't get a lot of pushback on our pricing and yet we've been able to really raise the profitability of these businesses. The AllianceBernstein product that I mentioned in the prepared remarks is based off of the realtime bond pricing platform, which is new. It's something that Interactive Data had under construction at the time we acquired it. We're working to accelerate that and to get more and more instruments and more sophistication around that. And we think there's a number of different channels where that can be deployed. Right now, obviously, the AllianceBernstein deal is a deployment that results in financial gain for us, but that data is floating around the ecosystem right now in a relatively uncoordinated way, and people are starting to rely on it, and we're going to figure out how to better channel that and monetize it for our shareholders."

The data in many of those indices belongs to Interactive Data. And the history, if you will, also belongs to Interactive Data. So we believe customers who are benchmarking to indices, it's going to be important that they have some continuity in their marketing materials and to the way they talk to their investors and their boards. And so at this moment in time, we have no reason to believe that those indices aren't going to continue to be anything other than a customer to us. There's a lot of index activity in the fixed income space. It's an unbelievably large space in terms of number of instruments and issuance and the global nature of the debt markets around the world. So the various fund managers are providing lots of different instruments to allow investors to participate in those markets. And as a result, there are a lot of different benchmarks and indices and ways that the market is growing. And so as you can see, we were able to convince one of the most sophisticated providers of ETFs in the form of BlackRock to begin to move business on indices that we now provide."

So Ben Jackson, who is now reporting directly to me and really we've passed with the job of looking at our total portfolio, looking at our footprint and helping us to figure out how to best organize that. And that work is just starting. So we don't have anything to say right now. I will say that there are a lot of interesting parts and pieces in the businesses that you just described that we want to take a hard look at to see where they might fit with other things we do before we make any kind of decisions on their long-term deployment, and that's what Ben is doing with us. I think what's been interesting about the NYSE is that it fits so nicely now with the Interactive Data, as we've mentioned, the systems that we need to run ETFs inside the NYSE are highly complementary with Interactive Data. The sale of data, the way we move marshal data around, having the New York Stock Exchange data is a door opener for our sales force. It's -- obviously, we can easily help people price equities, having our commodity data in this era where there's tremendous conversation at all levels of boardrooms about commodities. All that packaged together is really valuable. So New York Stock Exchange, while it may have a different name -- and other than, it's not called ICE, the reality is that company is being integrated in a way that is really raising our earnings capabilities across the firm. And not the least of which is that New York Stock Exchange is a cash generative business that sits in the United States so that we get U.S. cash, which is allowing us to quickly pay down debt and delever, and will allow us to return capital to shareholders faster. We are in an -- we are global company with an enviable position in that we're not struggling to figure out how to move money around the world in order to return capital to shareholders. And so it's paid some very, very strong and interesting dividends that I think is really working for the firm right now. And not -- by the way, it's convenient for people to write about the New York Stock Exchange -- not you, Rich, but for people to write about the New York Stock Exchange to say, ""It once had 85% market share and now it only has 25% market share. Woe is me."" The reality is that last year was the highest earnings of the New York Stock Exchange in its over 225-year history. And this month, I suspect that this is probably one of the highest earnings months in its history. It's a company that is doing incredibly well from a financial standpoint. And I think as we continue to shed legacy platforms and simplify it and make it better and easier to understand and more approachable to investors and listed companies, that it's going to continue to do well. Notwithstanding the fact that it is in a highly competitive environment with very strong competitors. But it's been doing very well and it is not a business that we would want to see leave our portfolio."

So my point is, I think that is such a strong value proposition for us and, such an interesting thing for those managers that conversations are happening at levels above your typical salesperson. It's easy once that door is open for us to figure out creative ways of packaging things and we've just started this. But so far have been very, very well received and actually had some inbound calls from people saying, ""Can you come in here and let's sit down and talk about how we might work better together.""

Perfect. And then just a follow-up question. As I turn to regulation, just around MiFID II, around the possibly of some of these large commodity trading firms, including many of your customers potentially getting caught under the scope of MiFID II and being forced to hold more capital, so it just seems like we're in this weird period of limbo. We're waiting to see how long MiFID II will be delayed. I just want to get your thoughts on the delay, when do you think the delay gives your customers more time to speak with regulators? And if you generally feel more confident that the delay would lead to a bit more practical and workable regulation?"

One of the things that we've seen now is that when MiFID II was passed, I got the sense that politicians went and asked their constituents, ""Would you like to have everything unbundled? Would you like to be able to choose where you trade, and where you clear and where you buy research and have complete choice in what you do."" And everybody said yes. Would you like to make sure that the banks are not cornering markets and taking a speculative position that drive prices the wrong way? People said yes. And the question that wasn't asked is, ""How was that actually going to impact the market and what is it going to cost you?"" And now that the regulation is out there, people are looking at it and saying, ""Oh my gosh."" It's going to fragment markets, it's going to drive up my cost, it's going to limit -- potentially it will make it more difficult for me to hedge, it may move markets to other jurisdictions. And so there is a much more active dialogue going on around MiFID II in not just the areas that I described being in totality of the bill. And I would say to you that Lord Hill, who was the Finance Minister there or the Infrastructure Minister that's overseeing financial services is -- got an open ear and wants them -- my impression is that he wants to make these markets work. And it is much more impactful in the dialogue when the ultimate end-users go in and talk about their concerns than it is when exchanges and brokers and infrastructure providers go in, because we look to the politicians like we're just trying to protect our interest, when in reality, they're starting to hear these kinds of issues from the end-users. And so obviously, it has slowed down and part of the reason that it is slowed down is that there is an active dialogue going on around it as to how to improve the language and make it work. And so in that regard, I'm relatively hopeful and respectful that the bill will get better with time. It's hard to know when it will actually be implemented. Some of these things require investment and not just investment by the industry but also investment by government in order to monitor and maintain some of these things. So until Europe has landed on a specific set of language, the people can understand and then figure out a timetable on how it can be implemented, it's hard to know exactly what the timing is. But the good news is that there is an active dialogue and it's pretty broad and involving lots of different constituencies."

NYSE does not have any kind of speed bump, any kind of artificial delays. I just want to correct one thing in your question. NYSE and ICE are not against IEX becoming a regulated exchange. And in fact, the National Stock Exchange recently had an application became a stock exchange, and we were not against that. What our concern is, is that there is a law on the books that requires that NYSE and all other regulated exchanges deliver our results as soon as technically practicable, and we've been held to that standard for years. And what IEX is asking is for an exemption that would solely be for IEX, not for the industry, solely IEX would be the only one that would be exempted from that law. And IEX is attempting to patent the system that it is seeking to exempt. So it is looking for the ability to have a regulated monopoly status that the other exchanges do not have. And so we -- I have advocated that and worked behind the scenes with lots of people to say we should take a look at market structure, we should look at slowing down. The ideas that they're promulgating are not bad ideas at all, but the methods that they're going about it, we are objecting to. This is solely for their benefit and not for the benefit of the industry. And frankly, if that were to go forward, IEX would actually hurt the other people in the industry. Normally, when there's innovation, the innovation helps people, but it doesn't actually hurt the people that are left behind. And so that is our objection, that's what we want the SEC to take a hard look at. If the industry can come together and work on our change to Reg NMS, we would be very supportive. If the SEC wants our support or needs our help in changing Reg NMS to allow things to slow down to change the way the data moves around, to change the obligation of exchanges, we're all in for that. But not a one-off deal that benefits somebody that's trying to patent and receive a regulated monopoly. And I don't think it's fair. I just don't think it's -- it is un-American and it's not fair, and it's not the way that our systems should work."

And while you mentioned 1 competitor, there are others that are all coming at this because it's a growing area of business. And in a competitive space, people are looking to get their market share. One thing that we've heard from many of the ETF sponsors is they like, frankly, the competition; they feel it's benefiting them. And secondly that they do want to have some diversity of providers. In case there is a technical problem or some other structural problems so that they have tested other systems and would be able to move business around quickly. So some of it is really just -- some of the movements that you're seeing is really people doing a BCP planning so that -- because these franchises are becoming ever more important. And so we understand and actually helped some people to do that because we want to be able to have them -- have those businesses, those that can move our way. The -- I don't know what to say other than it is not particularly expensive to list an ETF. You're talking about things in the sense of $25,000 a year or less. So while it is highly competitive, that is really not the metric that is going to allow an ETF provider of any size and scale to determine where to list. And what I'm investing in, what you can see us doing is really improving the package of services that we can have to literally partner with these firms, to be part of their workflow and to make life easy for them because we understand this business, and even more so now in the fixed income space. And we are an advocate for them and want to continue to be an advocate with public policy and with their marketing and sales efforts that goes way beyond what a $25,000 investment would have for an ETF.

And so there's a lot of trading activity. Open interest as you know from covering this for a long time, I'm sure that open interest in certain commodities, particularly in oil, will go up and down with the steepness of the curve. When it back predates or goes into contango, there are different Kerry [ph] economics that go on, that affect open interest but actually accelerate trading, which is what we care about.

And so we are very, very comfortable right now that, that is still a growing franchise. And as I mentioned, we have record volumes in January, and there's tremendous interest in energy, commodity space globally right now. We would expect that growth to continue."

As Kelly mentioned, the slides to which we will refer this morning can also be found on the ICE homepage. I'll begin on Slide 4 of that presentation where you will see that we delivered another record quarter, including adjusted earnings per share, which was 20% as reported versus the first quarter of 2015. As this is the first full quarter, including our recent acquisitions, unless otherwise noted, year-over-year figures will reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma first quarter 2015 results. 
On that basis, ICE's first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to a record $3.68. Both our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment contributed meaningfully to first quarter revenue, which in total grew 5% to $1.2 billion. This solid revenue performance, combined with disciplined expense management, allowed us to expand operating margins by 5 points to 59%. Equally important, these results help generate strong operating cash flows, which enabled us to pay over $100 million in dividend, up 14% from the fourth quarter, while also allowing us to significantly reduce our leverage, which stood atr only 2.5x just 3 months post the closing of interactive data transaction. 
Moving to Slide 5, you will see the component of our strong earnings growth. Revenue growth of 5%, combined with a 6% decline in adjusted operating expenses, generated adjusted operating income growth of 14%. Net income attributable to ICE grew 18%, and we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We achieved these strong results despite a challenging quarter for institutional trading debts, continued regulatory change and while executing on a range of strategic initiatives, from the integration of previously acquired companies and continued product and technology innovation to evaluations of additional value-enhancing M&A opportunities. 
We remain committed to generating strong financial performance in the current period even as we develop strategies to enhance our returns on investment in the future. 
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll talk to our new segment reporting. First quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year-over-year to nearly $1.2 billion. The chart on the left side of the slide shows our revenues were evenly split between our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. 
Turning to the table on the right side of the slide, you will note a similar balance of growth across the diverse line items that constitute each segment. For example, as shown on the table, total trading in clearing segment revenue grew 4% year-to-year with solid contributions from both commodities and financials, which grew 5% and 4%, respectively. Within those balance results, Sugar, LIBOR and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits. Our data and listings segment revenues grew 5% in the first quarter. Our pricing and analytics revenues were up 6% and exchange data revenues were up 9%, both driven primarily by new users and new products. As these results demonstrate, we are already seeing expected acceleration in the growth of the legacy interactive data pricing reference data business. This strong start further supports our confidence in our data revenues can grow 6% to 7% on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. 
Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first quarter despite a quiet IPO environment. The growth in the first quarter and our confidence in our listings business will continue to grow throughout 2016 is due to our clear leadership in capital raising activity at the NYSE over the last few years. And I'm pleased to say that we've already seen a handful of IPOs early in Q2, and our pipeline continues to build. 
Let's shift to Slide 7 where I'll cover our disciplined expense management and provide update on expense guidance and synergies. First quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 6% year-over-year to $476 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by 5 points. Our first quarter expenses included higher-than-usual M&A related spending, but that was largely offset by some 2015 credits in compensation and professional services. The period also benefited from the release of roughly $11 million of nonincome tax-related results, which were partially offset by few 3 nonoperating expenses below the operating income line. 
More importantly, even adjusting for these impacts, we would have been below our expense guidance as we once again realized synergies sooner than expected. This strong first quarter expense performance and our updated synergy expectations result in us lowering our full year expense guidance to between $1.97 billion and $2.0 billion. This improved guidance reflect expected 2016 expense synergies of $85 million to $90 million, that's up from prior guidance of $75 million. And this includes $30 million to $35 million from Interactive Data, which is also improved from prior guidance of $25 million. For the second quarter, we expect expenses in the range of $495 million to $505 million. The second quarter will be first one to reflect the full impact of 2016 compensation increases, and we will also see a pickup in investments related to business development and CapEx.
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our solid cash generation, improving leverage profile and ongoing capital return. We generated nearly $600 million of operating cash flow during the first quarter, which enabled us to invest in growth even as we reduced our debt by over $500 billion and returned over $100 million to our shareholders through dividends. As a result of our strong cash flow generation, we've reduced our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.5x at the end of the first quarter. We now believe, we can reduce our leverage below 2x by early next year, which we think is sufficient to maintain our current debt rating, while also creating more flexibility for additional capital returns. We also increased our first quarter dividend payout by 14% versus the fourth quarter consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend as we grow our earnings. 
Our record first quarter results show our continued focus and execution across our businesses. We delivered solid revenue growth, strong operating margin expansion and once again double-digit earnings growth. And importantly, we see strong demand from our customers and encouraging parents are close to market we serve. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

The first quarter of 2016 was the best quarter in our company's history for both revenue and earnings. And it was our 7th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We delivered 20% earnings per share growth in the quarter as a result of expanding our revenues and reducing expenses and while making investments for long-term growth. These strong results demonstrate our consistent focus on increasing our top line, expense discipline, cash flow generation, returns on invested capital and our capital returns. This morning, we announced our decision to end our current review of a potential offer for the London Stock Exchange group. We thought that the combination may have a compelling rational, including bringing together the premier transatlantic capital raising values, offering complementary interest rate and financial products and providing widespread equity, LIBOR and fixed income indices together with extensive market data. 
So over the last year, members of our board and our advisors attempted unsuccessfully to arrange meetings through the LAC Chairman to discuss these ideas. Then following our public expression in March of interest under the U.K. takeover code, the LAC Chairman and CEO these not engage with ICE. Not withstanding, we spent the last 2 months reviewing the data that we were provided with our financial advisers, auditors and legal and regulatory experts to determine whether our operations, expense basis and governance structure would result in a strategic combination that would meet ICE's return on investment thresholds, while operating shareholders meaningful share price premium. 
The disappointing level of engagement at the ultimately did not allow us to make a complete determination of the integration benefit and the related risk that ICE would required to support a bit. We are committed to building on our track record of creating shareholder value by achieving the targets that we set at the outset of our strategic transactions. Because we were unable to establish to our satisfaction, the financial models, risk undertakings and integration plans needed to set such targets, returning our focus to other opportunities to build on our track record of growth. 
As our results today show, our deliberation did not get in the way of ICE growing its revenues, increasing synergies, reducing expenses, utilizing our strong cash flows to delever and increasing our dividend. I am proud that our team has once again delivered strong operational results and the best quarter in our history even as we considered strategy opportunities.
And I'll now highlight some of the opportunities set that we have starting on Slide 9. Our team has driven our range of new initiatives in recent months. From launching our Singapore Exchange in clearing houses to introducing new equities trading platforms and issuer services at NYSE to expanding our data valuation network businesses. Each of these initiatives is on track, thanks to our global team that drive these efforts. 
So let's start with data, which is our most recent area of expansion. It's worth noting that 10 years ago, in 2006, 11% of our consolidated revenues were derived from market data. Today, 41% of our revenues are from our data business where the breadth of our product and services continued to expand. We are already seeing the benefits of enhancing the consistency of our revenues with solid margin and growth profile the subscription revenues bring. We've long seen the trend of data and connectivity consumption as markets became more automated, regulated and clear. And we've been an early mover in addressing the rising demand for information and analytics across virtually all asset classes. This is similar to our recognition of clearing becoming a centerpiece of market infrastructure a decade ago. And I'd like to note that even today, the category of exchange data, which is our traditional proprietary data, is still 11% of our significantly expanded total revenue base. And it continues to grow alongside of our highly complementary trading and clearing businesses. 
We previously discussed the secular drivers of rising data demand, including regulatory reform, automation, unbundling, fragmentation and the move towards indexation just to name a few. These secular trends are also driving growth in the other recent additions to our data business, pricing and analytics, desktops and connectivity. Our acquisitions over the last 3 years, including NYSE Euronext, SuperDerivatives, Interactive Data and Trayport bring a unique range of assets to support our growth. Our new services range from real-time bond pricing and indices to global infrastructure for exchange and broker connectivity to widely disputed desktops. 
We continue to make great progress on the advancement of Interactive Data since its closing in December. Last month, we launched the ICE U.S. Treasury industries to leverage a index business that was part of the NYSE with the capabilities we found at Interactive Data. And we're in the process of aligning our global sales and shared services teams to better serve our customers and realize efficiencies. 
Moving now to Slide 10, I will note that growth in our global markets and clearing houses continues. Just as with data, there are similar secular growth opportunities as the markets continue to evolve. Customers are increasingly adopting hedging practices as well as more recently seeking those solutions to do so in the most capital efficient manner. And hedging is needed regardless of price levels of commodities. Nearly 2 years ago, when oil prices began falling, many suggested that trading and clearing volumes would decline with crisis. The reality is just the opposite, because absolute price levels tend not to drive risk management activities, volatility does. 
In our global oil and agricultural products, we have seen consistent demand for the risk management that our exchanges and clearing houses clearinghouses offer. Our quarter benchmark contracts continued their growth and innovation, for example, ICE Brent Futures, set volume, revenue and open interest records in the quarter and spawn the launch of a Brent contract to better serve our Asian customers at ICE Futures Singapore. Growth in our agricultural markets were once again lead by our Sugar contract with revenue up 17% over the prior first quarter. 
Our financial markets ranging from European rates to global index benchmarks to credit markets, also, continued to strengthen. In our Euribor contract, which is Europe's short-term interest-rate benchmark revenue increased 34% year-to-year on Central Bank actions and the dynamics around the euro, pound and dollar. Volume in our equity index complex across MSCI and Russell grew over the prior first quarter. Consistent with our cash equities and option markets, we're voluntarily continued to drive growth. 
I'll wrap up our strategic highlights on Slide 11 with an update on our achievements at the New York Stock Exchange where we are delivering on the synergies that we promised as well as driving new revenue growth. Our investment in new systems, coupled with simplifying our offerings, continues to create a better market structure for market participants. In U.S. cash equities, we had a record quarter with strong volume and market share that continue to grow coupled with strong revenue capture. We lead an EPP listings with 82% of the new assets under management choosing the list with NYSE this quarter. And we maintained listings from 92% of our U.S. assets under management. We continue to be the the premier listing venue due to our liquidity, tight bid ask spreads and the security trade at the national best bid and offer price on our exchange. 
We're working closely with ETP issuers to help enable their ongoing innovation to grow this investment category. In our NYSE listings business, revenue grew despite the quite quarter for IPOs. And we have great momentum with an IPO pipeline that began to open up in April. We are expanding our issuer services and rolling our new NYSE connect platform to all listed companies later this month. These services are an important part of value proposition that we've been power listed companies and these are not revenue light item for us, but part of what drives our leadership in listings. There remains no more trusted model for our issuers, which is why the NYSE is growing with the first quarter representing the best quarter in its 224-year history. 
I'll close on Slide 12, noting our track record of growth, execution and results. This year has already been a product one, just one quarter in. We've reviewed and chose not to pursue the transaction. We grew revenues, reduced expenses and increase synergies. We continue to expand margins and roll double-digit earnings growth, and we invested for growth. We paid debt and returned dividend capital. So I'd like to thank our customers for their business and what was the best quarter in our company's history. And I'd like to thank our team for their continued hardwork. My colleagues and I look forward to continue to update you on our progress throughout the year. And with that, I will now turn the call back to our operator, Rocco, who will be glad to turn you on so that we can take your questions."

Then when we acquired SuperDerivatives, and ultimately, Interactive Data, we acquired sales team that had even more connection to the buyside.

First of all, I don't want to comment too much, because they're going to go through competition review that's going to open up a lot of opportunity for the entire market to comment on competition issues. And so I don't want to prejudge any of that. But with respect to their offering it's been very unclear to us what is being offered. And so I don't know how to react to this. Let me just make 1 point of color about our company unrelated to them. I'm going to be very clear, I'm talking about ICE. ICE operates clearing houses around the world. We operate largely on a common technology platform. We have global customers that we serve. And in many of our clearing houses, we have highly similar or highly correlated products. If it was easy to figure out how to net that down, we would be doing it, because we have every incentive in the world offer the best offering that we can for our customer base. The reality is that in different jurisdictions that are different bankruptcy James and when we just as we saw collapse the way people were treated in the U.S. as soon as the court stepped in and the administrators and the way people were treated in our clearing houses outside the U.S. was very different. Even though, the products were similar, the customers were similar and the risks were similar. And so these things complicate the ability to do passport integrations. We continue to work on it. We've been actually working on that for years had lots of dialogues with regulators and customers on how it might be accomplished, but it is a very difficult problem to solve, because at the end of the day people don't want money in cross-border at the moment of bankruptcy and regulators tend to come in and regulate locally during these moments of stress. And that's just the fact that all of us are trying to figure out how to work around."

In other words, they completely hedged out their risk. The people that do that are not end-users, the people that do that our dealers, people that are offering something to 1 party and then immediately hedging it out, so that they take out risk. That dealer community is under pressure as you, I'm sure, know. It's been shrinking if you look at announcements that have been going on.

I think, the way it impacts the entire market is that there's a goal to create more competition, which you and I mean more fragmentation of markets. We also think that it will be very, very difficult and hard and very little incentive for any third party to start a major clearing house when the existing tier houses have open access. In an odd way, while its meant to stimulate competition at the end of the day, probably, entrenches the incumbency, including ICE, who has a large clearing presence in Europe. So we continue to build out a capabilities in times that clearinghouse to get ready for access. And we continue to make sure that the ancillary services that we provide around the trading venues, where we do believe there will be fragmentation of our a lot of capabilities to our end-users.

As I think I have mentioned in other kinds of businesses, people have figured out ways of expanding the market, that expansion, while it benefits them, also has side benefits often times that benefits us. And I think, you're seeing that in the numbers. As fragmented markets in my mind are bad for end-users, they're very good for intermediaries. They create much more capabilities that brings a new kind of to the market that once they lag in all of the various different venues, which drives volumes.

Pre-NYSE, 80% to 90% revenues were volumes based. Post NYSE, it was still 70% to 75%. We're now at a point where our annuity half businesses are about hour our revenues, which introduces significant stability end of the financial model. You saw a very strong cash flows in the first quarter. Why you can't multiply that because got our annual listings building in it. We clearly are on track to a number that's going to around $2 billion of operating cash flows for the year, which you will note significantly above where we were in the prior year. Our CapEx needs have grown slightly. And so even letting that out our free cash flow are very significant. You saw in the quarter alone, we were able to knock 3/10 of point of leverage out in the first quarter. And so I think all of that is why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're now comfortable once we get below 2x leverage, which we think we can do late this year, or certainly, early next year. We believe that will support our overall rating. And that trading is important to us, because we're going to do the things that are necessary to support it. But as you mentioned, I don't think think 1.5x is that anymore given what we've done. I think, we could comfortably operate around 175, 180.

Well, first of all, there are tremendous synergies across the range of businesses that we have acquired recently and that's really what our plans called for us doing is unlocking those synergies, the revenue synergy opportunities across them. But just by way of example, we launched these new treasury indices at IDC, but we're able to develop those using a very strong team that we have at the NYSE that has very intimate relationships with large ETP and ETF providers. So we're able to very quickly have a dialogue with the unique customer base over their new product sets. Their idea on how they are going to grow that market and what capabilities we may have to support them. Neither company stand-alone on their own. And it was an amazing we were able to pull that together within the first month or so of ownership. And it's paying dividends. Obviously, we announced very quickly the BlackRock was moving some large ETP products on to those industries and now our team is out working with a lot of other providers and users of the industry is to advance and accelerate those products. I'd just make the point to you that much of this data revenue that we are talking about the subscription-based, which gives Scott the ability to have great confidence may need tells you it's going to grow at 6% to 7% this year. Because many of those contracts are being signed our have already been signed so we have tremendous visibility into them. Those tend to recur. So that's the nice thing about that model. So looking forward, we would hope that we are doing good job those customers and that they will continue to re-sign with us. And meanwhile, we take the products that we develop on the road and find new customers for them, so that we can have growth on growth."

And you can see the results that we posted, which is, we're doing phenomenally well. When you step back and look at payment for order flow, while it became accepted within the intermediary community around the equities market. Giving equity kick backs to large institutions that have very strong brands and are trying to appeal to retail customers in an era where the SEC and the labor department and others are very concerned that retail investors be given good guidance as to how their money is being handled up. And say real reputational band risk for somebody to step into that It would back the question if somebody create a product simply to generate churn inside of it and get these equity kickbacks or was that really the best listing venue. What I will tell you is that, all of us in financial services are under pressure by new regulation and also just best practices to make sure that we have no single point of failure in our businesses. And the big institutional investment firms are subject to those same kinds of reviews and pressure. So we expect that in that ETP, ETF market that people will for diversity purposes but it's not economically driven. It's really diversity driven. We have such a strong offering with 92% of AUM at NYSE. And you could see in the face of the pressure you talked about, 82% of the AUM that was listing in the first quarter came to us. The reason that such a strong venue is that we have very, very deep liquidity on the exchange the NYSE exchange where we list these platforms, marketmakers, infrastructures are rules set that really enables these innovative and fabulous listings to come to us and know that they have every opportunity for growth and success. NYSE is a brand that is known around the world, and we have been passported into most countries. And so the platform that we can offer somebody in terms of distribution is really unparalleled. And if those things that are driving the listings. I don't believe that payment for order flow is going to have a material impact on this business nor should it. And I also as you probably know think it's a corrosive mechanism that actually ultimately hurts markets. And so hopefully, I'm right and we won't see that is really innovative ETPs that are coming out."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Kelly mentioned, the slides to which we'll refer this morning can also be found on the ICE homepage.

As Kelly mentioned, the slides to which we'll refer this morning can also be found on the ICE homepage. 
I'll begin on Slide 4 of that presentation, where you will see that we delivered another record quarter, including adjusted earnings per share, which rose 20% as reported versus the first quarter of 2015. As this is the first full quarter, including our recent acquisitions, unless otherwise noted, year-over-year figures will reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma first quarter 2015 results. 
On that basis, ICE's first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to a record $3.68. Both our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment contributed meaningfully to first quarter revenues, which in total, grew 5% to $1.2 billion. This solid revenue performance, combined with disciplined expense management, allowed us to expand operating margins by 5 points to 59%. Equally important, these results help generate strong operating cash flows, which enabled us to pay over $100 million in dividend, up 14% from the fourth quarter, while also allowing us to significantly reduce our leverage, which stood at only 2.5x just 3 months post the closing of Interactive Data transaction. 
Moving to Slide 5, you'll see the components of our strong earnings growth. Revenue growth of 5%, combined with a 6% decline in adjusted operating expenses, generated adjusted operating income growth of 14%. Net income attributable to ICE grew 18%, and we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We achieved these strong results despite a challenging quarter for institutional trading desks, continued regulatory change and while executing on a range of strategic initiatives, from the integration of previously acquired companies and continued product and technology innovation to evaluations of additional value-enhancing M&A opportunities. We remain committed to generating strong financial performance in the current period even as we develop strategies to enhance our returns on investment in the future. 
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll walk through our new segment reporting. First quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year-over-year to nearly $1.2 billion. The chart on the left side of the slide shows our revenues were evenly split between our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. 
Turning to the table on the right side of the slide, you'll note a similar balance of growth across the diverse line items that constitute each segment. For example, as shown on the table, total trading and clearing segment revenues grew 4% year-to-year with solid contributions from both commodities and financials, which grew 5% and 4%, respectively. Within those balance results, ICE Brent, sugar, Euribor and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits. Our data and listings segment revenues grew 5% in the first quarter. Our pricing and analytics revenues were up 6% and exchange data revenues were up 9%, both driven primarily by new users and new products. As these results demonstrate, we are already seeing the expected acceleration in the growth of the legacy interactive data pricing reference data business. This strong start further supports our confidence that our data revenues can grow 6% to 7% on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. 
Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first quarter despite a quiet IPO environment. The growth in the first quarter and our confidence that our listings business will continue to grow throughout 2016 is due to our clear leadership in capital-raising activity at the NYSE over the last few years. And I'm pleased to say that we've already seen a handful of IPOs early in Q2, and our pipeline continues to build. 
Let's shift to Slide 7 where I'll cover our disciplined expense management and provide update on expense guidance and synergies. First quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 6% year-over-year to $476 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by 5 points. Our first quarter expenses included higher-than-usual M&A-related spending, but that was largely offset by some 2015 credits in compensation and professional services. The period also benefited from the release of roughly $11 million of nonincome tax-related reserves, which were partially offset by a few nonoperating expenses below the operating income line. More importantly, even adjusting for these impacts, we would have been below our expense guidance as we once again realized synergies sooner than expected. 
This strong first quarter expense performance and our updated synergy expectations result in us lowering our full year expense guidance to between $1.97 billion and $2.0 billion. This improved guidance reflects expected 2016 expense synergies of $85 million to $90 million, that's up from prior guidance of $75 million. And this includes $30 million to $35 million from Interactive Data, which has also improved from prior guidance of $25 million. For the second quarter, we expect expenses in the range of $495 million to $505 million. The second quarter will be the first one to reflect the full impact of 2016 compensation increases, and we will also see a pickup in investments related to business development and CapEx.
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our solid cash generation, improving leverage profile and ongoing capital return. We generated nearly $600 million of operating cash flow during the first quarter, which enabled us to invest in growth even as we reduced our debt by over $500 billion and returned over $100 million to our shareholders through dividends. As a result of our strong cash flow generation, we reduced our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.5x at the end of the first quarter. We now believe we can reduce our leverage below 2x by early next year, which we think is sufficient to maintain our current debt rating, while also creating more flexibility for additional capital returns. We also increased our first quarter dividend payout by 14% versus the fourth quarter, consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend as we grow our earnings. 
Our record first quarter results show our continued focus and execution across our businesses. We delivered solid revenue growth, strong operating margin expansion and, once again, double-digit earnings growth. And importantly, we see strong demand from our customers and encouraging trends across the markets we serve. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

The first quarter of 2016 was the best quarter in our company's history for both revenue and earnings. And it was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We delivered 20% earnings per share growth in the quarter as a result of expanding our revenues and reducing expenses and while making investments for long-term growth. These strong results demonstrate our consistent focus on increasing our top line, expense discipline, cash flow generation, returns on invested capital and our capital returns. 
This morning, we announced our decision to end our current review of a potential offer for the London Stock Exchange group. We thought that the combination may have a compelling rational, including bringing together the premier transatlantic capital-raising venues, offering complementary interest rate and financial products and providing widespread equity, LIBOR and fixed income indices, together with extensive market data. 
So over the last year, members of our board and our advisers attempted unsuccessfully to arrange meetings through the LSE Chairman to discuss these ideas. Then following our public expression in March of interest under the U.K. Takeover Code, the LSE Chairman and CEO did not engage with ICE. Notwithstanding, we spent the last 2 months reviewing the data that we were provided with our financial advisers, auditors and legal and regulatory experts to determine whether our operations, expense basis and governance structures would result in a strategic combination that would meet ICE's return on investment thresholds, while offering LSE shareholders a meaningful share price premium. The disappointing level of engagement at the LSE ultimately did not allow us to make a complete determination of the integration benefits and the related risks that ICE would required to support a bid. 
We are committed to building on our track record of creating shareholder value by achieving the targets that we set at the outset of our strategic transactions. Because we were unable to establish, to our satisfaction, the financial models, risk undertakings and integration plans needed to set such targets, we're turning our focus to other opportunities to build on our track record of growth. 
As our results today show, our deliberations did not get in the way of ICE growing its revenues, increasing synergies, reducing expenses, utilizing our strong cash flows to delever and increasing our dividend. I am proud that our team has once again delivered strong operational results and the best quarter in our history even as we considered strategy opportunities.
And I'll now highlight some of the opportunities set that we have, starting on Slide 9. Our team has driven our range of new initiatives in recent months. From launching our Singapore Exchange and clearing house to introducing new equities trading platforms and issuer services at NYSE, to expanding our data valuation network businesses. Each of these initiatives is on track, thanks to our global team that drive these efforts. 
So let's start with data, which is our most recent area of expansion. It's worth noting that 10 years ago, in 2006, 11% of our consolidated revenues were derived from market data. Today, 41% of our revenues are from our data business, where the breadth of our products and services continued to expand. We're already seeing the benefits of enhancing the consistency of our revenues with solid margin and growth profile the subscription revenues bring. We've long seen the trend of more data and connectivity consumption as markets became more automated, regulated and clear. And we've been an early mover in addressing the rising demand for information and analytics across virtually all asset classes. This is similar to our recognition of clearing becoming a centerpiece of market infrastructure a decade ago. And I'd like to note that even today, the category of exchange data, which is our traditional proprietary data, is still 11% of our significantly expanded total revenue base. And it continues to grow alongside of our highly complementary trading and clearing businesses. 
We've previously discussed the secular drivers of rising data demand, including regulatory reform, automation, unbundling, fragmentation and the move towards passive investing and indexation, just to name a few. These secular trends are also driving growth in the other recent additions to our data business, pricing and analytics, desktops and connectivity. Our acquisitions over the last 3 years, including NYSE Euronext, SuperDerivatives, Interactive Data and Trayport, bring a unique range of assets to support our growth. Our new services range from real-time bond pricing and indices to global infrastructure for exchange and broker connectivity to widely distributed desktops. 
We continue to make great progress on the advancement of Interactive Data since its closing in December. Last month, we launched the ICE U.S. Treasury Indices to leverage the index business that was part of the NYSE, with the capabilities we found at Interactive Data. And we're in the process of aligning our global sales and shared services teams to better serve our customers and realize efficiencies. 
Moving now to Slide 10. I'll note that growth in our global markets and clearing houses continues. Just as with data, there are similar secular growth opportunities as the markets continue to evolve. Customers are increasingly adopting hedging practices as well as, more recently, seeking those solutions to do so in the most capital efficient manner. And hedging is needed regardless of price levels of commodities. Nearly 2 years ago, when oil prices began falling, many suggested that trading and clearing volumes would decline with prices. The reality is just the opposite because absolute price levels tend not to drive risk management activities, volatility does. 
In our global oil and agricultural products, we've seen consistent demand for the risk management that our exchanges and clearing houses offer. Our core benchmark contracts continued their growth and innovation, for example, ICE Brent futures set volume, revenue and open interest records in the quarter and spawned the launch of a Brent contract to better serve our Asian customers at ICE Futures Singapore. Growth in our agricultural markets were once again lead by our world sugar contract, with revenue up 17% over the prior first quarter. 
Our financial markets, ranging from European rates to global index benchmarks to credit markets, also continued to strengthen. In our Euribor contract, which is Europe's short-term interest-rate benchmark, revenue increased 34% year-to-year on Central Bank actions and the dynamics around the euro, pound and dollar. Volume in our equity index complex across FTSE, MSCI and Russell grew over the prior first quarter, consistent with our cash equities and actuary option markets where volatility continued to drive growth. 
I'll wrap up our strategic highlights on Slide 11, with an update on our achievements at the New York Stock Exchange, where we're delivering on the synergies that we promised as well as driving new revenue growth. Our investment in new systems, coupled with simplifying our offerings, continues to create a better market structure for market participants. 
In U.S. cash equities, we had a record quarter with strong volume and market share that continue to grow, coupled with strong revenue capture. We lead in ETP listings with 82% of the new assets under management choosing to list with NYSE this quarter. And we maintained listings for 92% of our U.S. ETP assets under management. We continue to be the premier listing venue due to our liquidity, tight bid-ask spreads and the amount of time that these security trade at the National Best Bid and Offer price on our exchange. We're working closely with ETP issuers to help enable their ongoing innovation to grow this investment category. 
In our NYSE listings business, revenue grew despite the quite quarter for IPOs. And we have great momentum with an IPO pipeline that began to open up in April. We're expanding our issuer services and rolling out our new NYSE Connect platform to all listed companies later this month. These services are an important part of value proposition that we bring to our listed companies, and these are not revenue line item for us, but part of what drives our leadership in listings. There remains no more trusted model for our issuers, which is why the NYSE is growing, with the first quarter representing the best quarter in its 224-year history. 
I'll close on Slide 12, noting our track record of growth, execution and results. This year has already been a productive one, just one quarter in. We reviewed and chose not to pursue the LSE transaction. We grew revenues, reduced expenses and increase synergies. We continue to expand margins and drove double-digit earnings growth, and we invested for growth, repaid debt and returned dividend capital. 
So I'd like to thank our customers for their business in what was the best quarter in our company's history. And I'd like to thank our team for their continued hard work. My colleagues and I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress throughout the year. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our operator, Rocco, who'll be glad to turn you on so that we can take your questions."

Then when we acquired SuperDerivatives, and ultimately, Interactive Data, we acquired sales teams that had even more connection to the buyside. And at the New York Stock Exchange, every quarter, we have large quarterly meetings with significant buyside participants that I also attend as well as many of my colleagues.

What's going on with the number of users around our exchanges, and that tends to be driven by what's going on in the overall global markets or the commodity markets generally. And that line is continue to trend up. But now by being able to supplement that with the business that we bought at Interactive Data to offer more products through a seemless and secure connection, that combination gives us the confidence that the overall business will grow 6% to 7% for the year, which is an acceleration of what we've seen over the last year or so and also versus what we saw at Interactive Data in their history."

I appreciate you asking it. So it's really driven by 2 things, primarily. First of all, in the first quarter, as I mentioned, we had the release of a non-income tax reserve of about $11 million. Those happen from time-to-time. The size or timing is difficult to predict, so that's not something we would expect to repeat in the second quarter. And so that would cause a natural increase in SG&A quarter-to-quarter. And then the second part of it is what you mentioned. The compensation increases really don't kick in for us until March. And so effectively, in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q, you get a full quarter versus 1 month. That would push comp up probably $9 million to $10 million on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And embedded in there as well is an R&D tax credit that we had in the first quarter. So overall, that's -- those are really the 2 key drivers that move you up quarter-to-quarter. My expectation is in the range, it will probably in the lower part of that range in the second quarter. And then we'll stay within that range, trending slightly higher within in it as we move through the rest of the year."

That partly why I think we had permission from our shareholders to do M&A is that we've earned their trust, that we will deliver what we say we're going to do and that they can count on it. And so when we can't get visibility and don't have confidence, it makes it very, very hard for us to look our shareholders in the eye and suggest that we're going to deliver a specific amount of performance.

Well, first of all, I don't want to comment too much because they're going to go through a competition review that's going to open up a lot of opportunity for the entire market to comment on competition issues. And so I don't want to prejudge any of that. But with respect to their offering, it's been very unclear to us what is being offered. And so I don't know how to react to it. Let me just make one point of color about our company, unrelated to them. I'm going to be very clear. I'm talking about ICE. ICE operates clearing houses around the world. We operate largely on a common technology platform. We have global customers that we serve. And in many of our clearing houses, we have highly similar or highly correlated products. If it was easy to figure out how to net that down, we would be doing it, because we have every incentive in the world to offer the best offering that we can for our customer base. The reality is that in different jurisdictions, there are different bankruptcy regimes. And when -- just as we saw when MF Global collapsed, the way people were treated in the U.S., as soon as the court stepped in and the administrators, and we -- the way people were treated in our clearing houses outside the U.S. was very different, even though the products were similar, the customers were similar and the risks were similar. And so these things complicate the ability to do cross-border integrations. We continue to work on it. We've been actually working on that topic for years, had lots of dialogue with regulators and customers on how it might be accomplished. But it is a very difficult problem to solve. Because at the end of the day, people don't want money in-flight cross-border at the moment of bankruptcy. And regulators tend to come in and regulate locally during these moments of stress. And that's just a fact that all of us are trying to figure out how to work around."

You mentioned integration of sales team and really getting -- selling IDC products again. When we talked to management of IDC last year before you owned them, it sounded like they've really been focused inwards and getting the products line right and not really selling. So just wondering where you are in that process and actually selling again? Just this one anecdote, we talked to one bank the other day. They said they don't even know who IDC salesperson is.

We also have all these various touch points. And so the real effort that's going on now is to bring everyone together so that we have single-point subcontracts for our large customers so that they know how to get access to the entire suite of products that we have. And we can see already that, that's just in the early stages, and we can see already that just the work that we've done alone around IDC has improved our sales function and has allowed our revenues to grow. And we think it's only going to get better. It's a high priority for us because we really do believe that this company grows by having a close relationship to our customers because the end up giving us ideas and ask -- tell us about their problems and give us an opportunity to create solutions that they will ultimately acquire from us. And so it's very, very high priority, and it's the work that is going on right now.

In other words, that they completely hedged out their risk. The people that do that are not end-users. The people that do that are dealers. People that are offering something to one party and then immediately hedging it out so that they take out risk. That dealer community is under pressure, as you, I'm sure, know. It's been shrinking, if you look at announcements that are going on. So it's unclear that the paradigms of the past necessarily are going to be the paradigms of the future.

Well, we've been living with -- the whole industry's been living with the prospect of these rules being implemented now for many, many years. So we continue to get our businesses ready to be responsive to those rules. I think the way it impacts the entire market is that there's a goal to create more competition, which to you and I means more fragmentation of markets. We also think that it will be very, very difficult and hard and very little incentive for any third party to start a major clearing house when the existing tier houses have open access. So in an odd way, while it's meant to stimulate competition, it, at the end of the day, probably entrenches the incumbents, including ICE, who has a large clearing presence in Europe. So we continue to build out our capabilities inside that clearing house to get ready for access. And we've continued to make sure that the ancillary services that we provide around the trading venues, where we do believe there will be fragmentation, offer a lot of capabilities to our end-users. So you've seen us take on the ability to create more indices, improve the data offerings, improve the kind of consultative compliance services that we offer to our customers. We've worked hard on improving our delivery mechanisms for physical products and all of those kinds of things, which will all largely become unbundled as the market fragments and create opportunities for us."

The -- as I think I've mentioned in other kinds of businesses, people have figured out ways of expanding the market. That expansion, while it benefits them, also has side benefits, often times that benefits us. And I think you're seeing that in the numbers. As fragmented markets, in my mind, are bad for end-users, they're very good for intermediaries. They create much more arbitrage capability that brings a new kind of arbitrageur to the market that wants the leg in all of the various different venues, which drives volume. And so ICE really doesn't care about market share. We really want to have people that want to value our services and pay us to provide them.

And we've been involved in extensive dialogues with the ratings agencies over the past few months on exactly your point, which is the business model that ICE had and the financial structure and capital structure that ICE had when we did the NYSE deal back in 2013 versus where we sit today in 2016 is very different. Pre-NYSE, 80% to 90% of our revenues were volumes based. Post-NYSE, it was still 70% to 75%. We're now at a point where our annuity-like businesses are about half our revenues, which introduces significant stability in to the financial model. You saw the very strong cash flows in the first quarter. Why you can't multiply that times 4? Because it's got our annual listings billing in it. We clearly are on track to a number that's going to around $2 billion of operating cash flows for the year, which you'll note is significantly above where we were the prior year. Our CapEx needs have grown slightly. And so even netting that out, our free cash flow are very significant. You saw in the quarter alone, we were able to knock 0.3 of point of leverage out in the first quarter. And so I think all of that summed up. It is why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're now comfortable once we get below 2x leverage, which we think we can do late this year or certainly early next year. We believe that will support our overall rating. And that rating's important to us. And so we're going to do the things that are necessary to support it. But as you mentioned, I don't think 1.5x is that bogey anymore, given what we've done. I think we could comfortably operate around $175 million, $180 million, and again, below 2x. I think we're back-active, looking at ways to return addition capital to our shareholders, and we're looking forward to doing that."

Well, we -- first of all, there are tremendous synergies across the range of businesses that we've acquired recently, and that's really what our plans call for us doing is unlocking those synergies -- the revenue synergy opportunities across them. But just by way of example, we launched these new treasury indices at IDC, but we were able to develop those using a very strong team that we have at the NYSE that has very intimate relationships with large ETP and ETF providers. So we're able to very quickly have a dialogue with a unique customer base over their new product sets, their ideas on how they're going to grow that market and what capabilities we may have to support them, that neither company has a stand-alone hat on their own. And it was amazing that we were able to pull that together within the first month or so of ownership, and it's paying dividends. Obviously, we announced very quickly that BlackRock was moving some large ETP products onto those indices, and now our team is out working with a lot of other providers and users of the indices to advance and accelerate those products. I would just make the point to you that much of this data revenue that we are talking about the subscription-based, which gives Scott the ability to have great confidence when he tells you that it's going to grow at 6% to 7% this year. Because many of those contracts are being signed or have already been signed, so we have tremendous visibility into them. Those tend to recur. So that's the nice thing about that model. So looking forward, we would hope that we're doing a good job with those customers, and that they will continue to re-sign with us. And meanwhile, we take the products that we've developed out on the road and find new customers for them so that we can have growth on growth."

And you can see the results that we posted, which is we're doing phenomenally well. When you step back and look at payment for order flow, while it became accepted within the intermediary community around the equities markets, giving equity kickbacks to large institutions that have very strong brands and are trying to appeal to retail customers in an era where the SEC and the Labor Department and others are very concerned that retail investors be given good guidance as to how their money is being handled. It's a real reputational brand risk for somebody to step into that quagmire. It would beg the question, ""Did somebody create a product simply to generate churn inside of it and get these equity kickbacks or was that really the best listing venue?"" What I will tell you is that all of us in financial services are under pressure by new regulation and also just best practices to make sure that we have no single point of failure in our businesses. And the big institutional investment firms are subject to those same kinds of reviews and pressure. So we expect that in that ETP, ETF market, that people will, for diversity purposes, list across a range of venues. But it's not really economically-driven, it's really diversity-driven. We have such a strong offering, with 92% of AUM at NYSE. And you could see what -- in the face of the pressure you talked about, 82% of the AUM that was listing in the first quarter came to us. The reason that, that is such a strong venue is that we have very, very deep liquidity on the exchange, the NYSE Arca exchange, where we list these platforms. Market-makers, infrastructures are rules set that really enables these innovative and fabulous listings to come to us and know that they have every opportunity for growth and success. NYSE is a brand that is known around the world, and we have been passported into most countries. And so the platform that we can offer somebody in terms of distribution is really unparalleled. And it's those things that are driving the listings. I don't believe that payment for order flow is going to have a material impact on this business, nor should it. And I also, as you probably know, think it's a corrosive mechanism that actually ultimately hurts markets. And so hopefully, I'm right, and we won't see that corrode these really neat, innovative ETPs that are coming out."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Kelly mentioned, the slides to which we'll refer this morning can also be found on the ICE homepage.

As Kelly mentioned, the slides to which we'll refer this morning can also be found on the ICE homepage. 
I'll begin on Slide 4 of that presentation, where you will see that we delivered another record quarter, including adjusted earnings per share, which rose 20% as reported versus the first quarter of 2015. As this is the first full quarter, including our recent acquisitions, unless otherwise noted, year-over-year figures will reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma first quarter 2015 results. 
On that basis, ICE's first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to a record $3.68. Both our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment contributed meaningfully to first quarter revenues, which in total, grew 5% to $1.2 billion. This solid revenue performance, combined with disciplined expense management, allowed us to expand operating margins by 5 points to 59%. Equally important, these results help generate strong operating cash flows, which enabled us to pay over $100 million in dividends, up 14% from the fourth quarter, while also allowing us to significantly reduce our leverage, which stood at only 2.5x just 3 months post the closing of Interactive Data transaction. 
Moving to Slide 5, you'll see the components of our strong earnings growth. Revenue growth of 5%, combined with a 6% decline in adjusted operating expenses, generated adjusted operating income growth of 14%. Net income attributable to ICE grew 18%, and we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We achieved these strong results despite a challenging quarter for institutional trading desks, continued regulatory change and while executing on a range of strategic initiatives, from the integration of previously acquired companies and continued product and technology innovation to evaluations of additional value-enhancing M&A opportunities. We remain committed to generating strong financial performance in the current period even as we develop strategies to enhance our returns on investment in the future. 
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll walk through our new segment reporting. First quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year-over-year to nearly $1.2 billion. The chart on the left side of the slide shows our revenues were evenly split between our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. 
Turning to the table on the right side of the slide, you'll note a similar balance of growth across the diverse line items that constitute each segment. For example, as shown on the table, total trading and clearing segment revenues grew 4% year-to-year with solid contributions from both commodities and financials, which grew 5% and 4%, respectively. Within those balance results, ICE Brent, sugar, Euribor and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits. Our data and listings segment revenues grew 5% in the first quarter. Our pricing and analytics revenues were up 6% and exchange data revenues were up 9%, both driven primarily by new users and new products. As these results demonstrate, we are already seeing the expected acceleration in the growth of the legacy interactive data pricing reference data business. This strong start further supports our confidence that our data revenues can grow 6% to 7% on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. 
Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first quarter despite a quiet IPO environment. The growth in the first quarter and our confidence that our listings business will continue to grow throughout 2016 is due to our clear leadership in capital-raising activity at the NYSE over the last few years. And I'm pleased to say that we've already seen a handful of IPOs early in Q2, and our pipeline continues to build. 
Let's shift to Slide 7 where I'll cover our disciplined expense management and provide update on expense guidance and synergies. First quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 6% year-over-year to $476 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by 5 points. Our first quarter expenses included higher-than-usual M&A-related spending, but that was largely offset by some 2015 credits in compensation and professional services. The period also benefited from the release of roughly $11 million of nonincome tax-related reserves, which was partially offset by a few nonoperating expenses below the operating income line. More importantly, even adjusting for these impacts, we would have been below our expense guidance as we once again realized synergies sooner than expected. 
This strong first quarter expense performance and our updated synergy expectations result in us lowering our full year expense guidance to between $1.97 billion and $2.0 billion. This improved guidance reflects expected 2016 expense synergies of $85 million to $90 million, that's up from prior guidance of $75 million. And this includes $30 million to $35 million from Interactive Data, which has also improved from prior guidance of $25 million. For the second quarter, we expect expenses in the range of $495 million to $505 million. The second quarter will be the first one to reflect the full impact of 2016 compensation increases, and we will also see a pickup in investments related to business development and CapEx.
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our solid cash generation, improving leverage profile and ongoing capital return. We generated nearly $600 million of operating cash flow during the first quarter, which enabled us to invest in growth even as we reduced our debt by over $500 billion and returned over $100 million to our shareholders through dividends. As a result of our strong cash flow generation, we reduced our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.5x at the end of the first quarter. We now believe we can reduce our leverage below 2x by early next year, which we think is sufficient to maintain our current debt rating, while also creating more flexibility for additional capital returns. We also increased our first quarter dividend payout by 14% versus the fourth quarter, consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend as we grow our earnings. 
Our record first quarter results show our continued focus and execution across our businesses. We delivered solid revenue growth, strong operating margin expansion and, once again, double-digit earnings growth. And importantly, we see strong demand from our customers and encouraging trends across the markets we serve. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

The first quarter of 2016 was the best quarter in our company's history for both revenue and earnings. And it was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We delivered 20% earnings per share growth in the quarter as a result of expanding our revenues and reducing expenses and while making investments for long-term growth. These strong results demonstrate our consistent focus on increasing our top line, expense discipline, cash flow generation, returns on invested capital and our capital returns. 
This morning, we announced our decision to end our current review of a potential offer for the London Stock Exchange group. We thought that the combination may have a compelling rational, including bringing together the premier transatlantic capital-raising venues, offering complementary interest rate and financial products and providing widespread equity, LIBOR and fixed income indices, together with extensive market data. 
So over the last year, members of our board and our advisers attempted unsuccessfully to arrange meetings through the LSE Chairman to discuss these ideas. Then following our public expression in March of interest under the U.K. Takeover Code, the LSE Chairman and CEO did not engage with ICE. Notwithstanding, we spent the last 2 months reviewing the data that we were provided with our financial advisers, auditors and legal and regulatory experts to determine whether our operations, expense basis and governance structures would result in a strategic combination that would meet ICE's return on investment thresholds, while offering LSE shareholders a meaningful share price premium. The disappointing level of engagement at the LSE ultimately did not allow us to make a complete determination of the integration benefits and the related risks that ICE would required to support a bid. 
We are committed to building on our track record of creating shareholder value by achieving the targets that we set at the outset of our strategic transactions. Because we were unable to establish, to our satisfaction, the financial models, risk undertakings and integration plans needed to set such targets, we're turning our focus to other opportunities to build on our track record of growth. 
As our results today show, our deliberations did not get in the way of ICE growing its revenues, increasing synergies, reducing expenses, utilizing our strong cash flows to delever and increasing our dividend. I am proud that our team has once again delivered strong operational results and the best quarter in our history even as we considered strategy opportunities.
And I'll now highlight some of the opportunities set that we have, starting on Slide 9. Our team has driven our range of new initiatives in recent months. From launching our Singapore Exchange and clearing house to introducing new equities trading platforms and issuer services at NYSE, to expanding our data valuation network businesses. Each of these initiatives is on track, thanks to our global team that drive these efforts. 
So let's start with data, which is our most recent area of expansion. It's worth noting that 10 years ago, in 2006, 11% of our consolidated revenues were derived from market data. Today, 41% of our revenues are from our data business, where the breadth of our products and services continued to expand. We're already seeing the benefits of enhancing the consistency of our revenues with solid margin and growth profile the subscription revenues bring. We've long seen the trend of more data and connectivity consumption as markets became more automated, regulated and clear. And we've been an early mover in addressing the rising demand for information and analytics across virtually all asset classes. This is similar to our recognition of clearing becoming a centerpiece of market infrastructure a decade ago. And I'd like to note that even today, the category of exchange data, which is our traditional proprietary data, is still 11% of our significantly expanded total revenue base. And it continues to grow alongside of our highly complementary trading and clearing businesses. 
We've previously discussed the secular drivers of rising data demand, including regulatory reform, automation, unbundling, fragmentation and the move towards passive investing and indexation, just to name a few. These secular trends are also driving growth in the other recent additions to our data business, pricing and analytics, desktops and connectivity. Our acquisitions over the last 3 years, including NYSE Euronext, SuperDerivatives, Interactive Data and Trayport, bring a unique range of assets to support our growth. Our new services range from real-time bond pricing and indices to global infrastructure for exchange and broker connectivity to widely distributed desktops. 
We continue to make great progress on the advancement of Interactive Data since its closing in December. Last month, we launched the ICE U.S. Treasury Indices to leverage the index business that was part of the NYSE, with the capabilities we found at Interactive Data. And we're in the process of aligning our global sales and shared services teams to better serve our customers and realize efficiencies. 
Moving now to Slide 10. I'll note that growth in our global markets and clearing houses continues. Just as with data, there are similar secular growth opportunities as the markets continue to evolve. Customers are increasingly adopting hedging practices as well as, more recently, seeking those solutions to do so in the most capital efficient manner. And hedging is needed regardless of price levels of commodities. Nearly 2 years ago, when oil prices began falling, many suggested that trading and clearing volumes would decline with prices. The reality is just the opposite because absolute price levels tend not to drive risk management activities, volatility does. 
In our global oil and agricultural products, we've seen consistent demand for the risk management that our exchanges and clearing houses offer. Our core benchmark contracts continued their growth and innovation, for example, ICE Brent futures set volume, revenue and open interest records in the quarter and spawned the launch of a Brent contract to better serve our Asian customers at ICE Futures Singapore. Growth in our agricultural markets were once again lead by our world sugar contract, with revenue up 17% over the prior first quarter. 
Our financial markets, ranging from European rates to global index benchmarks to credit markets, also continued to strengthen. In our Euribor contract, which is Europe's short-term interest-rate benchmark, revenue increased 34% year-to-year on Central Bank actions and the dynamics around the euro, pound and dollar. Volume in our equity index complex across FTSE, MSCI and Russell grew over the prior first quarter, consistent with our cash equities and actuary option markets where volatility continued to drive growth. 
I'll wrap up our strategic highlights on Slide 11, with an update on our achievements at the New York Stock Exchange, where we're delivering on the synergies that we promised as well as driving new revenue growth. Our investment in new systems, coupled with simplifying our offerings, continues to create a better market structure for market participants. 
In U.S. cash equities, we had a record quarter with strong volume and market share that continue to grow, coupled with strong revenue capture. We lead in ETP listings with 82% of the new assets under management choosing to list with NYSE this quarter. And we maintained listings for 92% of our U.S. ETP assets under management. We continue to be the premier listing venue due to our liquidity, tight bid-ask spreads and the amount of time that these security trade at the National Best Bid and Offer price on our exchange. We're working closely with ETP issuers to help enable their ongoing innovation to grow this investment category. 
In our NYSE listings business, revenue grew despite the quite quarter for IPOs. And we have great momentum with an IPO pipeline that began to open up in April. We're expanding our issuer services and rolling out our new NYSE Connect platform to all listed companies later this month. These services are an important part of value proposition that we bring to our listed companies, and these are not revenue line item for us, but part of what drives our leadership in listings. There remains no more trusted model for our issuers, which is why the NYSE is growing, with the first quarter representing the best quarter in its 224-year history. 
I'll close on Slide 12, noting our track record of growth, execution and results. This year has already been a productive one, just one quarter in. We reviewed and chose not to pursue the LSE transaction. We grew revenues, reduced expenses and increase synergies. We continue to expand margins and drove double-digit earnings growth, and we invested for growth, repaid debt and returned dividend capital. 
So I'd like to thank our customers for their business in what was the best quarter in our company's history. And I'd like to thank our team for their continued hard work. My colleagues and I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress throughout the year. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our operator, Rocco, who'll be glad to turn you on so that we can take your questions."

But any indication of what's driving that, where you're seeing that increased demand? I know there's a lot of regulatory changes, whether it's on the banks and the FCMs on their clients, in terms of trying to figuring out how to hedge, how to clear in this kind of dynamic and changing landscape.

Well, let me start, and then I'm going to ask Scott to give you a little more detail behind the numbers. But when you step back, one of the changes that I've noticed at ICE is that when we acquired Creditex, Creditex had a platform that was once called T-Zero, today, it's called ICE Connect. That was connected to hundreds of buyside participants. And we continued to grow that connectivity since we acquired the firm, and used that to link the buyside to our clearing houses. Then when we acquired SuperDerivatives, and ultimately, Interactive Data, we acquired sales teams that had even more connection to the buyside. And at the New York Stock Exchange, every quarter, we have large quarterly meetings with significant buyside participants that I also attend as well as many of my colleagues. And so long story short what has gradually happened in our company is that we've been able to broaden our footprint and our touch points to ultimate end-users, and they are the ones that are really driving the growth of more screens and more consumption of information."

So if you noticed in the quarter, our desktops and connectivity revenues were up 3%. And that's more people wanting to get connected to us. And once they're connected to us, that allows them to consume the data products that we're selling and the breadth, of the offering that we've got continues to grow. And then that translates up into what you saw in our pricing business that grew 6% and our exchange data business that grew 9%. I've talk to you over the years, and I look at it every single month. What's going on with the number of users around our exchanges, and that tends to be driven by what's going on in the overall global markets or the commodity markets generally. And that line is continue to trend up. But now by being able to supplement that with the business that we bought at Interactive Data to offer more products through a seemless and secure connection, that combination gives us the confidence that the overall business will grow 6% to 7% for the year, which is an acceleration of what we've seen over the last year or so and also versus what we saw at Interactive Data in their history."

I appreciate you asking it. So it's really driven by 2 things, primarily. First of all, in the first quarter, as I mentioned, we had the release of a non-income tax reserve of about $11 million. Those happen from time-to-time. The size or timing is difficult to predict, so that's not something we would expect to repeat in the second quarter. And so that would cause a natural increase in SG&A quarter-to-quarter. And then the second part of it is what you mentioned. The compensation increases really don't kick in for us until March. And so effectively, in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q, you get a full quarter versus 1 month. That would push comp up probably $9 million to $10 million on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And embedded in there as well is an R&D tax credit that we had in the first quarter. So overall, that's -- those are really the 2 key drivers that move you up quarter-to-quarter. My expectation is in the range, it will probably in the lower part of that range in the second quarter. And then we'll stay within that range, trending slightly higher within in it as we move through the rest of the year."

That partly why I think we had permission from our shareholders to do M&A is that we've earned their trust, that we will deliver what we say we're going to do and that they can count on it. And so when we can't get visibility and don't have confidence, it makes it very, very hard for us to look our shareholders in the eye and suggest that we're going to deliver a specific amount of performance. And I don't have anything under the Takeover Code that's going to change that perception. It takes engagements in order to come to those kinds of determinations. And I'll just leave it at that."

And so I don't want to prejudge any of that. But with respect to their offering, it's been very unclear to us what is being offered. And so I don't know how to react to it. Let me just make one point of color about our company, unrelated to them. I'm going to be very clear. I'm talking about ICE. ICE operates clearing houses around the world. We operate largely on a common technology platform. We have global customers that we serve. And in many of our clearing houses, we have highly similar or highly correlated products. If it was easy to figure out how to net that down, we would be doing it, because we have every incentive in the world to offer the best offering that we can for our customer base. The reality is that in different jurisdictions, there are different bankruptcy regimes. And when -- just as we saw when MF Global collapsed, the way people were treated in the U.S., as soon as the court stepped in and the administrators, and we -- the way people were treated in our clearing houses outside the U.S. was very different, even though the products were similar, the customers were similar and the risks were similar. And so these things complicate the ability to do cross-border integrations. We continue to work on it. We've been actually working on that topic for years, had lots of dialogue with regulators and customers on how it might be accomplished. But it is a very difficult problem to solve. Because at the end of the day, people don't want money in-flight cross-border at the moment of bankruptcy. And regulators tend to come in and regulate locally during these moments of stress. And that's just a fact that all of us are trying to figure out how to work around."

That doesn't include whatever you're buying from S&P, which I believe $100 million annualized revenue. So just clarify that. And then for you, Jeff, on a bigger picture. You mentioned integration of sales team and really getting -- selling IDC products again. When we talked to management of IDC last year before you owned them, it sounded like they've really been focused inwards and getting the products line right and not really selling. So just wondering where you are in that process and actually selling again? Just this one anecdote, we talked to one bank the other day. They said they don't even know who IDC salesperson is.

And so we are already competing against that kind of offering. I would just -- stepping back, if you say how many people in the world are there that have OTC interest rate swaps that are fully or largely offset with futures contracts. In other words, that they completely hedged out their risk. The people that do that are not end-users. The people that do that are dealers. People that are offering something to one party and then immediately hedging it out so that they take out risk. That dealer community is under pressure, as you, I'm sure, know. It's been shrinking, if you look at announcements that are going on. So it's unclear that the paradigms of the past necessarily are going to be the paradigms of the future.

But other than that, we're competing in that world today, and we're doing really well."

Well, we've been living with -- the whole industry's been living with the prospect of these rules being implemented now for many, many years. So we continue to get our businesses ready to be responsive to those rules. I think the way it impacts the entire market is that there's a goal to create more competition, which to you and I means more fragmentation of markets. We also think that it will be very, very difficult and hard and very little incentive for any third party to start a major clearing house when the existing clearing houses have open access. So in an odd way, while it's meant to stimulate competition, it, at the end of the day, probably entrenches the incumbents, including ICE, who has a large clearing presence in Europe. So we continue to build out our capabilities inside that clearing house to get ready for access. And we've continued to make sure that the ancillary services that we provide around the trading venues, where we do believe there will be fragmentation, offer a lot of capabilities to our end-users. So you've seen us take on the ability to create more indices, improve the data offerings, improve the kind of consultative compliance services that we offer to our customers. We've worked hard on improving our delivery mechanisms for physical products and all of those kinds of things, which will all largely become unbundled as the market fragments and create opportunities for us."

And so we have very high prospects for that franchise going forward. There are always going to be entrants to this business. The -- as I think I've mentioned in other kinds of businesses, people have figured out ways of expanding the market. That expansion, while it benefits them, also has side benefits, often times that benefits us. And I think you're seeing that in the numbers. As fragmented markets, in my mind, are bad for end-users, they're very good for intermediaries. They create much more arbitrage capability that brings a new kind of arbitrageur to the market that wants the leg in all of the various different venues, which drives volume. And so ICE really doesn't care about market share. We really want to have people that want to value our services and pay us to provide them. And so that's the market that we focus on, which is a subset of what you're talking about. And we're doing really, really well in the market for people that want to pay for services, and that's why we continue to grow."

And we've been involved in extensive dialogues with the ratings agencies over the past few months on exactly your point, which is the business model that ICE had and the financial structure and capital structure that ICE had when we did the NYSE deal back in 2013 versus where we sit today in 2016 is very different. Pre-NYSE, 80% to 90% of our revenues were volumes based. Post-NYSE, it was still 70% to 75%. We're now at a point where our annuity-like businesses are about half our revenues, which introduces significant stability in to the financial model. You saw the very strong cash flows in the first quarter. Why you can't multiply that times 4? Because it's got our annual listings billing in it. We clearly are on track to a number that's going to around $2 billion of operating cash flows for the year, which you'll note is significantly above where we were the prior year. Our CapEx needs have grown slightly. And so even netting that out, our free cash flow are very significant. You saw in the quarter alone, we were able to knock 0.3 of point of leverage out in the first quarter. And so I think all of that summed up. It is why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're now comfortable once we get below 2x leverage, which we think we can do late this year or certainly early next year. We believe that will support our overall rating. And that rating's important to us. And so we're going to do the things that are necessary to support it. But as you mentioned, I don't think 1.5x is that bogey anymore, given what we've done. I think we could comfortably operate around $175 million, $180 million, and again, below 2x. I think we're back-active, looking at ways to return addition capital to our shareholders, and we're looking forward to doing that."

Well, we -- first of all, there are tremendous synergies across the range of businesses that we've acquired recently, and that's really what our plans call for us doing is unlocking those synergies -- the revenue synergy opportunities across them. But just by way of example, we launched these new treasury indices at IDC, but we were able to develop those using a very strong team that we have at the NYSE that has very intimate relationships with large ETP and ETF providers. So we're able to very quickly have a dialogue with a unique customer base over their new product sets, their ideas on how they're going to grow that market and what capabilities we may have to support them, that neither company has a stand-alone hat on their own. And it was amazing that we were able to pull that together within the first month or so of ownership, and it's paying dividends. Obviously, we announced very quickly that BlackRock was moving some large ETP products onto those indices, and now our team is out working with a lot of other providers and users of the indices to advance and accelerate those products. I would just make the point to you that much of this data revenue that we are talking about is subscription-based, which gives Scott the ability to have great confidence when he tells you that it's going to grow at 6% to 7% this year. Because many of those contracts are being signed or have already been signed, so we have tremendous visibility into them. Those tend to recur. So that's the nice thing about that model. So looking forward, we would hope that we're doing a good job with those customers, and that they will continue to re-sign with us. And meanwhile, we take the products that we've developed out on the road and find new customers for them so that we can have growth on growth."

And you can see the results that we posted, which is we're doing phenomenally well. When you step back and look at payment for order flow, while it became accepted within the intermediary community around the equities markets, giving equity kickbacks to large institutions that have very strong brands and are trying to appeal to retail customers in an era where the SEC and the Labor Department and others are very concerned that retail investors be given good guidance as to how their money is being handled. It's a real reputational brand risk for somebody to step into that quagmire. It would beg the question, ""Did somebody create a product simply to generate churn inside of it and get these equity kickbacks or was that really the best listing venue?"" What I will tell you is that all of us in financial services are under pressure by new regulation and also just best practices to make sure that we have no single point of failure in our businesses. And the big institutional investment firms are subject to those same kinds of reviews and pressure. So we expect that in that ETP, ETF market, that people will, for diversity purposes, list across a range of venues. But it's not really economically-driven, it's really diversity-driven. We have such a strong offering, with 92% of AUM at NYSE. And you could see what -- in the face of the pressure you talked about, 82% of the AUM that was listing in the first quarter came to us. The reason that, that is such a strong venue is that we have very, very deep liquidity on the exchange, the NYSE Arca exchange, where we list these platforms. Market-makers, infrastructures are rules set that really enables these innovative and fabulous listings to come to us and know that they have every opportunity for growth and success. NYSE is a brand that is known around the world, and we have been passported into most countries. And so the platform that we can offer somebody in terms of distribution is really unparalleled. And it's those things that are driving the listings. I don't believe that payment for order flow is going to have a material impact on this business, nor should it. And I also, as you probably know, think it's a corrosive mechanism that actually ultimately hurts markets. And so hopefully, I'm right, and we won't see that corrode these really neat, innovative ETPs that are coming out."

For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our Form 10-K for 2015.
In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.
In the Appendix of our presentation and the earnings release, you'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.

I'll begin on Slide 4 and highlight that the second quarter was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. 
Our performance was driven by revenues that grew 7% and adjusted operating expenses that decline 1% year-over-year. We generated adjusted operating income growth of 15% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 3 points to 56%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% versus the prior year to $3.43. And we've continued momentum in our transaction business in July, growing data revenues and lower expenses, we're well positioned in 2016 to extend our decade-long track record of double-digit earnings growth. 
As you'll see as I move to Slide 5, our second quarter performance contributed to strong results for the first half of 2016. We generated consolidated net revenues of $2.3 billion during the first half of the year. Both are trading in clearing segment and our data and listing segment grew 6% versus the first half of 2015. This solid top line growth combined with disciplined expense management allowed us to expand operating margins by 5 points to 58% and to grow earnings per share 16% to $7.12. 
Additionally, we generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the first half of 2016, which enabled us to pay over $200 million [ph] in dividends even as we reduce our leverage to 2.4x just 6 months post the closing of our Interactive Data acquisition. 
These strong financial results enabled by our globally diverse business model supported our board's authorization of a $1 billion share repurchase program and our $0.85 per share dividend for the third quarter. We also announced last the pursuit a 5-for-1 stock split to ensure that our stock trades as efficiently as possible in a fragmented markets and that it is more accessible to a broad range of shareholders. 
Let's move to Slide 6, where I'll provide some more details on our first half revenue performance. 52% of the $2.3 billion in revenue came from our data and listing segment and 48% came from our trading and clearing segment. Each segment grew 6% year-over-year. You'll find further detail on each segment's revenue on the right side of the slide. 
In the trading and clearing segment, commodities revenue grew 10% with a strong contributions from both our energy and ag markets. Financials revenues grew 2% with continued strength in our equity index markets, partially offset by muted European interest rate volume. Notably, volume in ICE Brent, sugar, other ags, MSCI and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits during the first half of the year. 
Within our data and listings segment, pricing and analytics revenues grew 6% and exchange data revenues increased by 13% year-to-year. This strong performance was enabled by a high retention rate of existing customers, the acquisition of new customers and the development of new and enhanced product designed to efficiently deliver more value to all of our customers. 
Each of our data offerings are benefiting from customers recognition of the increasing value of readily available, easy-to-consume information. This nascent trend reflects our customers need to deal with the challenges of the volatile markets and uncertain political and economic environment in which they operate. We continue to expect our full year 2016 data revenues to grow between 6% and 7% on a pro forma basis despite the recent significant decline in the pound Sterling in which roughly 9% of our total data revenues are build. Further, though we expect this currency impact to cause a sequential decline in revenues of $6 million in the third quarter, we believe fourth quarter data revenues could approach $500 million even at current spot rates. 
Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior year first half, and we hosted some notable IPOs as activity picked up late in the second quarter. Going forward, we're confident that our unique market model and strong issuer services will continue to support the capital raising needs of the world's most innovative companies and exchange traded product issuers. 
Please turn to Slide 7 where I'll discuss our disciplined expense management and provide updated and improved guidance. First half adjusted operating expenses declined 4% year-over-year to $970 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by 5 points. 
As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies sooner than expected. The majority of our corporate functions are well along the path to integration. Our technology and operations teams have built clear integration road maps. And perhaps most importantly, the ICE data sales team is now fully integrated and well positioned to better serve our customers with a complete range of data solutions. 
Given our solid execution, we now expect to realize roughly $50 million in synergies from Interactive Data this year and approximately $100 million in combined expense synergies during 2016. 
Accordingly, we now expect our full year adjusted expenses to be in a range between $1.94 billion and $1.97 billion, including adjusted expenses in the range of $485 million to $495 million in the third quarter. 
This updated and improved full year guidance reflects the $60 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement consists of an additional $25 million in synergies and roughly $35 million largely related to the currency impact of the lower pound. 
We run a diverse global business that is subject to currency fluctuations. Given the size of the change in the pound related to the Brexit vote, I want to take a brief moment to give you some color on how you should think about this in the context of our second half financial performance. 
With roughly 11% of our total revenues and 15% of our consolidated expenses denominated in pounds, we have a natural hedge that mitigates a meaningful portion of the impact to profit. Therefore, even though the currency-driven decline in revenue exceeds the expense reduction on a dollar basis, we expect the net impact to earnings to be immaterial and it will not impede our ability to extend our track record of delivering double-digit earnings growth to 11 years. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our cash generation, leverage and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the first half of the year and deploy that cash to invest around $150 million in CapEx to reduce our debt by nearly $800 million and to return over $200 million the shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.4x at the end of June. 
We believe that by the end of this year or early next, we can reduce our leverage to a level that will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating even as we increase our capital return and consider other strategic investments. This solid cash generation and rapid deleveraging supports our board's authorization of a new $1 billion stock buyback program and our ability to grow our cash dividend as we grow. 
Our record first half results reflect our commitment to serving customers and generating strong returns for our investors. We are expanding and improving the products we offer in the markets we serve. We are growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. 
We are reducing expenses, debt and leverage, and we have invested strategically to build a diverse business model that we believe will allow us to continue to deliver consistent earnings growth, solid cash generation and leading returns on investment. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

I'll provide an update on our strategy that's delivering the strong growth that we detail this morning and then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. 
On Slide 9 of the result of our strategic approach to transforming our company into a global financial services leader. 
Since our IPO in November of 2005, we've grown EPS fivefold and we've grown our share price tenfold by building on the changing needs of our customers. Rather than simply retracing the path to seek growth, we've been future focused on the intersection of financial services and technology to offer more services to our expanding base of customers. 
We began as an energy trading platform and strategically transformed the company to become a global operator of exchanges and clearing houses and become a top-tier provider of proprietary data solutions. This successful evolution of our business occurred despite the financial crisis, evolving regulations, tumultuous global markets and economic cycles. We stayed focused amid these dynamic times on innovating to solve our customers challenges, bringing solutions long before they were widely appreciated by the market. 
This very point is highlighted on the Slide 10, where you could see the virtuous cycle created by our global ecosystem of exchanges, clearing houses, information and connectivity, which is an unparalleled model relative to more specialized data providers and market operators. 
Data and trading are symbiotic and serve as integral inputs into our customers workflow. For many customers access to our data drives more trading, which in turn creates the information used for investing, for settlement, compliance, collateral management, reporting and numerous other functions, all of which drive the rise in consumption of data. 
The services listed on this slide represents solutions across a vast range of our clients workflow. And because these services are part of an integrated offering, they create a strong value proposition. For example, our markets are widely accessible via the ICE Desktop, Mobile and Messenger Applications, which we offer integrated solutions for our customers trading, information and risk management needs on a common technology platform. 
We also offer vast sets of proprietary data for nonexchange-traded fixed income markets, which represent some of the world's largest addressable markets. Today, we're pricing millions of bonds for thousands of customers each day and within the fixed income markets, invested assets under management continue to rise. 
For example, exchange-traded fixed income funds have quickly risen to over $585 billion, now accounting for 20% of total U.S. ETP assets under management. ICE also has an expanding set of solutions to serve active fixed income managers, such as pricing and reference data, continuous elevated evaluative prices, liquidity indicators and best execution identification. The role of these new services is highlighted around the times of market volatility and the Brexit vote was an example of an event that is reinforced the importance of real-time information tools. 
In addition, ongoing demand is being driven by regulation, by market fragmentation, volatility and the uncertainty around global central bank actions. You can see on Slide 11 that our approach to driving change has produced consistent top line growth, with record annual earnings for the last decade regardless of the economy or the market cycle or commodity prices or the level of interest rates or increasing regulation or the many other headlines and headwinds that have occurred over the last 10 years. 
It is such market and economic disruptions that make our risk management services valuable and ICE's performance relative to the broader sector over the same time validates the model that we've built to benefit from change. 
In that context, I'll say a few words about Brexit, which we view was another opportunity to drive our set of differentiated solutions. We've dedicated meaningful resources to our London operations and for good reasons. The United Kingdom has tremendous location and time zone advantages in global markets. It has a strong set of regulatory and legal frameworks that have promoted confidence and ICE have highly-qualified team of colleagues that have time and time again contributed to our successful navigation of change. 
Since the Brexit vote, we've had an active dialogue with senior officials in the U.K. government to discuss the types of policies that will facilitate our continued investment. 
We're looking forward to this ongoing dialogue, and we're very optimistic about the government's focus on preserving a competitive climate for business. ICE also operates exchanges and clearing houses in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and in Continental Europe. Our decision to be globally diverse is a result of customer demand to have choices for important markets in local jurisdictions. 
We've been open and transparent about our views that there will be continued fragmentation and balkanization of markets as they become are electronic and more locally regulated. These trends and unpredictable events like the Brexit referendum and Central Bank moves remind the market of the value of having different data sets readily available. And we believe that these factors increase the need for our proprietary data and the relevance for our globally distributed model. 
Moving now to Slide 12, I'll review the solid performance in our global markets. The strength of our markets as demonstrated by the fact that trading and clearing revenues or 12 of our 13 key markets grew year-to-year in the second quarter. As you can see on the slide, volume and open interest in our crude, agriculture, sterling and MSCI products is strong and growing. 
Another benefit of operating diverse global market is the ability to gain both exposure and diversification. For example, while European interest rates, which made up 4% of our total revenues, was the 1 asset class were transaction revenues declined year-to-year in the second quarter, we earned market data revenues from that business. And importantly, trading and clearing volumes again grew by double digits in June and July. 
Moving to Slide 13, I'll note the 14% revenue growth in our cash equities market year-to-date, which produced strong U.S. cash flow and enables us to serve the one of the largest global securities markets with data and listings. 
We've continued to improve and enhance this market over the last 2.5 years since our acquisition, while growing revenues and expanding market share at the same time. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see the ongoing contribution of credit derivatives clearing in both Europe and the U.S. We've seen greater regulatory certainty in the U.S., draw more CDS clearing to the U.S. and away from Europe with record level participation from the buy-side. 
I'll note that we are approaching the milestone of $100 trillion in notional value cleared by ICE. Through a great deal of innovation, we now clear nearly 600 credit derivative interest instruments, driving $53 million in revenue in the first half. 
Last week, we announced our agreement to sell the U.S. voice brokerage assets of Creditex to agreement, which represents approximately 10% of our global CDS revenues. ICE is not selling the valuable electronic post-trade assets of Creditex that helped us support the launch and are continuing contributor to our ongoing operations in CDS clearing. 
We are also retaining Creditex electronic trading assets as we continue to build on our solutions for the credit markets. As we announced yesterday, we've seen early traction in our new single-named CDS electronic trading platform called ICE swap that we launched in June. This is an all-to-all platform for single name CDS, which has gotten the attention of major dealers and buy-side clients who are asking for more liquidity and transparency in these markets. So we've been very strategic with the acquisition of Creditex by leveraging it to create a group of assets that have generated a positive return on that original investment and which continue to contribute -- continued to contribute to our earnings. 
Turning to a slight 14, I'm pleased to say that not only is the integration of Interactive Data running ahead of schedule but more importantly, we're well on track to achieve our 2016 revenue growth targets. 
In June, we announced the reorganization of all our data businesses into ICE Data Services which brings together our analytics, desktops, mobile apps, indices, exchange data and connectivity solutions under a global data brand to serve our customers comprehensively. 
While there remains much integration work yet to be done, the early feedback from our customers is that we're on the right track. Our ICE U.S. Treasury index family has grown with new indices and new customers. They've been selected as the new benchmarks for a range of ETPs now offered by [ph] iShares, the leading provider of fixed income ETPs; Directs, a provider for ETPs with over $10 billion in assets under management; and [ph] Securities Investment Trust Companies, a comprehensive financial services firm serving the Asia Pacific region; and Invesco Power Shares recently filed to begin using ICE indices in the ETP products. 
Our revenue mix of from transaction-based revenues towards more recurring subscription-based revenues continues to grow as the evolution of the market continues to transfer value to this mission-critical offerings. 
With a high revenue renewal rate in our pricing and analytics business, we become a key source for consistent and reliable pricing and reference data. We're often asked if the growth of our data business is levered to headcount at the banks. It is not. 
First and most evidently, our data revenues have grown during and since the financial crisis. While headcount and parts of the financial services industry may have declined since that time, the need for information, connectivity and risk management from ICE has risen consistent with our data revenues. The consumption of data is rising due to secular trends, such as the move to indexation, the rise of ETPs, market fragmentation, independent valuation demands, regulatory reporting, real-time distribution needs and automated trading. 
The sheer breadth of our services and our positioning at the value-added end of the data spectrum gives us confidence in our growth projections. 
Turning to our listings business. The market for initial public offerings improved once the volatility of the first quarter abated. The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in global proceeds rate, including hosting 5 -- the 5 largest IPOs by market cap to-date in 2016. Those are Lion Corporation, China Online Education, U.S. Foods, MGM Growth and Patheon. NYSE also was the home to the 2 largest technology IPOs year-to-date, Lion and [ph]. 
NYSE continues to lead in ETP listings and host 92% of assets under management. We're working closely with issuers to develop more solutions and value-added services in addition to enhanced market quality. 
Importantly, the listings business also drives growth across our trading and data lines. You can see that even as we deliver on our synergies, the NYSE is a growth-oriented business for us and we're proud of the work of our team has done to strengthen and grow this valuable business. 
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 15, where you can see we are very well positioned to build on our decade-long track record. Our strong start to the year was driven by revenue growth, faster synergy realization, margin expansion and 19%, as reported, adjusted earnings growth in the first half of this year. 
We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow, repaid nearly $800 million in debt, demonstrated our commitment to capital return with $1 billion share repurchase authorization and announced a planned stock split. 
So I'd like to thank our customers for their business and I want to thank our team for their continued hard work. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our operator, Keith. We'll be glad to take your questions."

This is Jeff. It's interesting because I try to make the a point on multiple calls now that we believe that the markets are going to become more fragmented now that they're more electronic and more regulation is being put on markets at the local level. And in some of our core markets, what you've seen is some people come in and pay for order flow. And so what we've done is readjusted essentially our data offering and the way we disseminated and charge for it so that we can benefit from those payments into the market. So when somebody pays for order flow, you attract a new kind of trader. You actually in our mind grow the market by bringing people in that want to receive those payments. And those people tend to hang on the primary market in order to receive those payments. And so what we do is basically have a compact with them that they will receive those payments and pass some of them back to us in the form of increased data revenues. When a company goes in and wants to get paid for order flow, it tends to do 1 of 2 things. It's either uses algorithms or it's own trading style to basically churn so that it is constantly buying and selling but accepting no risk. Or they come up with strategies where you can put on positions that actually show up in open interest but they carry no risk. And so there've been a lot of talk in our industry about market share, people like to talk about market share and we like to talk about earnings. And that's why I always start my recent presentations showing you our earnings growth because we have decided that the way to maximize our earnings growth is to participate in that trend with our customers who want to receive payments from others. And so there's been a big spike up in that area and I expect honestly that this is a macro trend that we're going to see more fragmentation due to a number of factors and that you continue to see growth in our core data offering."

And a difficult not to crack in a sense that we do continue to build out continued capabilities in risk management to serve fixed income and interest rate markets. And that has been a constant source of investment for us, as you've indicated, over a number of years. Whether or not we actually would enter that space on our own is yet to be determined. There's some M&A going on right now, the [ph] deal. It's hard to understand what kind of offering that deal will have, given the fact that they're now in 2 different regulatory jurisdictions. It's hard to understand what the complexities of regulation may be between the U.K. and the EU. So that may open and operating or may foreclose an opportunity, depends on how things play out. I would also mentioned to you that the interest rate swaps business in our mind is largely people doing fixed for floating swaps. In other words, commercial borrowers like ICE and Scott Hill who is sitting across from me, may choose to lock in floating interest rates for a period generally 5 years or so. But in this low interest rate environment, it's hard to imagine that locking in low interest rates as a growth market. And so one of the things that we promised is earnings growth, and we tend to look for trends where we can position ourselves early to be part of the growth. And it's very unclear whether the interest rate swaps market is one of those markets. So I say all of that in the sense of that we've not made a decision yet on what to do and when to do it, but we do continue to build out capability so that we have optionality around that decision."

We've seen it in the products that we've been able to package up in our data. So the interest levels have continued to grow. And as we sign up more users, as we're able to offer more information in various forms or various packages of information, yes, we've seen fee increases related to that. And so that's really helped to drive the revenue. And to some extent, when you look at our commodities growth in the first half at 10%, that's across the energy and ag and there's a lot of volatility in those markets, a lot of drivers that are -- and there are different drivers, it's weather in Brazil, it's Middle East and U.S. oil issues that are driving oil. And as you're trying to figure out what's going on a volatile world, you need data and you need information. And so as people see that need, you describing it, we see a user growth and we see existing users wanting more information and all of that's contributed to very strong growth in that business. And the thing that excites me about it is not just the data revenue growth in and of itself. But that data growth, coupled with there are still open interest in our commodities business is a good leading indicator, not necessarily for any given month or quarter. But as we look forward, it says the interest in the market we're serving remains very high with importantly, the commercial customers who are actually taking a view on price and actively managing the risk."

And much of what we have been doing over the last few years in the way we've been building out this data offering and distribution vehicle is set up for that. We firmly believe that markets are going to become more fragmented. It's very different today when they're used to be open out [ph] floors in regional jurisdictions with a name of the city on them, it was very hard to compete. Today, there are a lot of a very sophisticated electronic platform operators that can simply pay for order flow and start a market. And so we believe that there will be fragmentation. We've seen it in the most fragmented markets that we operated in, in the U.S. cash equities market. But what changes there is that as those payments are made, there's an opportunity to participate in. And that's really what we've been doing.

What I didn't say at that time that I can say now is that, at the time, we did not want to talk about Brexit, and we've been urged by others not to talk about Brexit. But the way that deal was lining up, it was orchestrated so that we were going to, if we entered the deal, have to put a number on the table right ahead of the Brexit vote. We happen to have [ph] the times 3 U.K. directors who sat on our board who are incredibly knowledgeable people that are very engaged with us and they were cautioning management and the rest of the board that the Brexit vote was going to be close and they caution us back in February and March. And really said you guys need to know exactly what you're doing and you need to run scenarios and what's going to happen in either eventuality. So we went out and we started talking to our U.K. colleagues to try to gauge where we thought the vote was going to come out. And honestly, we came to the opinion that the U.K. was probably going to leave. And so we decided, given that we didn't have good information and given that we thought the landscape is going to change, that, that was not an appropriate time for us to do a transaction. I will tell you that so, and I think that we were fortunate in making that decision. I don't know what the European landscape is going to be. We have been building our company to have a lot of options and we've been very open about that. We've been very transparent that we, long ago, decided to build a footprint on the Continental Europe with an exchange and clearing house because we felt that there could be some fragmentation and balkanization that our customers would have demands. So we're set up for change but I don't know what the change is going to be.

We've had very open dialogue with the ratings agencies and they've indicated a comfort level with our current rating in that range. I don't think that means we have to necessarily be in that range to start the repurchases, but we certainly need to have a path to get to that range quickly as we introduce the repurchases. And so in terms of timing, the other thing I'd say is there are always a number of variables. You asked about M&A in 2017. I've no idea what that could look like. We've got the S&P deal that we expect will close later this year. We've got the Cetip [ph] deal that's working its way through the process. So they're any number of factors that could impact the timing and the size of the repurchases. I think what the authorization tells you is we are deleveraging at a faster rate than we anticipated. We had originally said we wouldn't be there until the end of next year. Now we're saying possibly by the end of this year. And so, look, it's out of the question that we are back in the market in the fourth quarter but there'll be a number of variables that impact that.

Right now, honestly, if you just step back and think about the world and your own behavior, the amount of data that we're all consuming just goes up. I mean, I've no doubt the data but I have on my smartphone is going to consume more data in 5 years than it does today. And in every aspect of our lives and certainly here at ICE, the way we run our business, there is just more data available and we have better and better tools to use that data and analyze that data. When it comes to trading and risk management, there's no question that we're going to have more passive investments vehicles. Those are doing well and growing and growing quickly. There's no question that decisions are going to be made increasingly by algorithms or they're going to contributed to the decision-making process. And in my mind -- and there's no question that regulators are going to demand and frankly Board of Directors and the Audit Committee and auditors are going to demand better information faster than they've gotten it before. And so all those trends just suggest to us that there is an incredible future demand for information and what we are trying to do is figure out areas where we really generate some unique proprietary content that will be of high value to our customers. And so that's been our focus. And so far, the early returns have been really good. And frankly, on some of the sales meetings that I've been in, we've gotten a lot of positive feedback that it's nice to have a large-scale vendor information to people that is very technology-focused and cybersecurity focused like we are to fit into their current demands for information."

And I think we're seeing benefit on that in terms of securing new customers and again, as I said, on the exchange data side, similarly in the pricing and valuation side, I think, it's customers who are purchasing more. It's something -- beginning to gain traction and new products. Continuos volume pricing the product that allows you to read that the to get a view on the price of the bonds that you may be interested in trading or that you hold in your portfolio.

So I think that's why I'm confident about our ability to grow the rest of this year and into next year. As we do look at are we capturing the right value in our pricing? Are there different ways we package up across the various businesses that we've owned?

So it's not as easy as saying, yes, we're just going to go over of everything that is out there because there's some great companies but they are fully valued by the market right now. So we have to be somewhat creative. I'll just quickly mentioned [ph]. I've got years and years ago, many people on this call would ask us what is our strategy in the interest rate space? And we knew that there were some dominance and important people in that space and it would be hard to compete because we started breaking down the interest rate market and trying to think of where either opportunities that we could enter the market. And we started to focus on the mortgage space and this was before the financial crisis. And very gracious gentlemen, Bill Gruger [ph], who is a banker at JP Morgan said, well, I can introduce you to the people at [ph]. Mirsky is an industry consortium of 5,000 members in the mortgage community, including everybody that matters in the mortgage community. And we started to talk to Maersk prior to the financial crisis about whether or not they're a good opportunity to privatize it. The financial crisis intervened. Maersk was involved in effectively Robo signing mortgages on behalf of lender and got very involved and put into conservatorship follow with Fannie and Freddie. It is now made its way through that and it's ready to have continued investment, a new look, a new outlook, and we were able to convince the members that, that consortium should privatize with ICE and that we will help bring them together. About 5 years ago, we never announced but we did by a mortgage platform and a team in Silicon Valley that was working on some advanced techniques around mortgages. We've continued to quietly build that out and obviously worked with Maersk over the last 2 years and how we could put these systems together. And we're thrilled to announce that we are going to work with the Maersk team that Fannie and Freddie and some of the bank interests are going to stay on the board of the company to help us. And that we think there is a really interesting opportunity to bring some evolution to the broad market for residential mortgages in the United States. Small deal in terms of how it exist today, but it could have larger repercussions if we get all together and work on the successfully. So it's great to see long, long cycle actually close and they feel it's been a long 1 cycle as well."

But that being said, there are a lot of smaller players, niche players, that existed in the region that were not going to come to London and the real key that we had in Singapore is getting to those new customers, getting them to join the exchange, getting them to set up in the clearinghouse. These are brokers, these are commodity merchants and others across the broad region of Asia and we've had good success there. And really if you look at our focus, it's not on day-to-day volume, it's on chipping away about a targeted customer list and getting them through the process that the MAS or the regulator in Singapore requires to be passported into a Singapore Exchange and clearing house. And that work is ongoing and it's going well and everyday, it is a network effect to everyday that somebody joins, new joins or takes interest, it spills over to the next person and so we feel like we're making very good progress there."

That is a single exchange, it has very deep liquidity and single exchange. We have other competitors that like to add together 3 or 4 exchanges and then show a number. But the ETP sponsors don't really care about the volume across a bunch of fragmented markets. They want to know is a great depth of liquidity in the market were discussing is primary going to trade. That is a real competitive advantage that we have. And then when we couple that with all the other services that we can provide that are value added, we've done seen that we continue to do very well. I would mention there's something like 4 ETP, new ETP listings per day. So the vast majority unfortunately, like any new businesses are probably not going to grow very big and amount to much. They become highly differentiated and specialized in many cases.

I'll begin on Slide 4 and highlight that the second quarter was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. 
Our performance was driven by revenues that grew 7% and adjusted operating expenses that declined 1% year-over-year. We generated adjusted operating income growth of 15% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 3 points to 56%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% versus the prior year to $3.43. And we've continued momentum in our transaction business in July, growing data revenues and lower expenses, we're well positioned in 2016 to extend our decade-long track record of double-digit earnings growth. 
As you'll see as I move to Slide 5, our second quarter performance contributed to strong results for the first half of 2016. We generated consolidated net revenues of $2.3 billion during the first half of the year. Both are trading and clearing segment, and our data and listings segment grew 6% versus the first half of 2015. This solid top line growth combined with disciplined expense management allowed us to expand operating margins by 5 points to 58% and to grow earnings per share 16% to $7.12. 
Additionally, we generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the first half of 2016, which enabled us to pay over $200 billion (sic) [ $200 million ] in dividends even as we reduced our leverage to 2.4x just 6 months post the closing of our Interactive Data acquisition. 
These strong financial results enabled by our globally diverse business model supported our board's authorization of a $1 billion share repurchase program and our $0.85 per share dividend for the third quarter. We also announced plans to pursue a 5-for-1 stock split to ensure that our stock trades as efficiently as possible in a fragmented market and that it is more accessible to a broad range of shareholders. 
Let's move to Slide 6, where I'll provide some more details on our first half revenue performance. 52% of the $2.3 billion in revenue came from our data and listings segment, and 48% came from our trading and clearing segment. Each segment grew 6% year-over-year. You'll find further detail on each segment's revenue on the right side of the slide. 
In the trading and clearing segment, commodities revenues grew 10% with strong contributions from both our energy and ag markets. Financials revenues grew 2% with continued strength in our equity index markets, partially offset by muted European interest rate volume. Notably, volume in ICE Brent, sugar, other ags, MSCI and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits during the first half of the year. 
Within our data and listings segment, pricing and analytics revenues grew 6% and exchange data revenues increased by 13% year-to-year. This strong performance was enabled by a high retention rate of existing customers, the acquisition of new customers and the development of new and enhanced products designed to efficiently deliver more value to all of our customers. 
Each of our data offerings are benefiting from customers recognition of the increasing value of readily available, easy-to-consume information. This nascent trend reflects our customers need to deal with the challenges of the volatile markets and uncertain political and economic environments in which they operate. We continue to expect our full year 2016 data revenues to grow between 6% and 7% on a pro forma basis despite the recent significant decline in the pound Sterling in which roughly 9% of our total data revenues are build. Further, though we expect this currency impact to cause a sequential decline in revenues of $6 million in the third quarter, we believe fourth quarter data revenues could approach $500 million even at current spot rates. 
Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first half, and we hosted some notable IPOs as activity picked up late in the second quarter. Going forward, we're confident that our unique market model and strong issuer services will continue to support the capital raising needs of the world's most innovative companies and exchange traded product issuers. 
Please turn to Slide 7 where I'll discuss our disciplined expense management and provide updated and improved guidance. First half adjusted operating expenses declined 4% year-over-year to $970 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by 5 points. 
As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies sooner than expected. The majority of our corporate functions are well along the path to integration. Our technology and operations teams have built clear integration road maps. And perhaps most importantly, the ICE data sales team is now fully integrated and well positioned to better serve our customers with a complete range of data solutions. 
Given our solid execution, we now expect to realize roughly $50 million in synergies from Interactive Data this year and approximately $100 million in combined expense synergies during 2016. 
Accordingly, we now expect our full year adjusted expenses to be in a range between $1.94 billion and $1.97 billion, including adjusted expenses in the range of $485 million to $495 million in the third quarter. 
This updated and improved full year guidance reflects the $60 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement consists of an additional $25 million in synergies and roughly $35 million largely related to the currency impact of the lower pound. 
We run a diverse global business that is subject to currency fluctuations. Given the size of the change in the pound related to the Brexit vote, I want to take a brief moment to give you some color on how you should think about this in the context of our second half financial performance. 
With roughly 11% of our total revenues and 15% of our consolidated expenses denominated in pounds, we have a natural hedge that mitigates a meaningful portion of the impact to profit. Therefore, even though the currency-driven decline in revenue exceeds the expense reduction on a dollar basis, we expect the net impact to earnings to be immaterial, and it will not impede our ability to extend our track record of delivering double-digit earnings growth to 11 years. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our cash generation, leverage and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the first half of the year and deployed that cash to invest around $150 million in CapEx to reduce our debt by nearly $800 million and to return over $200 million to shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.4x at the end of June. 
We believe that by the end of this year or early next, we can reduce our leverage to a level that will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating even as we increase our capital return and consider other strategic investments. This solid cash generation and rapid deleveraging supports our board's authorization of a new $1 billion stock buyback program and our ability to grow our cash dividend as we grow. 
Our record first half results reflect our commitment to serving customers and generating strong returns for our investors. We are expanding and improving the products we offer in the markets we serve. We are growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. 
We are reducing expenses, debt and leverage, and we have invested strategically to build a diverse business model that we believe will allow us to continue to deliver consistent earnings growth, solid cash generation and leading returns on investment. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

I'll provide an update on our strategy that's delivering the strong growth that we detailed this morning, and then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. 
On Slide 9 of the results of our strategic approach to transforming our company into a global financial services leader. 
Since our IPO in November of 2005, we've grown EPS fivefold, and we've grown our share price tenfold by building on the changing needs of our customers. Rather than simply retracing the path to seek growth, we've been future focused on the intersection of financial services and technology to offer more services to our expanding base of customers. 
We began as an energy trading platform and strategically transformed the company to become a global operator of exchanges and clearing houses and become a top-tier provider of proprietary data solutions. This successful evolution of our business occurred despite the financial crisis, evolving regulations, tumultuous global markets and economic cycles. We stayed focused amid these dynamic times on innovating to solve our customers' challenges, bringing solutions of long before they were widely appreciated by the market. 
This very point is highlighted on Slide 10, where you can see the virtuous cycle created by our global ecosystem of exchanges, clearing houses, information and connectivity, which is an unparalleled model relative to more specialized data providers and market operators. 
Data and trading are symbiotic and serve as integral inputs into our customers workflow. For many customers access to our data drives more trading, which in turn creates the information used for investing, for settlement, compliance, collateral management, reporting and numerous other functions, all of which drive the rise in consumption of data. 
The services listed on this slide represents solutions across a vast range of our clients workflow. And because these services are part of an integrated offering, they create a strong value proposition. For example, our markets are widely accessible via the ICE desktop, mobile and messenger applications, which we offer integrated solutions for our customers trading, information and risk management needs on a common technology platform. 
We also offer vast sets of proprietary data for nonexchange-traded fixed income markets, which represent some of the world's largest addressable markets. Today, we're pricing millions of bonds for thousands of customers each day, and within the fixed income markets, invested assets under management continue to rise. 
For example, exchange-traded fixed income funds have quickly risen to over $585 billion, now accounting for 20% of total U.S. ETP assets under management. ICE also has an expanding set of solutions to serve active fixed income managers, such as pricing and reference data, continuous evaluated prices, liquidity indicators and best execution identification. The role of these new services is highlighted around the times of market volatility and the Brexit vote was an example of an event that is reinforced the importance of real-time information tools. 
In addition, ongoing demand is being driven by regulation, by market fragmentation, volatility and the uncertainty around global central bank actions. You can see on Slide 11 that our approach to driving change has produced consistent top line growth, with record annual earnings for the last decade regardless of the economy or the market cycle or commodity prices or the level of interest rates or increasing regulation or the many other headlines and headwinds that have occurred over the last 10 years. 
It is such market and economic disruptions that make our risk management services valuable, and ICE's performance relative to the broader sector over the same time validates the model that we've built to benefit from change. 
In that context, I'll say a few words about Brexit, which we view as another opportunity to drive our set of differentiated solutions. We've dedicated meaningful resources to our London operations and for good reasons. The United Kingdom has tremendous location and time zone advantages in global markets. It has a strong set of regulatory and legal frameworks that have promoted confidence, and ICE has a highly-qualified team of colleagues that have time and time again contributed to our successful navigation of change. 
Since the Brexit vote, we've had an active dialogue with senior officials in the U.K. government to discuss the types of policies that will facilitate our continued investment. 
We're looking forward to this ongoing dialogue, and we're very optimistic about the government's focus on preserving a competitive climate for business. ICE also operates exchanges and clearing houses in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and in Continental Europe. Our decision to be globally diverse is a result of customer demand to have choices for important markets in local jurisdictions. 
We've been open and transparent about our views that there will be continued fragmentation and balkanization of markets, as they become are electronic and more locally regulated. These trends and unpredictable events like the Brexit referendum and Central Bank moves remind the market of the value of having different data sets readily available. And we believe that these factors increase the need for our proprietary data and the relevance for our globally distributed model. 
Moving now to Slide 12. I'll review the solid performance in our global markets. The strength of our markets as demonstrated by the fact that trading and clearing revenues were 12 of our 13 key markets grew year-to-year in the second quarter. As you can see on the slide, volume and open interest in our crude, agriculture, sterling and MSCI products is strong and growing. 
Another benefit of operating diverse global markets is the ability to gain both exposure and diversification. For example, while European interest rates, which made up 4% of our total revenues, was the one asset class where transaction revenues declined year-to-year in the second quarter, we earned market data revenues from that business. And importantly, trading and clearing volumes again grew by double digits in June and July. 
Moving to Slide 13, I'll note the 14% revenue growth in our cash equities markets year-to-date, which produced strong U.S. cash flow and enables us to serve one of the largest global securities markets with data and listings. 
We've continued to improve and enhance this market over the last 2.5 years since our acquisition, while growing revenues and expanding market share at the same time. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see the ongoing contribution of credit derivatives clearing in both Europe and the U.S. We've seen greater regulatory certainty in the U.S., draw more CDS clearing to the U.S. and away from Europe with record level participation from the buy-side. 
I'll note that we are approaching the milestone of $100 trillion in notional value cleared by ICE. Through a great deal of innovation, we now cleared nearly 600 credit derivative interest instruments, driving $53 million in revenue in the first half. 
Last week, we announced our agreement to sell the U.S. voice brokerage assets of Creditex to sell a pre-bond, which represents approximately 10% of our global CDS revenues. ICE is not selling the valuable electronic post-trade assets of Creditex that helped us support the launch and are continuing contributor to our ongoing operations in CDS clearing. 
We're also retaining Creditex electronic trading assets, as we continue to build on our solutions for the credit markets. As we announced yesterday, we've seen early traction in our new single-name CDS electronic trading platform, called ICE swap, that we launched in June. This is an all-to-all platform for single-name CDS, which has gotten the attention of major dealers and buy-side clients who are asking for more liquidity and transparency in these markets. So we've been very strategic with the acquisition of Creditex by leveraging it to create a group of assets that have generated a positive return on that original investment and which continued to contribute -- continued to contribute to our earnings. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'm pleased to say that not only is the integration of Interactive Data running ahead of schedule, but more importantly, we're well on track to achieve our 2016 revenue growth targets. 
In June, we announced a reorganization of all our data businesses into ICE Data Services, which brings together our analytics, desktops, mobile apps, indices, exchange data and connectivity solutions under a global data brand to serve our customers comprehensively. 
While there remains much integration work yet to be done, the early feedback from our customers is that we're on the right track. Our ICE U.S. Treasury Index family has grown with new indices and new customers. They've been selected as the new benchmarks for a range of ETPs now offered by BlackRock iShares, the leading provider of fixed income ETPs. Direxion, a provider of ETPs with over $10 billion in assets under management; and Yuanta Securities Investment Trust Company, a comprehensive financial services firm serving the Asia Pacific region; and Invesco PowerShares recently filed to begin using ICE indices in ETP products. 
Our revenue mix of from transaction-based revenues towards more recurring subscription-based revenues continues to grow as the evolution of the market continues to transfer value to these mission-critical offerings. 
With a high revenue renewal rate in our pricing and analytics business, we become a key source for consistent and reliable pricing and reference data. We're often asked if the growth of our data business is levered to headcount at the banks. It is not.  First and most evidently, our data revenues have grown during and since the financial crisis. While headcount in parts of the financial services industry may have declined since that time, the need for information, connectivity and risk management from ICE has risen consistent with our data revenues. The consumption of data is rising due to secular trends, such as the move to indexation, the rise of ETPs, market fragmentation, independent valuation demands, regulatory reporting, real-time distribution needs and automated trading. The sheer breadth of our services and our positioning at the value-added end of the data spectrum gives us confidence in our growth projections. 
Turning to our listings business. The market for initial public offerings improved once the volatility of the first quarter abated. The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in global proceeds rate, including hosting 5 -- the 5 largest IPOs by market cap to-date in 2016. Those are Lion Corporation, China Online Education, U.S. Foods, MGM Growth and Patheon. NYSE also was the home to the 2 largest technology IPOs year-to-date, Lion and Twilio.
NYSE Arca continues to lead in new ETP listings and host 92% of assets under management. We're working closely with issuers to develop more solutions and value-added services in addition to enhanced market quality. 
Importantly, the listings business also drives growth across our trading and data lines. You can see that even as we deliver on our synergies, the NYSE is a growth-oriented business for us, and we're proud of the work that our team has done to strengthen and grow this valuable business. 
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 15, where you can see we are very well positioned to build on our decade-long track record. Our strong start to the year was driven by revenue growth, faster synergy realization, margin expansion and 19%, as reported, adjusted earnings growth in the first half of this year. 
We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow, repaid nearly $800 million in debt, demonstrated our commitment to capital return with $1 billion share repurchase authorization and announced a planned stock split. So I'd like to thank our customers for their business and I want to thank our team for their continued hard work. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our operator, Keith. We'll be glad to take your questions."

This is Jeff. Well, it's interesting because I tried to make the point on multiple calls now that we believe that the markets are going to become more fragmented, now that they're more electronic and more regulation is being put on markets at the local level. And in some of our core markets, what you've seen is some people come in and pay for order flow. And so what we've done is readjusted essentially our data offering and the way we disseminated and charge for it so that we can benefit from those payments into the market. So when somebody pays for order flow, you attract a new kind of trader. You actually in our mind grow the market by bringing people in that want to receive those payments. And those people tend to hang on the primary market in order to receive those payments. And so what we do is basically have a compact with them that they will receive those payments and pass some of them back to us in the form of increased data revenues. When a company goes in and wants to get paid for order flow, it tends to do 1 of 2 things. It either uses algorithms or it's own trading style to basically churn so that it is constantly buying and selling but accepting no risk. Or they come up with strategies where you can put on positions that actually show up in open interest but they carry no risk. And so there've been a lot of talk in our industry about market share, people like to talk about market share, and we like to talk about earnings. And that's why I always start my recent presentations showing you our earnings growth because we have decided that the way to maximize our earnings growth is to participate in that trend with our customers who want to receive payments from others. And so there's been a big spike up in that area, and I expect honestly that this is a macro trend that we're going to see more fragmentation due to a number of factors and that you'll continue to see growth in our core data offering."

And a difficult nut to crack, in a sense, that we do continue to build out continued capabilities in risk management to serve fixed income and interest rate markets and that has been a constant source of investment for us, as you've indicated, over a number of years. Whether or not we actually would enter that space on our own is yet to be determined. There's some M&A going on right now, the LSE-DB deal. It's hard to understand what kind of offering that deal will have, given the fact that they're now in 2 different regulatory jurisdictions. It's hard to understand what the complexities of regulation may be between the U.K. and the EU. So that may open an opportunity or it may foreclose an opportunity, depends on how things play out. I would also mention to you that the interest rate swaps business in our mind is largely people doing fixed for floating swaps. In other words, commercial borrowers, like ICE and Scott Hill, who is sitting across from me, may choose to lock in floating interest rate for a period generally 5 years or so. But in this low interest rate environment, it's hard to imagine that locking in low interest rates is a growth market. And so one of the things that we promised is earnings growth, and we tend to look for trends where we can position ourselves early to be part of the growth. And it's very unclear whether the interest rate swaps market is one of those markets. So I say all of that in the sense that we've not made a decision yet on what to do and when to do it, but we do continue to build out capability so that we have optionality around that decision."

I mean, effectively, what he said that there are more people who are more active in the markets that we provide, and we've seen that in user growth. We've seen it in the products that we've been able to package up in our data. So the interest levels have continued to grow. And as we sign up more users, as we're able to offer more information in various forms or various packages of information, yes, we've seen fee increases related to that. And so that's really helped to drive the revenue. And to some extent, when you look at our commodities growth in the first half at 10%, that's across the energy and ag, and there's a lot of volatility in those markets, a lot of drivers that are -- and there are different drivers. It's weather in Brazil, it's Middle East and U.S. oil issues that are driving oil. And as you're trying to figure out what's going on in a volatile world, you need data and you need information. And so as people see that need, as Jeff was describing it, we see user growth, and we see existing users wanting more information and all of that's contributed to very strong growth in that business. And the thing that excites me about it is, is not just the data revenue growth in and of itself, but that data growth, coupled with very strong open interest in our commodities business, is a good leading indicator, not necessarily for any given month or quarter, but as we look forward, it says the interest in the markets we're serving remains very high with importantly, the commercial customers who are actually taking a view on price and actively managing the risk."

If in order to get into that line, you have to pay the primary market $1, so that you can get $4 of those dollars, that is a good trade. And so what we do is set up to make sure that our shareholders get a transfer of that $1 from the other persons shareholders. And much of what we have been doing over the last few years in the way we've been building out this data offering and distribution vehicle is set up for that. We firmly believe that markets are going to become more fragmented. It's very different today when they're used to be open outcry floors in regional jurisdictions with the name of the city on them, it was very hard to compete. Today, there are a lot of a very sophisticated electronic platform operators that can simply pay for order flows and start a market. And so we believe that there will be fragmentation. We've seen it in the most fragmented markets that we operated in, in the U.S. cash equities market. But what changes there is that as those payments are made, there is an opportunity to participate in. And that's really what we've been doing. We laugh a little bit around here when people put notes out talking about market share and fail to realize that behind that, that the market has actually grown and there is more wealth transfer going on.

What I didn't say at that time that I can say now is that, at that time, we did not want to talk about Brexit, and we've been urged by others not to talk about Brexit. But the way that deal was lining up, it was orchestrated so that we were going to, if we entered the deal, have to put a number on the table right ahead of the Brexit vote. We happen to have at the times, 3 U.K. directors who sat on our board who are incredibly knowledgeable people that are very engaged with us, and they were cautioning management and the rest of the board that the Brexit vote was going to be close and they cautioned us back in February and March, and really said you guys need to know exactly what you're doing, and you need to run scenarios on what's going to happen in either eventuality. So we went out, and we started talking to our U.K. colleagues to try to gauge where we thought the vote was going to come out. And honestly, we came to the opinion that the U.K. was probably going to leave. And so we decided, given that we didn't have good information and given that we thought the landscape was going to change that it was not an appropriate time for us to do a transaction. I will tell you that so, and I think that we were fortunate in making that decision. I don't know what the European landscape is going to be. We have been building our company to have a lot of options, and we've been very open about that. We've been very transparent that we, long ago, decided to build a footprint on the Continental Europe with an exchange and clearing house because we felt that there could be some fragmentation and balkanization that our customers would have demands. So we're set up for change, but I don't know what the change is going to be.

I don't think that means we have to necessarily be in that range to start the repurchases, but we certainly need to have a path to get to that range quickly as we introduced the repurchases. And so in terms of timing, the other thing I'd say is, there are always a number of variables. You asked about M&A in 2017. I've no idea what that could look like. We've got the S&P deal that we expect will close later this year. We've got the Cetip, BM&F deal that is working its way through the process. So they're any number of factors that could impact the timing and the size of the repurchases. I think what the authorization tells you is we are deleveraging at a faster rate than we anticipated.

There is no question that decisions are going to be made increasingly by algorithms or they're going to contribute to the decision-making process. And in my mind -- and there's no question that regulators are going to demand, and frankly, Boards of Directors and the Audit Committee and auditors are going to demand better information faster than they've gotten it before. And so all those trends just suggest to us that there is an incredible future demand for information, and what we are trying to do is figure out areas where we really generate some unique proprietary content that will be of high value to our customers. And so that's been our focus. And so far, the early returns have been really good.

I think, the success we're seeing right now is really, again, around the continued high retention of existing customers. Jeff's point about, as we talk to customers, their interest in having a data provider and so it's -- as opposed to showing up, as SuperD or as ICE are as IDC, we're showing up us ICE Data Services. And I think we're seeing benefit from that in terms of securing new customers, and again as I said, on the exchange data side, similarly in the pricing and valuation side, I think, it's customers who are purchasing more. It's beginning to gain traction and new products. Continuous value to pricing product that allows you during the day to get a view on the price of bonds that you may be interested in trading or that you hold in your portfolio. That's execution services. So it's really more right now, new customers, retention of existing customers, building on new product development that actually started before we purchased IDC. I think to Jeff's point, we've only really reorganized the sales team and the go-to-market in the past few weeks. So I think that's why I'm confident about our ability to grow the rest of this year and in the next year. As we do look at, are we capturing the right value in our pricing? Are there different ways we can package up across the various businesses that we've owned? Are there better ways that we can deliver the information more efficiently across the single desktop versus multiple, et cetera. So that's really benefit, I think that's in front of us, not that's reflected in the strong performance we've had in the first half."

But it -- that area was not an area that traditionally ICE had direct relationships with. And so the reason that we're excited about some of the bundling and packaging and the reorganization of our sales force is that it opens a whole new customer base to us. And what we have found, as I mentioned before, is that customer base who had been -- who often times deals with lots of data vendors appreciates having another large comprehensive offering. So that it can be kind of a one-stop shop when it comes to purchasing and security issues. Some of these things that we're providing our mission-critical services to companies that use them for regulatory purposes or reporting purposes. And so they need primaries, backups and others. They want as much information as they can, and having another large vendor enter the space has been very well received."

We're really people creating proprietary content. And so areas that are of interest to us is, where are things that where there is some content that we could help monetize through our channel. That being said, as you probably know, we operate here in an M&A -- we buy versus build on every decision we make as a buy versus build decision. And many of the valuations in the data space are quite high, and they would be certainly wouldn't operate on our return on invested capital thresholds that we operate under. So it's not as easy as saying, oh, yes, that we're just going to go, hoover up everything that's out there because there's some great companies but they are fully valued by the market right now. So we have to be somewhat creative. I'll just quickly mention MERS. ICE got years and years ago, many people on this call would ask us what is our strategy in the interest rate space? And we knew that there were some dominant and important people in that space, and it would be hard to compete. And so we started breaking down the interest rate market and trying to think of where are there opportunities that we could enter the market. And we started to focus on the mortgage space, and this was before the financial crisis. And very gracious gentlemen, Bill Cruger, who was the banker at JPMorgan said, well, I can introduce you to the people at MERS. MERS is a industry consortium of 5,000 members in the mortgage community, including everybody that matters in the mortgage community. And we started to talk to MERS prior to the financial crisis about whether or not there'd be an opportunity to privatize it. The financial crisis intervened. MERS was involved in effectively robo-signing mortgages on behalf of lenders and got very emboiled and was put into conservatorship along with Fannie and Freddie. It is now made its way through that and it's ready to have continued investment, a new look -- a new outlook, and we were able to convince the members that, that consortium should privatize with ICE and that we will help bring them together. About 5 years ago, we never announced, but we did by a mortgage platform and a team in Silicon Valley that was working on some advanced techniques around mortgages. We've continued to quietly build that out and obviously worked with MERS over the last few years on how we could put these systems together and are thrilled to announce that we are going to work with the MERS team that Fannie and Freddie and some of the bank interests are going to stay on the board of the company to help us. And that we think there is a really interesting opportunity to bring some evolution to the broad market for residential mortgages in the United States. Small deal of -- in terms of how it exist today, but it could have large repercussions if we all get together and work on this successfully. So it's great to see a long, long cycle actually close, and they feel it's been a long, long cycle as well."

And I really do believe based on conversations we've had with U.K. government that the government has incredibly strong interest in adopting policies that will continue to attract Asian business to come to London. But that being said, there are a lot of smaller players, niche players, that existed in the region that were not going to come to London and the real key that we've had in Singapore is getting to those new customers, getting them to join the exchange, getting them to set up in the clearinghouse. These are brokers, these are commodity merchants and others across the broad region of Asia, and we've had good success there. And really if you look at our focus, it's not on day-to-day volume, it's on chipping away at a targeted customer list and getting them through the process that the MAS or the regulator in Singapore requires to be passported into a Singapore Exchange and clearing house. And that work is ongoing and it's going well, and everyday -- it is a network effect, so everyday that somebody new joins or takes interest, it spills over to the next person, and so we feel like we're making very good progress there."

Well, first of all, when we talk to the sponsors of ETFs in that community, they are incredibly bullish on the demand for fixed income ETFs. It is a real growth area. And so there is tremendous interest by sponsors in that arena to talk to us about what we can do. We have a unique ability in that, that we had an ETP listings team, a very good and well-known ETP listings team at the NYSE, which we were able to combine with our index and data people and put together essentially packages that we can take to these ETP providers, where we can develop an index or replace an index, we can provide the data. We have the systems internally to do real-time calculation and NAV calculations. We can list it, we can help them market it, we can use the ICE brand, we can use the NYSE brands. So we bring a lot of assets to the table with these providers, and we're aggressive, and we're interested in this space, and so we're able to move quickly. So I think it's going to be a growth area for us. In terms of how it's monetized, we don't really carry in a package, whether it's monetizing the data or monetizing the index or monetizing the infrastructure. All of that can go together in a cauldron that can be very value-enhancing for these ETP providers. There is no question that, that it is a competitive space and that people they're are interested in speed-to-market and they're interest in low administrative costs. And so once we get those ETPs up, then we continue to market the fact that we have continuous evaluated pricing, that we have these liquidity indicators that -- and honestly, then we go to the active fund managers and talk to them about how are they going to respond to this passive trend? Then what can we do for them? So it's a really unique moment in time, and we're kind of hitting a sweet spot in the space in our mind with an opportunity set and capability set that we have.

That is a real competitive advantage that we have. And then when we couple that with all the other services that we can provide that are value added, we've done -- we've seen that we continue to do very well.

And so when we come out with a number on that at close, we're like this is the number. And we've subsequently executed on it really well. The IDC deal was a completely different deal. It was an auction, it closed the day we signed it and that's really when the integration work began in earnest. And so we are continuing to dig through, and we are seeing early success and greater success than we had counted on. And things like corporate integration, where we have been able to identify and eliminate corporate redundancies faster. We're seeing things like the 7ticks network and the safety network where we knew there might be some overlap come together and we're realizing benefits from that sooner. And so that's really the acceleration of the 25 to 50 in this year. I don't think our view on the overall synergies related to that business really have changed, the timing hasn't changed. There was a heavy piece of technology integration that has to occur. And as you know, with the NYSE acquisition, that's kind of the last chunk of synergies that we're going to realize there. I suspect that will be the case at IDC as well. We will certainly get the synergies, the timing of them. I'll give you an update on '17 as we move later into this year, and I'll give you an update on '18 as we move into the later 2017. But we said at the beginning of the year, $220 million to go. We've now got $100 million of that, that will get done this year.

We're also seeing, I think, some longer sales cycles where we're in conversations with people about wholesale changes to the way we deliver and the technology that underlies our data and the way we deliver it and the way the 2 of us are technologically connect and work together. Those are probably multiyear cycles because we both are committing to build kind of new infrastructure that will better scale for future demand. And then there's everything in between.

I'll begin on Slide 4 and highlight that the second quarter was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. 
Our performance was driven by revenues that grew 7% and adjusted operating expenses that declined 1% year-over-year. We generated adjusted operating income growth of 15% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 3 points to 56%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% versus the prior year to $3.43. And with continued momentum in our transaction business in July, growing data revenues and lower expenses, we're well positioned in 2016 to extend our decade-long track record of double-digit earnings growth. 
As you'll see as I move to Slide 5, our second quarter performance contributed to strong results for the first half of 2016. We generated consolidated net revenues of $2.3 billion during the first half of the year. Both our trading and clearing segment, and our data and listings segment grew 6% versus the first half of 2015. This solid top line growth combined with disciplined expense management allowed us to expand operating margins by 5 points to 58% and to grow earnings per share 16% to $7.12. 
Additionally, we generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the first half of 2016, which enabled us to pay over $200 million in dividends even as we reduced our leverage to 2.4x just 6 months post the closing of our Interactive Data acquisition. 
These strong financial results enabled by our globally diverse business model supported our board's authorization of a $1 billion share repurchase program and our $0.85 per share dividend for the third quarter. We also announced plans to pursue a 5-for-1 stock split to ensure that our stock trades as efficiently as possible in a fragmented market and that it is more accessible to a broad range of shareholders. 
Let's move to Slide 6, where I'll provide some more details on our first half revenue performance. 52% of the $2.3 billion in revenue came from our data and listings segment, and 48% came from our trading and clearing segment. Each segment grew 6% year-over-year. You'll find further detail on each segment's revenue on the right side of the slide. 
In the trading and clearing segment, commodities revenues grew 10% with strong contributions from both our energy and ag markets. Financials revenues grew 2% with continued strength in our equity index markets, partially offset by muted European interest rate volume. Notably, volume in ICE Brent, sugar, other ags, MSCI and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits during the first half of the year. 
Within our data and listings segment, pricing and analytics revenues grew 6% and exchange data revenues increased by 13% year-to-year. This strong performance was enabled by a high retention rate of existing customers, the acquisition of new customers and the development of new and enhanced products designed to efficiently deliver more value to all of our customers. 
Each of our data offerings are benefiting from customers' recognition of the increasing value of readily available, easy-to-consume information. This nascent trend reflects our customers' need to deal with the challenges of the volatile markets and uncertain political and economic environments in which they operate. We continue to expect our full year 2016 data revenues to grow between 6% and 7% on a pro forma basis despite the recent significant decline in the pound Sterling in which roughly 9% of our total data revenues are billed. Further, though we expect this currency impact to cause a sequential decline in revenues of $6 million in the third quarter, we believe fourth quarter data revenues could approach $500 million even at current spot rates. 
Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first half, and we hosted some notable IPOs as activity picked up late in the second quarter. Going forward, we're confident that our unique market model and strong issuer services will continue to support the capital raising needs of the world's most innovative companies and exchange traded product issuers. 
Please turn to Slide 7 where I'll discuss our disciplined expense management and provide updated and improved guidance. First half adjusted operating expenses declined 4% year-over-year to $970 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by 5 points. 
As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies sooner than expected. The majority of our corporate functions are well along the path to integration. Our technology and operations teams have built clear integration road maps. And perhaps most importantly, the ICE data sales team is now fully integrated and well positioned to better serve our customers with a complete range of data solutions. 
Given our solid execution, we now expect to realize roughly $50 million in synergies from Interactive Data this year and approximately $100 million in combined expense synergies during 2016. 
Accordingly, we now expect our full year adjusted expenses to be in a range between $1.94 billion and $1.97 billion, including adjusted expenses in the range of $485 million to $495 million in the third quarter. 
This updated and improved full year guidance reflects the $60 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement consists of an additional $25 million in synergies and roughly $35 million largely related to the currency impact of the lower pound. 
We run a diverse global business that is subject to currency fluctuations. Given the size of the change in the pound related to the Brexit vote, I want to take a brief moment to give you some color on how you should think about this in the context of our second half financial performance. 
With roughly 11% of our total revenues and 15% of our consolidated expenses denominated in pounds, we have a natural hedge that mitigates a meaningful portion of the impact to profit. Therefore, even though the currency-driven decline in revenue exceeds the expense reduction on a dollar basis, we expect the net impact to earnings to be immaterial, and it will not impede our ability to extend our track record of delivering double-digit earnings growth to 11 years. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our cash generation, leverage and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the first half of the year and deployed that cash to invest around $150 million in CapEx to reduce our debt by nearly $800 million and to return over $200 million to shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.4x at the end of June. 
We believe that by the end of this year or early next, we can reduce our leverage to a level that will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating even as we increase our capital return and consider other strategic investments. This solid cash generation and rapid deleveraging supports our board's authorization of a new $1 billion stock buyback program and our ability to grow our cash dividend as we grow. 
Our record first half results reflect our commitment to serving customers and generating strong returns for our investors. We are expanding and improving the products we offer in the markets we serve. We are growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. 
We are reducing expenses, debt and leverage, and we have invested strategically to build a diverse business model that we believe will allow us to continue to deliver consistent earnings growth, solid cash generation and leading returns on investment. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."
1081952,321421340,1023615,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll provide an update on our strategy that's delivering the strong growth that we detailed this morning, and then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session.

I'll provide an update on our strategy that's delivering the strong growth that we detailed this morning, and then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. 
On Slide 9 are the results of our strategic approach to transforming our company into a global financial services leader. 
Since our IPO in November of 2005, we've grown EPS fivefold, and we've grown our share price tenfold by building on the changing needs of our customers. Rather than simply retracing the path to past growth, we've been future focused on the intersection of financial services and technology to offer more services to our expanding base of customers. 
We began as an energy trading platform and strategically transformed the company to become a global operator of exchanges and clearing houses and become a top-tier provider of proprietary data solutions. This successful evolution of our business occurred despite the financial crisis, evolving regulations, tumultuous global markets and economic cycles. We stayed focused amid these dynamic times on innovating to solve our customers' challenges, bringing solutions long before they were widely appreciated by the market. 
This very point is highlighted on Slide 10, where you can see the virtuous cycle created by our global ecosystem of exchanges, clearing houses, information and connectivity, which is an unparalleled model relative to more specialized data providers and market operators. 
Data and trading are symbiotic and serve as integral inputs into our customers' workflow. For many customers access to our data drives more trading, which in turn creates the information used for investing, for settlement, compliance, collateral management, reporting and numerous other functions, all of which drive the rising consumption of data. 
The services listed on this slide represent solutions across a vast range of our clients workflow. And because these services are part of an integrated offering, they create a strong value proposition. For example, our markets are widely accessible via the ICE desktop, mobile and messenger applications, which we offer integrated solutions for our customers' trading, information and risk management needs on a common technology platform. 
We also offer vast sets of proprietary data for nonexchange-traded fixed income markets, which represent some of the world's largest addressable markets. Today, we're pricing millions of bonds for thousands of customers each day, and within the fixed income markets, invested assets under management continue to rise. 
For example, exchange-traded fixed income funds have quickly risen to over $585 billion, now accounting for 20% of total U.S. ETP assets under management. ICE also has an expanding set of solutions to serve active fixed income managers, such as pricing and reference data, continuous evaluated prices, liquidity indicators and best execution identification. The role of these new services is highlighted around the times of market volatility, and the Brexit vote was an example of an event that has reinforced the importance of real-time information tools. 
In addition, ongoing demand is being driven by regulation, by market fragmentation, volatility and the uncertainty around global central bank actions. You can see on Slide 11 that our approach to driving change has produced consistent top line growth, with record annual earnings for the last decade regardless of the economy or the market cycle or commodity prices or the level of interest rates or increasing regulation or the many other headlines and headwinds that have occurred over the last 10 years. 
It is such market and economic disruptions that make our risk management services valuable, and ICE's performance relative to the broader sector over the same time validates the model that we've built to benefit from change. 
In that context, I'll say a few words about Brexit, which we view as another opportunity to drive our set of differentiated solutions. We've dedicated meaningful resources to our London operations and for good reasons. The United Kingdom has tremendous location and time zone advantages in global markets. It has a strong set of regulatory and legal frameworks that have promoted confidence, and ICE has a highly qualified team of colleagues that have time and time again contributed to our successful navigation of change. 
Since the Brexit vote, we've had an active dialogue with senior officials in the U.K. government to discuss the types of policies that will facilitate our continued investment. 
We're looking forward to this ongoing dialogue, and we're very optimistic about the government's focus on preserving a competitive climate for business. ICE also operates exchanges and clearing houses in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and in Continental Europe. Our decision to be globally diverse is a result of customer demand to have choices for important markets in local jurisdictions. 
We've been open and transparent about our views that there will be continued fragmentation and balkanization of markets, as they become are electronic and more locally regulated. These trends and unpredictable events like the Brexit referendum and Central Bank moves remind the market of the value of having different data sets readily available. And we believe that these factors increase the need for our proprietary data and the relevance for our globally distributed model. 
Moving now to Slide 12. I'll review the solid performance in our global markets. The strength of our markets is demonstrated by the fact that trading and clearing revenues for 12 of our 13 key markets grew year-to-year in the second quarter. As you can see on the slide, volume and open interest in our crude, agriculture, sterling and MSCI products is strong and growing. 
Another benefit of operating in diverse global markets is the ability to gain both exposure and diversification. For example, while European interest rates, which made up 4% of our total revenues, was the one asset class where transaction revenues declined year-to-year in the second quarter, we earned market data revenues from that business. And importantly, trading and clearing volumes again grew by double digits in June and July. 
Moving to Slide 13, I'll note the 14% revenue growth in our cash equities markets year-to-date, which produced strong U.S. cash flow and enables us to serve one of the largest global securities markets with data and listings. 
We've continued to improve and enhance this market over the last 2.5 years since our acquisition, while growing revenues and expanding market share at the same time. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see the ongoing contribution of credit derivatives clearing in both Europe and the U.S. We've seen greater regulatory certainty in the U.S. draw more CDS clearing to the U.S. and away from Europe with record-level participation from the buy-side. 
I'll note that we are approaching the milestone of $100 trillion in notional value cleared by ICE. Through a great deal of innovation, we now clear nearly 600 credit derivative interest instruments, driving $53 million in revenue in the first half. 
Last week, we announced our agreement to sell the U.S. voice brokerage assets of Creditex to Tullett Prebon, which represents approximately 10% of our global CDS revenues. ICE is not selling the valuable electronic post-trade assets of Creditex that helped us support the launch and are a continuing contributor to our ongoing operations in CDS clearing. 
We're also retaining Creditex's electronic trading assets, as we continue to build on our solutions for the credit markets. As we announced yesterday, we've seen early traction in our new single-name CDS electronic trading platform, called ICE Swap, that we launched in June. This is an all-to-all platform for single-name CDS, which has gotten the attention of major dealers and buy-side clients who are asking for more liquidity and transparency in these markets. So we've been very strategic with the acquisition of Creditex by leveraging it to create a group of assets that have generated a positive return on that original investment and which continued to contribute -- continue to contribute to our earnings. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'm pleased to say that not only is the integration of Interactive Data running ahead of schedule, but more importantly, we're well on track to achieve our 2016 revenue growth targets. 
In June, we announced a reorganization of all our data businesses into ICE Data Services, which brings together our analytics, desktops, mobile apps, indices, exchange data and connectivity solutions under a global data brand to serve our customers comprehensively. 
While there remains much integration work yet to be done, the early feedback from our customers is that we're on the right track. Our ICE U.S. Treasury Index family has grown with new indices and new customers. They've been selected as the new benchmarks for a range of ETPs now offered by BlackRock iShares, the leading provider of fixed income ETPs. Direxion, a provider of ETPs with over $10 billion in assets under management; and Yuanta Securities Investment Trust Company, a comprehensive financial services firm serving the Asia Pacific region; and Invesco PowerShares recently filed to begin using ICE indices in ETP products. 
Our revenue mix from transaction-based revenues towards more recurring subscription-based revenues continues to grow as the evolution of the market continues to transfer value to these mission-critical offerings. 
With a high revenue renewal rate in our pricing and analytics business, we've become a key source for consistent, reliable pricing and reference data. We're often asked if the growth of our data business is levered to headcount at the banks. It is not.  First and most evidently, our data revenues have grown during and since the financial crisis. While headcount in parts of the financial services industry may have declined since that time, the need for information, connectivity and risk management from ICE has risen consistent with our data revenues. The consumption of data is rising due to secular trends, such as the move to indexation, the rise of ETPs, market fragmentation, independent valuation demands, regulatory reporting, real-time distribution needs and automated trading. The sheer breadth of our services and our positioning at the value-added end of the data spectrum gives us confidence in our growth projections. 
Turning to our listings business. The market for initial public offerings improved once the volatility of the first quarter abated. The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in global proceeds raised, including hosting 5 -- the 5 largest IPOs by market cap to-date in 2016. Those are LINE Corporation, China Online Education, U.S. Foods, MGM Growth and Patheon. NYSE also was the home to the 2 largest technology IPOs year-to-date, LINE and Twilio.
NYSE Arca continues to lead in new ETP listings and hosts 92% of assets under management. We're working closely with issuers to develop more solutions and value-added services in addition to enhanced market quality. 
Importantly, the listings business also drives growth across our trading and data lines. You can see that even as we deliver on our synergies, the NYSE is a growth-oriented business for us, and we're proud of the work that our team has done to strengthen and grow this valuable business. 
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 15, where you can see we are very well positioned to build on our decade-long track record. Our strong start to the year was driven by revenue growth, faster synergy realization, margin expansion and 19%, as reported, adjusted earnings growth in the first half of this year. 
We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow, repaid nearly $800 million in debt, demonstrated our commitment to capital return with a $1 billion share repurchase authorization and announced a planned stock split. So I'd like to thank our customers for their business and I want to thank our team for their continued hard work. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our operator, Keith. We'll be glad to take your questions."

This is Jeff. Well, it's interesting because I've tried to make the point on multiple calls now that we believe that the markets are going to become more fragmented, now that they're more electronic and more regulation is being put on markets at the local level. And in some of our core markets, what you've seen is some people come in and pay for order flow. And so what we've done is readjusted essentially our data offering and the way we disseminate it and charge for it so that we can benefit from those payments into the market. So when somebody pays for order flow, you attract a new kind of trader. You actually in our mind grow the market by bringing people in that want to receive those payments. And those people tend to hang on the primary market in order to receive those payments. And so what we do is basically have a compact with them that they will receive those payments and pass some of them back to us in the form of increased data revenues. When a company goes in and wants to get paid for order flow, it tends to do 1 of 2 things. It either uses algorithms or its own trading style to basically churn so that it is constantly buying and selling but accepting no risk. Or they come up with strategies where you can put on positions that actually show up in open interest but that carry no risk. And so there've been a lot of talk in our industry about market share, people like to talk about market share, and we like to talk about earnings. And that's why I always start my recent presentations showing you our earnings growth because we have decided that the way to maximize our earnings growth is to participate in that trend with our customers who want to receive payments from others. And so there's been a big spike up in that area, and I expect honestly that this is a macro trend that we're going to see more fragmentation due to a number of factors and that you'll continue to see growth in our core data offering."

And a difficult nut to crack, in the sense that we do continue to build out continued capabilities in risk management to serve fixed income and interest rate markets and that has been a constant source of investment for us, as you've indicated, over a number of years. Whether or not we actually would enter that space on our own is yet to be determined. There's some M&A going on right now, the LSE-DB deal. It's hard to understand what kind of offering that deal will have, given the fact that they're now in 2 different regulatory jurisdictions. It's hard to understand what the complexities of regulation may be between the U.K. and the EU. So that may open an opportunity or it may foreclose an opportunity, depends on how things play out. I would also mention to you that the interest rate swaps business in our mind is largely people doing fixed for floating swaps. In other words, commercial borrowers, like ICE and Scott Hill, who is sitting across from me, may choose to lock in floating interest rates for a period generally 5 years or so. But in this low interest rate environment, it's hard to imagine that locking in low interest rates is a growth market. And so one of the things that we promised is earnings growth, and we tend to look for trends where we can position ourselves early to be part of the growth. And it's very unclear whether the interest rate swaps market is one of those markets. So I say all of that in the sense that we've not made a decision yet on what to do and when to do it, but we do continue to build out capabilities so that we have optionality around that decision."

If you stand on a corner and hand out $5 bills, a long line will form. If in order to get into that line, you have to pay the primary market $1, so that you can get $4 of those dollars, that is a good trade. And so what we do is set up to make sure that our shareholders get a transfer of that $1 from the other person's shareholders. And much of what we have been doing over the last few years and the way we've been building out this data offering and distribution vehicle is set up for that. We firmly believe that markets are going to become more fragmented. It's very different today, when there used to be open outcry floors in regional jurisdictions with the name of the city on them, it was very hard to compete. Today, there are a lot of a very sophisticated electronic platform operators that can simply pay for order flows and start a market. And so we believe that there will be fragmentation. We've seen it in the most fragmented markets that we operated in, in the U.S. cash equities market. But what changes there is that as those payments are made, there is an opportunity to participate in them. And that's really what we've been doing. We laugh a little bit around here when people put notes out talking about market share and fail to realize that behind that, that the market has actually grown and there is more wealth transfer going on. And our goal is to maximize the value of this company for our shareholders."

What I didn't say at that time that I can say now is that, at the time, we did not want to talk about Brexit, and we've been urged by others not to talk about Brexit. But the way that deal was lining up, it was orchestrated so that we were going to, if we entered the deal, have to put a number on the table right ahead of the Brexit vote. We happened to have at the times, 3 U.K. directors who sat on our board who are incredibly knowledgeable people that are very engaged with us, and they were cautioning management and the rest of the board that the Brexit vote was going to be close and they cautioned us back in February and March, and really said you guys need to know exactly what you're doing, and you need to run scenarios on what's going to happen in either eventuality. So we went out, and we started talking to our U.K. colleagues to try to gauge where we thought the vote was going to come out. And honestly, we came to the opinion that the U.K. was probably going to leave. And so we decided, given that we didn't have good information and given that we thought the landscape was going to change that it was not an appropriate time for us to do a transaction. I will tell you that so, and I think that we were fortunate in making that decision. I don't know what the European landscape is going to be. We have been building our company to have a lot of options, and we've been very open about that. We've been very transparent that we, long ago, decided to build a footprint on the Continental Europe with an exchange and clearing house because we felt that there could be some fragmentation and balkanization that our customers would have demands. So we're set up for change, but I don't know what the change is going to be.

We've had very open dialogue with the ratings agencies, and they've indicated a comfort level with our current rating in that range. I don't think that means we have to necessarily be in that range to start the repurchases, but we certainly need to have a path to get to that range quickly as we introduce the repurchases. And so in terms of timing, the other thing I'd say is, there are always a number of variables. You asked about M&A in 2017. I've no idea what that could look like. We've got the S&P deal that we expect will close later this year. We've got the Cetip, BM&F deal that is working its way through the process. So they're any number of factors that could impact the timing and the size of the repurchases. I think what the authorization tells you is we are deleveraging at a faster rate than we anticipated. We had originally said we wouldn't be there until the end of next year. Now we're saying possibly by the end of this year. And so, look, I don't think it's out of the question that we're back in the market in the fourth quarter, but there'll be a number of variables that impact that.

Right now, honestly, if you just step back and think about the world and your own behavior, the amount of data that we're all consuming just goes up. I mean, I've no doubt that the data plan that I have on my smartphone is going to consume more data in 5 years than it does today. And in every aspect of our lives, and certainly here at ICE, the way we run our business, there is just more data available, and we have better and better tools to use that data and analyze that data. When it comes to trading and risk management, there is no question that we're going to have more passive investment vehicles. So those are doing well and growing and growing quickly. There's no question that decisions are going to be made increasingly by algorithms or they're going to contribute to the decision-making process. And in my mind -- and there's no question that regulators are going to demand, and frankly, Boards of Directors and the Audit Committee and auditors are going to demand better information faster than they've gotten it before. And so all those trends just suggest to us that there is an incredible future demand for information, and what we are trying to do is figure out areas where we really generate some unique proprietary content that will be of high value to our customers. And so that's been our focus. And so far, the early returns have been really good. And frankly, on some of the sales meetings that I've been in, we've gotten a lot of positive feedback that it's nice to have a large scale vendor of information to people that is very technology-focused and cybersecurity focused like we are to fit into their current demands for information."

I think, the success we're seeing right now is really, again, around the continued high retention of existing customers. Jeff's point about, as we talk to customers, their interest in having a data provider and so it's -- as opposed to showing up, as SuperD or as ICE are as IDC, we're showing up as ICE Data Services. And I think we're seeing benefit from that in terms of securing new customers, and again as I said, on the exchange data side, similarly in the pricing and valuation side, I think, it's customers who are purchasing more. It's beginning to gain traction and new products. That continuous evaluative pricing product that allows you during the day to get a view on the price of bonds that you may be interested in trading or that you hold in your portfolio. That's execution services. So it's really more right now, new customers, retention of existing customers, building on new product development that actually started before we purchased IDC. I think to Jeff's point, we've only really reorganized the sales team and the go-to-market in the past few weeks. So I think that's why I'm confident about our ability to grow the rest of this year and into next year. As we do look at, are we capturing the right value in our pricing? Are there different ways we can package up across the various businesses that we've owned? Are there better ways that we can deliver the information more efficiently across the single desktop versus multiple, et cetera. So that's really benefit, I think that's in front of us, not that's reflected in the strong performance we've had in the first half."

But it -- that area was not an area that traditionally ICE had direct relationships with. And so the reason that we're excited about some of the bundling and packaging and the reorganization of our sales force is that it opens a whole new customer base to us. And what we have found, as I mentioned before, is that customer base who had been -- who oftentimes deals with lots of data vendors appreciates having another large comprehensive offering. So that it can be kind of a one-stop shop when it comes to purchasing and security issues. Some of these things that we're providing are mission-critical services to companies that use them for regulatory purposes or reporting purposes. And so they need primaries, backups and others. They want as much information as they can, and having another large vendor enter the space has been very well received."

We're really people that are creating proprietary content. And so areas that are of interest to us is where are things -- where there is some content that we could help monetize through our channel. That being said, as you probably know, we operate here in an M&A -- we buy versus build -- on every decision we make is a buy versus build decision. And many of the valuations in the data space are quite high, and they would -- certainly wouldn't operate on our return on invested capital thresholds that we operate under. So it's not as easy as saying, oh, yes, we're just going to go, hoover up everything that's out there because there are some great companies but they are fully valued by the market right now. So we have to be somewhat creative. I'll just quickly mention MERS. ICE got years and years ago, many people in this call would ask us what is our strategy in the interest rate space? And we knew that there were some dominant and important people in that space, and it would be hard to compete. And so we started breaking down the interest rate market and trying to think of where are there opportunities that we could enter the market. And we started to focus on the mortgage space, and this was before the financial crisis. And a very gracious gentleman, Bill Cruger, who was a banker at JPMorgan said, well, I can introduce you to the people at MERS. MERS is a industry consortium of 5,000 members in the mortgage community, including everybody that matters in the mortgage community. And we started to talk to MERS prior to the financial crisis about whether or not there would be an opportunity to privatize it. The financial crisis intervened. MERS was involved in effectively robo-signing mortgages on behalf of lenders and got very embroiled and was put into conservatorship along with Fannie and Freddie. It has now made its way through that and it's ready to have continued investment, a new look -- a new outlook, and we were able to convince the members that, that consortium should privatize with ICE and that we will help bring them together. About 5 years ago, we never announced, but we did buy a mortgage platform and a team in Silicon Valley that was working on some advanced techniques around mortgages. We've continued to quietly build that out and obviously work with MERS over the last few years on how we could put these systems together and are thrilled to announce that we are going to work with the MERS team, that Fannie and Freddie and some of the bank interests are going to stay on the board of the company to help us. And that we think there is a really interesting opportunity to bring some evolution to the broad market for residential mortgages in the United States. Small deal of -- in terms of how it exists today, but it could have large repercussions if we all get together and work on this successfully. So it's great to see a long, long cycle actually close, and they feel it's been a long, long cycle as well."

And I really do believe based on conversations we've had with the U.K. government that the government has incredibly strong interest in adopting policies that will continue to attract Asian business to come to London. But that being said, there are a lot of smaller players, niche players, that existed in the region that were not going to come to London and the real key that we've had in Singapore is getting to those new customers, getting them to join the exchange, getting them to set up in the clearinghouse. These are brokers, these are commodity merchants and others across the broad region of Asia, and we've had good success there. And really if you look at our focus, it's not on day-to-day volume, it's on chipping away at a targeted customer list and getting them through the process that the MAS or the regulator in Singapore requires to be passported into a Singapore exchange and clearing house. And that work is ongoing and it's going well, and every day -- it is a network effect, so every day that somebody new joins or takes interest, it spills over to the next person, and so we feel like we're making very good progress there."

We have a unique ability in that, that we had an ETP listings team, a very good and well-known ETP listings team at the NYSE, which we were able to combine with our index and data people and put together essentially packages that we can take to these ETP providers, where we can develop an index or replace an index, we can provide the data. We have the systems internally to do real-time calculation and NAV calculations. We can list it, we can help them market it, we can use the ICE brand, we can use the NYSE brand. So we bring a lot of assets to the table with these providers, and we're aggressive, and we're interested in this space, and so we're able to move quickly. So I think it's going to be a growth area for us. In terms of how it's monetized, we don't really care in a package, whether it's monetizing the data or monetizing the index or monetizing the infrastructure. All of that can go together in a cauldron that can be very value-enhancing for these ETP providers. There is no question that, that it is a competitive space and that people there are interested in speed-to-market and they're interested in low administrative costs. And so once we get those ETPs up, then we continue to market the fact that we have continuous evaluated pricing, that we have these liquidity indicators that -- and honestly, then we go to the active fund managers and talk to them about how are they going to respond to this passive trend? Then what can we do for them? So it's a really unique moment in time, and we're kind of hitting a sweet spot in the space in our mind with an opportunity set and capability set that we have. So I'm sorry, the second part of your question was?"

It has very deep liquidity in a single exchange. We have other competitors that like to add together 3 or 4 exchanges and then show a number. But the ETP sponsors don't really care about the volume across a bunch of fragmented markets. They want to know is there depth of liquidity in the market where this thing is primarily going to trade. That is a real competitive advantage that we have. And then when we couple that with all the other services that we can provide that are value added, we've done -- we've seen that we continue to do very well. I would mention there is something like 4 ETP -- new ETP listings per day. So the vast majority, unfortunately, like any new business are probably not going to grow very big or amount to much. They become highly differentiated and specialized in many cases.

Look, Alex, I think, what you're seeing as we through this year is that the pose of the NYSE where we announced that deal in 2012 and then had a year before it closed and a year to work on the integration plans and the synergies. And so when we come out with a number on that at close, we're like this is the number. And we've subsequently executed on it really well. The IDC deal was a completely different deal. It was an auction, it closed the day we signed it and that's really when the integration work began in earnest. And so we're continuing to dig through, and we are seeing early success and greater success than we had counted on in things like corporate integration, where we have been able to identify and eliminate corporate redundancies faster. We're seeing things like the 7ticks network and the safety network where we knew there might be some overlap come together and we're realizing benefits from that sooner. And so that's really the acceleration of the 25 to 50 in this year. I don't think our view on the overall synergies related to that business really have changed, the timing hasn't changed. There was a heavy piece of technology integration that has to occur. And as you know, with the NYSE acquisition, that's kind of the last chunk of synergies that we're going to realize there. I suspect that will be the case at IDC as well. We will certainly get the synergies, the timing of them. I'll give you an update on '17 as we move later into this year, and I'll give you an update on '18 as we move into the later 2017. But we said at the beginning of the year, $220 million to go. We've now got $100 million of that, that will get done this year. I'm very confident over the course of '17 and '18 and may be a little bit into early '19 that we will get that last $120 million out of what's roughly now a $2 billion expense base."

We're also seeing, I think, some longer sales cycles where we're in conversations with people about wholesale changes to the way we deliver and the technology that underlies our data and the way we deliver it and the way the 2 of us will technologically connect and work together.

I'll begin on Slide 4 and highlight that the second quarter was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. 
Our performance was driven by revenues that grew 7% and adjusted operating expenses that declined 1% year-over-year. We generated adjusted operating income growth of 15% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 3 points to 56%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% versus the prior year to $3.43. And with continued momentum in our transaction business in July, growing data revenues and lower expenses, we're well positioned in 2016 to extend our decade-long track record of double-digit earnings growth. 
As you'll see as I move to Slide 5, our second quarter performance contributed to strong results for the first half of 2016. We generated consolidated net revenues of $2.3 billion during the first half of the year. Both our trading and clearing segment, and our data and listings segment grew 6% versus the first half of 2015. This solid top line growth combined with disciplined expense management allowed us to expand operating margins by 5 points to 58% and to grow earnings per share 16% to $7.12. 
Additionally, we generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the first half of 2016, which enabled us to pay over $200 million in dividends even as we reduced our leverage to 2.4x just 6 months post the closing of our Interactive Data acquisition. 
These strong financial results enabled by our globally diverse business model supported our board's authorization of a $1 billion share repurchase program and our $0.85 per share dividend for the third quarter. We also announced plans to pursue a 5-for-1 stock split to ensure that our stock trades as efficiently as possible in a fragmented market and that it is more accessible to a broad range of shareholders. 
Let's move to Slide 6, where I'll provide some more details on our first half revenue performance. 52% of the $2.3 billion in revenue came from our data and listings segment, and 48% came from our trading and clearing segment. Each segment grew 6% year-over-year. You'll find further detail on each segment's revenue on the right side of the slide. 
In the trading and clearing segment, commodities revenues grew 10% with strong contributions from both our energy and ag markets. Financials revenues grew 2% with continued strength in our equity index markets, partially offset by muted European interest rate volume. Notably, volume in ICE Brent, sugar, other ags, MSCI and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits during the first half of the year. 
Within our data and listings segment, pricing and analytics revenues grew 6% and exchange data revenues increased by 13% year-to-year. This strong performance was enabled by a high retention rate of existing customers, the acquisition of new customers and the development of new and enhanced products designed to efficiently deliver more value to all of our customers. 
Each of our data offerings are benefiting from customers' recognition of the increasing value of readily available, easy-to-consume information. This nascent trend reflects our customers' need to deal with the challenges of the volatile markets and uncertain political and economic environments in which they operate. We continue to expect our full year 2016 data revenues to grow between 6% and 7% on a pro forma basis despite the recent significant decline in the pound Sterling in which roughly 9% of our total data revenues are billed. Further, though we expect this currency impact to cause a sequential decline in revenues of $6 million in the third quarter, we believe fourth quarter data revenues could approach $500 million even at current spot rates. 
Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first half, and we hosted some notable IPOs as activity picked up late in the second quarter. Going forward, we're confident that our unique market model and strong issuer services will continue to support the capital raising needs of the world's most innovative companies and exchange traded product issuers. 
Please turn to Slide 7 where I'll discuss our disciplined expense management and provide updated and improved guidance. First half adjusted operating expenses declined 4% year-over-year to $970 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by 5 points. 
As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies sooner than expected. The majority of our corporate functions are well along the path to integration. Our technology and operations teams have built clear integration road maps. And perhaps most importantly, the ICE data sales team is now fully integrated and well positioned to better serve our customers with a complete range of data solutions. 
Given our solid execution, we now expect to realize roughly $50 million in synergies from Interactive Data this year and approximately $100 million in combined expense synergies during 2016. 
Accordingly, we now expect our full year adjusted expenses to be in a range between $1.94 billion and $1.97 billion, including adjusted expenses in the range of $485 million to $495 million in the third quarter. 
This updated and improved full year guidance reflects the $60 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement consists of an additional $25 million in synergies and roughly $35 million largely related to the currency impact of the lower pound. 
We run a diverse global business that is subject to currency fluctuations. Given the size of the change in the pound related to the Brexit vote, I want to take a brief moment to give you some color on how you should think about this in the context of our second half financial performance. 
With roughly 11% of our total revenues and 15% of our consolidated expenses denominated in pounds, we have a natural hedge that mitigates a meaningful portion of the impact to profit. Therefore, even though the currency-driven decline in revenue exceeds the expense reduction on a dollar basis, we expect the net impact to earnings to be immaterial, and it will not impede our ability to extend our track record of delivering double-digit earnings growth to 11 years. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our cash generation, leverage and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the first half of the year and deployed that cash to invest around $150 million in CapEx to reduce our debt by nearly $800 million and to return over $200 million to shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.4x at the end of June. 
We believe that by the end of this year or early next, we can reduce our leverage to a level that will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating even as we increase our capital return and consider other strategic investments. This solid cash generation and rapid deleveraging supports our board's authorization of a new $1 billion stock buyback program and our ability to grow our cash dividend as we grow. 
Our record first half results reflect our commitment to serving customers and generating strong returns for our investors. We are expanding and improving the products we offer in the markets we serve. We are growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. 
We are reducing expenses, debt and leverage, and we have invested strategically to build a diverse business model that we believe will allow us to continue to deliver consistent earnings growth, solid cash generation and leading returns on investment. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

I'll provide an update on our strategy that's delivering the strong growth that we detailed this morning, and then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. 
On Slide 9 are the results of our strategic approach to transforming our company into a global financial services leader. 
Since our IPO in November of 2005, we've grown EPS fivefold, and we've grown our share price tenfold by building on the changing needs of our customers. Rather than simply retracing the path to past growth, we've been future focused on the intersection of financial services and technology to offer more services to our expanding base of customers. 
We began as an energy trading platform and strategically transformed the company to become a global operator of exchanges and clearing houses and become a top-tier provider of proprietary data solutions. This successful evolution of our business occurred despite the financial crisis, evolving regulations, tumultuous global markets and economic cycles. We stayed focused amid these dynamic times on innovating to solve our customers' challenges, bringing solutions long before they were widely appreciated by the market. 
This very point is highlighted on Slide 10, where you can see the virtuous cycle created by our global ecosystem of exchanges, clearing houses, information and connectivity, which is an unparalleled model relative to more specialized data providers and market operators. 
Data and trading are symbiotic and serve as integral inputs into our customers' workflow. For many customers access to our data drives more trading, which in turn creates the information used for investing, for settlement, compliance, collateral management, reporting and numerous other functions, all of which drive the rising consumption of data. 
The services listed on this slide represent solutions across a vast range of our clients workflow. And because these services are part of an integrated offering, they create a strong value proposition. For example, our markets are widely accessible via the ICE desktop, mobile and messenger applications, which we offer integrated solutions for our customers' trading, information and risk management needs on a common technology platform. 
We also offer vast sets of proprietary data for nonexchange-traded fixed income markets, which represent some of the world's largest addressable markets. Today, we're pricing millions of bonds for thousands of customers each day, and within the fixed income markets, invested assets under management continue to rise. 
For example, exchange-traded fixed income funds have quickly risen to over $585 billion, now accounting for 20% of total U.S. ETP assets under management. ICE also has an expanding set of solutions to serve active fixed income managers, such as pricing and reference data, continuous evaluated prices, liquidity indicators and best execution identification. The role of these new services is highlighted around the times of market volatility, and the Brexit vote was an example of an event that has reinforced the importance of real-time information tools. 
In addition, ongoing demand is being driven by regulation, by market fragmentation, volatility and the uncertainty around global central bank actions. You can see on Slide 11 that our approach to driving change has produced consistent top line growth, with record annual earnings for the last decade regardless of the economy or the market cycle or commodity prices or the level of interest rates or increasing regulation or the many other headlines and headwinds that have occurred over the last 10 years. 
It is such market and economic disruptions that make our risk management services valuable, and ICE's performance relative to the broader sector over the same time validates the model that we've built to benefit from change. 
In that context, I'll say a few words about Brexit, which we view as another opportunity to drive our set of differentiated solutions. We've dedicated meaningful resources to our London operations and for good reasons. The United Kingdom has tremendous location and time zone advantages in global markets. It has a strong set of regulatory and legal frameworks that have promoted confidence, and ICE has a highly qualified team of colleagues that have time and time again contributed to our successful navigation of change. 
Since the Brexit vote, we've had an active dialogue with senior officials in the U.K. government to discuss the types of policies that will facilitate our continued investment. 
We're looking forward to this ongoing dialogue, and we're very optimistic about the government's focus on preserving a competitive climate for business. ICE also operates exchanges and clearing houses in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and in Continental Europe. Our decision to be globally diverse is a result of customer demand to have choices for important markets in local jurisdictions. 
We've been open and transparent about our views that there will be continued fragmentation and balkanization of markets, as they become are electronic and more locally regulated. These trends and unpredictable events like the Brexit referendum and Central Bank moves remind the market of the value of having different data sets readily available. And we believe that these factors increase the need for our proprietary data and the relevance for our globally distributed model. 
Moving now to Slide 12. I'll review the solid performance in our global markets. The strength of our markets is demonstrated by the fact that trading and clearing revenues for 12 of our 13 key markets grew year-to-year in the second quarter. As you can see on the slide, volume and open interest in our crude, agriculture, sterling and MSCI products is strong and growing. 
Another benefit of operating in diverse global markets is the ability to gain both exposure and diversification. For example, while European interest rates, which made up 4% of our total revenues, was the one asset class where transaction revenues declined year-to-year in the second quarter, we earned market data revenues from that business. And importantly, trading and clearing volumes again grew by double digits in June and July. 
Moving to Slide 13, I'll note the 14% revenue growth in our cash equities markets year-to-date, which produced strong U.S. cash flow and enables us to serve one of the largest global securities markets with data and listings. 
We've continued to improve and enhance this market over the last 2.5 years since our acquisition, while growing revenues and expanding market share at the same time. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see the ongoing contribution of credit derivatives clearing in both Europe and the U.S. We've seen greater regulatory certainty in the U.S. draw more CDS clearing to the U.S. and away from Europe with record-level participation from the buy-side. 
I'll note that we are approaching the milestone of $100 trillion in notional value cleared by ICE. Through a great deal of innovation, we now clear nearly 600 credit derivative interest instruments, driving $53 million in revenue in the first half. 
Last week, we announced our agreement to sell the U.S. voice brokerage assets of Creditex to Tullett Prebon, which represents approximately 10% of our global CDS revenues. ICE is not selling the valuable electronic post-trade assets of Creditex that helped us support the launch and are a continuing contributor to our ongoing operations in CDS clearing. 
We're also retaining Creditex's electronic trading assets, as we continue to build on our solutions for the credit markets. As we announced yesterday, we've seen early traction in our new single-name CDS electronic trading platform, called ICE Swap, that we launched in June. This is an all-to-all platform for single-name CDS, which has gotten the attention of major dealers and buy-side clients who are asking for more liquidity and transparency in these markets. So we've been very strategic with the acquisition of Creditex by leveraging it to create a group of assets that have generated a positive return on that original investment and which continued to contribute -- continue to contribute to our earnings. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'm pleased to say that not only is the integration of Interactive Data running ahead of schedule, but more importantly, we're well on track to achieve our 2016 revenue growth targets. 
In June, we announced a reorganization of all our data businesses into ICE Data Services, which brings together our analytics, desktops, mobile apps, indices, exchange data and connectivity solutions under a global data brand to serve our customers comprehensively. 
While there remains much integration work yet to be done, the early feedback from our customers is that we're on the right track. Our ICE U.S. Treasury Index family has grown with new indices and new customers. They've been selected as the new benchmarks for a range of ETPs now offered by BlackRock iShares, the leading provider of fixed income ETPs. Direxion, a provider of ETPs with over $10 billion in assets under management; and Yuanta Securities Investment Trust Company, a comprehensive financial services firm serving the Asia Pacific region; and Invesco PowerShares recently filed to begin using ICE indices in ETP products. 
Our revenue mix from transaction-based revenues towards more recurring subscription-based revenues continues to grow as the evolution of the market continues to transfer value to these mission-critical offerings. 
With a high revenue renewal rate in our pricing and analytics business, we've become a key source for consistent, reliable pricing and reference data. We're often asked if the growth of our data business is levered to headcount at the banks. It is not. First and most evidently, our data revenues have grown during and since the financial crisis. While headcount in parts of the financial services industry may have declined since that time, the need for information, connectivity and risk management from ICE has risen consistent with our data revenues. The consumption of data is rising due to secular trends, such as the move to indexation, the rise of ETPs, market fragmentation, independent valuation demands, regulatory reporting, real-time distribution needs and automated trading. The sheer breadth of our services and our positioning at the value-added end of the data spectrum gives us confidence in our growth projections. 
Turning to our listings business. The market for initial public offerings improved once the volatility of the first quarter abated. The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in global proceeds raised, including hosting 5 -- the 5 largest IPOs by market cap to-date in 2016. Those are LINE Corporation, China Online Education, U.S. Foods, MGM Growth and Patheon. NYSE also was the home to the 2 largest technology IPOs year-to-date, LINE and Twilio.
NYSE Arca continues to lead in new ETP listings and hosts 92% of assets under management. We're working closely with issuers to develop more solutions and value-added services in addition to enhanced market quality. 
Importantly, the listings business also drives growth across our trading and data lines. You can see that even as we deliver on our synergies, the NYSE is a growth-oriented business for us, and we're proud of the work that our team has done to strengthen and grow this valuable business. 
I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 15, where you can see we are very well positioned to build on our decade-long track record. Our strong start to the year was driven by revenue growth, faster synergy realization, margin expansion and 19%, as reported, adjusted earnings growth in the first half of this year. 
We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow, repaid nearly $800 million in debt, demonstrated our commitment to capital return with a $1 billion share repurchase authorization and announced a planned stock split. So I'd like to thank our customers for their business and I want to thank our team for their continued hard work. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our operator, Keith. We'll be glad to take your questions."

This is Jeff. Well, it's interesting because I've tried to make the point on multiple calls now that we believe that the markets are going to become more fragmented, now that they're more electronic and more regulation is being put on markets at the local level. And in some of our core markets, what you've seen is some people come in and pay for order flow. And so what we've done is readjusted essentially our data offering and the way we disseminate it and charge for it so that we can benefit from those payments into the market. So when somebody pays for order flow, you attract a new kind of trader. You actually in our mind grow the market by bringing people in that want to receive those payments. And those people tend to hang on the primary market in order to receive those payments. And so what we do is basically have a compact with them that they will receive those payments and pass some of them back to us in the form of increased data revenues. When a company goes in and wants to get paid for order flow, it tends to do 1 of 2 things. It either uses algorithms or its own trading style to basically churn so that it is constantly buying and selling but accepting no risk. Or they come up with strategies where you can put on positions that actually show up in open interest but that carry no risk. And so there've been a lot of talk in our industry about market share, people like to talk about market share, and we like to talk about earnings. And that's why I always start my recent presentations showing you our earnings growth because we have decided that the way to maximize our earnings growth is to participate in that trend with our customers who want to receive payments from others. And so there's been a big spike up in that area, and I expect honestly that this is a macro trend that we're going to see more fragmentation due to a number of factors and that you'll continue to see growth in our core data offering."

And a difficult nut to crack, in the sense that we do continue to build out continued capabilities in risk management to serve fixed income and interest rate markets and that has been a constant source of investment for us, as you've indicated, over a number of years. Whether or not we actually would enter that space on our own is yet to be determined. There's some M&A going on right now, the LSE-DB deal. It's hard to understand what kind of offering that deal will have, given the fact that they're now in 2 different regulatory jurisdictions. It's hard to understand what the complexities of regulation may be between the U.K. and the EU. So that may open an opportunity or it may foreclose an opportunity, depends on how things play out. I would also mention to you that the interest rate swaps business in our mind is largely people doing fixed for floating swaps. In other words, commercial borrowers, like ICE and Scott Hill, who is sitting across from me, may choose to lock in floating interest rates for a period generally 5 years or so. But in this low interest rate environment, it's hard to imagine that locking in low interest rates is a growth market. And so one of the things that we promised is earnings growth, and we tend to look for trends where we can position ourselves early to be part of the growth. And it's very unclear whether the interest rate swaps market is one of those markets. So I say all of that in the sense that we've not made a decision yet on what to do and when to do it, but we do continue to build out capabilities so that we have optionality around that decision."

I mean, effectively, what he said that there are more people who are more active in the markets that we provide, and we've seen that in user growth. We've seen it in the products that we've been able to package up in our data. So the interest levels have continued to grow. And as we sign up more users, as we're able to offer more information in various forms or various packages of information, yes, we've seen fee increases related to that. And so that's really helped drive the revenue. And to some extent, when you look at our commodities growth in the first half at 10%, that's across the energy and ags, and there's a lot of volatility in those markets, a lot of drivers that are -- and there are different drivers. It's weather in Brazil, it's Middle East and U.S. oil issues that are driving oil. And as you're trying to figure out what's going on in a volatile world, you need data and you need information. And so as people see that need, as Jeff was describing it, we see user growth, and we see existing users wanting more information and all of that's contributed to very strong growth in that business. And the thing that excites me about it is, is not just the data revenue growth in and of itself, but that data growth, coupled with very strong open interest in our commodities business, is a good leading indicator, not necessarily for any given month or quarter, but as we look forward, it says the interest in the markets we're serving remains very high with importantly, the commercial customers who are actually taking a view on price and actively managing their risk."

And much of what we have been doing over the last few years and the way we've been building out this data offering and distribution vehicle is set up for that. We firmly believe that markets are going to become more fragmented. It's very different today, when there used to be open outcry floors in regional jurisdictions with the name of the city on them, it was very hard to compete. Today, there are a lot of a very sophisticated electronic platform operators that can simply pay for order flows and start a market. And so we believe that there will be fragmentation. We've seen it in the most fragmented markets that we operated in, in the U.S. cash equities market. But what changes there is that as those payments are made, there is an opportunity to participate in them. And that's really what we've been doing. We laugh a little bit around here when people put notes out talking about market share and fail to realize that behind that, that the market has actually grown and there is more wealth transfer going on.

But the way that deal was lining up, it was orchestrated so that we were going to, if we entered the deal, have to put a number on the table right ahead of the Brexit vote. We happened to have at the times, 3 U.K. directors who sat on our board who are incredibly knowledgeable people that are very engaged with us, and they were cautioning management and the rest of the board that the Brexit vote was going to be close and they cautioned us back in February and March, and really said you guys need to know exactly what you're doing, and you need to run scenarios on what's going to happen in either eventuality. So we went out, and we started talking to our U.K. colleagues to try to gauge where we thought the vote was going to come out. And honestly, we came to the opinion that the U.K. was probably going to leave. And so we decided, given that we didn't have good information and given that we thought the landscape was going to change that it was not an appropriate time for us to do a transaction. I will tell you that so, and I think that we were fortunate in making that decision. I don't know what the European landscape is going to be. We have been building our company to have a lot of options, and we've been very open about that.

And so in terms of timing, the other thing I'd say is, there are always a number of variables. You asked about M&A in 2017. I've no idea what that could look like. We've got the S&P deal that we expect will close later this year. We've got the Cetip, BM&F deal that is working its way through the process.

We see a lot of interest by large buy-side firms, for example, who want to have vendors that they can trust, who have a breadth of data, who meet their cybersecurity demands and give them sort of a single point to go to. Right now, honestly, if you just step back and think about the world and your own behavior, the amount of data that we're all consuming just goes up. I mean, I've no doubt that the data plan that I have on my smartphone is going to consume more data in 5 years than it does today. And in every aspect of our lives, and certainly here at ICE, the way we run our business, there is just more data available, and we have better and better tools to use that data and analyze that data. When it comes to trading and risk management, there is no question that we're going to have more passive investment vehicles. So those are doing well and growing and growing quickly. There's no question that decisions are going to be made increasingly by algorithms or they're going to contribute to the decision-making process. And in my mind -- and there's no question that regulators are going to demand, and frankly, Boards of Directors and the Audit Committee and auditors are going to demand better information faster than they've gotten it before. And so all those trends just suggest to us that there is an incredible future demand for information, and what we are trying to do is figure out areas where we really generate some unique proprietary content that will be of high value to our customers. And so that's been our focus. And so far, the early returns have been really good. And frankly, on some of the sales meetings that I've been in, we've gotten a lot of positive feedback that it's nice to have a large scale vendor of information to people that is very technology-focused and cybersecurity focused like we are to fit into their current demands for information."

I think, the success we're seeing right now is really, again, around the continued high retention of existing customers. Jeff's point about, as we talk to customers, their interest in having a data provider and so it's -- as opposed to showing up, as SuperD or as ICE are as IDC, we're showing up as ICE Data Services. And I think we're seeing benefit from that in terms of securing new customers, and again as I said, on the exchange data side, similarly in the pricing and valuation side, I think, it's customers who are purchasing more. It's beginning to gain traction and new products. That continuous evaluative pricing product that allows you during the day to get a view on the price of bonds that you may be interested in trading or that you hold in your portfolio. That's execution services. So it's really more right now, new customers, retention of existing customers, building on new product development that actually started before we purchased IDC. I think to Jeff's point, we've only really reorganized the sales team and the go-to-market in the past few weeks. So I think that's why I'm confident about our ability to grow the rest of this year and into next year. As we do look at, are we capturing the right value in our pricing? Are there different ways we can package up across the various businesses that we've owned? Are there better ways that we can deliver the information more efficiently across the single desktop versus multiple, et cetera. So that's really benefit, I think that's in front of us, not that's reflected in the strong performance we've had in the first half."

But it -- that area was not an area that traditionally ICE had direct relationships with. And so the reason that we're excited about some of the bundling and packaging and the reorganization of our sales force is that it opens a whole new customer base to us. And what we have found, as I mentioned before, is that customer base who had been -- who oftentimes deals with lots of data vendors appreciates having another large comprehensive offering. So that it can be kind of a one-stop shop when it comes to purchasing and security issues. Some of these things that we're providing are mission-critical services to companies that use them for regulatory purposes or reporting purposes. And so they need primaries, backups and others. They want as much information as they can, and having another large vendor enter the space has been very well received."

We're really people that are creating proprietary content. And so areas that are of interest to us is where are things -- where there is some content that we could help monetize through our channel. That being said, as you probably know, we operate here in an M&A -- we buy versus build -- on every decision we make is a buy versus build decision. And many of the valuations in the data space are quite high, and they would -- certainly wouldn't operate on our return on invested capital thresholds that we operate under. So it's not as easy as saying, oh, yes, we're just going to go, hoover up everything that's out there because there are some great companies but they are fully valued by the market right now. So we have to be somewhat creative. I'll just quickly mention MERS. ICE got years and years ago, many people in this call would ask us what is our strategy in the interest rate space? And we knew that there were some dominant and important people in that space, and it would be hard to compete. And so we started breaking down the interest rate market and trying to think of where are there opportunities that we could enter the market. And we started to focus on the mortgage space, and this was before the financial crisis. And a very gracious gentleman, Bill Cruger, who was a banker at JPMorgan said, well, I can introduce you to the people at MERS. MERS is a industry consortium of 5,000 members in the mortgage community, including everybody that matters in the mortgage community. And we started to talk to MERS prior to the financial crisis about whether or not there would be an opportunity to privatize it. The financial crisis intervened. MERS was involved in effectively robo-signing mortgages on behalf of lenders and got very embroiled and was put into conservatorship along with Fannie and Freddie. It has now made its way through that and it's ready to have continued investment, a new look -- a new outlook, and we were able to convince the members that, that consortium should privatize with ICE and that we will help bring them together. About 5 years ago, we never announced, but we did buy a mortgage platform and a team in Silicon Valley that was working on some advanced techniques around mortgages. We've continued to quietly build that out and obviously work with MERS over the last few years on how we could put these systems together and are thrilled to announce that we are going to work with the MERS team, that Fannie and Freddie and some of the bank interests are going to stay on the board of the company to help us. And that we think there is a really interesting opportunity to bring some evolution to the broad market for residential mortgages in the United States. Small deal of -- in terms of how it exists today, but it could have large repercussions if we all get together and work on this successfully. So it's great to see a long, long cycle actually close, and they feel it's been a long, long cycle as well."

And I really do believe based on conversations we've had with the U.K. government that the government has incredibly strong interest in adopting policies that will continue to attract Asian business to come to London. But that being said, there are a lot of smaller players, niche players, that existed in the region that were not going to come to London and the real key that we've had in Singapore is getting to those new customers, getting them to join the exchange, getting them to set up in the clearinghouse. These are brokers, these are commodity merchants and others across the broad region of Asia, and we've had good success there. And really if you look at our focus, it's not on day-to-day volume, it's on chipping away at a targeted customer list and getting them through the process that the MAS or the regulator in Singapore requires to be passported into a Singapore exchange and clearing house. And that work is ongoing and it's going well, and every day -- it is a network effect, so every day that somebody new joins or takes interest, it spills over to the next person, and so we feel like we're making very good progress there."

Well, first of all, when we talk to the sponsors of ETFs and that community, they are incredibly bullish on the demand for fixed income ETFs. It is a real growth area. And so there is tremendous interest by sponsors in that arena to talk to us about what we can do. We have a unique ability in that, that we had an ETP listings team, a very good and well-known ETP listings team at the NYSE, which we were able to combine with our index and data people and put together essentially packages that we can take to these ETP providers, where we can develop an index or replace an index, we can provide the data. We have the systems internally to do real-time calculation and NAV calculations. We can list it, we can help them market it, we can use the ICE brand, we can use the NYSE brand. So we bring a lot of assets to the table with these providers, and we're aggressive, and we're interested in this space, and so we're able to move quickly. So I think it's going to be a growth area for us. In terms of how it's monetized, we don't really care in a package, whether it's monetizing the data or monetizing the index or monetizing the infrastructure. All of that can go together in a cauldron that can be very value-enhancing for these ETP providers. There is no question that, that it is a competitive space and that people there are interested in speed-to-market and they're interested in low administrative costs. And so once we get those ETPs up, then we continue to market the fact that we have continuous evaluated pricing, that we have these liquidity indicators that -- and honestly, then we go to the active fund managers and talk to them about how are they going to respond to this passive trend?

But the ETP sponsors don't really care about the volume across a bunch of fragmented markets. They want to know is there depth of liquidity in the market where this thing is primarily going to trade. That is a real competitive advantage that we have. And then when we couple that with all the other services that we can provide that are value added, we've done -- we've seen that we continue to do very well.

And so when we come out with a number on that at close, we're like this is the number. And we've subsequently executed on it really well. The IDC deal was a completely different deal. It was an auction, it closed the day we signed it and that's really when the integration work began in earnest. And so we're continuing to dig through, and we are seeing early success and greater success than we had counted on in things like corporate integration, where we have been able to identify and eliminate corporate redundancies faster. We're seeing things like the 7ticks network and the safety network where we knew there might be some overlap come together and we're realizing benefits from that sooner. And so that's really the acceleration of the 25 to 50 in this year. I don't think our view on the overall synergies related to that business really have changed, the timing hasn't changed. There was a heavy piece of technology integration that has to occur. And as you know, with the NYSE acquisition, that's kind of the last chunk of synergies that we're going to realize there. I suspect that will be the case at IDC as well. We will certainly get the synergies, the timing of them. I'll give you an update on '17 as we move later into this year, and I'll give you an update on '18 as we move into the later 2017. But we said at the beginning of the year, $220 million to go.

So I just think it's a long-term trend, and I think -- as I've said before, I think, the data package that you have on your mobile phone will be bigger in 5 years than it is today and the same for me and everybody that's listening. I just think that it is the unique opportunity of our times to really be connected and have vast amounts of information at your fingertips."

So there is a vast audience of people that have agreements that have expiration dates, and we have a team that goes in well before that. And those renewals happen, as you can see a very high rate of renewal, and that sales cycle is an obvious one that is driven by the contracts. But for new acquisitions, we've seen some of the, as I've mentioned, some of the aggressive market participants particularly people that are doing exchange traded products and new innovative things want to have speed-to-market, so those sales cycles have tended to be short. We're also seeing, I think, some longer sales cycles where we're in conversations with people about wholesale changes to the way we deliver and the technology that underlies our data and the way we deliver it and the way the 2 of us will technologically connect and work together. Those are probably multiyear cycles because we both are committing to build kind of new infrastructure that will better scale for future demand. And then there's everything in between. We are pleasantly surprised, I will tell you, that we predicted that we could grow this business quickly, and we have definitely than that. So there is a part of the sales cycle that is moving very, very quickly to the point that you can see it in our increased -- the increased growth of the businesses that we own. And so that's the good news. But there is -- I will tell you, there is a back end to it based on some of these other trends that we think will pay dividends into the future. When Scott is guiding that, already can tell you what the fourth quarter number is going to be. It gives you some indication that we have visibility into the next few quarters that is pretty, pretty accurate."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I'll begin on Slide 4 cover our results through the first 9 months of 2016.

I'll begin on Slide 4 cover our results through the first 9 months of 2016. Consolidated net revenues grew 4% to $3.4 billion with trading and clearing revenues up 2% and data and listings revenue up 6% versus the prior year.
In addition, operating margins expanded 4 points to 57%, and expected 2016 synergies have increased over 50% to $115 million. All of these factors enabled adjusted earnings to grow 10% versus 2015 pro forma results.
This financial performance also generated record operating cash flow of $1.5 billion for September. This strong cash generation enabled us to reduce our leverage, grew our dividend and, in October, to reach our share repurchase program.
We are executing the well-designed strategic plan, are efficiently integrating our acquired businesses and are delivering top and bottom line growth, strong cash generation and improving ROIC and capital return all less than 1 year after closing our acquisition of Interactive Data.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 where I'll walk you through our results for the third quarter. Revenues in the quarter were up slightly over the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year and margins expanded to 55%. Adjusted operating income increased 4% year-to-year, and adjusted earnings per share were $3.21. Of note, you'll see that our third quarter tax rate was roughly 30%. We currently expect a similar rate for the fourth quarter.
Moving next to Slide 6, I'll provide some additional details about our third quarter revenues. While our total revenues were roughly flat, our data and listings segment revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 55% of our consolidated revenue for the quarter. Within the data and listings segment, our change data was up 17% year-over-year. Pricing and Analytics revenue would have grown 3%, excluding the weakness in the pound and the impact of a large customer true up that occurred in the prior third quarter. Our data revenues remain on track to grow between 6% and 7% for the full year 2016, and the outlook is favorable for at least a similar level of growth in 2017. Our trading and clearing revenues declined 4% versus the prior year as lower volatility and the precipitous fall in the pound created a significant headwind.
Within the trading and clearing segment, though, commodities revenues grew 2%, including energy revenue, which grew 4% year-to-year. Oil and natural gas were both strong contributors and continue to grow in October. Despite continued growth in our OTC clearing business, financial revenues declined 14%, including interest revenues, which were down 15%.
Interest rate future volume grew 13% in the quarter, but revenues were severely impacted by the weaker pound. We expect to publish our October volumes on Wednesday. And despite the currency impacts and lower volatility and equity, we primarily expect reported solid results, including volumes up around 10% and interest rate volumes going more than 50% versus the prior year. The increased volumes, stable to improving open interest level and continued growth in exchange data customers, interest in the markets we operate, remains high. 
Now let's look to Slide 7, where I'll discuss our expense performance and provide updated guidance. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year to $484 million, and pro forma operating margin expanded by 2 points. Importantly, please also note on the right side of the slide that margins expanded in both our businesses. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing interactive data synergies on an accelerated basis. We now expect to achieve around $115 million of synergies for 2016. Increased synergies and the weaker pound enabled us to maintain our full year adjusted expense guidance despite the addition of expenses related to the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisition. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted expenses in the range of $500 million to $505 million with a quarter-to-quarter increase due largely to the addition of these recently acquired businesses.
Our final full year 2016 expense guidance reflects a reduction of nearly 3% versus 2015 and a $75 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement benefited from roughly $35 million largely related to the impact of the lower pound but, more importantly, reflect an additional $40 million in synergies realized during 2016.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our cash generation, deleveraging and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.5 billion in the first 9 months of the year and deployed that cash to invest around $250 million in CapEx to reduce our debt by $1 billion and to return over $300 million to shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.3x at the end of the September. Importantly, we remain on track to reduce leverage below 2x during 2017, which allowed us to restart our share repurchase program in October and will support our objective to grow our dividends as we grow.
We remain confident that our solid cash generation will continue to support our strong investment grade rating and able additional strategic investments and allow us to increase our capital returns to shareholders. Our results for the first 9 months of this year reflect our commitment to execution, innovation and value creation for our shareholders. We deliver on this commitment by expanding our footprint to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers in a very dynamic time in our industry. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

This morning I'll take a few minutes update you on a key areas of investor interest, and then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session.

This morning I'll take a few minutes update you on a key areas of investor interest, and then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. 
I'll start with the topic of consistent long-term growth on Slide 9. Our tenfold revenue growth over the last decade, including revenue that doubled and earnings that have tripled in the last 3 years, is driven by expanding the range of ways we serve our customers around the world. This growth continues with total futures volume up 20% in the month of October, alongside and expanding data business that is meeting the secular demand for more information.
As a startup company, we gain the by fortifying trading station. This market transparency and product standardization and growth demand for clearing to serve the growing need for risk management. And today, as capital and operational efficiencies become paramount, our customers require more of our proprietary information to support risk management, trading and investment management.
Our services continue to evolve with changes in the market, which creates shareholder value by anticipating and capitalizing on change. As the most global exchange operator with over 40% of our total revenues derived outside the U.S., we're moving quickly to leverage our scalable technology infrastructure across North America, Europe and Asia.
In an ever-fragmenting marketplace, we're providing the consistent tools technology and data sources that customers require in order to stitch together the big picture on an enterprise scale. As a result, we're benefiting from balanced geographic, product and customer diversification. And because we're not levered to anyone cyclical trend or geography, we've let our space and growth on virtually every metric over the last decade.
On Slide 10, I'll highlight the strategy behind our balanced approach driven by a virtuous cycle across our global markets, clearing houses, data and listings. Transaction-based revenue can be cyclical, but market participants always require information and make good risk management decisions. This is why we're establishing a new approach for market data for our customers, who told us that they're looking for flexible and efficient ways to receive and respond to information. Our investments in technology that help scale our infrastructure are allowing us to serve customers on an increasingly integrated platform. Following the financial crisis, many new opportunities to provide valuable services have emerged, whether it's increased compliance, the move to independent pricing, demand for information secure to, algorithmic trading or the trends for passive investing, each of these drives increasing demand for data. These dynamics have only begun to play out. An example is last month's SEC's ruling on liquidity, which will require the measuring and reporting of liquidity risks by certain ETFs and mutual funds. Our liquidity indicators product is developed specifically to meet the reporting requirements in the U.S. and Europe, particularly as both the SEC and MiFID rules come into effect. To further build on our capabilities, we completed the acquisition of S&P's Security Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis. These assets add to our portfolio of unique information that spans virtually all asset classes and provides workflow support for the front, middle and back offices. And having increased our capabilities for expanded bond price evaluations, we're developing new types of fixed income indices for institutions investors as a component of our treasury indices. We'll have more details on this in the coming weeks.
We're rapidly integrating the former Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, NYSE Index Operations and ICE's Exchange Data to form decompensated global ICE Data Services Organization. In the third quarter, we also completed the integration of the Safety Connectivity business with our 7 Ticks Network to be in a position to offer an expanded range of service. We're focused on leveraging our broad product and client service platform to drive efficiencies for both our customers and for our company. We believe we're in the early stages of bringing our complete and subsequent prostate a solution to bear, and we'll continue to update you as we build out an integrated data platform. 
The other component of the segment is our listings business. And while the IPO environment continues to be muted, we had a record quarter for revenue. Since ICE's acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we've listed 18 out of the 20 IPOs that raised $1 billion or more, including the largest IPO in 2016 with a listing of ZTO last week.
As we always do, we're also curating our business lines to stay focused on our core capabilities. So we've decided to sell a company known as IDMS that came to us as part of our acquisition of Interactive Data. This business provides services to wealth management firms. We have also decided to sell NYSE governance services, which operates in the governance, risk and compliance space. While good businesses in their own right, they don't meaningfully leverage ICE's core competencies or have our strong margin growth profile, and so we believe that there'll be more available to others within their core sectors.
ICE's recurring revenue grew to over 55% of our total revenue in the third quarter compared to just 38% in the prior third quarter. Today, the majority of our revenue is ratable and subscription-based, which allows greater visibility in the cash flow generation and which provides balance to thus ecology of the transactions segment. This also leads to less volatile earnings in more consistent cash flow, which we believe is a higher-value business. 
On the other side of our revenue equation, it's highlighted on Slide 11, where you can see the ongoing strength in our transaction and clearing segment with revenues up 2% in the first 9 months. In the third quarter, volume again grew year-to-year in energy, agriculture, metals, interest rates and MSCI indexes. Notably, year-to-date through October, the volume in our European interest rate futures complex is up 17%, and, surprising to many, is going 3x as fast as the U.S. interest rate futures contracts traded elsewhere even with all the speculation surrounding a potential Fed rate hike.  Importantly, volume and many of our benchmark contracts are up double digits year-to-date, including ICE Brent crude, our agricultural complex, sterling, Euribor and our MSCI futures contracts.
We also set records in our emerging contracts such as the ICE -- pound-denominated LIBOR future. This is the first sterling-denominated interest rate swap feature to trade and clear on an exchange. And you can also see the solid trends in open interest even amid a less volatile third quarter as market participants kept their positions open heading into year-end. And we continue to grow our lead in our share of crude oil open interest.
We believe that our continued growth is driven by the global relevance of our products and their exposure to the numerous international factors that are driving markets today.
So I'm pleased to note that ICE clear Europe and ICE clear credit both received their compliance recognition from -- during the third quarter. And yesterday, ICE Futures Europe received the CFTC's approval for its board of trade application. These are just a few examples of how the U.S, the U.K and the EU have worked together to utilize equivalents, rather than passporting, to management cross-boarder international regulatory frameworks.
Our drive to grow and evolve has produced consistent growth throughout market cycles. And anyone that's followed the financial markets for a few years knows that there is continuous range going on. One of those drivers of change and driver of opportunity is Brexit. The U.K remains an important global market center with prudent regulation, a focus on ensuring market confidence and a strong financial services talent pool. we are maintaining an active dialogue with officials in the U.K government to preserve the role of markets in London's future. We are encouraged by the particle approach that U.K government is taking to carefully consider the future opportunities as an independent country.
And similarly, we do not believe the financial market infrastructure leaving London is in the best interest of Europe's markets. Many question whether we might bid for the London Stock Exchange, an opportunity that we called off earlier this year in the absence of sufficient information to establish the value of a bid coupled with our concerns about the effects on the company of a Brexit vote. Because this important asset could be leaving the city of London, we believe that this may create new opportunities for us as a leading infrastructure provider as we see the ability to continue to invest in the U.K. For example, in December of last year, we invested in the London-based Trayport, an operator of important technology that serves the European commercial energy markets.
Recently, the CMA issued a finding that ICE owning Trayport would have an adverse impact on competition in the European utility, derivatives trading and clearing markets and then be we should, therefore, divest the Trayport.
ICE and Trayport are not competitors, which the CMA recognized, so our acquisition of Trayport does not involve a loss of competition under a so-called horizontal theory of harm. The CMA's decision relied on a simplistic assessment of market dynamics rather than a rigorous quantitative analysis. And it also relied largely on the use of conflicted third parties that have a competitive interest in the outcome of their view. ICE produced a detailed analysis to demonstrate that we would not and could not operate Trayport that impairs access. We also offered far-reaching operational and governance -- to address CMA's theoretical concerns. So we believe that CMA's decision under such a speculative and baked theory is disproportionate and will be terrible precedent for future merger and acquisition activities in Europe. Therefore, it's important for us that we pursue our right of appeal in connection with this pro-customer, pro-market transaction.
We're committed to continuing Trayport operations in London, and we continue to operate the company just as we have for most of last year. Now across our entire organization, our focus remains on servicing customers. And we believe that if we do the right things with our customers in mind, then we're serving our shareholders.
Let me conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 12, where you can see that we continue to build on our decade-long track record of growth. This year again, we've grown revenues, met or exceeded synergy expectations, reduced expenses and expanded our margins driving 16% adjusted earnings growth in the first 9 months of the year. We've generated over $1.5 billion in cash flow, repaid $1 billion in debt, grew our dividend, restarted our share repurchase program and finalized our stock split, which will occur later this week. And we're already engaged in planning for a very productive 2017.
And so I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the quarter, and I'd also like to thank our team for their continued efforts in meeting our growth objectives.
I'll now turn the call back to the operator, Allison, and we'll be glad to take your questions."

Number 1, recall that at the beginning of the year, when we talked about the synergies. We also mentioned that we have about $45 million increase in compensation and that we be making about $30 million of investments in our products and technology. A lot of that product investment is resulting in deals like the index feel that we're announcing in the data space, the continued solid product that we've announced in that space. So there are investments there. Clearly, a portion of the compensation go to our data team, who have more than earned it in the execution that they had this year. And the other thing you see very clearly on the chart is we had some M&A spending in the year that tips the data space. As you might imagine, a lot of that is been around that Trayport deal. And then the last thing I'd note is a number of the synergies come through our corporate functions in the first year of any deal. And those corporate expenses tend to get allocated to the segments based on revenue because account that supports the company, they don't support data versus trading, and so you actually do see some of the synergy even though they are related to IDC showing up in the trading segment just because of the way that we allocate. So I think if you take a step back, we laid out a pretty clear view of $115 million of synergies in the quarter, but that hopefully helps a little bit on the dynamic that you're asking about. One thing that I would point out in the same aria of Chart 7, we disclosed our operating margins for each of the segment, and I think that's an important story that a lot of people are missing. If you look at our aggregate margins and got a compare that to a diverse basket of competitors, I'm not sure you get the same do you do when you look at margins in the trading segment that are 50% in the quarter and 51% year-to-date. Compare those to other data companies that we compete with and then look at the trading margins, which include the New York Stock Exchange, 61% in the quarter, and 64% year-to-date. And again, compare those to our exchange competitors that we deal with. So hopefully that helps with your direct question, but I think that area of the chart that you're looking at is 1 I point a lot of investors to because I think there's an important story that's being missed."

It's always interesting to us that a lot of the people that try to benefit from fragmentation of markets and complain about the fact that it costs them more to do business in that fragmentation that they help create. And that is what's going on. You look at where you've seen just fragmentation in the past couple of years with a new entrant in the energy futures space, new entrants in the European interest rate space and look at the growth of our complex in those basis. Our trading points have grown and our data sales in those areas have grown. In other words this fragmentation causes arbitrage between markets. It's less easy for people to figure out where the market is at any moment in time. It's much more difficult to write a settlement price for marketing folks. There is much more load,  if you will, on the middle and back-office for compliance, best execution and so on and so forth. All of that trend is driving demand for increased information. One point that, that group that is spending more and more on data doesn't recognize is that the actual cost of data is plummeting. There is just the fact that people are buying more lower-cost, declining cost information. And the spend for many of these people is voluntary. It is because they want a holistic view of the market, and a voluntarily are going out having to buy more and more information even though on a per-unit basis. Information prices have been collapsing over the last decade. So we think the total wallet, if you will, is going to continue to increase. Regulatory pressures, back-office compliance, pressure, reporting pressures, things that all of us in a more regulated financial service industry are going to had to adjust to and pay for. Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it wasn't something that we had to do before, is affecting our room as well. But it is in the irreversible trends in my mind. We still have a lot of regulation to come into impact in Europe, MiFID for example; the differences that may come out of the EU and the U.K with the actual Brexit separation.

And so if you kind of back out, you call it $15 million, the guidance range would've been $485 million to $490 million, which is what we've been on average every quarter this year and so relatively flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In terms of revenue, you'll likely recall that I mentioned last quarter we see a slight deceleration into the third quarter and then a reacceleration into the fourth where we would approach $500 million of data revenue. That was at a time where the pound was still around $1.31. It's now closer to $1.22. And so that looks softened a little bit. So on an apples-to-apples basis, versus maybe the high 4 90s, we'd be looking closer to the low to mid 4 90. That notwithstanding, I actually think data revenues in the quarter including the 2 acquisitions, will be north of $515 million. And so that expenses that I mentioned in the earnings script will be more than offset by revenues, and then obviously that adds to our overall data business and gives us an opportunity as we combine those 2 companies over time."

We decided to replace that infra structure with NYSE Connect, which is what we talked about. It's basically a desktop and provides trading information. We've been building that out in a space where when we look at the space and particularly following up on earlier questions, there is pressure on some of the spent to lower the price of desktops particularly, and that area of data acquisition the desktop delivery is under a lot of pressure. So having a very low-cost desktop that we can provide to people to give them the basic information they need around at debt and equities has been very, very well received. So in a sense, we're a disruptor in providing such a thing. As you can imagine, we have very good data about where stocks are trading given that we own the NYSE, and we have very good data around where bonds are trading given that we've built out this fixed income platform with a number of acquisitions. And we have very good data around corporate actions for our listed companies since it's a requirement that they get that information to us. So that's a very nice desktop that we can expand on. Right now, we're just focused on our list of companies but we'll see where life takes that offering. It has almost no cost to us in terms of incremental margins.

We would have been at 6% this year without it. And frankly, on a constant-currency basis, we would've been above 7% for data even without those acquisitions. But directly to your question, we have had a very strong performance in our exchange data revenue this year. Jeff talked about it on the last call and this call. That's a solid mix of growth in customers and some additional value that we captured as we've sold more data to existing customers. As Jeff said, while there is discussion about prices going up, the price per unit if you look at it in terms of the data that's consumed for the price, that data amount has increased significantly. So a good year this year. We would expect to have a good year again in exchange data next year. I truly don't expect it to be on par with this year. But we have, as Jeff alluded to, seen very strong sales in our pricing evaluation business, if you will, the former IDC business, and that's really what is encouraging us and gives us a good solid foundation to suggest that we could be at least at the same level of growth in 2017 as 2016.

If you look on an absolute basis, although we dipped to just below 8%, that relates to the IDC business that we haven't even owned for a year. If you look at the trends coming out of the last year before that business, we were on our way back to 10%. We'll start to rebuild that as we move through this year and next.

So 2 things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract speculator use, and there has been -- over the last year or so a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go, $60 going down to $30 will go",503,"Sure. So 2 things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract speculator use, and there has been -- over the last year or so a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go, $60 going down to $30 will go back up to $50. Those kinds of behaviors particularly as the U.S. was rightsizing its drilling infrastructure and as high yield was in focus on many of the energy companies. And so 1 would naturally expect that WTI, which we also have, would have more trading in that environment. Brent is and remains the contract that most of the energy space uses for hedging. And the nice thing about that is you can see that that's industry continues to use Brent. The second trend that goes on as we have competitors that are paying for order flow. And there are people that in the trading business that if you pay them they will produce volume. And our competitors that do that like to talk about market share and report market share, and there was actually investors and analysts that reward them for getting market share, even though it's destroying value for shareholders. We have a large customer come to us and said, hey, one of your competitors came to us and said that they would buy our business. What are they talking about? They were not talking about to us about lowering our cost. They actually said they would pay us to move to go. And we said, how much do they say they would pay you? In the said, we will pay you anything, name your price. And so with that kind of behavior, you will always find some people that will take up on that. It doesn't bother us that we lose that share because we are primary market. And as you can see from data sales and just growth in our open interest and what-have-you, that people tend to have to rely on the primary market in order to get paid by competitors. So overall trading volume goes up at our volume, which is really the volume of people that want to pay or maybe the wallet share, if you will, continues to go up for us. And with respect to Brent, this will be, we believe, our 19th consecutive year of growth in trading of Brent. I mean, it's almost -- you put a ruler on it, it's almost an unprecedented ability when you think about everything that's going on in the world over that 19-year period. Wars, changes in policy, changes in regulation, financial crises, et cetera. We continue to see Brent just its volumes just marching forward so we're very lucky to have that as the primary market. We are really careful custodians of it. And it's why we're not playing that game of going in and asking customers for much do you want us to pay you to do business with us."

Where we -- when we're out talking to customers, where we hear there is a lot of focus is on data that's delivered via a desktop, a lot of focus on the number of screens, if you will and the acquisition of desktops. We built the safety network and combined it with a 7 ticks network to build essentially a data plan that is the subject via API. And we see strong growth in people wanting to buy bulk data if you will via an API and manage it internally and not buy it on individual desktop basis. We're not really in the desktop space as I mentioned earlier. We have NYSE Connect, which is a desktop that is a very low-cost desktop and to a certain degree, it's becoming a substitution for the higher desktop providers, if you will. And so I think that's the trend that sort of mixed up here. Alex, I really believe that the middle and back-office in your firm has no choice but to, for compliance purposes and for improving systems and commoditization of the way risk is being looked at insides large firms is buying that bulk data and figuring out how to redistribute it, and I think that that trend is going to continue. Because we haven't really seen the full implementation of MiFID. We have seen the results of different Brexit regime. The SEC is not fully commented Dodd-Frank. And so there are still more pressures for compliance and internal functions that we think will drive demand."

We still do have synergies that we will extract from that business. We mentioned originally $150 million. We'll do 65 this year, well above what we thought it would get done in the first year. But those synergies will continue to come out and improve margins. The other thing that I talked about a little bit that I think it's really important for people to understand, the incremental margin on the proprietary data we sell is very similar to historically what you've seen him in the margins on our trading business, where it's more labor-intensive in terms of just trying to determine what the price of bond is. There are people involved with that versus the oil be decided on an exchange. But once you determine that price of the bond, if I can sell it to a second customer and a third customer and a fourth quarter, the incremental costs are very small. And so revenue growth and price hike with the margins, synergies drive margin improvement, and so I absolutely think the expectation for that business is margin expansion over time. Again, I'm not going to guess what the end state is but it's higher."

And so the businesses that you mentioned that we're going to exit and businesses that we've exited in the past when we acquired NYSE and other firms tend to be very good businesses that are growing, but they don't have the phenomena where we can use our technology skills to build something once and our network to redistribute it. And so for example, we're going to sell NYSE government services, that is a very hot space. It's a growing space companies need more infrastructure to educate employees about anti-money-laundering. There is a huge demand for what they do and that company has -- is going, has growth potential, but it doesn't have that phenomenon that I just mentioned that really we do well. So that's why we say we think that company will be better owned by others. A good company but 1 that doesn't cater to our needs. We tend to see other people in our space go into those kinds of businesses. But we just don't do well and it doesn't really work for us to be in these lower-margin consultancy type businesses."

That's why we were able to get back into the market in October and take advantage of what Jeff correctly identified as the best buy in the market in our opinion. So we definitely are on a path to get below 2x. We're committed to get there. But as I said in my prepared remarks, not only we were able to restart our buybacks in October, but we remain committed to grow our dividend as we grow. And I think, with the increased cash generation that you're seeing, we're going to be north of $2 billion of operating cash flow this year, well north of probably $1.7 billion of free cash flow this year. And that should definitely allow us to get our leverage back below 2x to continue to ramp up our share repurchases because we certainly are at the level in the fourth quarter that we would anticipate being as we move through next year then also to grow the dividend as we grow. All of which hopefully move us. In '14 and '15, we returned almost $1 billion a year. This year, it will be between $400 million and $500 million but I said I think as you get into '17 and certainly '18 and '19, you're going to see us get back to and above the levels you saw in '14 and '15."

I'll begin on Slide 4 and cover our results through the first 9 months of 2016. Consolidated net revenues grew 4% to $3.4 billion, with trading and clearing revenues up 2% and data and listings revenue up 6% versus the prior year.
In addition, operating margins expanded 4 points to 57%, and expected 2016 synergies have increased over 50% to $115 million. All of these factors enabled adjusted earnings to grow 10% versus 2015 pro forma results.
This strong financial performance also generated record operating cash flow of $1.5 billion through September. This strong cash generation enabled us to reduce our leverage, grow our dividend and, in October, to restart our share repurchase program.
We are executing a well-designed strategic plan, are efficiently integrating our acquired businesses and are delivering top and bottom line growth, strong cash generation and improving ROIC and capital return, all less than 1 year after closing our acquisition of Interactive Data.
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll walk you through our results for the third quarter. Revenues in the quarter were up slightly over the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year and margins expanded to 55%. Adjusted operating income increased 4% year-to-year, and adjusted earnings per share were $3.21. Of note, you'll see that our third quarter tax rate was roughly 30%. We currently expect a similar rate for the fourth quarter.
Moving next to Slide 6, I'll provide some additional details about our third quarter revenues. While our total revenues were roughly flat, our data and listings segment revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 55% of our consolidated revenue for the quarter. Within the data and listings segment, our exchange data was up 17% year-over-year. Pricing and analytics revenue would have grown 3%, excluding the weakness in the pound and the impact of a large customer true up that occurred in the prior third quarter. Our data revenues remain on track to grow between 6% and 7% for the full year 2016, and the outlook is favorable for, at least, a similar level of growth in 2017. Our trading and clearing revenues declined 4% versus the prior year as lower volatility and the precipitous fall in the pound created a significant headwind.
Within the trading and clearing segment, though, commodities revenues grew 2%, including energy revenue, which grew 4% year-to-year. Oil and natural gas were both strong contributors and continue to grow in October. Despite continued growth in our OTC clearing business, financials revenues declined 14%, including interest rate revenues, which were down 15%.
Interest rate futures volume grew 13% in the quarter, but revenues were significantly impacted by the weaker pound. We expect to publish our October volumes on Wednesday. And despite the currency impacts on lower volatility and equity, we preliminarily expect to report solid results, including oil volumes up around 10% and interest rate volumes growing more than 50% versus the prior year. The increased volumes, stable to improving open interest levels and continued growth in exchange data customers, [indiscernible] interest in the markets we operate, remains high.
Now let's flip to Slide 7, where I'll discuss our expense performance and provide updated guidance. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year to $484 million, and pro forma operating margin expanded by 2 points. Importantly, please, also, note on the right side of the slide that margins expanded in both our business segments. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing interactive data synergies on an accelerated basis. We now expect to achieve around $115 million of synergies for 2016. Increased synergies and the weaker pound enabled us to maintain our full year adjusted expense guidance, despite the addition of expenses related to the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted expenses in the range of $500 million to $505 million with the quarter-to-quarter increase due largely to the addition of these recently acquired businesses.
Our final full year 2016 expense guidance, reflects a reduction of nearly 3% versus 2015 and a $75 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement benefited from roughly $35 million, largely related to the impact of the lower pound but, more importantly, reflects an additional $40 million in synergies realized during 2016.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our cash generation, deleveraging and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.5 billion in the first 9 months of the year, and deployed that cash to invest around $250 million in CapEx to reduce our debt by $1 billion and to return over $300 million to shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.3x at the end of September. Importantly, we remain on track to reduce leverage below 2x during 2017, which allowed us to restart our share repurchase program in October and will support our objective to grow our dividend as we grow.
We remain confident that our solid cash generation will continue to support our strong investment grade rating, enable additional strategic investment and allow us to increase our capital returns to shareholders. Our results for the first 9 months of this year reflect our commitment to execution, innovation and value creation for our shareholders. We deliver on this commitment by expanding our footprint to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers in a very dynamic time in our industry. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

This morning I'll take a few minutes to update you on key areas of investor interest, and then we'll conduct the question-and-answer session. 
I'll start with the topic of consistent long-term growth on Slide 9. Our tenfold revenue growth over the last decade, including revenue that doubled and earnings that have tripled in the last 3 years, is driven by expanding the range of ways we serve our customers around the world. This growth continues with total futures volume up 20% in the month of October, alongside an expanding data business that is meeting the secular demand for more information.
As a startup company, we gained a foothold by electronifying trade execution. This market transparency and product standardization, then, drove demand for clearing to serve the growing need for risk management. And today, as capital and operational efficiencies become paramount, our customers require more of our proprietary information to support risk management, trading and investment management.
Our services continue to evolve with changes in the market, which creates shareholder value by anticipating and capitalizing on change. As the most global exchange operator, with over 40% of our total revenues derived outside the U.S., we're moving quickly to leverage our scalable technology infrastructure across North America, Europe and Asia.
In an ever-fragmenting marketplace, we're providing the consistent tools, technology and data sources that customers require, in order to stitch together the big picture on an enterprise scale. As a result, we're benefiting from balanced geographic, product and customer diversification. And because we're not levered to any one cyclical trend or geography, we've led our space and growth on, virtually, every metric over the last decade.
On Slide 10, I'll highlight the strategy behind our balanced approach driven by a virtuous cycle across our global markets, clearing houses, data and listings. Transaction-based revenue can be cyclical, but market participants always require information to make good risk management decisions. This is why we're establishing a new approach for market data, for our customers who've told us that they're looking for flexible and efficient ways to receive and respond to information. Our investments in technology, that helps scale our infrastructure, are allowing us to serve customers on an increasingly integrated platform. Following the financial crisis, many new opportunities to provide valuable services have emerged, whether it's increased compliance, the move to independent pricing, demand for information security, algorithmic trading or the trend toward passive investing, each of these drives increasing demand for data. These dynamics have only begun to play out. An example is, last month's SEC ruling on liquidity, which will require the measuring and reporting of liquidity risk by certain ETFs and mutual funds. Our liquidity indicators product is developed specifically to meet the reporting requirements in the U.S. and Europe, particularly as both the SEC and MiFID rules come into effect. To further build on our capabilities, we completed the acquisition of S&P's Security Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis. These assets add to our portfolio of unique information that spans virtually all asset classes, and provides workflow support for the front, middle and back offices. And having increased our capabilities for expanded bond price evaluations, we're developing new types of fixed income indices for institutional investors, as a complement to our treasury indices. We'll have more details on this in the coming weeks.
We're rapidly integrating the former Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, NYSE index operations and ICE's exchange data to form the comprehensive global ICE Data Services organization. In the third quarter, we also completed the integration of the safety connectivity business with our 7 Ticks network to be in a position to offer an expanded range of service. We're focused on leveraging our broad product and client service platform to drive efficiencies for both our customers and for our company. We believe, we're in the early stages of bringing our complete and flexible enterprise data solution to bear, and we'll continue to update you as we build out an integrated data platform. 
The other component of this segment is our listings business. And while the IPO environment continues to be muted, we had a record quarter for revenue. Since ICE's acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we've listed 18 out of the 20 IPOs that raised $1 billion or more, including the largest IPO in 2016 with the listing of ZTO last week.
As we always do, we're also curating our business lines to stay focused on our core capabilities. So we've decided to sell a company, known as IDMS, that came to us as part of our acquisition of Interactive Data. This business provides services to wealth management firms. We have also decided to sell NYSE Governance Services, which operates in the governance, risk and compliance space. While good businesses in their own right, they don't meaningfully leverage ICE's core competencies or have our strong margin growth profile, and so we believe that they'll be more available to others within their core sectors.
ICE's recurring revenue grew to over 55% of our total revenue in the third quarter compared to just 38% in the prior third quarter. Today, the majority of our revenue is ratable and subscription-based, which allows greater visibility in the cash flow generation and which provides balance to the cyclicality of the transaction segment. This also leads to less volatile earnings and more consistent cash flow, which, we believe, is a higher-value business. 
On the other side of our revenue equation, it's highlighted on Slide 11, where you can see the ongoing strength in our transaction and clearing segment, with revenues up 2% in the first 9 months. In the third quarter, volume again grew year-to-year in energy, agriculture, metals, interest rates and MSCI indexes. Notably, year-to-date through October, the volume in our European interest rate futures complex is up 17%, and, surprising to many, is going 3x as fast as the U.S. interest rate futures complex traded elsewhere, even with all the speculation surrounding a potential Fed rate hike. Importantly, volume in many of our benchmark contracts are up double-digits year-to-date, including ICE Brent Crude, our agricultural complex, sterling, Euribor, and our MSCI futures contracts.
We also set records in our emerging contracts such as the ICE -- pound-denominated LIBOR future. This is the first sterling-denominated interest rate swap feature to trade and clear on an exchange. And you can also see the solid trends and open interest, even amid a less volatile third quarter, as market participants kept their positions open heading in the year-end. And we continue to grow our lead in our share of crude oil open interest.
We believe that our continued growth is driven by the global relevance of our products, and their exposure to the numerous international factors that are driving markets today.
So I'm pleased to note that ICE Clear Europe and ICE Clear Credit, both received their EMIR compliance recognition from ESMA during the third quarter. And yesterday, ICE Futures Europe received the CFTC's approval for its foreign board of trade application. These are just a few examples of how the U.S., the U.K. and the EU have worked together to utilize equivalents, rather than passporting, to management cross-border international regulatory frameworks.
Our drive to grow and evolve has produced consistent growth throughout market cycles. And anyone that's followed the financial markets for a few years, knows that there is continuous change  going on. One of those drivers of change and driver of opportunity is Brexit. The U.K. remains an important global market center with prudent regulation, a focus on ensuring market confidence and a strong financial services talent pool. We are maintaining an active dialogue with officials in the U.K. government, to help preserve the role of markets in London's future. We are encouraged by the particle approach that the U.K. government is taking to carefully consider the future opportunities as an independent country.
And similarly, we do not believe that financial market infrastructure, leaving London, is in the best interest of Europe's markets. Many question whether we might bid for the London Stock Exchange, an opportunity that we called off earlier this year in the absence of sufficient information to establish the value of a bid, coupled with our concerns about the effects on the company of a Brexit vote. Because this important asset could be leaving the city of London, we believe that this may create new opportunities for us as a leading infrastructure provider as we see the ability to continue to invest in the U.K. For example, in December of last year, we invested in the London-based Trayport, an operator of important technology that serves the European commercial energy markets.
Recently, the CMA issued a finding that ICE owning Trayport would have an adverse impact on competition in the European utility, derivatives trading and clearing markets and that we should, therefore, divest of Trayport.
ICE and Trayport are not competitors, which the CMA recognized, so our acquisition of Trayport does not involve a loss of competition under a, so-called, horizontal theory of harm. The CMA's decision relied on a simplistic assessment of market dynamics, rather than a rigorous quantitative analysis. And it also relied largely on the views of conflicted third parties that have a competitive interest in the outcome of their review. ICE produced a detailed analysis to demonstrate that we would not and could not operate Trayport in a way that impairs access. We also offered far-reaching operational and governance remedies to address CMA's theoretical concerns. So we believe that CMA's decision under such a speculative and vague theory is disproportionate and it will be a terrible precedent for future merger and acquisition activities in Europe. Therefore, it's important for us that we pursue our right of appeal in connection with this pro-customer, pro-market transaction.
We're committed to continuing Trayport's operations in London, and we continue to operate the company just as we have for most of last year. And across our entire organization, our focus remains on servicing customers. And we believe that if we do the right things, with our customers in mind, then we're serving our shareholders.
Let me conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 12, where you can see that we continue to build on our decade-long track record of growth. This year again, we've grown revenues, met or exceeded synergy expectations, reduced expenses and expanded our margins, driving 16% adjusted earnings growth in the first 9 months of the year. We've generated over $1.5 billion in cash flow, repaid $1 billion in debt, grew our dividend, restarted our share repurchase program and finalized our stock split, which will occur later this week. And we're already engaged in planning for a very productive 2017.

Number 1, recall that at the beginning of the year, when we talked about the synergies. We also mentioned that we'd have about a $45 million increase in compensation and that we'd be making about $30 million of investment in our products and technology. A lot of that product investment is resulting in deals like the index deals that we're announcing in the data space, the continuous evaluated product that we've announced in that space. So there are investments there. Clearly, a portion of the compensation go to our data team, who have more than earned it in the outstanding execution that they had this year. And the other thing you see, very clearly, on the chart is we've had some M&A spending in the year that hit the data space. As you might imagine, a lot of that's been around the Trayport deal. And then the last thing I'd note is, a number of the synergies come through our corporate functions in the first year of any deal. And those corporate expenses tend to get allocated to the segments based on revenue, because an accountant supports the company, they don't support data versus trading. And so you, actually, do see some of the synergies, even though they are related to IDC, showing up in the trading segment just because of the way that we allocate. So I think if you take a step back, we've laid out a pretty clear view of $115 million of synergies in the quarter, but that hopefully helps a little bit on the dynamic that you're asking about. One thing though I'd point out, in that same area of Chart 7, we've disclosed our operating margins for each of the segment, and I think that's an important story that a lot of people are missing. If you look at our aggregate margins and, kind of, compare that to a diverse basket of competitors, I'm not sure you get the same view you do when you look at margins in the trading segment that are 50% in the quarter and 51% year-to-date. Compare those to other data companies that we compete with and then look at the trading margins, which include the New York Stock Exchange and are 61% in the quarter, and 64% year-to-date. And again, compare those to our exchange competitors that we deal with. So, hopefully, that helps with your direct question, but I think that area of the chart you're looking at, is the 1 I point a lot of investors to, because I think there's an important story that's being missed."

It's always interesting to us that a lot of the people that try to benefit from fragmentation of markets then complain about the fact that it cost them more to do business in that fragmentation that they helped create. And that is what's going on. You look at where you've seen just fragmentation in the past couple of years with new entrants in the energy futures space, new entrants in the European interest rate space and look at the growth of our complex in those spaces. Our trading points have grown, and our data sales in those areas have grown. In other words, this fragmentation causes arbitrage between markets. It's less easy for people to figure out where the market is at any moment in time. It's much more difficult to create settlement price for marketing warps. There is much more load, if you will, on the middle and back-office for compliance, best execution and so on and so forth. All of that trend is driving demand for increased information. One point that, that group that is spending more and more on data doesn't recognize is that the actual cost of data is plummeting. There is just the fact that people are buying more lower-cost, declining cost information. And the spend for many of these people is voluntary. It is because they want a holistic view of the market, and they voluntarily are going out and having to buy more and more information. Even though on a per-unit basis, information prices have been collapsing over the last decade. So we think the total wallet, if you will, is going to continue to increase. Regulatory pressures, back-office compliance pressures, reporting pressures, things that all of us in a more regulated financial service industry are going to have to adjust to and pay for. Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it wasn't something that we had to do before, is affecting our firm as well. But it is a irreversible trend in my mind. We still have a lot of regulation to come into impact in Europe, MiFID for example; the differences that may come out of the EU and the U.K with the actual Brexit separation. So I would expect that, that trend is going to continue."

And so if you, kind of, back out, you call it $15 million, the guidance range would have been $485 million to $490 million, which is right  we've been on average every quarter this year and so relatively flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In terms of revenue, you will likely recall that I mentioned last quarter, we'd see a slight deceleration into the third quarter and then a reacceleration into the fourth where we would approach $500 million of data revenue. That was at a time where the pound was still around $1.31. It's now closer to $1.22. And so that outlook softened a little bit. So on an apples-to-apples basis, versus maybe the high 490s, we'd be looking at something closer to the low to mid 490s. That notwithstanding, I actually think data revenues in the quarter, including the 2 acquisitions, will be north of $515 million. And so that was expenses that I mentioned in the earnings script, will be more than offset by revenues, and then obviously that adds to our overall data business and gives us an opportunity as we combine those 2 companies over time."

But yet our company is actually growing. And you couple that with this new segment that we have, our largest segment, which is really growing in the trading and, actually in the data and connectivity space. Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks that we see next year the growth -- we have visibility because we're signing contracts right now that extend well into next year and beyond for many.

We decided to replace that infrastructure with NYSE Connect, which is what we've talked about. It's basically a desktop and provides trading information. We've been building that out in a space where when we look at the space, and particularly following up on earlier questions, there is pressure on some of the spend to lower the price of desktops particularly, and that area of data acquisition, the desktop delivery, is under a lot of pressure. So having a very low-cost desktop that we can provide to people to give them the basic information they need around -- at debt and equities has been very, very well received. So, in a sense, we're a disruptor in providing such a thing. As you can imagine, we have very good data about where stocks are trading, given that we own the NYSE. And we have very good data around where bonds are trading, given that we've built out this fixed income platform with a number of acquisitions. And we have very good data around corporate actions for our listed companies since it's a requirement that they give that information to us. So that's a very nice desktop that we can expand on. Right now, we're just focused on our listed companies, but we'll see where life takes that offering. It has almost no cost to us in terms of incremental margins.

We would have been at 6% this year without it. And frankly, on a constant-currency basis, we would've been above 7% for data even without those acquisitions. But directly to your question, we have had a very strong performance in our exchange data revenues this year. Jeff talked about it on the last call and this call. That's a solid mix of growth in customers and some additional value that we've captured as we've sold more data to existing customers. As Jeff said, while there is discussion about prices going up, the price per unit if you look at it in terms of the data that's consumed for the price, that data amount has increased significantly. So a good year this year. We would expect to have a good year again in exchange data next year. I certainly don't expect it to be on par with this year. But we have, as Jeff alluded to, seen very strong sales in our pricing evaluation business, if you will, the former IDC business, and that's really what is encouraging us and gives us a good solid foundation to suggest that we could be at least at the same level of growth in 2017 as 2016. So said differently, I would expect a bit more balanced growth among, particularly, exchange data and pricing and valuations in '17 versus '16, which was benefited a little bit more by the exchange data."

If you looked at the trends coming out of the last year before that business, we were on our way back to 10%. We'll start to rebuild that as we move through this year and next.

So 2 things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract that speculators use, and there has been -- over the last year or so a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go, would $60 go down to $30",505,"Sure. So 2 things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract that speculators use, and there has been -- over the last year or so a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go, would $60 go down to $30, will it go back up to $50. Those kinds of behaviors, particularly, as the U.S. was rightsizing its drilling infrastructure and as high yield was in focus on many of the energy companies. And so 1 would naturally expect that WTI, which we also have, would have more trading in that environment. Brent is and remains the contract that most of the energy space uses for hedging. And the nice thing about that is you can see that, that industry continues to use Brent. The second trend that goes on is, we have competitors that are paying for order flow. And there are people that in the trading business that if you pay them, they will produce volume. And our competitors that do that like to talk about market share and report market share, and there's actually investors and analysts that reward them for getting market share, even though it's destroying value for shareholders. We had a large customer come to us and said, ""Hey, one of your competitors came to us and said, that they would buy our business."" What are they talking about? They were not talking about, to us about lowering our cost. They actually said they would pay us to move. And we said, ""How much did they say they would pay you?"" And they said, ""We will pay you anything, name your price."" And so with that kind of behavior, you will always find some people that will take up on that. It doesn't bother us that we loose that share because we are a primary market. And as you can see from data sales and just growth in our open interest and what-have-you, that people tend to have to rely on the primary market in order to get paid by competitors. So, overall, trading volume goes up but our volume, which is really the volume of people that want to pay or maybe the wallet share, if you will, continues to go up for us. And with respect to Brent, this will be, we believe, our 19th consecutive year of growth in trading of Brent. I mean, it's almost -- you put a ruler on it, it's almost an unprecedented ability when you think about everything that's going on in the world over that 19-year period. Wars, changes in policy, changes in regulation, financial crises, et cetera. We continue to see Brent just its volume just marching forward, so we're very lucky to have that as a primary market, and we are really careful custodians of it. And it's why we're not playing that game of going in and asking customers, how much do you want us to pay you to do business with us."

We see our retention rate is very, very high, maybe even increasing a little bit, well into the above 90% renewal rate. So we don't see the pressure, if you will, on those businesses. Where we -- when we're out talking to customers, where we hear there is a lot of focuses on data that's delivered via a desktop, a lot of focus on the number of screens, if you will, and the acquisition of desktops. We've built the safety network and combined it with the 7ticks network to build, essentially, a data plan that is distributed via API. And we see strong growth in people wanting to buy bulk data, if you will, via an API and manage it internally and not buy it on an individual desktop basis. We're not really in the desktop space. As I mentioned earlier, we have NYSE Connect, which is a desktop that is a very low-cost desktop and to a certain degree is becoming a substitution for the higher desktop providers, if you will. And so, I think, that's the trend that's sort of mixed up here. Alex, I really believe that the middle and back-office in your firm has no choice but to, for compliance purposes, and for improving systems and commoditization of the way risk is being looked at inside large firms, is buying that bulk data and figuring out how to redistribute it, and I think that, that trend is going to continue. Because we haven't really seen the full implementation of MiFID. We haven't seen what the result of a different Brexit regime. The SEC has not fully commented Dodd-Frank. And so there are still more pressures for compliance and internal functions that we think will drive demand."

We have people that really just look at markets every day and talk to customers and try to say, do we have liquidity all the way out the forward pricing curve? Are there gaps in where people tried to do business and where we have markets. And so we'll provide incentive programs to try to fill in gaps or to make the markets better for our customers. And so we do have incentive programs, which touch pricing, but they are not to get overall market share. They're really to make a better market.

We still do have synergies that we will extract from that business. We mentioned originally $150 million. We'll do $65 million this year, well above what we thought we'd get done in the first year. But those synergies will continue to come out and improve margins. The other thing that I've talked about a little bit that I think is really important for people to understand, the incremental margins on the proprietary data we sell is very similar to, historically, what you've seen the incremental margins on our trading business. Where it's more labor intensive in terms of just trying to determine what the price of a bond is. There are people involved with that versus oil being decided on an exchange. But once you determine that price of the bond, if I can sell it to a second customer and a third customer and a fourth quarter, the incremental costs are very small. And so revenue growth drives high incremental margin, synergies drive margin improvements. And so I absolutely think the expectation for that business is margin expansion over time. Again, I'm not going to guess what the instate is but it's higher."

And so for example, we're going to sell NYSE Governance Services, that is a very hot space, it's a growing space. Companies need more infrastructure to educate employees about anti-money-laundering, there is a huge demand for what they do and that company has -- is growing, and has growth potential. But it doesn't have that phenomenon, that I just mentioned, that really we do well. So that's why we say, we think that company will be better owned by others. A good company but 1 that doesn't cater to our needs. We tend to see other people in our space go into those kinds of businesses.

So we definitely are on a path to get below 2x. We're committed to get there. But as I said in my prepared remarks, not only were we able to restart our buybacks in October, but we remain committed to grow our dividend as we grow. And I think, with the increased cash generation that you're seeing, we're going to be north of $2 billion of operating cash flow this year, well north of probably $1.7 billion of free cash flow this year. And that should definitely allow us to get our leverage back below 2x to continue to ramp-up our share repurchases because we certainly aren't at the level in the fourth quarter that we would anticipate being as we move through next year and then also to grow the dividend as we grow, all of which would, hopefully, move us.

They -- people can come do those deals directly with us. They don't have to have a middleman, and we can provide a range of services. So we've been very successful early on in the ETF, ETP space, where there's a lot of cost pressure on those competitors and yet they need a full range of services from listing the ETF, to calculating the ETF, to having the prices of the things that are in the ETF, to creating index for the ETF and using our brands and marketing the ETF.

I'll begin on Slide 4 and cover our results through the first 9 months of 2016. Consolidated net revenues grew 4% to $3.4 billion, with trading and clearing revenues up 2% and data and listings revenue up 6% versus the prior year.
In addition, operating margins expanded 4 points to 57%, and expected 2016 synergies have increased over 50% to $115 million. All of these factors enabled adjusted earnings to grow 10% versus 2015 pro forma results.
This strong financial performance also generated record operating cash flow of $1.5 billion through September. This strong cash generation enabled us to reduce our leverage, grow our dividend and, in October, to restart our share repurchase program.
We are executing a well-designed strategic plan, are efficiently integrating our acquired businesses and are delivering top and bottom line growth, strong cash generation and improving ROIC and capital return, all less than 1 year after closing our acquisition of Interactive Data.
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll walk you through our results for the third quarter. Revenues in the quarter were up slightly over the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year and margins expanded to 55%. Adjusted operating income increased 4% year-to-year, and adjusted earnings per share were $3.21. Of note, you'll see that our third quarter tax rate was roughly 30%. We currently expect a similar rate for the fourth quarter.
Moving next to Slide 6, I'll provide some additional details about our third quarter revenues. While our total revenues were roughly flat, our data and listings segment revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 55% of our consolidated revenue for the quarter. Within the data and listings segment, our exchange data was up 17% year-over-year. Pricing and analytics revenue would have grown 3%, excluding the weakness in the pound and the impact of a large customer true-up that occurred in the prior third quarter. Our data revenues remain on track to grow between 6% and 7% for the full year 2016, and the outlook is favorable for at least a similar level of growth in 2017. Our trading and clearing revenues declined 4% versus the prior year, as lower volatility and the precipitous fall in the pound created a significant headwind.
Within the trading and clearing segment, though, commodities revenues grew 2%, including energy revenue, which grew 4% year-to-year. Oil and natural gas were both strong contributors and continued to grow in October. Despite continued growth in our OTC clearing business, financials revenues declined 14%, including interest rate revenues, which were down 15%.
Interest rate futures volume grew 13% in the quarter, but revenues were significantly impacted by the weaker pound. We expect to publish our October volumes on Wednesday. And despite continued currency impacts and lower volatility in equity, we preliminarily expect to report solid results, including oil volumes up around 10% and interest rate volumes growing more than 50% versus the prior year. The increased volumes, stable to improving open interest levels and continued growth in exchange data customers, [indiscernible] interest in the markets we operate remains high.
Now let's flip to Slide 7, where I'll discuss our expense performance and provide updated guidance. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year to $484 million, and pro forma operating margin expanded by 2 points. Importantly, please also note on the right side of the slide that margins expanded in both our business segments. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies on an accelerated basis. We now expect to achieve around $115 million of synergies for 2016. Increased synergies and the weaker pound enabled us to maintain our full year adjusted expense guidance, despite the addition of expenses related to the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted expenses in the range of $500 million to $505 million, with the quarter-to-quarter increase due largely to the addition of these recently acquired businesses.
Our final full year 2016 expense guidance reflects a reduction of nearly 3% versus 2015 and a $75 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement benefited from roughly $35 million, largely related to the impact of the lower pound but, more importantly, reflects an additional $40 million in synergies realized during 2016.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our cash generation, deleveraging and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.5 billion in the first 9 months of the year, and deployed that cash to invest around $250 million in CapEx, to reduce our debt by $1 billion and to return over $300 million to shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.3x at the end of September. Importantly, we remain on track to reduce leverage below 2x during 2017, which allowed us to restart our share repurchase program in October and will support our objective to grow our dividend as we grow.
We remain confident that our solid cash generation will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating, enable additional strategic investment and allow us to increase our capital returns to shareholders. Our results for the first 9 months of this year reflect our commitment to execution, innovation and value creation for our shareholders. We deliver on this commitment by expanding our footprint to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers in a very dynamic time in our industry. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As a startup company, we gained a foothold by electronifying trade execution. This market transparency and product standardization then drove demand for clearing to serve the growing need for risk management. And today, as capital and operational efficiencies become paramount, our customers require more of our proprietary information to support risk management, trading and investment management.
Our services continue to evolve with changes in the market, which creates shareholder value by anticipating and capitalizing on change. As the most global exchange operator, with over 40% of our total revenues derived outside the U.S., we're moving quickly to leverage our scalable technology infrastructure across North America, Europe and Asia.
In an ever-fragmenting marketplace, we're providing the consistent tools, technology and data sources that customers require in order to stitch together the big picture on an enterprise scale. As a result, we're benefiting from balanced geographic, product and customer diversification. And because we're not levered to any one cyclical trend or geography, we've led our space in growth on virtually every metric over the last decade.
On Slide 10, I'll highlight the strategy behind our balanced approach, driven by a virtuous cycle across our global markets, clearing houses, data and listings. Transaction-based revenue can be cyclical, but market participants always require information to make good risk management decisions. This is why we're establishing a new approach for market data for our customers who've told us that they're looking for flexible and efficient ways to receive and respond to information. Our investments in technology, that helps scale our infrastructure, are allowing us to serve customers on an increasingly integrated platform. Following the financial crisis, many new opportunities to provide valuable services have emerged. Whether it's increased compliance, the move to independent pricing, demand for information security, algorithmic trading or the trend toward passive investing, each of these drives increasing demand for data. These dynamics have only begun to play out. An example is last month's SEC ruling on liquidity, which will require the measuring and reporting of liquidity risk by certain ETFs and mutual funds. Our liquidity indicators product is developed specifically to meet the reporting requirements in the U.S. and Europe, particularly as both the SEC and MiFID rules come into effect. To further build on our capabilities, we completed the acquisition of S&P's Security Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis. These assets add to our portfolio of unique information that spans virtually all asset classes and provides workflow support for the front, middle and back offices. And having increased our capabilities for expanded bond price evaluations, we're developing new types of fixed income indices for institutional investors as a complement to our treasury indices. We'll have more details on this in the coming weeks.
We're rapidly integrating the former Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, NYSE index operations and ICE's exchange data to form the comprehensive global ICE Data Services organization. In the third quarter, we also completed the integration of the safety connectivity business with our 7ticks network to be in a position to offer an expanded range of service. We're focused on leveraging our broad product and client service platform to drive efficiencies for both our customers and for our company. We believe we're in the early stages of bringing our complete and flexible enterprise data solution to bear, and we'll continue to update you as we build out an integrated data platform. 
The other component of this segment is our listings business. And while the IPO environment continues to be muted, we had a record quarter for revenue. Since ICE's acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we've listed 18 out of the 20 IPOs that raised $1 billion or more, including the largest IPO in 2016 with the listing of ZTO last week.
As we always do, we're also curating our business lines to stay focused on our core capabilities. So we've decided to sell a company, known as IDMS, that came to us as part of our acquisition of Interactive Data. This business provides services to wealth management firms. We have also decided to sell NYSE Governance Services, which operates in the governance, risk and compliance space. While good businesses in their own right, they don't meaningfully leverage ICE's core competencies or have our strong margin growth profile, and so we believe that they'll be more valuable to others within their core sectors.
ICE's recurring revenue grew to over 55% of our total revenue in the third quarter compared to just 38% in the prior third quarter. Today, the majority of our revenue is ratable and subscription-based, which allows greater visibility into cash flow generation and which provides balance to the cyclicality of the transaction segment. This also leads to less volatile earnings and more consistent cash flow, which we believe is a higher-value business. 
On the other side of our revenue equation, it's highlighted on Slide 11, where you can see the ongoing strength in our transaction and clearing segment, with revenues up 2% in the first 9 months. In the third quarter, volume again grew year-to-year in energy, agriculture, metals, interest rates and MSCI indexes. Notably, year-to-date through October, the volume in our European interest rate futures complex is up 17%, and, surprising to many, is growing 3x as fast as the U.S. interest rate futures complex traded elsewhere, even with all the speculation surrounding a potential Fed rate hike. Importantly, volume in many of our benchmark contracts are up double-digits year-to-date, including ICE Brent Crude, our agriculture complex, sterling, Euribor, and our MSCI futures contracts.
We also set records in our emerging contracts such as the ICE/Eris pound-denominated LIBOR future. This is the first sterling-denominated interest rate swap future to trade and clear on an exchange. And you can also see the solid trends in open interest, even amid a less volatile third quarter, as market participants kept their positions open heading into year-end. And we continue to grow our lead in our share of crude oil open interest.
We believe that our continued growth is driven by the global relevance of our products and their exposure to the numerous international factors that are driving markets today.
So I'm pleased to note that ICE Clear Europe and ICE Clear Credit both received their EMIR compliance recognition from ESMA during the third quarter. And yesterday, ICE Futures Europe received the CFTC's approval for its foreign board of trade application. These are just a few examples of how the U.S., the U.K. and the EU have worked together to utilize equivalents, rather than passporting, to management cross-border international regulatory frameworks.
Our drive to grow and evolve has produced consistent growth throughout market cycles. And anyone that's followed the financial markets for a few years knows that there is continuous change going on. One of those drivers of change and driver of opportunity is Brexit. The U.K. remains an important global market center with prudent regulation, a focus on ensuring market confidence and a strong financial services talent pool. We are maintaining an active dialogue with officials in the U.K. government to help preserve the role of markets in London's future. We are encouraged by the practical approach that the U.K. government is taking to carefully consider the future opportunities as an independent country.
And similarly, we do not believe that financial market infrastructure leaving London is in the best interest of Europe's markets. Many question whether we might bid for the London Stock Exchange, an opportunity that we called off earlier this year in the absence of sufficient information to establish the value of a bid, coupled with our concerns about the effects on the company of a Brexit vote. Because this important asset could be leaving the city of London, we believe that this may create new opportunities for us as a leading infrastructure provider as we see the ability to continue to invest in the U.K. For example, in December of last year, we invested in the London-based Trayport, an operator of important technology that serves the European commercial energy markets.
Recently, the CMA issued a finding that ICE owning Trayport would have an adverse impact on competition in the European utility, derivatives trading and clearing markets, and that we should, therefore, divest of Trayport.
ICE and Trayport are not competitors, which the CMA recognized, so our acquisition of Trayport does not involve a loss of competition under a so-called horizontal theory of harm. The CMA's decision relied on a simplistic assessment of market dynamics, rather than a rigorous quantitative analysis. And it also relied largely on the views of conflicted third parties that have a competitive interest in the outcome of their review. ICE produced a detailed analysis to demonstrate that we would not and could not operate Trayport in a way that impairs access. We also offered far-reaching operational and governance remedies to address CMA's theoretical concerns. So we believe that CMA's decision under such a speculative and vague theory is disproportionate and it will be a terrible precedent for future merger and acquisition activities in Europe. Therefore, it's important for us that we pursue our right of appeal in connection with this pro-customer, pro-market transaction.
We're committed to continuing Trayport's operations in London, and we continue to operate the company just as we have for most of last year. Across our entire organization, our focus remains on servicing customers. And we believe that if we do the right things, with our customers in mind, then we're serving our shareholders.
Let me conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 12, where you can see that we continue to build on our decade-long track record of growth. This year again, we've grown revenues, met or exceeded synergy expectations, reduced expenses and expanded our margins, driving 16% adjusted earnings growth in the first 9 months of the year. We've generated over $1.5 billion in cash flow, repaid $1 billion in debt, grew our dividend, restarted our share repurchase program and finalized our stock split, which will occur later this week. And we're already engaged in planning for a very productive 2017.
And so I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the quarter, and I'd also like to thank our team for their continued efforts in meeting our growth objectives.
I'll now turn the call back to the operator, Allison, and we'll be glad to take your questions."

Number 1, recall that at the beginning of the year, when we talked about the synergies. We also mentioned that we'd have about a $45 million increase in compensation and that we'd be making about $30 million of investment in our products and technology. A lot of that product investment is resulting in deals like the index deals that we're announcing in the data space, the continuous evaluative product that we've announced in that space. So there are investments there. Clearly, a portion of the compensation go to our data team, who have more than earned it in the outstanding execution that they had this year. And the other thing you see very clearly on the chart is we've had some M&A spending in the year that hit the data space. As you might imagine, a lot of that's been around the Trayport deal. And then the last thing I'd note is, a number of the synergies come through our corporate functions in the first year of any deal. And those corporate expenses tend to get allocated to the segments based on revenue, because an accountant supports the company, they don't support data versus trading. And so you actually do see some of the synergies, even though they are related to IDC, showing up in the trading segment just because of the way that we allocate. So I think if you take a step back, we've laid out a pretty clear view of $115 million of synergies in the quarter, but that hopefully helps a little bit on the dynamic that you're asking about. One thing though I'd point out, in that same area of Chart 7, we've disclosed our operating margins for each of the segments, and I think that's an important story that a lot of people are missing. If you look at our aggregate margins and kind of compare that to a diverse basket of competitors, I'm not sure you get the same view you do when you look at margins in the trading segment that are 50% in the quarter and 51% year-to-date, compare those to other data companies that we compete with, and then look at the trading margins, which include the New York Stock Exchange and are 61% in the quarter and 64% year-to-date. And again, compare those to our exchange competitors that we deal with. So, hopefully, that helps with your direct question, but I think that area of the chart you're looking at is the one I point a lot of investors to, because I think there's an important story that's being missed."

So I guess the question is, how do you balance that? Is that just 1 asset class?

It's always interesting to us that a lot of the people that try to benefit from fragmentation of markets then complain about the fact that it cost them more to do business in that fragmentation that they helped create. And that is what's going on. You look at where you've seen just fragmentation in the past couple of years with new entrants in the energy futures space, new entrants in the European interest rate space and look at the growth of our complex in those spaces. Our trading volumes have grown and our data sales in those areas have grown. In other words, this fragmentation causes arbitrage between markets. It's less easy for people to figure out where the market is at any moment in time. It's much more difficult to create a settlement price for marking books. There is much more load, if you will, on the middle and back office for compliance, best execution and so on and so forth. All of that trend is driving demand for increased information. One point that, that group that is spending more and more on data doesn't recognize is that the actual cost of data is plummeting. There is just the fact that people are buying more lower-cost, declining-cost information. And so the spend for many of these people is voluntary. It is because they want a holistic view of the market, and they voluntarily are going out and having to buy more and more information. Even though on a per-unit basis, information prices have been collapsing over the last decade. So we think the total wallet, if you will, is going to continue to increase. Regulatory pressures, back-office compliance pressures, reporting pressures, things that all of us in a more regulated financial service industry are going to have to adjust to and pay for. Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it wasn't something that we had to do before. It's affecting our firm as well. But it is an irreversible trend in my mind. We still have a lot of regulation to come into impact in Europe, MiFID for example, the differences that may come out of the EU and the U.K with the actual Brexit separation. So I would expect that, that trend is going to continue."

And so if you kind of back out, call it, $15 million, the guidance range would have been $485 million to $490 million, which is right we've been on average every quarter this year, and so relatively flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In terms of revenue, you will likely recall that I mentioned last quarter, we'd see a slight deceleration into the third quarter and then a reacceleration into the fourth where we would approach $500 million of data revenue. That was at a time where the pound was still around $1.31. It's now closer to $1.22. And so that outlook softened a little bit. So on an apples-to-apples basis, versus maybe the high 490s, we'd be looking at something closer to the low to mid 490s. That notwithstanding, I actually think data revenues in the quarter, including the 2 acquisitions, will be north of $515 million. And so that was expenses that I mentioned in the earnings script, will be more than offset by revenues, and then obviously that adds to our overall data business and gives us an opportunity as we combine those 2 companies over time."

So having a very low-cost desktop that we can provide to people to give them the basic information they need around -- at debt and equities has been very, very well received. So, in a sense, we're a disruptor in providing such a thing. As you can imagine, we have very good data about where stocks are trading, given that we own the NYSE. And we have very good data around where bonds are trading, given that we've built out this fixed income platform with a number of acquisitions. And we have very good data around corporate actions for our listed companies since it's a requirement that they give that information to us. So that's a very nice desktop that we can expand on.

We will have additional revenues from the 2 acquired businesses. We would have grown 6% to 7% without that. So it will help solidify that towards the high end of the range. We would have been at 6% this year without it. And frankly, on a constant-currency basis, we would've been above 7% for data even without those acquisitions. But directly to your question, we have had a very strong performance in our exchange data revenues this year. Jeff talked about it on the last call and this call. That's a solid mix of growth in customers and some additional value that we've captured as we've sold more data to existing customers. As Jeff said, while there is discussion about prices going up, the price per unit, if you look at it in terms of the data that's consumed for the price, that data amount has increased significantly. So a good year this year. We would expect to have a good year again in exchange data next year. I certainly don't expect it to be on par with this year. But we have, as Jeff alluded to, seen very strong sales in our pricing evaluation business, if you will, the former IDC business, and that's really what is encouraging us and gives us a good solid foundation to suggest that we could be at least at the same level of growth in 2017 as 2016. So said differently, I would expect a bit more balanced growth among, particularly, exchange data and pricing and valuations in '17 versus '16, which was benefited a little bit more by the exchange data."

We're the only one in the space that is consistently doing it. So at just under 8%, versus cost of capital just over 6%, we are generating excess return on invested capital every day we operate the business. And again, that's unique in our space. If you look on an absolute basis, although we dipped to just below 8%, that relates to the IDC business that we haven't even owned for a year. If you looked at the trends coming out of the last year before that business, we were on our way back to 10%. We'll start to rebuild that as we move through this year and next. And you'll see a similar trend. And again, even at the current levels, compared to the people we compete with, our ROIC compares very favorably. So we'll continue to put it on the chart, which distinguishes us. It will continue to be above our cost of capital, which distinguishes us. And it will be -- continue to be above our competitors, which distinguishes us."

So can you help us think about outlook here for growth in this contract now that we've gotten some price stability in those markets?"

So 2 things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract that speculators use, and there has been, over the last year or so, a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go. Would $60 go down to $30?",509,"Sure. So 2 things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract that speculators use, and there has been, over the last year or so, a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go. Would $60 go down to $30? Will it go back up to $50? Those kinds of behaviors, particularly, as the U.S. was rightsizing its drilling infrastructure and as high yield was in focus on many of the energy companies. And so one would naturally expect that WTI, which we also have, would have more trading in that environment. Brent is and remains the contract that most of the energy space uses for hedging. And the nice thing about that is you can see that, that industry continues to use Brent. The second trend that goes on is, we have competitors that are paying for order flow. And there are people that -- in the trading business, that if you pay them, they will produce volume. And our competitors that do that like to talk about market share and report market share, and there's actually investors and analysts that reward them for getting market share, even though it's destroying value for shareholders. We had a large customer come to us and said, ""Hey, one of your competitors came to us and said that they would buy our business. What are they talking about? They were not talking about -- to us, about lowering our cost. They actually said they would pay us to move."" And we said, ""How much did they say they would pay you?"" And they said, ""We will pay you anything. Name your price."" And so with that kind of behavior, you will always find some people that will take up on that. It doesn't bother us that we lose that share because we are a primary market. And as you can see from data sales and just growth in our open interest and what have you, that people tend to have to rely on the primary market in order to get paid by competitors. So, overall, trading volume goes up but our volume, which is really the volume of people that want to pay or maybe the wallet share, if you will, continues to go up for us. And with respect to Brent, this will be, we believe, our 19th consecutive year of growth in trading of Brent. I mean, it's almost -- you put a ruler on it, it's almost an unprecedented ability when you think about everything that's gone on in the world over that 19-year period: Wars, changes in policy, changes in regulation, financial crises, et cetera. We continue to see Brent just -- its volume just marching forward. So we're very lucky to have that as a primary market, and we are really careful custodians of it. And it's why we're not playing that game of going in and asking customers, how much do you want us to pay you to do business with us."

So we don't see the pressure, if you will, on those businesses. Where we -- when we're out talking to customers, where we hear there is a lot of focus is on data that's delivered via a desktop, a lot of focus on the number of screens, if you will, and the acquisition of desktops. We've built the safety network and combined it with the 7ticks network to build, essentially, a data plan that is distributed via API. And we see strong growth in people wanting to buy bulk data, if you will, via an API and manage it internally and not buy it on an individual desktop basis. We're not really in the desktop space. As I mentioned earlier, we have NYSE Connect, which is a desktop that is a very low-cost desktop and to a certain degree is becoming a substitution for the higher desktop providers, if you will. And so I think that's the trend that's sort of mixed up here. Alex, I really believe that the middle and back office in your firm has no choice but to, for compliance purposes, and for improving systems and commoditization of the way risk is being looked at inside large firms, is buying that bulk data and figuring out how to redistribute it, and I think that, that trend is going to continue. Because we haven't really seen the full implementation of MiFID. We haven't seen what -- the result of a different Brexit regime. The SEC has not fully implemented Dodd-Frank. And so there are still more pressures for compliance and internal functions that we think will drive demand."

We have people that really just look at markets every day and talk to customers and try to say, do we have liquidity all the way out the forward pricing curve? Are there gaps in where people try to do business and where we have markets? And so we'll provide incentive programs to try to fill in gaps or to make the markets better for our customers. And so we do have incentive programs, which touch pricing, but they are not to get overall market share. They're really to make a better market.

But those synergies will continue to come out and improve margins. The other thing that I've talked about a little bit that I think is really important for people to understand, the incremental margins on the proprietary data we sell is very similar to, historically, what you've seen in incremental margins on our trading business. Where it's more labor intensive in terms of just trying to determine what the price of a bond is, there are people involved with that versus oil being decided on an exchange. But once you determine that price of the bond, if I can sell it to a second customer and a third customer and a fourth customer, the incremental costs are very small. And so revenue growth drives high incremental margin, synergies drive margin improvements. And so I absolutely think the expectation for that business is margin expansion over time. Again, I'm not going to guess at what the end state is, but it's higher."

And so for example, we're going to sell NYSE Governance Services. That is a very hot space, it's a growing space. Companies need more infrastructure to educate employees about anti-money laundering. There is a huge demand for what they do, and that company has -- is growing, and has growth potential. But it doesn't have that phenomenon, that I just mentioned, that really we do well.

So we definitely are on a path to get below 2x. We're committed to get there. But as I said in my prepared remarks, not only were we able to restart our buybacks in October, but we remain committed to grow our dividend as we grow. And I think, with the increased cash generation that you're seeing, we're going to be north of $2 billion of operating cash flow this year, well north of probably $1.7 billion of free cash flow this year. And that should definitely allow us to get our leverage back below 2x to continue to ramp up our share repurchases, because we certainly aren't at the level in the fourth quarter that we would anticipate being as we move through next year, and then also to grow the dividend as we grow, all of which would, hopefully, move us -- in '14 and '15, we returned almost $1 billion a year.

They -- people can come do those deals directly with us. They don't have to have a middleman, and we can provide a range of services.

I'll begin on Slide 4 and cover our results through the first 9 months of 2016. Consolidated net revenues grew 4% to $3.4 billion, with trading and clearing revenues up 2% and data and listings revenue up 6% versus the prior year.
In addition, operating margins expanded 4 points to 57%, and expected 2016 synergies have increased over 50% to $115 million. All of these factors enabled adjusted earnings to grow 10% versus 2015 pro forma results.
This strong financial performance also generated record operating cash flow of $1.5 billion through September. This strong cash generation enabled us to reduce our leverage, grow our dividend and, in October, to restart our share repurchase program.
We are executing a well-designed strategic plan, are efficiently integrating our acquired businesses and are delivering top and bottom line growth, strong cash generation and improving ROIC and capital return, all less than 1 year after closing our acquisition of Interactive Data.
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll walk you through our results for the third quarter. Revenues in the quarter were up slightly over the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year and margins expanded to 55%. Adjusted operating income increased 4% year-to-year, and adjusted earnings per share were $3.21. Of note, you'll see that our third quarter tax rate was roughly 30%. We currently expect a similar rate for the fourth quarter.
Moving next to Slide 6, I'll provide some additional details about our third quarter revenues. While our total revenues were roughly flat, our data and listings segment revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 55% of our consolidated revenue for the quarter. Within the data and listings segment, our exchange data was up 17% year-over-year. Pricing and analytics revenue would have grown 3%, excluding the weakness in the pound and the impact of a large customer true-up that occurred in the prior third quarter. Our data revenues remain on track to grow between 6% and 7% for the full year 2016, and the outlook is favorable for at least a similar level of growth in 2017. Our trading and clearing revenues declined 4% versus the prior year, as lower volatility and the precipitous fall in the pound created a significant headwind.
Within the trading and clearing segment, though, commodities revenues grew 2%, including energy revenue, which grew 4% year-to-year. Oil and natural gas were both strong contributors and continued to grow in October. Despite continued growth in our OTC clearing business, financials revenues declined 14%, including interest rate revenues, which were down 15%.
Interest rate futures volume grew 13% in the quarter, but revenues were significantly impacted by the weaker pound. We expect to publish our October volumes on Wednesday. And despite continued currency impacts and lower volatility in equity, we preliminarily expect to report solid results, including oil volumes up around 10% and interest rate volumes growing more than 50% versus the prior year. The increased volumes, stable to improving open interest levels and continued growth in exchange data customers, [indiscernible] interest in the markets we operate remains high.
Now let's flip to Slide 7, where I'll discuss our expense performance and provide updated guidance. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year to $484 million, and pro forma operating margin expanded by 2 points. Importantly, please also note on the right side of the slide that margins expanded in both our business segments. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies on an accelerated basis. We now expect to achieve around $115 million of synergies for 2016. Increased synergies and the weaker pound enabled us to maintain our full year adjusted expense guidance, despite the addition of expenses related to the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted expenses in the range of $500 million to $505 million, with the quarter-to-quarter increase due largely to the addition of these recently acquired businesses.
Our final full year 2016 expense guidance reflects a reduction of nearly 3% versus 2015 and a $75 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement benefited from roughly $35 million, largely related to the impact of the lower pound but, more importantly, reflects an additional $40 million in synergies realized during 2016.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 8 with a review of our cash generation, deleveraging and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.5 billion in the first 9 months of the year, and deployed that cash to invest around $250 million in CapEx, to reduce our debt by $1 billion and to return over $300 million to shareholders through dividends. We reduced our leverage from 2.8x at the end of 2015 to 2.3x at the end of September. Importantly, we remain on track to reduce leverage below 2x during 2017, which allowed us to restart our share repurchase program in October and will support our objective to grow our dividend as we grow.
We remain confident that our solid cash generation will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating, enable additional strategic investment and allow us to increase our capital returns to shareholders. Our results for the first 9 months of this year reflect our commitment to execution, innovation and value creation for our shareholders. We deliver on this commitment by expanding our footprint to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers in a very dynamic time in our industry. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

This morning I'll take a few minutes to update you on key areas of investor interest, and then we'll conduct the question-and-answer session. 
I'll start with the topic of consistent long-term growth on Slide 9. Our tenfold revenue growth over the last decade, including revenue that doubled and earnings that have tripled in the last 3 years, is driven by expanding the range of ways we serve our customers around the world. This growth continues with total futures volume up 20% in the month of October, alongside an expanding data business that is meeting the secular demand for more information.
As a startup company, we gained a foothold by electronifying trade execution. This market transparency and product standardization then drove demand for clearing to serve the growing need for risk management. And today, as capital and operational efficiencies become paramount, our customers require more of our proprietary information to support risk management, trading and investment management.
Our services continue to evolve with changes in the market, which creates shareholder value by anticipating and capitalizing on change. As the most global exchange operator, with over 40% of our total revenues derived outside the U.S., we're moving quickly to leverage our scalable technology infrastructure across North America, Europe and Asia.
In an ever-fragmenting marketplace, we're providing the consistent tools, technology and data sources that customers require in order to stitch together the big picture on an enterprise scale. As a result, we're benefiting from balanced geographic, product and customer diversification. And because we're not levered to any one cyclical trend or geography, we've led our space in growth on virtually every metric over the last decade.
On Slide 10, I'll highlight the strategy behind our balanced approach, driven by a virtuous cycle across our global markets, clearing houses, data and listings. Transaction-based revenue can be cyclical, but market participants always require information to make good risk management decisions. This is why we're establishing a new approach for market data for our customers who've told us that they're looking for flexible and efficient ways to receive and respond to information. Our investments in technology, that helps scale our infrastructure, are allowing us to serve customers on an increasingly integrated platform. Following the financial crisis, many new opportunities to provide valuable services have emerged. Whether it's increased compliance, the move to independent pricing, demand for information security, algorithmic trading or the trend toward passive investing, each of these drives increasing demand for data. These dynamics have only begun to play out. An example is last month's SEC ruling on liquidity, which will require the measuring and reporting of liquidity risk by certain ETFs and mutual funds. Our liquidity indicators product is developed specifically to meet the reporting requirements in the U.S. and Europe, particularly as both the SEC and MiFID rules come into effect. To further build on our capabilities, we completed the acquisition of S&P's Security Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis. These assets add to our portfolio of unique information that spans virtually all asset classes and provides workflow support for the front, middle and back offices. And having increased our capabilities for expanded bond price evaluations, we're developing new types of fixed income indices for institutional investors as a complement to our treasury indices. We'll have more details on this in the coming weeks.
We're rapidly integrating the former Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, NYSE index operations and ICE's exchange data to form the comprehensive global ICE Data Services organization. In the third quarter, we also completed the integration of the safety connectivity business with our 7ticks network to be in a position to offer an expanded range of service. We're focused on leveraging our broad product and client service platform to drive efficiencies for both our customers and for our company. We believe we're in the early stages of bringing our complete and flexible enterprise data solution to bear, and we'll continue to update you as we build out an integrated data platform. 
The other component of this segment is our listings business. And while the IPO environment continues to be muted, we had a record quarter for revenue. Since ICE's acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we've listed 18 out of the 20 IPOs that raised $1 billion or more, including the largest IPO in 2016 with the listing of ZTO last week.
As we always do, we're also curating our business lines to stay focused on our core capabilities. So we've decided to sell a company, known as IDMS, that came to us as part of our acquisition of Interactive Data. This business provides services to wealth management firms. We have also decided to sell NYSE Governance Services, which operates in the governance, risk and compliance space. While good businesses in their own right, they don't meaningfully leverage ICE's core competencies or have our strong margin growth profile, and so we believe that they'll be more valuable to others within their core sectors.
ICE's recurring revenue grew to over 55% of our total revenue in the third quarter compared to just 38% in the prior third quarter. Today, the majority of our revenue is ratable and subscription-based, which allows greater visibility into cash flow generation and which provides balance to the cyclicality of the transaction segment. This also leads to less volatile earnings and more consistent cash flow, which we believe is a higher-value business. 
On the other side of our revenue equation, it's highlighted on Slide 11, where you can see the ongoing strength in our transaction and clearing segment, with revenues up 2% in the first 9 months. In the third quarter, volume again grew year-to-year in energy, agriculture, metals, interest rates and MSCI indexes. Notably, year-to-date through October, the volume in our European interest rate futures complex is up 17%, and, surprising to many, is growing 3x as fast as the U.S. interest rate futures complex traded elsewhere, even with all the speculation surrounding a potential Fed rate hike. Importantly, volume in many of our benchmark contracts are up double-digits year-to-date, including ICE Brent Crude, our agriculture complex, sterling, Euribor, and our MSCI futures contracts.
We also set records in our emerging contracts such as the ICE/Eris pound-denominated LIBOR future. This is the first sterling-denominated interest rate swap future to trade and clear on an exchange. And you can also see the solid trends in open interest, even amid a less volatile third quarter, as market participants kept their positions open heading into year-end. And we continue to grow our lead in our share of crude oil open interest.
We believe that our continued growth is driven by the global relevance of our products and their exposure to the numerous international factors that are driving markets today.
So I'm pleased to note that ICE Clear Europe and ICE Clear Credit both received their EMIR compliance recognition from ESMA during the third quarter. And yesterday, ICE Futures Europe received the CFTC's approval for its foreign board of trade application. These are just a few examples of how the U.S., the U.K. and the EU have worked together to utilize equivalents, rather than passporting, to management cross-border international regulatory frameworks.
Our drive to grow and evolve has produced consistent growth throughout market cycles. And anyone that's followed the financial markets for a few years knows that there is continuous change going on. One of those drivers of change and driver of opportunity is Brexit. The U.K. remains an important global market center with prudent regulation, a focus on ensuring market confidence and a strong financial services talent pool. We are maintaining an active dialogue with officials in the U.K. government to help preserve the role of markets in London's future. We are encouraged by the practical approach that the U.K. government is taking to carefully consider the future opportunities as an independent country.
And similarly, we do not believe that financial market infrastructure leaving London is in the best interest of Europe's markets. Many question whether we might bid for the London Stock Exchange, an opportunity that we called off earlier this year in the absence of sufficient information to establish the value of a bid, coupled with our concerns about the effects on the company of a Brexit vote. Because this important asset could be leaving the city of London, we believe that this may create new opportunities for us as a leading infrastructure provider as we see the ability to continue to invest in the U.K. For example, in December of last year, we invested in the London-based Trayport, an operator of important technology that serves the European commercial energy markets.
Recently, the CMA issued a finding that ICE owning Trayport would have an adverse impact on competition in the European utility, derivatives trading and clearing markets, and that we should, therefore, divest of Trayport.
ICE and Trayport are not competitors, which the CMA recognized, so our acquisition of Trayport does not involve a loss of competition under a so-called horizontal theory of harm. The CMA's decision relied on a simplistic assessment of market dynamics, rather than a rigorous quantitative analysis. And it also relied largely on the views of conflicted third parties that have a competitive interest in the outcome of their review. ICE produced a detailed analysis to demonstrate that we would not and could not operate Trayport in a way that impairs access. We also offered far-reaching operational and governance remedies to address CMA's theoretical concerns. So we believe that CMA's decision under such a speculative and vague theory is disproportionate and it will be a terrible precedent for future merger and acquisition activities in Europe. Therefore, it's important for us that we pursue our right of appeal in connection with this pro-customer, pro-market transaction.
We're committed to continuing Trayport's operations in London, and we continue to operate the company just as we have for most of last year. Across our entire organization, our focus remains on servicing customers. And we believe that if we do the right things, with our customers in mind, then we're serving our shareholders.
Let me conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 12, where you can see that we continue to build on our decade-long track record of growth. This year again, we've grown revenues, met or exceeded synergy expectations, reduced expenses and expanded our margins, driving 16% adjusted earnings growth in the first 9 months of the year. We've generated over $1.5 billion in cash flow, repaid $1 billion in debt, grew our dividend, restarted our share repurchase program and finalized our stock split, which will occur later this week. And we're already engaged in planning for a very productive 2017.
And so I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the quarter, and I'd also like to thank our team for their continued efforts in meeting our growth objectives.
I'll now turn the call back to the operator, Allison, and we'll be glad to take your questions."

Number 1, recall that at the beginning of the year, when we talked about the synergies. We also mentioned that we'd have about a $45 million increase in compensation and that we'd be making about $30 million of investment in our products and technology. A lot of that product investment is resulting in deals like the index deals that we're announcing in the data space, the continuous evaluative product that we've announced in that space. So there are investments there. Clearly, a portion of the compensation go to our data team, who have more than earned it in the outstanding execution that they had this year. And the other thing you see very clearly on the chart is we've had some M&A spending in the year that hit the data space. As you might imagine, a lot of that's been around the Trayport deal. And then the last thing I'd note is, a number of the synergies come through our corporate functions in the first year of any deal. And those corporate expenses tend to get allocated to the segments based on revenue, because an accountant supports the company, they don't support data versus trading. And so you actually do see some of the synergies, even though they are related to IDC, showing up in the trading segment just because of the way that we allocate. So I think if you take a step back, we've laid out a pretty clear view of $115 million of synergies in the quarter, but that hopefully helps a little bit on the dynamic that you're asking about. One thing though I'd point out, in that same area of Chart 7, we've disclosed our operating margins for each of the segments, and I think that's an important story that a lot of people are missing. If you look at our aggregate margins and kind of compare that to a diverse basket of competitors, I'm not sure you get the same view you do when you look at margins in the trading segment that are 50% in the quarter and 51% year-to-date, compare those to other data companies that we compete with, and then look at the trading margins, which include the New York Stock Exchange and are 61% in the quarter and 64% year-to-date. And again, compare those to our exchange competitors that we deal with. So hopefully, that helps with your direct question, but I think that area of the chart you're looking at is the one I point a lot of investors to, because I think there's an important story that's being missed."

It's always interesting to us that a lot of the people that try to benefit from fragmentation of markets then complain about the fact that it cost them more to do business in that fragmentation that they helped create. And that is what's going on. You look at where you've seen just fragmentation in the past couple of years with new entrants in the energy futures space, new entrants in the European interest rate space and look at the growth of our complex in those spaces. Our trading volumes have grown and our data sales in those areas have grown. In other words, this fragmentation causes arbitrage between markets. It's less easy for people to figure out where the market is at any moment in time. It's much more difficult to create a settlement price for marking books. There is much more load, if you will, on the middle and back office for compliance, best execution and so on and so forth. All of that trend is driving demand for increased information. One point that, that group that is spending more and more on data doesn't recognize is that the actual cost of data is plummeting. There is just the fact that people are buying more lower-cost, declining-cost information. And so the spend for many of these people is voluntary. It is because they want a holistic view of the market, and they voluntarily are going out and having to buy more and more information. Even though on a per-unit basis, information prices have been collapsing over the last decade. So we think the total wallet, if you will, is going to continue to increase. Regulatory pressures, back-office compliance pressures, reporting pressures, things that all of us in a more regulated financial service industry are going to have to adjust to and pay for. Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it wasn't something that we had to do before. It's affecting our firm as well. But it is an irreversible trend in my mind. We still have a lot of regulation to come into impact in Europe, MiFID for example, the differences that may come out of the EU and the U.K with the actual Brexit separation. So I would expect that, that trend is going to continue."

In terms of revenue, you will likely recall that I mentioned last quarter, we'd see a slight deceleration into the third quarter and then a reacceleration into the fourth where we would approach $500 million of data revenue. That was at a time where the pound was still around $1.31. It's now closer to $1.22. And so that outlook softened a little bit. So on an apples-to-apples basis, versus maybe the high 490s, we'd be looking at something closer to the low to mid 490s. That notwithstanding, I actually think data revenues in the quarter, including the 2 acquisitions, will be north of $515 million.

And so we -- Scott moved very quickly to get back into the market and on this call announced that he's actually in the market now, that we started our share repurchase program. If you look at the futures space globally, it's relatively flat year-to-date on volumes. If you look at the -- a lot of the other trading and clearing spaces, they're down substantially. But yet our company is actually growing. And you couple that with this new segment that we have, our largest segment, which is really growing in the trading and -- actually in the data and connectivity space. Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks that we see next year the growth -- we have visibility because we're signing contracts right now that extend well into next year and beyond for many. The -- we have visibility into the growth of our data business, and so we think the PEG ratio of our stock is just off relative to our peers. And so that's been our focus, and that's why Scott decided to disclose that we actually got in the market earlier than what I think a lot of people suggested."

So first of all, NYSE has -- when we acquired the business, had a desktop that it provided to corporate treasurers and CFOs. It also has some communications tools that it uses to talk to listed companies so that listed companies can provide updates on various corporate actions and what have you as a requirement they have to the exchange. We decided to replace that infrastructure with NYSE Connect, which is what we've talked about. It's basically a desktop and provides trading information. We've been building that out in a space where when we look at the space, and particularly following up on earlier questions, there is pressure on some of the spend to lower the price of desktops particularly, and that area of data acquisition, the desktop delivery, is under a lot of pressure. So having a very low-cost desktop that we can provide to people to give them the basic information they need around -- at debt and equities has been very, very well received. So in a sense, we're a disruptor in providing such a thing. As you can imagine, we have very good data about where stocks are trading, given that we own the NYSE. And we have very good data around where bonds are trading, given that we've built out this fixed income platform with a number of acquisitions. And we have very good data around corporate actions for our listed companies since it's a requirement that they give that information to us. So that's a very nice desktop that we can expand on. Right now, we're just focused on our listed companies, but we'll see where life takes that offering. It has almost no cost to us in terms of incremental margins. And so it's an interesting tool in an area where there is a lot of pressure to lower cost by our customer base."

We would have been at 6% this year without it. And frankly, on a constant-currency basis, we would've been above 7% for data even without those acquisitions. But directly to your question, we have had a very strong performance in our exchange data revenues this year. Jeff talked about it on the last call and this call. That's a solid mix of growth in customers and some additional value that we've captured as we've sold more data to existing customers. As Jeff said, while there is discussion about prices going up, the price per unit, if you look at it in terms of the data that's consumed for the price, that data amount has increased significantly. So a good year this year. We would expect to have a good year again in exchange data next year. I certainly don't expect it to be on par with this year. But we have, as Jeff alluded to, seen very strong sales in our pricing evaluation business, if you will, the former IDC business, and that's really what is encouraging us and gives us a good solid foundation to suggest that we could be at least at the same level of growth in 2017 as 2016. So said differently, I would expect a bit more balanced growth among, particularly, exchange data and pricing and valuations in '17 versus '16, which was benefited a little bit more by the exchange data."

If you look on an absolute basis, although we dipped to just below 8%, that relates to the IDC business that we haven't even owned for a year. If you looked at the trends coming out of the last year before that business, we were on our way back to 10%. We'll start to rebuild that as we move through this year and next. And you'll see a similar trend. And again, even at the current levels, compared to the people we compete with, our ROIC compares very favorably.

So 2 things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract that speculators use, and there has been, over the last year or so, a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go. Would $60 go down to $30?",509,"Sure. So 2 things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract that speculators use, and there has been, over the last year or so, a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go. Would $60 go down to $30? Will it go back up to $50? Those kinds of behaviors, particularly, as the U.S. was rightsizing its drilling infrastructure and as high yield was in focus on many of the energy companies. And so one would naturally expect that WTI, which we also have, would have more trading in that environment. Brent is and remains the contract that most of the energy space uses for hedging. And the nice thing about that is you can see that, that industry continues to use Brent. The second trend that goes on is, we have competitors that are paying for order flow. And there are people that -- in the trading business, that if you pay them, they will produce volume. And our competitors that do that like to talk about market share and report market share, and there's actually investors and analysts that reward them for getting market share, even though it's destroying value for shareholders. We had a large customer come to us and said, ""Hey, one of your competitors came to us and said that they would buy our business. What are they talking about? They were not talking about -- to us, about lowering our cost. They actually said they would pay us to move."" And we said, ""How much did they say they would pay you?"" And they said, ""We will pay you anything. Name your price."" And so with that kind of behavior, you will always find some people that will take up on that. It doesn't bother us that we lose that share because we are a primary market. And as you can see from data sales and just growth in our open interest and what have you, that people tend to have to rely on the primary market in order to get paid by competitors. So overall, trading volume goes up but our volume, which is really the volume of people that want to pay or maybe the wallet share, if you will, continues to go up for us. And with respect to Brent, this will be, we believe, our 19th consecutive year of growth in trading of Brent. I mean, it's almost -- you put a ruler on it, it's almost an unprecedented ability when you think about everything that's gone on in the world over that 19-year period: Wars, changes in policy, changes in regulation, financial crises, et cetera. We continue to see Brent just -- its volume just marching forward. So we're very lucky to have that as a primary market, and we are really careful custodians of it. And it's why we're not playing that game of going in and asking customers, how much do you want us to pay you to do business with us."

So we don't see the pressure, if you will, on those businesses. Where we -- when we're out talking to customers, where we hear there is a lot of focus is on data that's delivered via a desktop, a lot of focus on the number of screens, if you will, and the acquisition of desktops. We've built the safety network and combined it with the 7ticks network to build, essentially, a data plan that is distributed via API. And we see strong growth in people wanting to buy bulk data, if you will, via an API and manage it internally and not buy it on an individual desktop basis. We're not really in the desktop space. As I mentioned earlier, we have NYSE Connect, which is a desktop that is a very low-cost desktop and to a certain degree is becoming a substitution for the higher desktop providers, if you will. And so I think that's the trend that's sort of mixed up here. Alex, I really believe that the middle and back office in your firm has no choice but to, for compliance purposes, and for improving systems and commoditization of the way risk is being looked at inside large firms, is buying that bulk data and figuring out how to redistribute it, and I think that, that trend is going to continue. Because we haven't really seen the full implementation of MiFID. We haven't seen what -- the result of a different Brexit regime. The SEC has not fully implemented Dodd-Frank.

But those synergies will continue to come out and improve margins. The other thing that I've talked about a little bit that I think is really important for people to understand, the incremental margins on the proprietary data we sell is very similar to, historically, what you've seen in incremental margins on our trading business. Where it's more labor intensive in terms of just trying to determine what the price of a bond is, there are people involved with that versus oil being decided on an exchange. But once you determine that price of the bond, if I can sell it to a second customer and a third customer and a fourth customer, the incremental costs are very small. And so revenue growth drives high incremental margin, synergies drive margin improvements. And so I absolutely think the expectation for that business is margin expansion over time.

What's kind of the debt-to-EBITDA ratios we should be thinking about on a go forward basis as we try to kind of think through the buyback over the next year or so?"

So you're right, historically, we had talked about 1.5x, and we've more recently talked about the need to get below 2x. And that remains the objective. We are on a path to do that. That's why we were able to get back into the market in October and take advantage of what Jeff correctly identified as the best buy in the market, in our opinion. So we definitely are on a path to get below 2x. We're committed to get there. But as I said in my prepared remarks, not only were we able to restart our buybacks in October, but we remain committed to grow our dividend as we grow. And I think, with the increased cash generation that you're seeing, we're going to be north of $2 billion of operating cash flow this year, well north of probably $1.7 billion of free cash flow this year. And that should definitely allow us to get our leverage back below 2x to continue to ramp up our share repurchases, because we certainly aren't at the level in the fourth quarter that we would anticipate being as we move through next year, and then also to grow the dividend as we grow, all of which would, hopefully, move us -- in '14 and '15, we returned almost $1 billion a year. This year, it will be between $400 million and $500 million. But I certainly think as you get into '17 and certainly '18 and '19, you're going to see us get back to and above the levels you saw in '14 and '15."

In fact, we're -- part of the exercise that's going on as we're creating ICE Data Services is just for management to figure out the metrics that we're going to use to run the business. And honestly, it probably won't be as detailed as you just laid out because there's a lot of moving parts. Particularly given the second part of your question, which is, we do see the opportunity, because we have a large data set that contains some commoditized data, some proprietary data, some network infrastructure and some desktop space, some indices and some calculation engines, to do sort of package deals, enterprise package deals for people, and there's tremendous interest in that. They -- people can come do those deals directly with us. They don't have to have a middleman, and we can provide a range of services. So we've been very successful early on in the ETF, ETP space, where there's a lot of cost pressure on those competitors and yet they need a full range of services, from listing the ETF, to calculating the ETF, to having daily prices of the things that are in the ETF, to creating an index for the ETF and using our brands and marketing the ETF. So those kinds of package deals don't lend themselves to some of the metrics that you just described. So I doubt that we'll ever fully get to that."
