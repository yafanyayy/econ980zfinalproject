In 2015, we met or exceeded our key outlook measures for the year. Even with integration, global currency pressures driven by macroeconomic headwinds and the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary last quarter, we had good momentum, which drove revenue, adjusted EBITDA growth and profit performance for the year. We also delivered strong free cash flow and set the stage for continued strong growth in 2016. Looking forward, we are building on this foundation, investing in the business and continue to be disciplined in managing our costs as a human being our focus on profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 3 for a summary of our performance in 2015. Our Core Network Services, or CNS revenue for the full year 2015, grew 5.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. For the full year, total enterprise CNS grew 7.2% and North America enterprise CNS grew 7.6%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 16% for the full year 2015, in line with our recent outlook of 15% to 17%. From a free cash flow perspective, we finished above the range of our outlook of $600 million to $650 million by generating $658 million in 2015. 
Free cash flow excludes $32 million of accelerated cash interest expense payments related to a refinancing that took place after reporting third quarter earnings. We refinanced $4.9 billion of debt during 2015, resulting in over $110 million of annualized cash interest expense savings. Additionally, we continue to lower our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is now at 3.8x. Finally from a synergy perspective, as of the end of the fourth quarter 2015, we achieved approximately $216 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the close of the tw telecom transaction. This exceeds our original synergy expectations to achieve $140 million by the end of the first quarter 2016 and $200 million in total. 
Turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter 2015, CNS revenue grew 4.4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% on a an as-reported basis. As we saw throughout 2015, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affected our reported growth rates. For the full year, CNS revenue grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis but 2.9% on an as-reported basis. At the end of the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar represented 90% of total revenue; the British pound represented 4%; the euro, 3%; and the Brazilian real, 2%. All of the currencies I included in the remaining 1%. 
I'd like to move now to a discussion of revenue on a regional basis. North America CNS revenue grew 5.9% for the full year. For the fourth quarter 2015, from an enterprise perspective, CNS revenue grew 6.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 1.5% on a sequential basis following the particularly strong results in the third quarter of 2015 where our sequential growth was 2.7%. Adjusting for that, our North America enterprise business is at a 2% sequential growth base over the last 2 quarters. 
For the full year 2015, EMEA CNS revenue was relatively flat on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, EMEA CNS revenue increased 0.7% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.1% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.5% on a constant currency basis and remain flat on an as-reported basis. While enterprise revenue growth was a little slower than the results we have seen in prior quarters, it was primarily a result of the unusual strength in enterprise CNS revenue from the fourth quarter 2014. 
Sequentially, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew to 2.2%. Also, CNS revenue declined 0.3% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an as-reported basis. U.K. government CNS revenue decreased 7.9% on a constant currency basis and 10.7% on an as-reported basis. In Latin America, for the full year, CNS revenue grew 7.2% on a constant currency basis while the fourth quarter, Latin America CNS revenue grew 8.4% on a constant currency basis and declined 6.4% on an as-reported basis. 
Enterprise CNS in Latin America grew 9.5% on a constant currency basis and declined 6.7% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue increased 4.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 5.4% on an as-reported basis. Our revenue mix can be found on Slide 5 with North America representing the bulk of our CNS revenue at 81% followed by EMEA at 11% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 73% of CNS revenue while wholesale customers make up the remaining 27%. 
Turning to Slide 6, end revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 8.2% and continues to drive the company's growth led by growth in VPN and managed services. Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year but grew 7.9% on a sequential basis. Transport and fiber grew 1.8%, driven by wavelengths and professional services. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 10% year-over-year. Colocation and data center services grew 3.9% and voice services declined by 0.5%. 
Over the course of 2015, we saw little change in the overall pricing environment within our products or regions. For 2016, we remain focused on assessing the pricing landscape and will continue to take a market by market approach to pricing solutions looking at particular geographies, products, verticals as well as other factors and maintaining our focus on profitable growth. One of the things we we're very focused on in 2015 and will continue to be focused on this year is sales production or bookings and sales productivity. 
In 2015, total sales production improved over 2014 and sales productivity grew significantly. For the fourth quarter 2015, CNS sales production grew nicely compared to the fourth quarter 2014. Moving to Slide 8. When we initially provided outlook for adjusted EBITDA 1 year ago, we expected growth of 12% [ph] to 16%. In the third quarter, we updated that outlook to 15% to 17%. We finished the full year 2015 growing adjusted EBITDA 16% to $2.638 billion. Keep in mind this is after that, the deconsolidation of Venezuela and some significant currency headwinds all during on integration year. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses, was 33.2% for the fourth quarter 2015. For the full year, including integration-related expenses, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin by more than 400 basis points from 28% to 32.1%. We are confident in our ability to expand margins over time as we grow high-margin CNS revenue and optimized costs across the business. Moving to synergies on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, at the end of the fourth quarter, we had the achieved a $216 million of annualized run rate savings exceeding our overalls $200 million synergy target ahead of schedule. 
As we continue to streamline our cost structure, we expect to continue to optimize network expense. As we've reached our $200 million target, we will not be providing additional updates around future synergies. On Slide 10, we delivered strong free cash flow for the full year 2015 of $658 million. This excludes the accelerated cash interest payments of $32 million related to Capital Markets activity in the fourth quarter 2015 and completed after third quarter earnings, driving cash interest expense higher in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. We exited the year with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3.8x. This compares to 4.4x at the end of 2014. Over the last decade, our target leverage range has been 3 to 5x. We are now narrowing our target leverage range to 3.4x and remain focused on getting to the low end of that range. 
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to outline our business outlook for 2016, which is also provided in this morning's press release. From a revenue growth perspective, all of my remarks are on a constant currency and a year-over-year basis. In 2015, total revenue grew 3.7%, excluding U.K. government, total CNS revenue grew 5.5% and enterprise CNS revenue grew 7.4%. 
For 2016, we expect total revenue growth to be higher. We also expect total CNS and enterprise CNS revenue growth, excluding the U.K. government revenue, to be stronger in 2016 compared to 2015. We expect total wholesale CNS revenue growth for the full year 2016 to be up slightly compared to the full year 2015. In North America, we expect total CNS and enterprise CNS revenue growth for the full year to be comparable to the 5.9% and 7.6% growth, respectively we saw in 2015. To put that in perspective, enterprise CNS growth is expected to be quite a bit higher than the 6.1% growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Also, keep in mind that the onetime install revenue in 2015 that won't recur in 2016 is about 0.5% of North America enterprise CNS revenue in 2015. Adjusting for that, our North America enterprise revenue growth is expected to be in higher in 2016 compared to 2015. As a reminder, our goal is to grow overall enterprise CNS 8% on a year-over-year basis. We also expect wholesale CNS revenue in North America to grow slightly in 2016. In EMEA, we expect total CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, to grow in 2016. 
For 2015, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, increased 5.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect comparable performance in 2016. EMEA wholesale revenue declined 7% in 2015 on a constant currency basis, and we expect a slight decline in 2016. From a U.K. government perspective, we anticipate an approximate 30% decline as our contract with HMRC expired in January. Our LATAM CNS revenues grew 7.2% in 2015. We expect performance to be stronger in 2016. Additionally, we think enterprise CNS revenue performance will be formally better than the 7.3% growth we saw for the full year 2015. Latin America wholesale revenue increased 6.9% in 2015 and we expect better performance in 2016. 
We also expect that wholesale voice and other revenue will decline approximately 10% in 2016. In addition to better revenue growth in 2016, we expect to generate strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Specifically from the adjusted EBITDA starting point of $2.592 [ph] billion from 2015, which excludes the 3 quarters of 2015 EBITDA contribution from Venezuela, we expect to grow adjusted EBITDA 9% to 12% for the full year 2016. We expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the full year 2016. From a capital expenditure perspective, we expect to spend about 15% of total revenue on CapEx in 2016 as we invest for future growth. 
Additionally, for 2016, we expect our full-year income tax rate to average about 30%. That rate can vary significant in any quarter. In summary. 2015 was a transitional year for the company as we successfully work through integrating tw telecom. With our continued investment for organic growth, coupled with our strong operating leverage, we are well positioned to drive better topline performance and strong line -- strong bottom line performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As I walk you through our strategy and how we think about the market opportunities, I also want to take a few minutes to provide more detail on our performance last year on the company's 3 key initiatives, starting with the successful in",2042,"Thank you, Sunit. As I walk you through our strategy and how we think about the market opportunities, I also want to take a few minutes to provide more detail on our performance last year on the company's 3 key initiatives, starting with the successful integration of tw telecom. 
As I noted early last year, we expect the 2015 to be a year of transition with all of the heavy lifting that usually occurs in the first year after a large acquisition. To highlight just a couple of examples of our progress here, I'll start with the sales force and sales process. Maintaining an effective sales force was the initial focal point of our integration efforts because those employees are closest connection to our customers and drive our growth. 
Early in the year, we consolidated accounts and enabled a common, comprehensive customer relationship management system. We then rolled out consistent compensation plans, unified our general management structure and developing conducted crosstraining on the combined company's products. Even with all this change, our 2015 CNS sales were higher than in 2014 for the combined companies. 
While we have additional work to make the process easier for our sales team, we feel good about where we are and how the actions we've taken set us up for growth this year and for future years. We also combined networks, streamlining our cost structure and capitalizing on our metro and long-haul assets. Again, we have more opportunity and more work to do here, but we believe we have the best global network supported by a deep metro footprint across the United States and growing footprints in EMEA and Latin America. 
In addition, we're able to hit our run rate synergy targets much sooner than expected. As the team focused on operational excellence, we know that moving customers on-net and illuminating operational efficiencies are the best way to drive a differentiated customer experience. Many of you have asked me about the potential revenue synergies associated with the combination of the 2 companies. As I stated before and as we've seen with prior acquisition, the pace and degree of change can be a lot for a sales force to process. 
However, as we work through integration throughout the year, we've seen benefits from a revenue perspective. While we've not specifically quantified the dollar impact of revenue synergies, cross-selling and net selling opportunities are a factor for us. I'll give you an example of a customer win from last quarter when that demonstrates the power of the combined company. Heritage home group or HHG is a world leader in designing, manufacturing, sourcing and retailing home furnishings. They market their products through a wide range of channels and including their own Thomas build retail stores through interior designers, multiline independent retailers and mass merchant stores. The Heritage Home group portfolio includes some of the best-known and most respected brands in the furniture industry. 
As a tw telecom customer since 2003, HHG historically used a large incumbent telco as their primary provider for their 50 or so locations. Tw telecom was limited in its ability to service many off HHG's domestic and international sites and complex voice needs. Additionally, HHG had grown to the point where they required more bandwidth to meet their demands of their business and we're looking for a provider who could help with more of the networking needs in all of their sites. In the fourth quarter of last year, Level 3 was successful in winning HHG's global win and voice business. The selection of Level 3 was based on the larger network, stronger service capabilities and the customer references we offered. Additionally, Level 3's Voice Complete solution was much more robust and met their needs better than services available at tw telecom or the incumbents. Finally, our secure access solution enables HHG to incorporate international sites in a way that's not previously possible. 
As a combined company, we went from supporting 5 sites to now supporting 50 sites and have added products such as global managed services -- global managed securities that were not available through standalone tw telecom. As a reminder, we occasionally win large multi site deals with brand-new customers. Our typical approach is to begin in customer relationship exactly like we did with HHG. We generally start with a single product in a few locations. After we demonstrate our performance, we can then go substantially in a number of locations and services we provide to meet their complex working needs. 
Moving to an update on EMEA. 2015 was also a year of transition for that region, the telecommunications market in EMEA is sizable, nearly as large as the U.S. market, yet get our market share in the region is much lower. But we have a nice business in the United Kingdom, we did not have the right go-to-market strategy or sales structure to take advantage of the opportunity on the continent or drive even better penetration in the U.K. Over the last year, we built a very talented leadership team to ensure we aggressively attacked the market. We concentrated our focus on 4 primarily markets: the U.K., Germany, France and Benelux, and have implemented a disciplined sales and investment process to enable profitable growth in that region. 
Additionally, our global ethernet and Voice Complete products will be fully available in the region by the end of the first quarter. We've made good progress in 2015. After several years of declining revenue in EMEA, revenue was essentially flat last year. For 2016, excluding U.K. government, we expect EMEA CNS revenue to grow on a constant currency basis. We do believe we can benefit from additional scale in the region and are actively expanding our growth opportunities. 
Turning to our initiatives -- position Level 3 for future growth. Our strategy to be the premier provider for global communication services focused on the enterprise networking market has 2 key components: to develop the capability that our customers need and to do so over an efficient, unified global platform. In the past, customers thought of a network as a noun. It was a thing that they used to tie their internal systems together in a few locations. Today, our customers know that network is actually a verb. It's not a thing. Network is an action. How well they network with their customers, their suppliers, their employees and even the equipment they use, to turn and how effectively they can empower and drive their businesses forward. 
With the rapid deployment of cloud services and the growth of the Internet of Things, customers know that how they network drives efficiencies, new products and entire new business models. With respect to the Internet of Things, it's important to note that many of the things are already there. It's the connectivity to those things and the ability to network those things that is rapidly evolving. Air handlers in the manufacturing facility or infusion pumps in the hospital room already exist. What would be different is the ability to efficiently network those devices and integrate them into the performance of the company. 
Networking is at the center of many of the technology transitions that are underway whether it is the need to heighten security capabilities, increasing demand to connect globally, the migration to the cloud or the delivery of over-the-top content, customers know that the network is a physical asset they use to move their data around, but it is really the action of networking that drives their success. As a result, they turn to Level 3. With our focus on enterprise networking, we are not distracted by wireless, consumer services or other initiatives. We are solely focused on meeting our customers ever-expanding demands for capacity and networking services. 
While just buzzwords for many, software-defined networking and network function virtualization or FDN and NFV are actually built into the capabilities we deliver and help our customers with their networking requirements. Our adaptive network control and Cloud Connect Solutions products allow enterprises to dynamically adjust bandwidth as they move computing resources from their own data center to an outsourced data center or to a cloud service provider. They are no longer limited in their operations by inflexible networks or the inherent insecurity of the public Internet. 
Let me give you some examples of how our customers are using our capabilities today. Big Data analytics. Big Data is driving the need for more bandwidth to the cloud. Our customers who are leveraging Big Data tools in the cloud, need to create connections to enable their data analysis. These customers require temporary increase in bandwidth to move terabytes of data and then return to normal volumes for everyday use. We have recently enabled this type of application for our customers in genome sequencing, biopharma, higher ed research and oil and gas exploration, to name a few. 
Project-oriented IT. Many organizations need to deploy application environments for a discrete period of time, but they still want the security and performance delivered with private connectivity. Think of the upcoming presidential race or tax season. Using remote data centers or cloud service providers, organizations can spin up the IT resources to support these applications needed for a short period of time. Our adaptive network control capabilities can then be used to allow the network to match the agility of cloud resources, scaling the network resources on demand to support their application. 
By continuing to build into more data centers and more cloud service providers across the globe, Level 3 remains one of the best connected communications companies to leading cloud providers. Those connections, coupled with the depth of network control, creating networking environment that matches the flexibility of a cloud environment and allows customers to more effectively utilize cloud resource. We see this as a key opportunity and we'll continue to invest in both our capabilities and expanding our connectivity to those providers. 
From a net revenue perspective, our goal is to drive 8% year-over-year CNS enterprise growth. We have several levers to help us meet this goal, including continuing to grow our sales force and sales supports teams, further developing our products and service offerings to meet the needs of the markets and investing to expand our network. We're not quite there yet, but this remains our objective. And as a company and a management team, we're working toward accelerating revenue growth through these and other initiatives. 
Before we open it up to your questions, I'd like to take 1 minute and talk about how we think about capital allocation going forward. As Sunit noted, we expect to generate between $1 billion and $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2016. As a result of our performance, we are certainly in a different position with regard to our degrees of freedom with cash than we have been at any other time in the history of the company. We firmly believe that putting cash to work is accretive to shareholder value. 
As we've indicated, we're a growth company and therefore, our top priority is investing in the business. In 2016, we will continue to invest around 15% of total revenue in capital expenditures. Even with that level of investment, we'll be generating more cash than we can use organically. That brings me to our second priority. As our market share is low in a consolidating industry, we will continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities whether to grow our market share or expand our capabilities. We believe we've demonstrated a strong track record over the past few years, delivering value to stockholders through our disciplined execution strategy and integration execution. 
At some point and in the absence of the opportunities put cash to work to drive growth and fulfill our long-term strategy, returning capital to stockholders is an appropriate consideration. Keeping in mind that 2015 was only the second year we generated substantial free cash flow. We will continue to be very disciplined in our efforts to drive revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA growth and that just consistent growth in free cash flow per share. All of our capital allocation decisions are evaluated through the lens of providing the best return for our stockholders. 
With that, we will open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process."

How important is it to the management team, to the board, to have potentially a buyback plan simply in place this year so that if -- as we go through the course of the year, you haven't been successful in finding a deal that makes sense for you and ultimately, you have this cash building and you're not deploying it as aggressively through M&A as you might've anticipated or wanted to. And then as part of that, it does look at least in our model that you could very well be at the low end if not below 3 turns of leverage whether it's at the end of '16 or maybe early '17, which if I'm not mistaken could actually make you possible or give you an option to be investment-grade. How important is it for Level 3 in your business model to be investment-grade? Is that something that you guys aspire to or would actually look to go below 3 turns to achieve over the long-term?"

So we think that's the right level for us, that's why we said the low end of 3 to 4x. With respect to your question on when in 2016, I mean just to further expand on what Jeff said. I mean, if you look at our returns over the last 5 years, in the last 5 years our compounded annual return on our stock price has been 30%. A big reason for that has been the 2 big M&A deals we did Global Crossing and tw. And so we think that successful M&A has been a key part of that. And will continue to be a part of that, not to mention expanding our market share is important but also all these acquisitions have really improved our competitive and strategic position and the durability of the growth and the returns we can provide over time. So I think just expanding on that, that'll continue to be our focus. I think, if you come to some point later in the year that we have figured out we have not been successful as Jeff said, our goal is to maximize or optimize free cash flow per share over the long-term. So I think there's no specific time line at this point. But I just want to remind everyone that a big reason why the returns have been the way they have in the last 5 years have been M&A driven besides just organic growth."

On the North American enterprise guidance, I just want to understand, it sounds like you still feel very comfortable with sort of the 8% target range on there. But perhaps 2016 would be impacted by the fact that you had some onetime benefits that came in 2015, that might impact the growth. But just want to see what your comfort level is with the ability to hit 8% in North American enterprise for '16. And then just secondly, on the synergies side. Obviously, I mean, I think that's really ramped up significantly in the last couple of quarters. Maybe you could walk us through where that's coming why you're able to exceed what areas you've been able to exceed not only in your near-term target but your total target. And if I'm not mistaken, you're not at the Network Access target that you set out initially. Is there still more synergies to come particularly in the Network Access site?"

So I'll start with the North America enterprise. As you say, the growth will be comparable to last year, which was 7.4% -- 7.6%.

As you say, the growth will be comparable to last year, which was 7.4% -- 7.6%. So I think that if you were to look at the underlying run rate excluding the 0.5% or so benefit we got from onetime install revenue that we got in 2015 that we don't expect to incur in the '16. From an underlying perspective, we're close to sort of the 8% growth rate. Now obviously, as we report over the course of the year and because of that install revenue in 2015, that impacts the growth rate by 0.5%. That's why we say we'd be comfortable with the performance we saw in 2015. Now as Jeff pointed out, our goal is probably to be at 8%, so we're going to work hard over the course of the year to make the investments to do that. But I think the guidance we have provided is the best insight we have at this point in time. On the synergy side. I think as you've seen from the schedule we provided, all the favorability has come from the operating expense side. I think some of the key areas that drove that, one is nonheadcount related expense, we work very hard with all of our suppliers, whether it's equipment suppliers, charges maintenance fees, utility costs to drive efficiency initiatives. So it's a combination of deficiencies on the non-headcount side. We also I think gained a fair bit of benefit from the headcount side, which was a tough and delicate balance to my left the same time we still have some integration to go. So I think -- so it is a combination of non-headcount and headcount-related expenses. And we got a favorable benefit of the capital expenditure side that we haven't talked about here that we mentioned last year. We negotiated with our suppliers to put that in place, to have those savings in place right at the beginning of last year. So it actually had the effect of increasing our investment compared to what the standalone companies are investing in '14 just because we had met our pricing. Finally, your questions on Network Access expenses. Yes, we have -- that hasn't worked out as well as we thought we -- but remember, our ultimate target was about $110 million that we didn't expect to achieve until closer to the end of this year. So as we -- as I said in my remarks, we'll continue to optimize that, it gets tougher and tougher to report as separate synergies. But you will see that in our network expense margins going forward."

If you want to tie 2 data centers across the country together, our 100 gig wide products are good solutions for that. If you want to tie a data center to a branch office, our IP VPN products are good for that. And so we look at that overall comprehensive portfolio and recognize that our customers have very -- a variety of different networking challenges that we are trying to solve. And so we match our technologies. We're not limited to just CDN. We're not limited to just Internet. We match our technology and solutions to their working needs. And so we think that's a strong capability that we offer versus most of our competitors. With respect to M&A, we are very pleased with our footprint. But we want to continue to expand our footprint both in depth and in geography. So if you look + EMEA for example, I mentioned that our goal is focused on expanding in 4 key markets, that means going richer and deeper in fiber in the U.K. but also richer and deeper in fiber in Germany, France and Benelux.

I think this is the -- I think the network advantage because the more network you have, the more closer you are to building. So the advantage in winning new businesses is 2 for 1, because you're connected to more buildings, you feel the higher margin or cost structure or more degrees of freedom to win the business. But in addition to your point, to die in new buildings in any particular customer proposal we are going for, our cost to getting that is generally lower than other providers just because of the depth and popularity of our network. And so the other key point there is because we operate in the number of geographies we do, more often than not when a customer has a need, we can get to the more locations on that than our competitors, which is why some of the reasons we talk about acquisitions is that not only do they give you synergies and accretive free cash flow per share, but actually improve your competitive and strategic competition and the durability of the advantage that you have your competition."

And I'd argue that the best connected globally to many of those types of companies. And so we'll continue to partner. We'll continue to build with them. The other thing that we're trying to do is change and we are doing is changing the way networks operate, so that the enterprise customers can take advantage of those resources more effectively. Historically, networks have been very inflexible. You build up capacity, you net all capacity up, and it just stays there and that's all you have. We have changed with our adaptive network control capabilities and our Cloud Connect Solutions products. We have changed that dynamic and are creating flexible networks that would allow enterprise customers to more effectively utilize those cloud environment and access those different pools of demand with very flexible network design. So we'll continue to partner with them and continue to focus on making sure that Level 3 is the most connected and the best equipped to take advantage of that for our shareholders. 
Thank you. With that, I'd like to close the call with just a few thoughts. As evidenced by our continued growth in market share, our strategy to position Level 3 as the premier provider of communication services is working. We believe we're at the intersection of the best network, the best people and the right market opportunity to continue to grow. The ability to generate significant free cash flow is evident in our performance last year and our expectation for 2016 and remains a focus for the business through continued profitable growth. 
We remain focused on our enterprise networking customers and on providing a differentiated customer experience.

In 2015, we met or exceeded our key outlook measures for the year. Even with integration, global currency pressures driven by macroeconomic headwinds and the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary last quarter, we had good momentum, which drove revenue, adjusted EBITDA growth and profit performance for the year. We also delivered strong free cash flow and set the stage for continued strong growth in 2016. Looking forward, we are building on this foundation, investing in the business and continue to be disciplined in managing our costs as we maintain our focus on profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 3 for a summary of our performance in 2015. Our Core Network Services, or CNS revenue for the full year 2015, grew 5.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. For the full year, total enterprise CNS grew 7.2% and North America enterprise CNS grew 7.6%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 16% for the full year 2015, in line with our recent outlook of 15% to 17%. From a free cash flow perspective, we finished above the range of our outlook of $600 million to $650 million for the year by generating $658 million in 2015. 
Free cash flow excludes $32 million of accelerated cash interest expense payments related to a refinancing that took place after reporting third quarter earnings. We refinanced $4.9 billion of debt during 2015, resulting in over $110 million of annualized cash interest expense savings.  Additionally, we continue to lower our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is now at 3.8x. 
Finally from a synergy perspective, as of the end of the fourth quarter 2015, we achieved approximately $216 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the close of the tw telecom transaction. This exceeds our original synergy expectations to achieve $140 million by the end of the first quarter 2016 and $200 million in total.
Turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter 2015, CNS revenue grew 4.4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% on a an as-reported basis. As we saw throughout 2015, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affected our reported growth rates. For the full year, CNS revenue grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis but 2.9% on an as-reported basis. At the end of the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar represented 90% of total revenue; the British pound represented 4%; the euro, 3%; and the Brazilian real, 2%. All other currencies are included in the remaining 1%.
I'd like to move now to a discussion of revenue on a regional basis. North America CNS revenue grew 5.9% for the full year. For the fourth quarter 2015, from an enterprise perspective, CNS revenue grew 6.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 1.5% on a sequential basis, following the particularly strong results in the third quarter of 2015, where our sequential growth was 2.7%. Adjusting for that, our North America enterprise business is at a 2% sequential growth base over the last 2 quarters.
For the full year 2015, EMEA CNS revenue was relatively flat on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, EMEA CNS revenue increased 0.7% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.1% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.5% on a constant currency basis and remained flat on an as-reported basis. While enterprise revenue growth was a little slower than the results we have seen in prior quarters, it was primarily a result of the unusual strength in enterprise CNS revenue from the fourth quarter 2014.
Sequentially, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 2.2%. Also, CNS revenue declined 0.3% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an as-reported basis. U.K. government CNS revenue decreased 7.9% on a constant currency basis and 10.7% on an as-reported basis. In Latin America, for the full year, CNS revenue grew 7.2% on a constant currency basis, while the fourth quarter, Latin America CNS revenue grew 8.4% on a constant currency basis and declined 6.4% on an as-reported basis. 
Enterprise CNS in Latin America grew 9.5% on a constant currency basis and declined 6.7% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue increased 4.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 5.4% on an as-reported basis. 
Our revenue mix can be found on Slide 5, with North America representing the bulk of our CNS revenue at 81%, followed by EMEA at 11% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 73% of CNS revenue while wholesale customers make up the remaining 27%.
Turning to Slide 6. Revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 8.2% and continues to drive the company's growth, led by growth in VPN and managed services. Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year, but grew 7.9% on a sequential basis. Transport and fiber grew 1.8%, driven by wavelengths and professional services. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 10% year-over-year. Colocation and datacenter services grew 3.9% and voice services declined by 0.5%.
Over the course of 2015, we saw little change in the overall pricing environment within our products or regions. For 2016, we remain focused on assessing the pricing landscape, and we'll continue to take a market-by-market approach to pricing solutions looking at particular geographies, products, verticals as well as other factors and maintaining our focus on profitable growth. One of the things we were very focused on in 2015 and will continue to be focused on this year is sales production or bookings and sales productivity.
In 2015, total sales production improved over 2014, and sales productivity grew significantly. For the fourth quarter 2015, CNS sales production grew nicely compared to the fourth quarter 2014. 
Moving to Slide 8. When we initially provided outlook for adjusted EBITDA 1 year ago, we expected growth of 12% to 16%. In the third quarter, we updated that outlook to 15% to 17%. We finished the full year 2015 growing adjusted EBITDA 16% to $2.638 billion. Keep in mind, this is after that the deconsolidation of Venezuela and some significant currency headwinds, all during in integration year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses, was 33.2% for the fourth quarter 2015. For the full year, including integration-related expenses, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin by more than 400 basis points from 28% to 32.1%. We are confident in our ability to expand margins over time as we grow high-margin CNS revenue and optimize costs across the business. 
Moving to synergies on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, at the end of the fourth quarter, we had the achieved a $216 million of annualized run rate savings, exceeding our overalls $200 million synergy target ahead of schedule.
As we continue to streamline our cost structure, we expect to continue to optimize network expense. As we've reached our $200 million target, we will not be providing additional updates around future synergies. 
On Slide 10. We delivered strong free cash flow for the full year 2015 of $658 million. This excludes the accelerated cash interest payments of $32 million related to capital markets activity in the fourth quarter 2015 and completed after third quarter earnings, driving cash interest expense higher in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. We exited the year with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3.8x. This compares to 4.4x at the end of 2014. Over the last decade, our target leverage range has been 3 to 5x. We are now narrowing our target leverage range to 3.4x and remain focused on getting to the low end of that range.
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to outline our business outlook for 2016, which is also provided in this morning's press release. From a revenue growth perspective, all of my remarks are on a constant currency and a year-over-year basis. 
In 2015, total revenue grew 3.7%.  Excluding U.K. government, total CNS revenue grew 5.5%, and enterprise CNS revenue grew 7.4%. 
For 2016, we expect total revenue growth to be higher. We also expect total CNS and enterprise CNS revenue growth, excluding U.K. government revenue, to be stronger in 2016 compared to 2015. We expect total wholesale CNS revenue growth for the full year 2016 to be up slightly compared to the full year 2015. 
In North America, we expect total CNS and enterprise CNS revenue growth for the full year to be comparable to the 5.9% and 7.6% growth, respectively we saw in 2015. To put that in perspective, enterprise CNS growth is expected to be quite a bit higher than the 6.1% growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Also, keep in mind that the one-time installed revenue in 2015 that won't recur in 2016 is about 0.5% of North America enterprise CNS revenue in 2015. Adjusting for that, our North America enterprise revenue growth is expected to be in higher in 2016 compared to 2015. 
As a reminder, our goal is to grow overall enterprise CNS 8% on a year-over-year basis. We also expect wholesale CNS revenue in North America to grow slightly in 2016. In EMEA, we expect total CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, to grow in 2016.
For 2015, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, increased 5.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect comparable performance in 2016. EMEA wholesale revenue declined 7% in 2015 on a constant currency basis, and we expect a slight decline in 2016. 
From a U.K. government perspective, we anticipate an approximate 30% decline as our contract with HMRC expired in January. Our LATAM CNS revenues grew 7.2% in 2015. We expect performance to be stronger in 2016. Additionally, we think enterprise CNS revenue performance will be firmly better than the 7.3% growth we saw for the full year 2015. Latin America wholesale revenue increased 6.9% in 2015, and we expect better performance in 2016.
We also expect that Wholesale Voice and other revenue will decline approximately 10% in 2016. In addition to better revenue growth in 2016, we expect to generate strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Specifically from the adjusted EBITDA starting point of $2.592 billion from 2015, which excludes the 3 quarters of 2015 EBITDA contribution from Venezuela, we expect to grow adjusted EBITDA 9% to 12% for the full year 2016. We expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the full year 2016. From a capital expenditure perspective, we expect to spend about 15% of total revenue on CapEx in 2016 as we invest for future growth.
Additionally, for 2016, we expect our full year income tax rate to average about 30%. That rate can vary significant in any quarter. 
In summary, 2015 was a transitional year for the company as we successfully work through integrating tw telecom. With our continued investment for organic growth, coupled with our strong operating leverage, we are well positioned to drive better top line performance and strong line -- strong bottom line performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As I walk you through our strategy and how we think about the market opportunities, I also want to take a few minutes to provide more detail on our performance last year on the company's 3 key initiatives, starting with the successful integration of tw telecom.
As I noted early last year, we expected 2015 to be a year of transition, with all of the heavy lifting that usually occurs in the first year after a large acquisition. 
To highlight just a couple of examples of our progress here, I'll start with the sales force and sales process. Maintaining an effective sales force was the initial focal point of our integration efforts, because those employees are the closest connection to our customers and drive our growth.
Early in the year, we consolidated accounts and enabled a common, comprehensive customer relationship management system. We then rolled out consistent compensation plans, unified our general management structure and developed and conducted cross-training on the combined company's products. Even with all this change, our 2015 CNS sales were higher than in 2014 for the combined company.
While we have additional work to make the process easier for our sales team, we feel good about where we are and how the actions we've taken set us up for growth this year and in future years. We also combined networks, streamlining our cost structure and capitalizing on our metro and long-haul assets. Again, we have more opportunity and more work to do here, but we believe we have the best global network supported by a deep metro footprint across the United States and growing footprints in EMEA and Latin America.
In addition, we are able to hit our run rate synergy targets much sooner than expected. As the team focused on operational excellence, we know that moving customers on-net and illuminating operational inefficiencies are the best ways to drive a differentiated customer experience. 
Many of you have asked me about the potential revenue synergies associated with the combination of the 2 companies. As I stated before and as we've seen with prior acquisition, the pace and degree of change can be a lot for a sales force to process.
However, as we work through integration throughout the year, we've seen benefits from a revenue perspective. While we've not specifically quantified the dollar impact of revenue synergies, cross-selling and upselling opportunities are a factor for us. I'll give you an example of a customer win from last quarter that demonstrates the power of the combined company. Heritage Home Group, or HHG is a world leader in designing, manufacturing, sourcing and retailing home furnishings. They market their products through a wide range of channels, including their own Thomasville retail stores through interior designers, multiline independent retailers and mass merchant stores. The Heritage Home Group portfolio includes some of the best-known and most respected brands in the furniture industry.
As a tw telecom customer since 2003, HHG historically used a large incumbent telco as their primary provider for their 50 or so locations. Tw telecom was limited in its ability to service many off HHG's domestic and international sites and complex voice needs. 
Additionally, HHG had grown to the point where they required more bandwidth to meet their demands of their business and were looking for a provider who could help with more of their networking needs in all of their sites. 
In the fourth quarter of last year, Level 3 was successful in winning HHG's global win and voice business. The selection of Level 3 was based on the larger network, stronger service capabilities and the customer references we offered. 
Additionally, Level 3's Voice Complete solution was much more robust and met their needs better than services available from tw telecom or the incumbents. Finally, our secure access solution enabled HHG to incorporate international sites in a way that was not previously possible. 
As a combined company, we went from supporting 5 sites to now supporting 50 sites and have added products, such as global managed services -- global managed security that were not available through standalone tw telecom. 
As a reminder, we occasionally win large multisite deals with brand new customers. Our typical approach is to begin customer relationship exactly like we did with HHG. We generally start with a single product in a few locations. After we demonstrate our performance, we can then grow substantially in the number of locations and services we provide to meet their complex networking needs.
Moving to an update on EMEA. 2015 was also a year of transition for that region. The telecommunications market in EMEA is sizable, nearly as large as the U.S. market, yet our market share in the region is much lower. While we have a nice business in the United Kingdom, we did not have the right go-to-market strategy or sales structure to take advantage of the opportunity on the continent or drive even better penetration in the U.K. Over the last year, we built a very talented leadership team to ensure we aggressively attack the market. We've concentrated our focus on 4 primarily markets: the U.K., Germany, France and Benelux and have implemented a disciplined sales and investment process to enable profitable growth in that region.
Additionally, our global ethernet and Voice Complete products will be fully available in the region by the end of the first quarter. We made good progress in 2015. After several years of declining revenue in EMEA, revenue was essentially flat last year. For 2016, excluding U.K. government, we expect EMEA CNS revenue to grow on a constant currency basis. We do believe we can benefit from additional scale in the region and are actively investing to expand our growth opportunities.
Turning to our initiatives, position Level 3 for future growth. Our strategy to be the premier provider of global communication services, focused on the enterprise networking market has 2 key components: to develop the capabilities of our customers need and to do so over an efficient, unified global platform. In the past, customers thought of the network as a noun. It was a thing that they used to tie their internal systems together in a few locations. Today, our customers know that network is actually a verb. It's not a thing. Network is an action. How well they network with their customers, their suppliers, their employees and even the equipment they use, determines how effectively they can empower and drive their businesses forward.
With the rapid deployment of cloud services and the growth of the Internet of Things, customers know that how the network drives efficiencies, new products and entire new business models. With respect to the Internet of Things, it's important to note that many of the things are already there. It's the connectivity to those things and the ability to network those things that is rapidly evolving. Air handlers in the manufacturing facility or infusion pumps in a hospital room already exist. What would be different is the ability to efficiently network those devices and integrate them into the performance of the company.
Networking is at the center of many of the technology transitions that are underway, whether it is the need for heightened security capabilities, increasing demand to connect globally, the migration to the cloud or the delivery of over-the-top content, customers know that the network is a physical asset they use to move their data around, but it is really the action of networking that drives their success. As a result, they turn to Level 3. With our focus on enterprise networking, we are not distracted by wireless, consumer services or other initiatives. We are solely focused on meeting our customers ever-expanding demands for capacity and networking services. 
While just buzzwords for many, software-defined networking and network function virtualization, or SDN and NFV are actually built into the capabilities we deliver and help our customers with their networking requirements. Our Adaptive Network Control and Cloud Connect Solutions products allow enterprises to dynamically adjust bandwidth, as they move computing resources from their own data center to an outsourced data center or to a cloud service provider. They are no longer limited in their operations by inflexible networks or the inherent insecurity of the public Internet.
Let me give you some examples of how our customers are using our capabilities today. Big data analytics. Big data is driving the need for more bandwidth to the cloud. Our customers who are leveraging big data tools in the cloud, need to create connections to enable their data analysis. These customers require temporary increase in bandwidth to move terabytes of data and then return to normal volumes for everyday use. We have recently enabled this type of application for our customers in genome sequencing, biopharma, higher ed research and oil and gas exploration, to name a few. 
Project-oriented IT. Many organizations need to deploy application environments for a discrete period of time, but they still want the security and performance delivered with private connectivity. Think of the upcoming presidential race or tax season. Using remote data centers or cloud service providers, organizations can spin up the IT resources to support these applications needed for a short periods of time. Our Adaptive Network Control capabilities can then be used to allow the network to match the agility of cloud resources, scaling the network resources on-demand to support their application.
By continuing to build into more data centers and more cloud service providers across the globe, Level 3 remains one of the best connected communications companies to leading cloud providers. Those connections, coupled with the depth of network control, creating networking environment that matches the flexibility of a cloud environment and allows customers to more effectively utilize cloud resource. We see this as a key opportunity, and we'll continue to invest in both our capabilities and expanding our connectivity to those providers.
From a net revenue perspective, our goal is to drive 8% year-over-year CNS enterprise growth. We have several levers to help us meet this goal, including continuing to grow our sales force and sales supports teams, further developing our products and service offerings to meet the needs of the market and investing to expand our network. We're not quite there yet, but this remains our objective. And as a company and a management team, we are working toward accelerating revenue growth through these and other initiatives.
Before we open it up for your questions, I'd like to take one minute and talk about how we think about capital allocation going forward. As Sunit noted, we expect to generate between $1 billion and $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2016. As a result of our performance, we are certainly in a different position with regard to our degrees of freedom with cash than we have been at any other time in the history of the company. We firmly believe that putting excess cash to work is accretive to stockholder value.
As we've indicated, we are a growth company, and therefore, our top priority is investing in the business. In 2016, we will continue to invest around 15% of total revenue in capital expenditures. Even with that level of investment, we'll be generating more cash than we can use organically. That brings me to our second priority. As our market share is low in a consolidating industry, we will continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities, whether to grow our market share or expand our capabilities. We believe we've demonstrated a strong track record over the past few years, delivering value to stockholders through our disciplined acquisition strategy and integration execution.
At some point and in the absence of the opportunities put cash toward to drive growth and fulfill our long-term strategy, returning capital to stockholders is an appropriate consideration. 
Keeping in mind that 2015 was only the second year we generated substantial free cash flow. We will continue to be very disciplined in our efforts to drive revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA growth and consistent growth in free cash flow per share. All of our capital allocation decisions are evaluated through the lens of providing the best return for our stockholders.
With that, we will open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process."

And then as part of that, it does look at least in our model that you could very well be at the low end, if not below, 3 turns of leverage, whether it's at the end of '16 or maybe early '17, which if I'm not mistaken could actually make you possible or give you an option to be investment-grade. How important is it for Level 3 in your business model to be investment-grade? Is that something that you guys aspire to or would actually look to go below 3 turns to achieve over the long term?"

So we think that's the right level for us, that's why we said the low end of 3 to 4x. With respect to your question on when in 2016, I mean, just to further expand on what Jeff said, I mean, if you look at our returns over the last 5 years, our compounded annual return on our stock price has been 30%. A big reason for that has been the 2 big M&A deals we did Global Crossing and tw. And so we think that successful M&A has been a key part of that and will continue to be a part of that. Not to mention that expanding our market share is important but also all these acquisitions have really improved our competitive and strategic position and the durability of the growth and the returns we can provide over time. So I think, just expanding on that, that'll continue to be our focus. I think, if we come to some point late in the year where we figure out we have not been successful as that as Jeff said, our goal is to maximize or optimize free cash flow per share over the long term. So I think there's no specific time line at this point, but I just want to remind everyone that reason why the returns have been the way they have in the last 5 years, it has been M&A driven besides just organic growth."

But just want to see what your comfort level is with the ability to hit 8% in North American enterprise for '16. And then just secondly, on the synergies side. Obviously, I mean, I think that's really ramped up significantly in the last couple of quarters. Maybe you could walk us through where that's coming from? Why you've been able to exceed? On what area you've been able to exceed not only your near-term target but what was your total target. And if I'm not mistaken, you're not at the Network Access target that you set out initially.

So I'll start with the North America enterprise. As we said, the growth will be comparable to last year, which was 7.4% -- 7.6%.

As we said, the growth will be comparable to last year, which was 7.4% -- 7.6%. So I think that if you were to look at the underlying run rate, excluding the 0.5% or so benefit we got from one-time install revenue in 2015, that we don't expect to incur in '16. From an underlying perspective, we are -- we're close to sort of the 8% growth rate. Now obviously, as we report over the course of the year because of that install revenue in 2015, that impacts the growth rate by 0.5%. That's why we said it'd be comparable to the performance we saw in 2015. Now as Jeff pointed out, our goal is firmly to be at 8%. So we're going to work hard over the course of the year to make the investments to do that. But I think the guidance we provided is the best insight we have at this point in time. On the synergy side, I think, as you've seen from the schedule we provided, all the favorability has come from the operating expense side. I think some of the key areas that drove that, one was on nonheadcount-related expenses. We worked very hard with all our suppliers, whether it's equipment suppliers, the charges, maintenance fees, utility costs to drive efficiency initiatives, so it's a combination of synergies and efficiencies on the nonheadcount side. We also, I think, gained a fair bit of benefit from the headcount side, which was a tough and delicate balance to achieve, while at the same time, we had a heavy integration load and we still have some integration to go. So I think -- so it was a combination of nonheadcount- and headcount-related expenses. And we got a fair bit of benefit on the capital expenditure side that we haven't talked about here but we mentioned last year. We negotiated with our suppliers to put that in place, have those savings in place right at the beginning of last year. So it actually had the effect of increasing our investment compared to what the standalone companies were investing in '14 just because we have better pricing. Finally, your questions on Network Access expenses. Yes, we haven't -- that hasn't worked out as well as we thought. We -- but remember, our ultimate target was about $110 million that we didn't expect to achieve until closer to the end of this year. So as we -- as I said in my remarks, we'll continue to optimize that. It gets tougher and tougher to report that separately as synergies, but you will see that in our network expense margins going forward."

If you want to tie 2 locally located data centers together, dark fiber is a good solution for that. If you want to tie 2 data centers across the country together, our 100 gig products are good solutions for that. If you want to tie a data center to a branch office, our IP VPN products are good for that. And so we look at that overall comprehensive portfolio and recognize that our customers have very -- a variety of different networking challenges that they are trying to solve. And so we match our technologies. We don't -- we're not limited to just CDN, we're not limited to just Internet. We match our technologies and our solutions to their working needs, and so we think that's a strong capability that we offer versus most of our competitors. With respect to M&A, we are very pleased with our footprint, but we want to continue to expand our footprint, both in depth and in geography. So if you look at EMEA for example, I mentioned that we are focused on expanding in 4 key markets. That means going richer and deeper in fiber in the U.K. but also richer and deeper in fiber in Germany, France and Benelux. And so we'll continue to look at those both organically and inorganically, that how we put our cash to work to drive the growth for Level 3. Sunit?"

We continue to see dark fiber performing well over the next couple of years as some of our customers' scale needs are large and that solution works for them. Then there are other areas. CDN, we've talked about, we told -- we said last year, we made a significant investment there. We're beginning to see the benefits there. There are other areas that we've made investments, so we'll talk about in the future, like security services that Jeff has talked about. We continue to make reasonable size investments in that area. That's something we'll be able to talk about more tangibly later in the year or next year. So these are some of the areas. But in general, the basic message, I think, is the demand drivers for bandwidth continuing strength for all of the things that Jeff cited, and that's what we are leveraged towards."

For example, did you get any maybe color or commentary on the credit markets that your incremental funding costs could be a lot lower if you're willing to commit to a lower floor? And then you guys provided a really constructive view on what supports your revenue outlook for this year. And Jeff, I was hoping you can maybe just provide a little more color in terms of what's behind that? Specifically, how much of that outlook is based on the demand environment in general, what you're seeing in sales funnels, what you're seeing in client spend?

In terms of the components, as we've said in the past, most of our capital expenditure is success based driven by customer contracts. About $300 million to $350 million is what we have described as sort of maintenance upgrade-type CapEx. The rest is expansion CapEx. The thrust of the expansion capital this year will be some of the things that Jeff mentioned, which is expanding our network footprint, both deeper within existing geographies and in new geographies. I think that'll be a big chunk. We are spending capital for data centers on a select basis in different -- in some regions. We are spending capital for upgrading or putting in more capacity on our subsea systems. We are investing capital on long-haul dark fiber outs where needed. So these are several different areas that we're investing capital. The other area we're going to be investing more capital is an area we cited earlier, the security business we talked about.

But in addition to your point, to tie in new buildings in any particular customer proposal we are going for, our cost to get to that is generally lower than other providers just because of the depth and capillarity of our network. So -- and the other key point there is because we operate in the number of geographies we do, more often than not, when a customer has a need, we can get to the more of their locations on that than our competitors do, which is why one of the reasons we talked about acquisitions is that not only do they give you synergies and accretive free cash flow per share, but actually improve your competitive and strategic positon and the durability or the advantage that you have vis-à-vis your competition."

The other thing that we're trying to do is change and we are doing is changing the way networks operate, so that the enterprise customers can take advantage of those resources more effectively. Historically, networks have been very inflexible. You build up capacity, you nail that capacity up and it just stays there and that's all you have. We have changed with our Adaptive Network Control capabilities and our Cloud Connect Solutions products. We have changed that dynamic and are creating flexible networks that allow enterprise customers to more effectively utilize those cloud environments and access those different pools of demand with very flexible network design.

In 2015, we met or exceeded our key outlook measures for the year.

From a free cash flow perspective, we finished above the range of our outlook of $600 million to $650 million for the year by generating $658 million in 2015. 
Free cash flow excludes $32 million of accelerated cash interest expense payments related to a refinancing that took place after reporting third quarter earnings. We refinanced $4.9 billion of debt during 2015, resulting in over $110 million of annualized cash interest expense savings. Additionally, we continue to lower our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is now at 3.8x. 
Finally from a synergy perspective, as of the end of the fourth quarter 2015, we achieved approximately $216 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the close of the tw telecom transaction. This exceeds our original synergy expectations to achieve $140 million by the end of the first quarter 2016 and $200 million in total.
Turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter 2015, CNS revenue grew 4.4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% on a an as-reported basis. As we saw throughout 2015, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affected our reported growth rates. For the full year, CNS revenue grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis but 2.9% on an as-reported basis. At the end of the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar represented 90% of total revenue; the British pound represented 4%; the euro, 3%; and the Brazilian real, 2%. All other currencies are included in the remaining 1%.
I'd like to move now to a discussion of revenue on a regional basis. North America CNS revenue grew 5.9% for the full year. For the fourth quarter 2015, from an enterprise perspective, CNS revenue grew 6.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 1.5% on a sequential basis, following the particularly strong results in the third quarter of 2015, where our sequential growth was 2.7%. Adjusting for that, our North America enterprise business is at a 2% sequential growth base over the last 2 quarters.
For the full year 2015, EMEA CNS revenue was relatively flat on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, EMEA CNS revenue increased 0.7% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.1% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.5% on a constant currency basis and remained flat on an as-reported basis. While enterprise revenue growth was a little slower than the results we have seen in prior quarters, it was primarily a result of the unusual strength in enterprise CNS revenue from the fourth quarter 2014.
Sequentially, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 2.2%. Also, CNS revenue declined 0.3% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an as-reported basis. U.K. government CNS revenue decreased 7.9% on a constant currency basis and 10.7% on an as-reported basis. In Latin America, for the full year, CNS revenue grew 7.2% on a constant currency basis, while the fourth quarter, Latin America CNS revenue grew 8.4% on a constant currency basis and declined 6.4% on an as-reported basis. 
Enterprise CNS in Latin America grew 9.5% on a constant currency basis and declined 6.7% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue increased 4.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 5.4% on an as-reported basis. 
Our revenue mix can be found on Slide 5, with North America representing the bulk of our CNS revenue at 81%, followed by EMEA at 11% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 73% of CNS revenue while wholesale customers make up the remaining 27%.
Turning to Slide 6. Revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 8.2% and continues to drive the company's growth, led by growth in VPN and managed services. Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year, but grew 7.9% on a sequential basis. Transport and fiber grew 1.8%, driven by wavelengths and professional services. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 10% year-over-year. Colocation and datacenter services grew 3.9% and voice services declined by 0.5%.
Over the course of 2015, we saw little change in the overall pricing environment within our products or regions. For 2016, we remain focused on assessing the pricing landscape, and we'll continue to take a market-by-market approach to pricing solutions looking at particular geographies, products, verticals as well as other factors and maintaining our focus on profitable growth. One of the things we were very focused on in 2015 and will continue to be focused on this year is sales production on bookings and sales productivity.
In 2015, total sales production improved over 2014, and sales productivity grew significantly. For the fourth quarter 2015, CNS sales production grew nicely compared to the fourth quarter 2014. 
Moving to Slide 8. When we initially provided outlook for adjusted EBITDA 1 year ago, we expected growth of 12% to 16%. In the third quarter, we updated that outlook to 15% to 17%. We finished the full year 2015 growing adjusted EBITDA 16% to $2.638 billion. Keep in mind, this is after that the deconsolidation of Venezuela and some significant currency headwinds, all during in integration year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses, was 33.2% for the fourth quarter 2015. For the full year, including integration-related expenses, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin by more than 400 basis points from 28% to 32.1%. We are confident in our ability to expand margins over time as we grow high-margin CNS revenue and optimize costs across the business. 
Moving to synergies on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, at the end of the fourth quarter, we had the achieved a $216 million of annualized run rate savings, exceeding our overalls $200 million synergy target ahead of schedule.
As we continue to streamline our cost structure, we expect to continue to optimize network expense. As we've reached our $200 million target, we will not be providing additional updates around future synergies. 
On Slide 10. We delivered strong free cash flow for the full year 2015 of $658 million. This excludes the accelerated cash interest payments of $32 million related to capital markets activity in the fourth quarter 2015 and completed after third quarter earnings, driving cash interest expense higher in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. We exited the year with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3.8x. This compares to 4.4x at the end of 2014. Over the last decade, our target leverage range has been 3 to 5x. We are now narrowing our target leverage range to 3.4x and remain focused on getting to the low end of that range.
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to outline our business outlook for 2016, which is also provided in this morning's press release. From a revenue growth perspective, all of my remarks are on a constant currency and a year-over-year basis. 
In 2015, total revenue grew 3.7%. Excluding U.K. government, total CNS revenue grew 5.5%, and enterprise CNS revenue grew 7.4%. 
For 2016, we expect total revenue growth to be higher. We also expect total CNS and enterprise CNS revenue growth, excluding U.K. government revenue, to be stronger in 2016 compared to 2015. We expect total wholesale CNS revenue growth for the full year 2016 to be up slightly compared to the full year 2015. 
In North America, we expect total CNS and enterprise CNS revenue growth for the full year to be comparable to the 5.9% and 7.6% growth, respectively we saw in 2015. To put that in perspective, enterprise CNS growth is expected to be quite a bit higher than the 6.1% growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Also, keep in mind that the one-time installed revenue in 2015 that won't recur in 2016 is about 0.5% of North America enterprise CNS revenue in 2015. Adjusting for that, our North America enterprise revenue growth is expected to be higher in 2016 compared to 2015. 
As a reminder, our goal is to grow overall enterprise CNS 8% on a year-over-year basis. We also expect wholesale CNS revenue in North America to grow slightly in 2016. In EMEA, we expect total CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, to grow in 2016.
For 2015, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, increased 5.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect comparable performance in 2016. EMEA wholesale revenue declined 7% in 2015 on a constant currency basis, and we expect a slight decline in 2016. 
From a U.K. government perspective, we anticipate an approximate 30% decline as our contract with HMRC expired in January. Our LATAM CNS revenues grew 7.2% in 2015. We expect performance to be stronger in 2016. Additionally, we think enterprise CNS revenue performance will be firmly better than the 7.3% growth we saw for the full year 2015. Latin America wholesale revenue increased 6.9% in 2015, and we expect better performance in 2016.
We also expect that Wholesale Voice and other revenue will decline approximately 10% in 2016. In addition to better revenue growth in 2016, we expect to generate strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Specifically from the adjusted EBITDA starting point of $2.592 billion from 2015, which excludes the 3 quarters of 2015 EBITDA contribution from Venezuela, we expect to grow adjusted EBITDA 9% to 12% for the full year 2016. We expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the full year 2016. From a capital expenditure perspective, we expect to spend about 15% of total revenue on CapEx in 2016 as we invest for future growth.
Additionally, for 2016, we expect our full year income tax rate to average about 30%. That rate can vary significant in any quarter. 
In summary, 2015 was a transitional year for the company as we successfully worked through integrating tw telecom. With our continued investment for organic growth, coupled with our strong operating leverage, we are well positioned to drive better top line performance and strong line -- strong bottom line performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As I walk you through our strategy and how we think about the market opportunities, I also want to take a few minutes to provide more detail on our performance last year on the company's 3 key initiatives, starting with the successful integration of tw telecom.
As I noted early last year, we expected 2015 to be a year of transition, with all of the heavy lifting that usually occurs in the first year after a large acquisition. 
To highlight just a couple of examples of our progress here, I'll start with the sales force and sales process. Maintaining an effective sales force was the initial focal point of our integration efforts, because those employees are the closest connection to our customers and drive our growth.
Early in the year, we consolidated accounts and enabled a common, comprehensive customer relationship management system. We then rolled out consistent compensation plans, unified our general management structure and developed and conducted cross-training on the combined company's products. Even with all this change, our 2015 CNS sales were higher than in 2014 for the combined company.
While we have additional work to make the process easier for our sales team, we feel good about where we are and how the actions we've taken set us up for growth this year and in future years. We also combined networks, streamlining our cost structure and capitalizing on our metro and long-haul assets. Again, we have more opportunity and more work to do here, but we believe we have the best global network supported by a deep metro footprint across the United States and growing footprints in EMEA and Latin America.
In addition, we are able to hit our run rate synergy targets much sooner than expected. As the team focused on operational excellence, we know that moving customers on-net and eliminating operational inefficiencies are the best ways to drive a differentiated customer experience. 
Many of you have asked me about the potential revenue synergies associated with the combination of the 2 companies. As I stated before and as we've seen with prior acquisition, the pace and degree of change can be a lot for a sales force to process.
However, as we work through integration throughout the year, we've seen benefits from a revenue perspective. While we've not specifically quantified the dollar impact of revenue synergies, cross-selling and upselling opportunities are a factor for us. I'll give you an example of a customer win from last quarter that demonstrates the power of the combined company. Heritage Home Group, or HHG is a world leader in designing, manufacturing, sourcing and retailing home furnishings. They market their products through a wide range of channels, including their own Thomasville retail stores through interior designers, multiline independent retailers and mass merchant stores. The Heritage Home Group portfolio includes some of the best-known and most respected brands in the furniture industry.
As a tw telecom customer since 2003, HHG historically used a large incumbent telco as their primary provider for their 50 or so locations. Tw telecom was limited in its ability to service many off HHG's domestic and international sites and complex voice needs. 
Additionally, HHG had grown to the point where they required more bandwidth to meet the demands of their business and were looking for a provider who could help with more of their networking needs in all of their sites. 
In the fourth quarter of last year, Level 3 was successful in winning HHG's global WAN and voice business. The selection of Level 3 was based on the larger network, stronger service capabilities and the customer references we offered. 
Additionally, Level 3's Voice Complete solution was much more robust and met their needs better than services available from tw telecom or the incumbents. Finally, our secure access solution enabled HHG to incorporate international sites in a way that was not previously possible. 
As a combined company, we went from supporting 5 sites to now supporting 50 sites and have added products, such as global managed services -- global managed security that were not available through standalone tw telecom. 
As a reminder, we occasionally win large multisite deals with brand new customers. Our typical approach is to begin customer relationship exactly like we did with HHG. We generally start with a single product in a few locations. After we demonstrate our performance, we can then grow substantially in the number of locations and services we provide to meet their complex networking needs.
Moving to an update on EMEA. 2015 was also a year of transition for that region. The telecommunications market in EMEA is sizable, nearly as large as the U.S. market, yet our market share in the region is much lower. While we have a nice business in the United Kingdom, we did not have the right go-to-market strategy or sales structure to take advantage of the opportunity on the continent or drive even better penetration in the U.K. Over the last year, we built a very talented leadership team to ensure we aggressively attack the market. We've concentrated our focus on 4 primarily markets: the U.K., Germany, France and Benelux and have implemented a disciplined sales and investment process to enable profitable growth in that region.
Additionally, our global ethernet and Voice Complete products will be fully available in the region by the end of the first quarter. We made good progress in 2015. After several years of declining revenue in EMEA, revenue was essentially flat last year. For 2016, excluding U.K. government, we expect EMEA CNS revenue to grow on a constant currency basis. We do believe we can benefit from additional scale in the region and are actively investing to expand our growth opportunities.
Turning to our initiatives, position Level 3 for future growth. Our strategy to be the premier provider of global communication services, focused on the enterprise networking market has 2 key components: to develop the capabilities of our customers need and to do so over an efficient, unified global platform. In the past, customers thought of the network as a noun. It was a thing that they used to tie their internal systems together in a few locations. Today, our customers know that network is actually a verb. It's not a thing. Network is an action. How well they network with their customers, their suppliers, their employees and even the equipment they use, determines how effectively they can empower and drive their businesses forward.
With the rapid deployment of cloud services and the growth of the Internet of Things, customers know that how the network drives efficiencies, new products and entire new business models. With respect to the Internet of Things, it's important to note that many of the things are already there. It's the connectivity to those things and the ability to network those things that is rapidly evolving. Air handlers in the manufacturing facility or infusion pumps in a hospital room already exist. What would be different is the ability to efficiently network those devices and integrate them into the performance of the company.
Networking is at the center of many of the technology transitions that are underway, whether it is the need for heightened security capabilities, increasing demand to connect globally, the migration to the cloud or the delivery of over-the-top content, customers know that the network is a physical asset they use to move their data around, but it is really the action of networking that drives their success. As a result, they turn to Level 3. With our focus on enterprise networking, we are not distracted by wireless, consumer services or other initiatives. We are solely focused on meeting our customers' ever-expanding demands for capacity and networking services. 
While just buzzwords for many, software-defined networking and network function virtualization, or SDN and NFV are actually built into the capabilities we deliver and help our customers with their networking requirements. Our Adaptive Network Control and Cloud Connect Solutions products allow enterprises to dynamically adjust bandwidth, as they move computing resources from their own data center to an outsourced data center or to a cloud service provider. They are no longer limited in their operations by inflexible networks or the inherent insecurity of the public Internet.
Let me give you some examples of how our customers are using our capabilities today. Big data analytics. Big data is driving the need for more bandwidth to the cloud. Our customers who are leveraging big data tools in the cloud, need to create connections to enable their data analysis. These customers require temporary increase in bandwidth to move terabytes of data and then return to normal volumes for everyday use. We have recently enabled this type of application for our customers in genome sequencing, biopharma, higher ed research and oil and gas exploration, to name a few. 
Project-oriented IT. Many organizations need to deploy application environments for a discrete period of time, but they still want the security and performance delivered with private connectivity. Think of the upcoming presidential race or tax season. Using remote data centers or cloud service providers, organizations can spin up the IT resources to support these applications needed for a short periods of time. Our Adaptive Network Control capabilities can then be used to allow the network to match the agility of cloud resources, scaling the network resources on-demand to support their application.
By continuing to build into more data centers and more cloud service providers across the globe, Level 3 remains one of the best connected communications companies to leading cloud providers. Those connections, coupled with Adaptive Network Control, create a networking environment that matches the flexibility of a cloud environment and allows customers to more effectively utilize cloud resource. We see this as a key opportunity, and we'll continue to invest in both our capabilities and expanding our connectivity to those providers.
From a net revenue perspective, our goal is to drive 8% year-over-year CNS enterprise growth. We have several levers to help us meet this goal, including continuing to grow our sales force and sales supports teams, further developing our products and service offerings to meet the needs of the market and investing to expand our network. We're not quite there yet, but this remains our objective. And as a company and a management team, we are working toward accelerating revenue growth through these and other initiatives.
Before we open it up for your questions, I'd like to take one minute and talk about how we think about capital allocation going forward. As Sunit noted, we expect to generate between $1 billion and $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2016. As a result of our performance, we are certainly in a different position with regard to our degrees of freedom with cash than we have been at any other time in the history of the company. We firmly believe that putting excess cash to work is accretive to stockholder value.
As we've indicated, we are a growth company, and therefore, our top priority is investing in the business. In 2016, we will continue to invest around 15% of total revenue in capital expenditures. Even with that level of investment, we'll be generating more cash than we can use organically. That brings me to our second priority. As our market share is low in a consolidating industry, we will continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities, whether to grow our market share or expand our capabilities. We believe we've demonstrated a strong track record over the past few years, delivering value to stockholders through our disciplined acquisition strategy and integration execution.
At some point and in the absence of the opportunities put cash toward to drive growth and fulfill our long-term strategy, returning capital to stockholders is an appropriate consideration. 
Keeping in mind that 2015 was only the second year we generated substantial free cash flow, we will continue to be very disciplined in our efforts to drive revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA growth and consistent growth in free cash flow per share. All of our capital allocation decisions are evaluated through the lens of providing the best return for our stockholders.
With that, we will open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process."

And then as part of that, it does look at least in our model that you could very well be at the low end, if not below, 3 turns of leverage, whether it's at the end of '16 or maybe early '17, which if I'm not mistaken could actually make you possible or give you an option to be investment-grade. How important is it for Level 3 in your business model to be investment-grade? Is that something that you guys aspire to or would actually look to go below 3 turns to achieve over the long term?"

So we think that's the right level for us, that's why we said the low end of 3 to 4x. With respect to your question on when in 2016, I mean, just to further expand on what Jeff said, I mean, if you look at our returns over the last 5 years, our compounded annual return on our stock price has been 30%. A big reason for that has been the 2 big M&A deals we did, Global Crossing and tw. And so we think that successful M&A has been a key part of that and will continue to be a part of that. Not to mention that expanding our market share is important but also all these acquisitions have really improved our competitive and strategic position and the durability of the growth and the returns we can provide over time. So I think, just expanding on that, that'll continue to be our focus. I think, if we come to some point late in the year where we figure out we have not been successful -- and as Jeff said, our goal is to maximize or optimize free cash flow per share over the long term. So I think there's no specific time line at this point, but I just want to remind everyone that reason why the returns have been the way they have in the last 5 years is been M&A driven besides just organic growth."

But just want to see what your comfort level is with the ability to hit 8% in North American enterprise for '16. And then just secondly, on the synergies side. Obviously, I mean, I think that's really ramped up significantly in the last couple of quarters. Maybe you could walk us through a bit where that's coming from? Why you've been able to exceed? What area you've been able to exceed not only your near-term target but what was your total target. And if I'm not mistaken, you're not at the Network Access target that you set out initially.

So I'll start with the North America enterprise. As we said, the growth will be comparable to last year, which was 7.4% -- 7.6%.

As we said, the growth will be comparable to last year, which was 7.4% -- 7.6%. So I think that if you were to look at the underlying run rate, excluding the 0.5% or so benefit we got from one-time install revenue in 2015, that we don't expect to incur in '16. From an underlying perspective, we are -- we're close to sort of the 8% growth rate. Now obviously, as we report over the course of the year because of that install revenue in 2015, that impacts the growth rate by 0.5%. That's why we said it'd be comparable to the performance we saw in 2015. Now as Jeff pointed out, our goal is firmly to be at 8%. So we're going to work hard over the course of the year to make the investments to do that. But I think the guidance we provided is the best insight we have at this point in time. On the synergy side, I think, as you've seen from the schedule we provided, all the favorability has come from the operating expense side. I think some of the key areas that drove that, one was on nonheadcount-related expenses. We worked very hard with all our suppliers, whether it's equipment suppliers, the charges, maintenance fees, utility costs to drive efficiency initiatives, so it's a combination of synergies and efficiencies on the nonheadcount side. We also, I think, gained a fair bit of benefit from the headcount side, which was a tough and delicate balance to achieve, while at the same time, we had a heavy integration load and we still have some integration to go. So I think -- so it was a combination of nonheadcount- and headcount-related expenses. And we got a fair bit of benefit on the capital expenditure side that we haven't talked about here but we mentioned last year. We negotiated with our suppliers to put that in place, have those savings in place right at the beginning of last year. So it actually had the effect of increasing our investment compared to what the standalone companies were investing in '14 just because we have better pricing. Finally, your questions on Network Access expenses. Yes, we haven't -- that hasn't worked out as well as we thought. We -- but remember, our ultimate target was about $110 million that we didn't expect to achieve until closer to the end of this year. So as we -- as I said in my remarks, we'll continue to optimize that. It gets tougher and tougher to report that separately as synergies, but you will see that in our network expense margins going forward."

If you want to tie 2 locally located data centers together, dark fiber is a good solution for that. If you want to tie 2 data centers across the country together, our 100 gig laid products are good solutions for that. If you want to tie a data center to a branch office, our IP VPN products are good for that. And so we look at that overall comprehensive portfolio and recognize that our customers have very -- a variety of different networking challenges that they are trying to solve. And so we match our technologies. We don't -- we're not limited to just CDN, we're not limited to just Internet. We match our technologies and our solutions to their working needs, and so we think that's a strong capability that we offer versus most of our competitors. With respect to M&A, we are very pleased with our footprint, but we want to continue to expand our footprint, both in depth and in geography. So if you look at EMEA for example, I mentioned that we are focused on expanding in 4 key markets. That means going richer and deeper in fiber in the U.K. but also richer and deeper in fiber in Germany, France and Benelux.

So we are benefiting from all kinds of drivers, whether it's from the enterprise side directly or content, it is a big driver of our growth there. So it's just a demand backdrop for bandwidth is what's driving it. So we do expect better performance in LATAM on a constant currency basis."

And so we'll continue to partner, we'll continue to build to them. The other thing that we're trying to do is change and we are doing is changing the way networks operate, so that the enterprise customers can take advantage of those resources more effectively. Historically, networks have been very inflexible. You build up capacity, you nail that capacity up and it just stays there and that's all you have. We have changed with our Adaptive Network Control capabilities and our Cloud Connect Solutions products. We have changed that dynamic and are creating flexible networks that allow enterprise customers to more effectively utilize those cloud environments and access those different pools of demand with very flexible network design. So we'll continue to partner with them and continue to focus on making sure that Level 3 is the most connected and the best equipped to take advantage of that for our customers.
Thank you. With that, I'd like to close the call with just a few thoughts. As evidenced by our continued growth in market share, our strategy to position Level 3 as the premier provider of global communication services is working. We believe we're at the intersection of the best network, the best people and the right market opportunity to continue to grow. The ability to generate significant free cash flow is evident in our performance last year and our expectation for 2016 and remains a focus for the business through continued profitable growth. We remain focused on our enterprise networking customers and on providing a differentiated customer experience. 
Lastly, I'd like to thank our dedicated employees around the globe for their significant contributions in 2015. They are the engine that drives Level 3. As always, thank you for joining today's call. Thank you for your questions and for your support of Level 3.

In 2015, we met or exceeded our key outlook measures for the year. Even with integration, global currency pressures driven by macroeconomic headwinds and the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary last quarter, we had good momentum, which drove revenue, adjusted EBITDA growth and profit performance for the year. We also delivered strong free cash flow and set the stage for continued strong growth in 2016. Looking forward, we are building on this foundation, investing in the business and continue to be disciplined in managing our costs as we maintain our focus on profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 3 for a summary of our performance in 2015. Our Core Network Services, or CNS revenue for the full year 2015, grew 5.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. For the full year, total enterprise CNS grew 7.2% and North America enterprise CNS grew 7.6%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 16% for the full year 2015, in line with our recent outlook of 15% to 17%. From a free cash flow perspective, we finished above the range of our outlook of $600 million to $650 million for the year by generating $658 million in 2015. 
Free cash flow excludes $32 million of accelerated cash interest expense payments related to a refinancing that took place after reporting third quarter earnings. We refinanced $4.9 billion of debt during 2015, resulting in over $110 million of annualized cash interest expense savings. Additionally, we continue to lower our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is now at 3.8x. 
Finally from a synergy perspective, as of the end of the fourth quarter 2015, we achieved approximately $216 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the close of the tw telecom transaction. This exceeds our original synergy expectations to achieve $140 million by the end of the first quarter 2016 and $200 million in total.
Turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter 2015, CNS revenue grew 4.4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% on a an as-reported basis. As we saw throughout 2015, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affected our reported growth rates. For the full year, CNS revenue grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis but 2.9% on an as-reported basis. At the end of the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar represented 90% of total revenue; the British pound represented 4%; the euro, 3%; and the Brazilian real, 2%. All other currencies are included in the remaining 1%.
I'd like to move now to a discussion of revenue on a regional basis. North America CNS revenue grew 5.9% for the full year. For the fourth quarter 2015, from an enterprise perspective, CNS revenue grew 6.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 1.5% on a sequential basis, following the particularly strong results in the third quarter of 2015, where our sequential growth was 2.7%. Adjusting for that, our North America enterprise business is at a 2% sequential growth base over the last 2 quarters.
For the full year 2015, EMEA CNS revenue was relatively flat on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, EMEA CNS revenue increased 0.7% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.1% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.5% on a constant currency basis and remained flat on an as-reported basis. While enterprise revenue growth was a little slower than the results we have seen in prior quarters, it was primarily a result of the unusual strength in enterprise CNS revenue from the fourth quarter 2014.
Sequentially, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 2.2%. Also, CNS revenue declined 0.3% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an as-reported basis. U.K. government CNS revenue decreased 7.9% on a constant currency basis and 10.7% on an as-reported basis. In Latin America, for the full year, CNS revenue grew 7.2% on a constant currency basis, while the fourth quarter, Latin America CNS revenue grew 8.4% on a constant currency basis and declined 6.4% on an as-reported basis. 
Enterprise CNS in Latin America grew 9.5% on a constant currency basis and declined 6.7% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue increased 4.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 5.4% on an as-reported basis. 
Our revenue mix can be found on Slide 5, with North America representing the bulk of our CNS revenue at 81%, followed by EMEA at 11% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 73% of CNS revenue while wholesale customers make up the remaining 27%.
Turning to Slide 6. Revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 8.2% and continues to drive the company's growth, led by growth in VPN and managed services. Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year, but grew 7.9% on a sequential basis. Transport and fiber grew 1.8%, driven by wavelengths and professional services. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 10% year-over-year. Colocation and datacenter services grew 3.9% and voice services declined by 0.5%.
Over the course of 2015, we saw little change in the overall pricing environment within our products or regions. For 2016, we remain focused on assessing the pricing landscape, and we'll continue to take a market-by-market approach to pricing solutions looking at particular geographies, products, verticals as well as other factors and maintaining our focus on profitable growth. One of the things we were very focused on in 2015 and will continue to be focused on this year is sales production on bookings and sales productivity.
In 2015, total sales production improved over 2014, and sales productivity grew significantly. For the fourth quarter 2015, CNS sales production grew nicely compared to the fourth quarter 2014. 
Moving to Slide 8. When we initially provided outlook for adjusted EBITDA 1 year ago, we expected growth of 12% to 16%. In the third quarter, we updated that outlook to 15% to 17%. We finished the full year 2015 growing adjusted EBITDA 16% to $2.638 billion. Keep in mind, this is after that the deconsolidation of Venezuela and some significant currency headwinds, all during in integration year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses, was 33.2% for the fourth quarter 2015. For the full year, including integration-related expenses, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin by more than 400 basis points from 28% to 32.1%. We are confident in our ability to expand margins over time as we grow high-margin CNS revenue and optimize costs across the business. 
Moving to synergies on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, at the end of the fourth quarter, we had the achieved a $216 million of annualized run rate savings, exceeding our overalls $200 million synergy target ahead of schedule.
As we continue to streamline our cost structure, we expect to continue to optimize network expense. As we've reached our $200 million target, we will not be providing additional updates around future synergies. 
On Slide 10. We delivered strong free cash flow for the full year 2015 of $658 million. This excludes the accelerated cash interest payments of $32 million related to capital markets activity in the fourth quarter 2015 and completed after third quarter earnings, driving cash interest expense higher in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. We exited the year with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3.8x. This compares to 4.4x at the end of 2014. Over the last decade, our target leverage range has been 3 to 5x. We are now narrowing our target leverage range to 3.4x and remain focused on getting to the low end of that range.
Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to outline our business outlook for 2016, which is also provided in this morning's press release. From a revenue growth perspective, all of my remarks are on a constant currency and a year-over-year basis. 
In 2015, total revenue grew 3.7%. Excluding U.K. government, total CNS revenue grew 5.5%, and enterprise CNS revenue grew 7.4%. 
For 2016, we expect total revenue growth to be higher. We also expect total CNS and enterprise CNS revenue growth, excluding U.K. government revenue, to be stronger in 2016 compared to 2015. We expect total wholesale CNS revenue growth for the full year 2016 to be up slightly compared to the full year 2015. 
In North America, we expect total CNS and enterprise CNS revenue growth for the full year to be comparable to the 5.9% and 7.6% growth, respectively we saw in 2015. To put that in perspective, enterprise CNS growth is expected to be quite a bit higher than the 6.1% growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Also, keep in mind that the one-time installed revenue in 2015 that won't recur in 2016 is about 0.5% of North America enterprise CNS revenue in 2015. Adjusting for that, our North America enterprise revenue growth is expected to be higher in 2016 compared to 2015. 
As a reminder, our goal is to grow overall enterprise CNS 8% on a year-over-year basis. We also expect wholesale CNS revenue in North America to grow slightly in 2016. In EMEA, we expect total CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, to grow in 2016.
For 2015, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, increased 5.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect comparable performance in 2016. EMEA wholesale revenue declined 7% in 2015 on a constant currency basis, and we expect a slight decline in 2016. 
From a U.K. government perspective, we anticipate an approximate 30% decline as our contract with HMRC expired in January. Our LATAM CNS revenues grew 7.2% in 2015. We expect performance to be stronger in 2016. Additionally, we think enterprise CNS revenue performance will be firmly better than the 7.3% growth we saw for the full year 2015. Latin America wholesale revenue increased 6.9% in 2015, and we expect better performance in 2016.
We also expect that Wholesale Voice and other revenue will decline approximately 10% in 2016. In addition to better revenue growth in 2016, we expect to generate strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Specifically from the adjusted EBITDA starting point of $2.592 billion from 2015, which excludes the 3 quarters of 2015 EBITDA contribution from Venezuela, we expect to grow adjusted EBITDA 9% to 12% for the full year 2016. We expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the full year 2016. From a capital expenditure perspective, we expect to spend about 15% of total revenue on CapEx in 2016 as we invest for future growth.
Additionally, for 2016, we expect our full year income tax rate to average about 30%. That rate can vary significant in any quarter. 
In summary, 2015 was a transitional year for the company as we successfully worked through integrating tw telecom. With our continued investment for organic growth, coupled with our strong operating leverage, we are well positioned to drive better top line performance and strong line -- strong bottom line performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As I walk you through our strategy and how we think about the market opportunities, I also want to take a few minutes to provide more detail on our performance last year on the company's 3 key initiatives, starting with the successful integration of tw telecom.
As I noted early last year, we expected 2015 to be a year of transition, with all of the heavy lifting that usually occurs in the first year after a large acquisition. 
To highlight just a couple of examples of our progress here, I'll start with the sales force and sales process. Maintaining an effective sales force was the initial focal point of our integration efforts, because those employees are the closest connection to our customers and drive our growth.
Early in the year, we consolidated accounts and enabled a common, comprehensive customer relationship management system. We then rolled out consistent compensation plans, unified our general management structure and developed and conducted cross-training on the combined company's products. Even with all this change, our 2015 CNS sales were higher than in 2014 for the combined company.
While we have additional work to make the process easier for our sales team, we feel good about where we are and how the actions we've taken set us up for growth this year and in future years. We also combined networks, streamlining our cost structure and capitalizing on our metro and long-haul assets. Again, we have more opportunity and more work to do here, but we believe we have the best global network supported by a deep metro footprint across the United States and growing footprints in EMEA and Latin America.
In addition, we are able to hit our run rate synergy targets much sooner than expected. As the team focused on operational excellence, we know that moving customers on-net and eliminating operational inefficiencies are the best ways to drive a differentiated customer experience. 
Many of you have asked me about the potential revenue synergies associated with the combination of the 2 companies. As I stated before and as we've seen with prior acquisition, the pace and degree of change can be a lot for a sales force to process.
However, as we work through integration throughout the year, we've seen benefits from a revenue perspective. While we've not specifically quantified the dollar impact of revenue synergies, cross-selling and upselling opportunities are a factor for us. I'll give you an example of a customer win from last quarter that demonstrates the power of the combined company. Heritage Home Group, or HHG is a world leader in designing, manufacturing, sourcing and retailing home furnishings. They market their products through a wide range of channels, including their own Thomasville retail stores through interior designers, multiline independent retailers and mass merchant stores. The Heritage Home Group portfolio includes some of the best-known and most respected brands in the furniture industry.
As a tw telecom customer since 2003, HHG historically used a large incumbent telco as their primary provider for their 50 or so locations. Tw telecom was limited in its ability to service many off HHG's domestic and international sites and complex voice needs. 
Additionally, HHG had grown to the point where they required more bandwidth to meet the demands of their business and were looking for a provider who could help with more of their networking needs in all of their sites. 
In the fourth quarter of last year, Level 3 was successful in winning HHG's global WAN and voice business. The selection of Level 3 was based on the larger network, stronger service capabilities and the customer references we offered. 
Additionally, Level 3's Voice Complete solution was much more robust and met their needs better than services available from tw telecom or the incumbents. Finally, our secure access solution enabled HHG to incorporate international sites in a way that was not previously possible. 
As a combined company, we went from supporting 5 sites to now supporting 50 sites and have added products, such as global managed services -- global managed security that were not available through standalone tw telecom. 
As a reminder, we occasionally win large multisite deals with brand new customers. Our typical approach is to begin customer relationship exactly like we did with HHG. We generally start with a single product in a few locations. After we demonstrate our performance, we can then grow substantially in the number of locations and services we provide to meet their complex networking needs.
Moving to an update on EMEA. 2015 was also a year of transition for that region. The telecommunications market in EMEA is sizable, nearly as large as the U.S. market, yet our market share in the region is much lower. While we have a nice business in the United Kingdom, we did not have the right go-to-market strategy or sales structure to take advantage of the opportunity on the continent or drive even better penetration in the U.K. Over the last year, we built a very talented leadership team to ensure we aggressively attack the market. We've concentrated our focus on 4 primarily markets: the U.K., Germany, France and Benelux and have implemented a disciplined sales and investment process to enable profitable growth in that region.
Additionally, our global ethernet and Voice Complete products will be fully available in the region by the end of the first quarter. We made good progress in 2015. After several years of declining revenue in EMEA, revenue was essentially flat last year. For 2016, excluding U.K. government, we expect EMEA CNS revenue to grow on a constant currency basis. We do believe we can benefit from additional scale in the region and are actively investing to expand our growth opportunities.
Turning to our initiatives, position Level 3 for future growth. Our strategy to be the premier provider of global communication services, focused on the enterprise networking market has 2 key components: to develop the capabilities of our customers need and to do so over an efficient, unified global platform. In the past, customers thought of the network as a noun. It was a thing that they used to tie their internal systems together in a few locations. Today, our customers know that network is actually a verb. It's not a thing. Network is an action. How well they network with their customers, their suppliers, their employees and even the equipment they use, determines how effectively they can empower and drive their businesses forward.
With the rapid deployment of cloud services and the growth of the Internet of Things, customers know that how the network drives efficiencies, new products and entire new business models. With respect to the Internet of Things, it's important to note that many of the things are already there. It's the connectivity to those things and the ability to network those things that is rapidly evolving. Air handlers in the manufacturing facility or infusion pumps in a hospital room already exist. What would be different is the ability to efficiently network those devices and integrate them into the performance of the company.
Networking is at the center of many of the technology transitions that are underway, whether it is the need for heightened security capabilities, increasing demand to connect globally, the migration to the cloud or the delivery of over-the-top content, customers know that the network is a physical asset they use to move their data around, but it is really the action of networking that drives their success. As a result, they turn to Level 3. With our focus on enterprise networking, we are not distracted by wireless, consumer services or other initiatives. We are solely focused on meeting our customers' ever-expanding demands for capacity and networking services. 
While just buzzwords for many, software-defined networking and network function virtualization, or SDN and NFV are actually built into the capabilities we deliver and help our customers with their networking requirements. Our Adaptive Network Control and Cloud Connect Solutions products allow enterprises to dynamically adjust bandwidth, as they move computing resources from their own data center to an outsourced data center or to a cloud service provider. They are no longer limited in their operations by inflexible networks or the inherent insecurity of the public Internet.
Let me give you some examples of how our customers are using our capabilities today. Big data analytics. Big data is driving the need for more bandwidth to the cloud. Our customers who are leveraging big data tools in the cloud, need to create connections to enable their data analysis. These customers require temporary increase in bandwidth to move terabytes of data and then return to normal volumes for everyday use. We have recently enabled this type of application for our customers in genome sequencing, biopharma, higher ed research and oil and gas exploration, to name a few. 
Project-oriented IT. Many organizations need to deploy application environments for a discrete period of time, but they still want the security and performance delivered with private connectivity. Think of the upcoming presidential race or tax season. Using remote data centers or cloud service providers, organizations can spin up the IT resources to support these applications needed for a short periods of time. Our Adaptive Network Control capabilities can then be used to allow the network to match the agility of cloud resources, scaling the network resources on-demand to support their application.
By continuing to build into more data centers and more cloud service providers across the globe, Level 3 remains one of the best connected communications companies to leading cloud providers. Those connections, coupled with Adaptive Network Control, create a networking environment that matches the flexibility of a cloud environment and allows customers to more effectively utilize cloud resource. We see this as a key opportunity, and we'll continue to invest in both our capabilities and expanding our connectivity to those providers.
From a net revenue perspective, our goal is to drive 8% year-over-year CNS enterprise growth. We have several levers to help us meet this goal, including continuing to grow our sales force and sales supports teams, further developing our products and service offerings to meet the needs of the market and investing to expand our network. We're not quite there yet, but this remains our objective. And as a company and a management team, we are working toward accelerating revenue growth through these and other initiatives.
Before we open it up for your questions, I'd like to take one minute and talk about how we think about capital allocation going forward. As Sunit noted, we expect to generate between $1 billion and $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2016. As a result of our performance, we are certainly in a different position with regard to our degrees of freedom with cash than we have been at any other time in the history of the company. We firmly believe that putting excess cash to work is accretive to stockholder value.
As we've indicated, we are a growth company, and therefore, our top priority is investing in the business. In 2016, we will continue to invest around 15% of total revenue in capital expenditures. Even with that level of investment, we'll be generating more cash than we can use organically. That brings me to our second priority. As our market share is low in a consolidating industry, we will continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities, whether to grow our market share or expand our capabilities. We believe we've demonstrated a strong track record over the past few years, delivering value to stockholders through our disciplined acquisition strategy and integration execution.
At some point and in the absence of the opportunities put cash toward to drive growth and fulfill our long-term strategy, returning capital to stockholders is an appropriate consideration. 
Keeping in mind that 2015 was only the second year we generated substantial free cash flow, we will continue to be very disciplined in our efforts to drive revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA growth and consistent growth in free cash flow per share. All of our capital allocation decisions are evaluated through the lens of providing the best return for our stockholders.
With that, we will open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process."

I guess, Jeff just on that last point you made there, how important is it to the management team to the board to have potentially a buyback plan simply in place this year, so that if -- as we go through the course of the year, you haven't been successful in finding a deal that makes sense for you, and ultimately, you had this cash building and you're not deploying it as aggressively through M&A as you might have anticipated or wanted to. And then as part of that, it does look at least in our model that you could very well be at the low end, if not below, 3 turns of leverage, whether it's at the end of '16 or maybe early '17, which if I'm not mistaken could actually make you possible or give you an option to be investment-grade. How important is it for Level 3 in your business model to be investment-grade? Is that something that you guys aspire to or would actually look to go below 3 turns to achieve over the long term?"

So we think that's the right level for us, that's why we said the low end of 3 to 4x. With respect to your question on when in 2016, I mean, just to further expand on what Jeff said, I mean, if you look at our returns over the last 5 years, our compounded annual return on our stock price has been 30%. A big reason for that has been the 2 big M&A deals we did, Global Crossing and tw. And so we think that successful M&A has been a key part of that and will continue to be a part of that. Not to mention that expanding our market share is important but also all these acquisitions have really improved our competitive and strategic position and the durability of the growth and the returns we can provide over time. So I think, just expanding on that, that'll continue to be our focus. I think, if we come to some point late in the year where we figure out we have not been successful -- and as Jeff said, our goal is to maximize or optimize free cash flow per share over the long term. So I think there's no specific time line at this point, but I just want to remind everyone that reason why the returns have been the way they have in the last 5 years is been M&A driven besides just organic growth."

On the North American enterprise guidance, I just want to make sure you understand, it sounds like you still feel very comfortable with sort of the 8% target range on there. But perhaps 2016 would be impacted by the fact that you had some one-time benefits that came in 2015 that might impact the growth. But just want to see what your comfort level is with the ability to hit 8% in North American enterprise for '16. And then just secondly, on the synergies side. Obviously, I mean, I think that's really ramped up significantly in the last couple of quarters. Maybe you could walk us through a bit where that's coming from? Why you've been able to exceed? What area you've been able to exceed not only your near-term target but what was your total target. And if I'm not mistaken, you're not at the Network Access target that you set out initially. Is there still more synergies to come particularly in the Network Access side?"

So I'll start with the North America enterprise. As we said, the growth will be comparable to last year, which was 7.4% -- 7.6%.

As we said, the growth will be comparable to last year, which was 7.4% -- 7.6%. So I think that if you were to look at the underlying run rate, excluding the 0.5% or so benefit we got from one-time install revenue in 2015, that we don't expect to incur in '16. From an underlying perspective, we are -- we're close to sort of the 8% growth rate. Now obviously, as we report over the course of the year because of that install revenue in 2015, that impacts the growth rate by 0.5%. That's why we said it'd be comparable to the performance we saw in 2015. Now as Jeff pointed out, our goal is firmly to be at 8%. So we're going to work hard over the course of the year to make the investments to do that. But I think the guidance we provided is the best insight we have at this point in time. On the synergy side, I think, as you've seen from the schedule we provided, all the favorability has come from the operating expense side. I think some of the key areas that drove that, one was on nonheadcount-related expenses. We worked very hard with all our suppliers, whether it's equipment suppliers, the charges, maintenance fees, utility costs to drive efficiency initiatives, so it's a combination of synergies and efficiencies on the nonheadcount side. We also, I think, gained a fair bit of benefit from the headcount side, which was a tough and delicate balance to achieve, while at the same time, we had a heavy integration load and we still have some integration to go. So I think -- so it was a combination of nonheadcount- and headcount-related expenses. And we got a fair bit of benefit on the capital expenditure side that we haven't talked about here but we mentioned last year. We negotiated with our suppliers to put that in place, have those savings in place right at the beginning of last year. So it actually had the effect of increasing our investment compared to what the standalone companies were investing in '14 just because we have better pricing. Finally, your questions on Network Access expenses. Yes, we haven't -- that hasn't worked out as well as we thought. We -- but remember, our ultimate target was about $110 million that we didn't expect to achieve until closer to the end of this year. So as we -- as I said in my remarks, we'll continue to optimize that. It gets tougher and tougher to report that separately as synergies, but you will see that in our network expense margins going forward."

If you want to tie a data center to a branch office, our IP VPN products are good for that.

With respect to M&A, we are very pleased with our footprint, but we want to continue to expand our footprint, both in depth and in geography. So if you look at EMEA for example, I mentioned that we are focused on expanding in 4 key markets. That means going richer and deeper in fiber in the U.K. but also richer and deeper in fiber in Germany, France and Benelux.

We're able to layer on security services, CDN services, managed services, professional services on top of that to help our customers do the migrations in technology and the transitions in technologies that they have to do. We've made great progress in the integration of tw telecom, and we have an excellent workforce across the globe, focused on making Level 3 the best provider. And then we have a market that's moving toward our capabilities, not away from our capabilities. Customers need the types of services that Level 3 is offering. The need for that is continuing to grow. They are operating in very complicated environments with many external threats with technology changes that they have to implement within their businesses, with new business opportunities and other things coming from things like Internet of Things and opportunities to increase the flexibility of their network with technologies like SDN and NSV. And so we think we're at a great intersection between where the network is, where the customers are going and our capabilities to deliver that based on the work that we've done over the last year."

In terms of the components, as we've said in the past, most of our capital expenditure is success based driven by customer contracts. About $300 million to $350 million is what we have described as sort of maintenance upgrade-type CapEx. The rest is expansion CapEx. The thrust of the expansion capital this year will be some of the things that Jeff mentioned, which is expanding our network footprint, both deeper within existing geographies and in new geographies. I think that'll be a big chunk. We are spending capital for data centers on a select basis in different -- in some regions. We are spending capital for upgrading or putting in more capacity on our subsea systems. We are investing capital on long-haul dark fiber outs where needed. So these are several different areas that we're investing capital. The other area we're going to be investing more capital is an area we cited earlier, the security business we talked about. We're going to continue to put more capital in that area. But, Jeff, I don't know if you're going to add to any of those areas [indiscernible] key things."

But in addition to your point, to tie in new buildings in any particular customer proposal we are going for, our cost to get to that is generally lower than other providers just because of the depth and capillarity of our network. So -- and the other key point there is because we operate in the number of geographies we do, more often than not, when a customer has a need, we can get to the more of their locations on that than our competitors do, which is why, one of the reasons we talked about acquisitions is that not only do they give you synergies and accretive free cash flow per share, but actually improve your competitive and strategic positon and the durability or the advantage that you have vis-à-vis your competition."

And so we are connecting to them and building to them very consistently and are the -- I'd argue are the best connected globally to many of those types of companies. And so we'll continue to partner, we'll continue to build to them. The other thing that we're trying to do is change and we are doing is changing the way networks operate, so that the enterprise customers can take advantage of those resources more effectively. Historically, networks have been very inflexible. You build up capacity, you nail that capacity up and it just stays there and that's all you have. We have changed with our Adaptive Network Control capabilities and our Cloud Connect Solutions products. We have changed that dynamic and are creating flexible networks that allow enterprise customers to more effectively utilize those cloud environments and access those different pools of demand with very flexible network design. So we'll continue to partner with them and continue to focus on making sure that Level 3 is the most connected and the best equipped to take advantage of that for our customers.
Thank you. With that, I'd like to close the call with just a few thoughts. As evidenced by our continued growth in market share, our strategy to position Level 3 as the premier provider of global communication services is working. We believe we're at the intersection of the best network, the best people and the right market opportunity to continue to grow. The ability to generate significant free cash flow is evident in our performance last year and our expectation for 2016 and remains a focus for the business through continued profitable growth. We remain focused on our enterprise networking customers and on providing a differentiated customer experience.

Before we get into our results this morning, I'd like to start out on a personal note. As most of you know, I'm recently back from medical leave following heart surgery. The surgery and my recovery have gone extremely well, and I'm very excited to be back at work, but I wanted to expect my thanks to the kind wishes I received from so many people on this call. Your cards, notes and words of support were very meaningful to me, and I greatly appreciate it. 
I'd also like to mention the outpouring of support I received from Level 3 employees. I mentioned a number of times before the outstanding employees we have, but as I was thinking about this call, I wanted to take the opportunity to really illustrate the point. 
One of the things that touched me most during my absence was literally thousands of notes and e-mails I received from employees. Of course, they wished me well, hoping for a speedy recovery and a complete recovery, but there were also many notes that expressed another thought. Many employees said things like, ""Jeff, while you're out, don't worry about Level 3. We've got this."" Or they said, ""Jeff, you focus on recovery, we'll focus on driving the business."" 
I think those notes really demonstrate something that I've known for a long time. The strength of Level 3 is our employees. We care about each other. We support each other. We take ownership of our own responsibilities that happily take on more to support a coworker in need. Ultimately, each of our employees are individually and personally committed to the success of the company. I really like to thank them for their support and all they do to drive Level 3 forward. 
I'd also like to thank Sunit for serving as interim CEO while I was out as well as the entire leadership team for keeping the business on track and executing against our strategy. It's gratifying to see the strength and depth of the leadership team we have built at the company. 
In fact, the focus by the entire team on profitable growth is evident in our first quarter results with expanding margins, strong growth and adjusted EBITDA and continued generation of free cash flow. On today's call, we'll have a slight departure from our usual approach. I'll provide a few initial thoughts on our view of the market and the Level 3 strategy. Sunit will provide a first quarter operational update and our detailed financial results. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
With that, I'll now turn to what we're seeing in the market and our strategy, which is designed to both maximize our opportunity for the long term and enable us to take advantage of the current environment. The increasingly digital and increasingly connected world is creating the need for businesses to be fully networked across their operations. At the same time, the compelling economics of the cloud are driving enterprises to include migration to the cloud as a key element of their IT strategy. 
Combined with the proliferation of connected devices and an ever more threatening security landscape for, a hybrid cloud strategy is leading to hybrid networking for many enterprises. These market factors benefit Level 3. Our robust product portfolio and capabilities that range from dark fiber and advanced transport services like 100 gig waves all the way up to CDN and our innovative threat intelligence services position Level 3 well to meet enterprises' complex hybrid networking needs. 
As we look to 2016 and beyond, our strategy is unchanged. We remain focused on operational excellence throughout the business, providing a superior experience to our customers and developing the products and capabilities to meet their evolving needs. 
There are 4 key elements to our strategy. First, focusing on enterprises as the company's growth engine. We've been successful in capturing share of the global enterprise communications market, but our share remains low, and we see a continuing opportunity to grow across all 3 regions. In particular, companies who view the network as fundamental to their business strategy and an enabler of growth in their own businesses are targets for our continued growth. 
Second, continue investing in a comprehensive and evolving product portfolio. As I mentioned, the transformation in the communications industry is underway, and we continue to develop the capabilities we need to solve our customers' needs for growth, efficiency and security. 
Third, expanding our network and building directly to our customers' locations. We believe that having our customers on our network or on-net enables us to provide better network performance and reliability as well as an improved experience for our customers. 
And fourth but certainly not least, providing an excellent customer experience. We are investing in operational excellence to continually improve our customers' interactions with Level 3 across every aspect of the business. 
Central to our strategy is our vision of one that I've discussed before, one set of products that we take to an expanding market, one network to deliver those products globally, one set of operational support systems to enable a differentiated customer experience and one team with the singular goal of making Level 3 the premier provider of enterprise networking services. 
Level 3 is a growth business. As I said on our fourth quarter earnings call, our goal is to achieve 8% year-over-year CNS enterprise revenue growth. While we aren't there yet, as a team, we are working toward accelerating growth. Our strategy and the operating plans that support our strategy are designed to deliver a differentiated customer experience and drive growth. Investing in the key areas of products, network, systems and customer service excellence are priorities for the business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit to discuss the first quarter results. Sunit?"

Jeff, before I start, on behalf of everyone here at Level 3, we are happy you are back. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'll start by covering key areas of focus on operational progress for the first quarter before I get to the financial results. As a company, we continue strive towards operational excellence, and we are executing on many initiatives to drive growth. We are adding to our sales organization and improving sales productivity. We continue to expand the Level 3 network and enhance our products. We are operating well from a bottom line and cash flow perspective and remain focused on driving better top line growth. 
In the first quarter, from a sales perspective, production held steady year-over-year and grew nicely sequentially. Sales productivity continue to increase. We continue to improve our sales model, implementing a unified strategy to ensure consistency across our markets. Our local sales presence and willingness to bring fiber to customer locations have been a differentiator in our success. 
From a headcount perspective, the first quarter is typically when we see a higher level of churn from our quota-bearing headcount. During the first quarter of this year, we held quota-bearing headcount relatively steady, declining by roughly 10 people in the quarter. At the same time, we added more than 20 specialized nonquota-bearing security and CDN sales representatives to help identify and close opportunities for this growth products. The size of our overall sales organization has increased, and we expect that quota-bearing headcount will grow for the full year. 
During the quarter, we further consolidated our legacy billing systems and are now on a single platform across North America and EMEA. With the consolidation of Latin America into our end state environment later this year, we expect to be on a single global billing platform by the end of the third quarter. 
Additionally, we now have a single customer self-service portal interface across North America and EMEA, with plans to incorporate Latin America in the future. 
From a product perspective, we continue investing to meet the needs of our customers. For example, we continue to strengthen our cloud offering with the introduction of Microsoft Office 365 to our Cloud Connect Solutions ecosystem. In general, we are seeing more secure enterprise connections to the cloud, driving revenue growth. 
Additionally, we were recently named an advanced partner in the AWS partner network, providing network connections to improve enterprise and public sector access to the AWS Cloud computing platform and services. I'd like to note at that Level 3 is connected to more AWS Direct Connect locations globally than any other network service provider. 
Wave length revenue continues to grow, and we are seeing increased adoption of 100 gig wave services. Driven by strong interest from customers, we continue to invest in our security solutions. In February, Level 3 opened its first distributor denial of service or DDoS scrubbing center in LatAm. This addition complements the 8 other scrubbing locations we have across North America, where we have 5; and EMEA, where we have 3. 
During the quarter, in addition to the investments we made to the sales force and our product portfolio, we also continue to expand our on-net billing footprint across all 3 of our regions. 
Turning to our results from a financial perspective. I'd like to start with some highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 4 of our presentation. We grew Core Network Services, or CNS, revenue by 4%. We grew CNS enterprise revenue 6%, grew North America CNS enterprise revenues 6% year-over-year and approximately 2% sequentially. We increased EBITDA by 15% to $710 million and generated strong free cash flow of $213 million. 
Turning to revenue results on Slide 5. As we've seen over the last year, the difference in constant currency and as-reported growth rates can be attributed to the strength of the dollar against many other currencies. As you can see on this slide, we have provided revenue growth rates by region on both a constant currency and an as-reported basis. Overall, total revenue grew 2.3%, and CNS revenue grew 3.6%. Within CNS, enterprise grew 5.7% while wholesale declined 1.4%. 
On a regional basis, we had a solid quarter in North America, highlighted by sequential CNS enterprise revenue growth of about 2%. In the first quarter, EMEA CNS revenue declined 4.9%, and CNS enterprise revenue, excluding U.K. government, declined 0.5%. 
First quarter enterprise sales, excluding U.K. government, were up 20% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. During the quarter, certain large disconnects and the timing of professional services and onetime items pressured revenue growth. 
We have invested in sales and marketing resources in the region, including new sales leaders in France and Germany. Additionally, we've been investing in product capabilities in the region, including CDN, security and Voice Complete, which should help drive revenue growth for the remainder of the year. 
In Latin America, CNS enterprise revenue remained strong, growing 10%. Also, CNS revenue growth was flat due to a few nondisconnects. 
Wholesale Voice Services revenue, or WVS, declined 18% to $104 million in the first quarter of 2016. For the full year, we continue to expect WVS revenue to decline by approximately 10%. As we said last quarter, excluding U.K. government revenue, we generally expect total CNS and CNS enterprise revenue growth to be stronger in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Looking at first quarter results, although EMEA started a bit weaker than expected, we are maintaining our full year 2016 outlook. 
Our revenue mix can be found on Slide 6, with North America representing 82% of our CNS revenue followed by EMEA at 10% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 72% of CNS revenue while wholesale customers make up the remaining 28%. 
Turning to Slide 7 and revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 7.2%. Transport and fiber declined 0.3%. Voice services grew 2.4%, and the colocation and data services revenue declined 0.5%. 
a Few highlights from an individual product perspective include CDN growth of 4%, dark fiber growth of 11% and managed security growth of 46%. From a pricing standpoint, we haven't seen much change over the last several quarters. 
Moving to Slide 8. Network Access margin expanded to 66.2% compared to 64.5% in the first quarter 2015. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven by continued high-margin CNS revenue growth combined with low-margin WVS revenue decline and continued expense savings from network consolidation. 
Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA was $710 million for the first quarter of 2016. This compares to $620 million in the first quarter 2015. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the operating leverage from CNS revenue growth, the full benefit of synergies realized in 2015 and continued initiatives to manage costs. We also continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved to 34.6% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 30.5% in the first quarter 2015. 
The company generated free cash flow of $213 million in the quarter compared to $42 million from the year-ago quarter. After the close of the quarter, the company redeemed $775 million of our 7% senior notes funded by the net proceeds from our 700 -- our new $775 million, 5.25% senior notes which closed during the first quarter. As a result of this transaction, in the second quarter 2016, we expect to recognize a loss before taxes of $40 million or $0.11 in basic earnings per share on the extinguishment and modification of debt. 
We exited the quarter with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7x and are focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4x. In the first quarter of 2016, the company generated net income of $124 million and basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.35 and $0.34, respectively. 
While the effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 43%, we continue to expect our GAAP income tax rate to average about 30% for the full year 2016. The effective tax rate can fluctuate significantly in any quarter for discrete or unusual events. We expect the rate in the second quarter to be in the 15% to 20% range. 
Turning to the business outlook on Slide 10. We remain confident in our performance for the remainder of the year. With our continued focus on profitable revenue growth and strong adjusted EBITDA results in the first quarter 2016, we are increasing our outlook for full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth. We now expect full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 12% compared to our previous outlook of 9% to 12%. 
In addition, we continue to expected generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Additionally, we've lowered our full year interest expense estimates based on our recent capital markets transactions. 
We also updated our noncash compensation estimate for 2016 to $170 million from $130 million as we had underestimated the expenses for employees who will become retirement eligible in 2016 and certain stock trends. 
In summary, we are focused on sales momentum by growing both the sales force and sales productivity. We are driving profitable growth by executing on the investments we made through our network expansion and product portfolio enhancement initiatives. Finally, across the business, we are maintaining financial discipline and driving improved efforts to improve operational excellence and customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Valerie to start the Q&A."

So we might need the people there. On the nonheadcount side, I think we will continue to hold those expenses down pretty tight, maybe even achieve further reductions. And within the Network Access costs, in general, we're looking to make investments to drive more off-net circuit costs on-net but, at the same time, we will have a revenue growth, which will drive the network expense up. So I think that the key is looking at the margins, which should expand a little bit over the course of the year."

So wondering if part of what we saw in the EBITDA side of the equation this quarter was driven by maybe an acceleration in those synergies as opposed to just other cost-cutting activity. And then secondly, just North America enterprise, if you look at the supplementals, it looks like 2.2% constant currencies sequential growth, a good number out of the gate. I think 1Q is historically is a slower quarter, and then we usually see it ramp throughout the year. Sunit, you mentioned bookings were strong and expectations going forward there.

So with respect to North America again as Jeff outlined in his remarks, our goal out there is to grow 8% year-over-year. And so I think back to the sequential performance, the sequential performance is lumpy in any given quarter there, onetime items and various other things involved. So 2% would mean anywhere from 1.5% to 2.5% or 1.5% [indiscernible] to 2.49%. So I think it's tough to really take anything from 1 quarter, but generally, I mean, our goal is to -- if we can achieve approximately 2%, which is 2 plus or minus 0.5 because it is lumpy when you look at sequential, then we should see the year-over-year growth trend improve, and that's really our goal on that front. As far as the cost flows, I think when you look at either the year-over-year or sequential changes on the cost side, certainly on the network expense side, we have been reducing what are called the fixed part of Network Access cost from optimization. So we did manage to do that sequentially in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So that helped. Similarly, we had further optimization on circuit costs. So we did see the benefit on Network Access costs. So they went down from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So we are seeing that benefit and also we achieved some reductions on the nonheadcount side of the house. I think both those things is what helped drive the cost out."

So we have actually been pretty aggressive about taking on declining businesses in the past. If you think about WilTel, we acquired WilTel at the time where its largest customer was SBC.

So I wouldn't say that that's our preferred, but it's also not something that scares us away. We look at companies for a variety of different reasons: capabilities that we don't have, products and services that we don't have. If you look at our relatively small security acquisition of Black Lotus, it's because they had capabilities that we were wanting to put in our product road map. We thought that it was the best way to get them into the product road map is just to acquire the capabilities and deploy them over our entire footprint, and so we'll keep looking at those things.

Before we get into our results this morning, I'd like to start out on a personal note. As most of you know, I'm recently back from medical leave following heart surgery. The surgery and my recovery have gone extremely well, and I'm very excited to be back at work. But I wanted to expect my thanks to the kind wishes I received from so many people on this call. Your cards, notes and words of support were very meaningful to me, and I greatly appreciate it. 
I'd also like to mention the outpouring of support I received from Level 3 employees. I'd mentioned a number of times before the outstanding employees we have, but as I was thinking about this call, I wanted to take the opportunity to really illustrate the point. 
One of the things that touched me most during my absence were the literally thousands of notes and e-mails I received from employees. Of course, they wished me well, hoping for a speedy recovery and a complete recovery, but there were also many notes that expressed another thought. Many employees said things like, ""Jeff, while you're out, don't worry about Level 3. We've got this."" Or they said, ""Jeff, you focus on recovery, we'll focus on driving the business."" 
I think those notes really demonstrate something that I've known for a long time. The strength of Level 3 is our employees. We care about each other. We support each other. We take ownership of our own responsibilities, but happily take on more to support a coworker in need. Ultimately, each of our employees are individually and personally committed to the success of the company. I'd really like to thank them for their support and all they do to drive Level 3 forward. 
I'd also like to thank Sunit for serving as interim CEO while I was out, as well as the entire leadership team for keeping the business on track and executing against our strategy. It's gratifying to see the strength and depth of the leadership team we have built at the company. In fact, the focus by the entire team on profitable growth is evident in our first quarter results with expanding margins, strong growth and adjusted EBITDA and continued generation of free cash flow.
On today's call, we'll have a slight departure from our usual approach. I'll provide a few initial thoughts on our view of the market and the Level 3 strategy. Sunit will provide a first quarter operational update and our detailed financial results. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
With that, I'll now turn to what we're seeing in the market and our strategy, which is designed to both maximize our opportunity for the long term and enable us to take advantage of the current environment. The increasingly digital and increasingly connected world is creating the need for businesses to be fully networked across their operations. At the same time, the compelling economics of the cloud are driving enterprises to include migration to the cloud as a key element of their IT strategy. 
Combined with the proliferation of connected devices and an ever more threatening security landscape for, a hybrid cloud strategy is leading to hybrid networking for many enterprises. These market factors benefit Level 3. Our robust product portfolio and capabilities that range from dark fiber and advanced transport services like 100 GB waves, all the way up to CDN and our innovative threat intelligence services, position Level 3 well to meet enterprises' complex hybrid networking needs. 
As we look to 2016 and beyond, our strategy is unchanged. We remain focused on operational excellence throughout the business, providing a superior experience to our customers and developing the products and capabilities to meet their evolving needs. 
There are 4 key elements to our strategy. First, focusing on enterprises as the company's growth engine. We've been successful in capturing share of the global enterprise communications market, but our share remains low, and we see a continuing opportunity to grow across all 3 regions. In particular, companies who view the network as fundamental to their business strategy and an enabler of growth in their own businesses are targets for our continued growth. 
Second, continue investing in a comprehensive and evolving product portfolio. As I mentioned, the transformation in the communications industry is underway, and we continue to develop the capabilities we need to solve our customers' needs for growth, efficiency and security.
Third, expanding our network and building directly to our customers' locations. We believe that having our customers on our network, or on-net, enables us to provide better network performance and reliability as well as an improved experience for our customers. 
And fourth, but certainly not least, providing an excellent customer experience. We are investing in operational excellence to continually improve our customers' interactions with Level 3 across every aspect of the business. 
Central to our strategy is our vision of one that I've discussed before: One set of products that we take to an expanding market, one network to deliver those products globally, one set of operational support systems to enable a differentiated customer experience and one team with the singular goal of making Level 3 the premier provider of enterprise networking services. 
Level 3 is a growth business. As I said on our fourth quarter earnings call, our goal is to achieve 8% year-over-year CNS enterprise revenue growth. While we aren't there yet, as a team, we are working toward accelerating growth. Our strategy and the operating plans that support our strategy are designed to deliver a differentiated customer experience and drive growth. Investing in the key areas of products, network, systems and customer service excellence are priorities for the business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit to discuss the first quarter results. Sunit?"

Jeff, before I start, on behalf of everyone here at Level 3, we are happy you're back. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'll start by covering key areas of focus and operational progress for the first quarter before I get to the financial results. As a company, we continue strive towards operational excellence, and we are executing on many initiatives to drive growth. We are adding to our sales organization and improving sales productivity. We continue to expand the Level 3 network and enhance our products. We are operating well from a bottom line and cash flow perspective and remain focused on driving better top line growth. 
In the first quarter, from a sales perspective, production held steady year-over-year and grew nicely sequentially. Sales productivity continued to increase. We continue to improve our sales model, implementing a unified strategy to ensure consistency across our markets. Our local sales presence and willingness to bring fiber to customer locations have been a differentiator in our success. 
From a headcount perspective, the first quarter is typically when we see a higher level of churn from our quota-bearing headcount. During the first quarter of this year, we held quota-bearing headcount relatively steady, declining by roughly 10 people in the quarter. At the same time, we added more than 20 specialized nonquota-bearing security and CDN sales representatives to help identify and close opportunities for these growth products. The size of our overall sales organization has increased, and we expect that quota-bearing headcount will grow for the full year. 
During the quarter, we further consolidated our legacy billing systems and are now on a single platform across North America and EMEA. With the consolidation of Latin America into our end-state environment later this year, we expect to be on a single global billing platform by the end of the third quarter. Additionally, we now have a single customer self-service portal interface across North America and EMEA, with plans to incorporate Latin America in the future. 
From a product perspective, we continue investing to meet the needs of our customers. For example, we continue to strengthen our cloud offering with the introduction of Microsoft Office 365 to our Cloud Connect Solutions ecosystem. In general, we are seeing more secure enterprise connections to the cloud, driving revenue growth. 
Additionally, we were recently named an advanced partner in the AWS partner network, providing network connections to improve enterprise and public sector access to the AWS cloud computing platform and services. I'd like to note at that Level 3 is connected to more AWS Direct Connect locations globally than any other network service provider. 
Wavelength revenue continues to grow, and we are seeing increased adoption of 100 GB wave services. Driven by strong interest from customers, we continue to invest in our security solutions. In February, Level 3 opened its first distributor denial of service, or DDoS, scrubbing center in LatAm. This addition complements the 8 other scrubbing locations we have across North America, where we have 5; and EMEA, where we have 3. During the quarter, in addition to the investments we made to the sales force and our product portfolio, we also continue to expand our on-net billing footprint across all 3 of our regions. 
Turning to our results from a financial perspective. I'd like to start with some highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 4 of our presentation. We grew Core Network Services, or CNS, revenue by 4%. We grew CNS enterprise revenue 6% -- grew North America CNS enterprise revenues 6% year-over-year and approximately 2% sequentially. We increased EBITDA by 15% to $710 million and generated strong free cash flow of $213 million. 
Turning to revenue results on Slide 5. As we've seen over the last year, the difference in constant currency and as-reported growth rates can be attributed to the strength of the dollar against many other currencies. As you can see on this slide, we have provided revenue growth rates by region on both a constant currency and an as-reported basis. Overall, total revenue grew 2.3%, and CNS revenue grew 3.6%. Within CNS, enterprise grew 5.7% while wholesale declined 1.4%. 
On a regional basis, we had a solid quarter in North America, highlighted by sequential CNS enterprise revenue growth of about 2%. In the first quarter, EMEA CNS revenue declined 4.9%, and CNS enterprise revenue, excluding U.K. government, declined 0.5%. First quarter enterprise sales, excluding U.K. government, were up 20% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. During the quarter, certain large disconnects and the timing of professional services and onetime items pressured revenue growth. 
We have invested in sales and marketing resources in the region, including new sales leaders in France and Germany. Additionally, we've been investing in product capabilities in the region, including CDN, security and Voice Complete, which should help drive revenue growth for the remainder of the year. In Latin America, CNS enterprise revenue remained strong, growing 10%. Also, CNS revenue growth was flat due to a few nondisconnects. 
Wholesale Voice Services revenue, or WVS, declined 18% to $104 million in the first quarter of 2016. For the full year, we continue to expect WVS revenue to decline by approximately 10%. As we said last quarter, excluding U.K. government revenue, we generally expect total CNS and CNS enterprise revenue growth to be stronger in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Looking at first quarter results, although EMEA started a bit weaker than expected, we are maintaining our full year 2016 outlook. Our revenue mix can be found on Slide 6, with North America representing 82% of our CNS revenue, followed by EMEA at 10% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 72% of CNS revenue, while wholesale customers make up the remaining 28%. 
Turning to Slide 7 and revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 7.2%, transport and fiber declined 0.3%, voice services grew 2.4% and the colocation and data services revenue declined 0.5%. A few highlights from an individual product perspective include CDN growth of 4%, dark fiber growth of 11% and managed security growth of 46%. From a pricing standpoint, we haven't seen much change over the last several quarters. 
Moving to Slide 8. Network Access margin expanded to 66.2% compared to 64.5% in the first quarter 2015. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven by continued high-margin CNS revenue growth combined with low-margin WVS revenue decline and continued expense savings from network consolidation. 
Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA was $710 million for the first quarter 2016. This compares to $620 million in the first quarter 2015. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the operating leverage from CNS revenue growth, the full benefit of synergies realized in 2015 and continued initiatives to manage costs. We also continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved to 34.6% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 30.5% in the first quarter 2015. The company generated free cash flow of $213 million in the quarter compared to $42 million from the year-ago quarter. 
After the close of the quarter, the company redeemed $775 million of our 7% senior notes funded by the net proceeds from our 700 -- our new $775 million 5.25% senior notes which closed during the first quarter. As a result of this transaction, in the second quarter 2016, we expect to recognize a loss before taxes of $40 million or $0.11 in basic earnings per share on the extinguishment and modification of debt. We exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7x and are focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4x.
In the first quarter of 2016, the company generated net income of $124 million and basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.35 and $0.34, respectively. While the effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 43%, we continue to expect our GAAP income tax rate to average about 30% for the full year 2016. The effective income tax rate can fluctuate significantly in any quarter for discrete or unusual events. We expect the rate in the second quarter to be in the 15% to 20% range. 
Turning to the business outlook on Slide 10. We remain confident in our performance for the remainder of the year. With our continued focus on profitable revenue growth and strong adjusted EBITDA results in the first quarter 2016, we're increasing our outlook for full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth. We now expect full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 12% compared to our previous outlook of 9% to 12%. 
In addition, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Additionally, we've lowered our full year interest expense estimates based on our recent capital markets transactions. We also updated our noncash compensation estimate for 2016 to $170 million from $130 million, as we had underestimated the expenses for employees who'll become retirement eligible in 2016 and certain performance-based stock grants. 
In summary, we're focused on sales momentum by growing both the sales force and sales productivity. We are driving profitable growth by executing on the investments we made through our network expansion and product portfolio enhancement initiatives. Finally, across the business, we are maintaining financial discipline and driving improved efforts to improve operational excellence and customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Valerie to start the Q&A."

Expanding our product portfolio. We've launched DDoS in EMEA. We have an excellent Ethernet footprint. We have 100 GB wave platform. We've talked about our Voice Complete launch that we're underway with and our security gateways that we've launched in the region. And we're also spending a lot of time and energy on market awareness and demand generation. And then the expansion of the sales channel. So I've talked about some of the people that we've hired in the past, but we've also been now hiring down a layer below that. So in the U.K., we've hired Mike Kennedy, who's a long-term Level 3 employee, but to focus on really driving those investments in EMEA and driving our sales performance, and in particular, our enterprise sales performance. Bart van Aanholt in Benelux, another long-term Level 3 employee, but now focused on making sure we're making the right investments in Benelux and driving the growth. In France and Germany, we've hired new people from outside, Thierry Brengard in France and Ralf Strausberger [ph] in Germany. So we think we're continuing to augment the team.

So we might need some people there. On the nonheadcount side, I think we will continue to hold those expenses down pretty tight, maybe even achieve further reductions. And within the Network Access costs, in general, we're looking to make investments to drive more off-net circuit costs on-net, but at the same time, we will have a revenue growth which will drive the network expense up.

One, just want to return to the cost side and the EBITDA performance for the quarter. I realize you're not going to give us synergy numbers going forward, but I'm just trying to get a sense for I think as we exited last year, the network expense synergies were sort of trailing behind where expectations had been. So wondering if part of what we saw in the EBITDA side of the equation this quarter was driven by maybe an acceleration in those synergies as opposed to just other cost-cutting activity. And then secondly, just North America enterprise, if you look at the supplementals, it looks like 2.2% constant currency sequential growth, a good number out of the gate. I think 1Q is historically a slower quarter, and then we usually see it ramp throughout the year. Sunit, you mentioned bookings were strong and expectations going forward there.

So with respect to North America, again as Jeff outlined in his remarks, our goal going out there is to grow 8% year-over-year. And so I think back to the sequential performance, the sequential performance is lumpy in any given quarter there, onetime items and various other things involved. So 2% would mean anywhere from 1.5% to 2.5% -- or 1.5% to 2.49%. So I think it's tough to really take anything from 1 quarter, but generally, I mean, our goal is to -- if we can achieve approximately 2%, which is 2 plus or minus 0.5 because it is lumpy when you look at sequential, then we should see the year-over-year growth trend improve, and that's really our goal on that front. As far as the cost goes, I think when you look at either the year-over-year or sequential changes on the cost side, certainly on the network expense side, we have been reducing what are called the fixed part of Network Access costs from optimization. So we did manage to do that sequentially in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, so that helped. Similarly, we had further optimization on circuit costs. So we did see the benefit on Network Access costs, so they went down from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So we are seeing that benefit. And also, we achieved some reductions on the nonheadcount side of the house. I think both those things is what helped drive the cost down."

So we have actually been pretty aggressive about taking on declining businesses in the past. If you think about WilTel, we acquired WilTel at the time where its largest customer was SBC. SBC had just acquired AT&T and was migrating traffic. And so we've actually been pretty successful at buying some aspects of declining businesses, taking the strength of the growing businesses and offsetting the weaknesses from the declining business. So I wouldn't say that that's our preferred, but it's also not something that scares us away. We look at companies for a variety of different reasons: capabilities that we don't have, products and services that we don't have. If you look at our relatively small security acquisition of Black Lotus, it's because they had capabilities that we were wanting to put in our product road map. We thought that was the best way to get them into the product road map, is just to acquire the capabilities and deploy them over our entire footprint. And so we'll keep looking at those things.

Before we get into our results this morning, I'd like to start out on a personal note. As most of you know, I'm recently back from medical leave following heart surgery. The surgery and my recovery have gone extremely well, and I'm very excited to be back at work. But I wanted to express my thanks for the kind wishes I received from so many people on this call. Your cards, notes and words of support were very meaningful to me, and I greatly appreciate it. 
I'd also like to mention the outpouring of support I received from Level 3 employees. I'd mentioned a number of times before the outstanding employees we have, but as I was thinking about this call, I wanted to take the opportunity to really illustrate the point. 
One of the things that touched me most during my absence were the literally thousands of notes and e-mails I received from employees. Of course, they wished me well, hoping for a speedy recovery and a complete recovery, but there were also many notes that expressed another thought. Many employees said things like, ""Jeff, while you're out, don't worry about Level 3. We've got this."" Or they said, ""Jeff, you focus on recovery, we'll focus on driving the business."" 
I think those notes really demonstrate something that I've known for a long time. The strength of Level 3 is our employees. We care about each other. We support each other. We take ownership of our own responsibilities, but happily take on more to support a coworker in need. Ultimately, each of our employees are individually and personally committed to the success of the company. I'd really like to thank them for their support and all they do to drive Level 3 forward. 
I'd also like to thank Sunit for serving as the interim CEO while I was out, as well as the entire leadership team for keeping the business on track and executing against our strategy. It's gratifying to see the strength and depth of the leadership team we have built at the company. In fact, the focus by the entire team on profitable growth is evident in our first quarter results, with expanding margins, strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and continued generation of free cash flow.
On today's call, we'll have a slight departure from our usual approach. I'll provide a few initial thoughts on our view of the market and the Level 3 strategy. Sunit will provide a first quarter operational update and our detailed financial results. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
With that, I'll now turn to what we're seeing in the market and our strategy, which is designed to both maximize our opportunity for the long term and enable us to take advantage of the current environment. The increasingly-digital and increasingly-connected world is creating the need for businesses to be fully networked across their operations. At the same time, the compelling economics of the cloud are driving enterprises to include migration to the cloud as a key element of their IT strategy. 
Combined with the proliferation of connected devices and an ever more threatening security landscape, a hybrid cloud strategy is leading to hybrid networking for many enterprises. These market factors benefit Level 3. Our robust product portfolio and capabilities that range from dark fiber and advanced transport services like 100 GB waves, all the way up to CDN and our innovative threat intelligence services, position Level 3 well to meet enterprises' complex hybrid networking needs. 
As we look to 2016 and beyond, our strategy is unchanged. We remain focused on operational excellence throughout the business, providing a superior experience to our customers and developing the products and capabilities to meet their evolving needs. 
There are 4 key elements to our strategy. First, focusing on enterprises as the company's growth engine. We've been successful in capturing share of the global enterprise communications market, but our share remains low, and we see a continuing opportunity to grow across all 3 regions. In particular, companies who view the network as fundamental to their business strategy and an enabler of growth in their own businesses are targets for our continued growth. 
Second, continue investing in a comprehensive and evolving product portfolio. As I mentioned, the transformation in the communications industry is underway, and we continue to develop the capabilities we need to solve our customers' needs for growth, efficiency and security.
Third, expanding our network and building directly to our customers' locations. We believe that having our customers on our network, or on-net, enables us to provide better network performance and reliability as well as an improved experience for our customers. 
And fourth, but certainly not least, providing excellent customer experience. We are investing in operational excellence to continually improve our customers' interactions with Level 3 across every aspect of the business. 
Central to our strategy is our vision of one that I've discussed before: One set of products that we take to an expanding market, one network to deliver those products globally, one set of operational support systems to enable a differentiated customer experience and one team with the singular goal of making Level 3 the premier provider of enterprise networking services. 
Level 3 is a growth business. As I said on our fourth quarter earnings call, our goal is to achieve 8% year-over-year CNS enterprise revenue growth. While we aren't there yet, as a team, we are working toward accelerating growth. Our strategy and the operating plans that support our strategy are designed to deliver a differentiated customer experience and drive growth. Investing in the key areas of products, network, systems and customer service excellence are priorities for the business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit to discuss the first quarter results. Sunit?"

Jeff, before I start, on behalf of everyone here at Level 3, we are happy you're back. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'll start by covering key areas of focus and operational progress for the first quarter before I get to the financial results. As a company, we continue to strive towards operational excellence, and we are executing on many initiatives to drive growth. We are adding to our sales organization and improving sales productivity. We continue to expand the Level 3 network and enhance our products. We are operating well from a bottom line and cash flow perspective and remain focused on driving better top line growth. 
In the first quarter, from a sales perspective, production held steady year-over-year and grew nicely sequentially. Sales productivity continued to increase. We continue to improve our sales model, implementing a unified strategy to ensure consistency across our markets. Our local sales presence and willingness to bring fiber to customer locations have been a differentiator in our success. 
From a headcount perspective, the first quarter is typically when we see a higher level of churn from our quota-bearing headcount. During the first quarter of this year, we held quota-bearing headcount relatively steady, declining by roughly 10 people in the quarter. At the same time, we added more than 20 specialized nonquota-bearing security and CDN sales representatives to help identify and close opportunities for these growth products. The size of our overall sales organization has increased, and we expect that quota-bearing headcount will grow for the full year. 
During the quarter, we further consolidated our legacy billing systems and are now on a single platform across North America and EMEA. With the consolidation of Latin America into our end-state environment later this year, we expect to be on a single global billing platform by the end of the third quarter. Additionally, we now have a single customer self-service portal interface across North America and EMEA, with plans to incorporate Latin America in the future. 
From a product perspective, we continued investing to meet the needs of our customers. For example, we continue to strengthen our cloud offering with the introduction of Microsoft Office 365 to our Cloud Connect Solutions ecosystem. In general, we are seeing more secure enterprise connections to the cloud, driving revenue growth. 
Additionally, we were recently named an advanced partner in the AWS partner network, providing network connections to improve enterprise and public sector access to the AWS cloud computing platform and services. I'd like to note that Level 3 is connected to more AWS Direct Connect locations globally than any other network service provider. 
Wavelength revenue continues to grow, and we are seeing increased adoption of 100 GB wave services. Driven by strong interest from customers, we continue to invest in our security solutions. In February, Level 3 opened its first distributed denial of service, or DDoS, scrubbing center in LatAm. This addition complements the 8 other scrubbing locations we have across North America, where we have 5, and EMEA, where we have 3. During the quarter, in addition to the investments we made to the sales force and our product portfolio, we also continued to expand our on-net building footprint across all 3 of our regions. 
Turning to our results from a financial perspective. I'd like to start with some highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 4 of our presentation. We grew Core Network Services, or CNS, revenue by 4%. We grew CNS enterprise revenue 6%; grew North America CNS enterprise revenues 6% year-over-year and approximately 2% sequentially. We increased EBITDA by 15% to $710 million and generated strong free cash flow of $213 million. 
Turning to revenue results on Slide 5. As we've seen over the last year, the difference in constant currency and as-reported growth rates can be attributed to the strength of the dollar against many other currencies. As you can see on this slide, we have provided revenue growth rates by region on both a constant currency and an as-reported basis. Overall, total revenue grew 2.3%, and CNS revenue grew 3.6%. Within CNS, enterprise grew 5.7% while wholesale declined 1.4%. 
On a regional basis, we had a solid quarter in North America, highlighted by sequential CNS enterprise revenue growth of about 2%. In the first quarter, EMEA CNS revenue declined 4.9%, and CNS enterprise revenue, excluding U.K. government, declined 0.5%. First quarter enterprise sales, excluding U.K. government, were up 20% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. During the quarter, certain large disconnects and the timing of professional services and onetime items pressured revenue growth. 
We have invested in sales and marketing resources in the region, including new sales leaders in France and Germany. Additionally, we've been investing in product capabilities in the region, including CDN, security and Voice Complete, which should help drive revenue growth for the remainder of the year. In Latin America, CNS enterprise revenue remained strong, growing 10%. Also, CNS revenue growth was flat due to a few known disconnects. 
Wholesale Voice Services revenue, or WVS, declined 18% to $104 million in the first quarter 2016. For the full year, we continue to expect WVS revenue to decline by approximately 10%. As we said last quarter, excluding U.K. government revenue, we generally expect total CNS and CNS enterprise revenue growth to be stronger in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Looking at first quarter results, although EMEA started a bit weaker than expected, we are maintaining our full year 2016 outlook. Our revenue mix can be found on Slide 6, with North America representing 82% of our CNS revenue, followed by EMEA at 10% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 72% of CNS revenue, while wholesale customers make up the remaining 28%. 
Turning to Slide 7 and revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 7.2%, transport and fiber declined 0.3%, voice services grew 2.4% and the colocation and data services revenue declined 0.5%. A few highlights from an individual product perspective include CDN growth of 4%, dark fiber growth of 11% and managed security growth of 46%. From a pricing standpoint, we haven't seen much change over the last several quarters. 
Moving to Slide 8. Network Access margin expanded to 66.2% compared to 64.5% in the first quarter 2015. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven by continued high-margin CNS revenue growth combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines and continued expense savings from network consolidation. 
Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA was $710 million for the first quarter 2016. This compares to $620 million in the first quarter 2015. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the operating leverage from CNS revenue growth, the full benefit of synergies realized in 2015 and continued initiatives to manage costs. We also continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved to 34.6% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 30.5% in the first quarter 2015. The company generated free cash flow of $213 million in the quarter compared to $42 million from the year-ago quarter. 
After the close of the quarter, the company redeemed $775 million of our 7% senior notes funded by the net proceeds from our 700 -- our new $775 million 5.25% senior notes which closed during the first quarter. As a result of this transaction, in the second quarter 2016, we expect to recognize a loss before taxes of $40 million or $0.11 in basic earnings per share on the extinguishment and modification of debt. We exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7x and are focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3x to 4x.
In the first quarter 2016, the company generated net income of $124 million and basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.35 and $0.34, respectively. While the effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 43%, we continue to expect our GAAP income tax rate to average about 30% for the full year 2016. The effective income tax rate can fluctuate significantly in any quarter for discrete or unusual events. We expect the rate in the second quarter to be in the 15% to 20% range. 
Turning to the business outlook on Slide 10. We remain confident in our performance for the remainder of the year. With our continued focus on profitable revenue growth and strong adjusted EBITDA results in the first quarter 2016, we're increasing our outlook for full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth. We now expect full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 12% compared to our previous outlook of 9% to 12%. 
In addition, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Additionally, we've lowered our full year interest expense estimates based on our recent capital markets transactions. We also updated our noncash compensation estimate for 2016 to $170 million from $130 million, as we had underestimated the expenses for employees who'll become retirement-eligible in 2016 and certain performance-based stock grants. 
In summary, we're focused on sales momentum by growing both the sales force and sales productivity. We are driving profitable growth by executing on the investments we made through our network expansion and product portfolio enhancement initiatives. Finally, across the business, we are maintaining financial discipline and driving improved efforts to improve operational excellence and customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Valerie to start the Q&A."

Expanding our product portfolio. We've launched DDoS in EMEA. We have an excellent Ethernet footprint. We have 100 GB wave platform. We've talked about our Voice Complete launch that we're underway with and our security gateways that we've launched in the region.

So I've talked about some of the people that we've hired in the past, but we've also been now hiring down a layer below that. So in the U.K., we've hired Mike Kennedy, who's a long-term Level 3 employee, but to focus on really driving those investments in EMEA and driving our sales performance, and in particular, our enterprise sales performance. Bart van Aanholt in Benelux, another long-term Level 3 employee, but now focused on making sure we're making the right investments in Benelux and driving the growth. In France and Germany, we've hired new people from outside, Thierry Brengard in France and Ralf Strausberger [ph] in Germany. So we think we're continuing to augment the team.

So we might need some people there. On the nonheadcount side, I think we will continue to hold those expenses down pretty tight, maybe even achieve further reductions. And within the Network Access costs, in general, we're looking to make investments to drive more off-net circuit costs on-net, but at the same time, we will have revenue growth which will drive the network expense up.

I realize you're not going to give us synergy numbers going forward, but I'm just trying to get a sense for I think as we exited last year, the network expense synergies were sort of trailing behind where expectations had been. So wondering if part of what we saw in the EBITDA side of the equation this quarter was driven by maybe an acceleration in those synergies as opposed to just other cost-cutting activity. And then secondly, just North America enterprise, if you look at the supplementals, it looks like 2.2% constant currency sequential growth, a good number out of the gate. I think 1Q is historically a slower quarter, and then we usually see it ramp throughout the year. Sunit, you mentioned bookings were strong and expectations going forward there.

So with respect to North America, again as Jeff outlined in his remarks, our goal going out there is to grow 8% year-over-year. And so I think back to the sequential performance, the sequential performance is lumpy in any given quarter there, onetime items and various other things involved. So 2% would mean anywhere from 1.5% to 2.5% -- or 1.5% to 2.49%. So I think that it's tough to really take anything from 1 quarter, but generally, I mean, our goal is to -- if we can achieve approximately 2%, which is 2 plus or minus 0.5 because it is lumpy when you look at sequential, then we should see the year-over-year growth trend improve, and that's really our goal on that front. As far as the cost goes, I think when you look at either the year-over-year or sequential changes on the cost side, certainly on the network expense side, we have been reducing what I'll call the fixed part of Network Access costs from optimization. So we did manage to do that sequentially in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, so that helped. Similarly, we had further optimization on circuit costs. So we did see the benefit on Network Access costs, so they went down from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So we are seeing the benefit. And also, we achieved some reductions on the nonheadcount side of the house. So I think both those things is what helped drive the cost down."

And so we've actually been pretty successful at buying some aspects of declining businesses, taking the strength of the growing businesses and offsetting the weaknesses from the declining business. So I wouldn't say that that's our preferred, but it's also not something that scares us away. We look at companies for a variety of different reasons: capabilities that we don't have, products and services that we don't have. If you look at our relatively small security acquisition of Black Lotus, it's because they had capabilities that we were wanting to put into our product road map and felt that was the best way to get them into the product road map, is just to acquire the capabilities and deploy them over our entire footprint.

Before we get into our results this morning, I'd like to start out on a personal note. As most of you know, I'm recently back from medical leave following heart surgery. The surgery and my recovery have gone extremely well, and I'm very excited to be back at work. But I wanted to express my thanks for the kind wishes I received from so many people on this call. Your cards, notes and words of support were very meaningful to me, and I greatly appreciate it. 
I'd also like to mention the outpouring of support I received from Level 3 employees. I'd mentioned a number of times before the outstanding employees we have, but as I was thinking about this call, I wanted to take the opportunity to really illustrate the point. 
One of the things that touched me most during my absence were the literally thousands of notes and e-mails I received from employees. Of course, they wished me well, hoping for a speedy recovery and a complete recovery, but there were also many notes that expressed another thought. Many employees said things like, ""Jeff, while you're out, don't worry about Level 3. We've got this."" Or they said, ""Jeff, you focus on recovery, we'll focus on driving the business."" 
I think those notes really demonstrate something that I've known for a long time. The strength of Level 3 is our employees. We care about each other. We support each other. We take ownership of our own responsibilities, but happily take on more to support a coworker in need. Ultimately, each of our employees are individually and personally committed to the success of the company. I'd really like to thank them for their support and all they do to drive Level 3 forward. 
I'd also like to thank Sunit for serving as the interim CEO while I was out, as well as the entire leadership team for keeping the business on track and executing against our strategy. It's gratifying to see the strength and depth of the leadership team we have built at the company. In fact, the focus by the entire team on profitable growth is evident in our first quarter results, with expanding margins, strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and continued generation of free cash flow.
On today's call, we'll have a slight departure from our usual approach. I'll provide a few initial thoughts on our view of the market and the Level 3 strategy. Sunit will provide a first quarter operational update and our detailed financial results. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
With that, I'll now turn to what we're seeing in the market and our strategy, which is designed to both maximize our opportunity for the long term and enable us to take advantage of the current environment. The increasingly-digital and increasingly-connected world is creating the need for businesses to be fully networked across their operations. At the same time, the compelling economics of the cloud are driving enterprises to include migration to the cloud as a key element of their IT strategy. 
Combined with the proliferation of connected devices and an ever more threatening security landscape, a hybrid cloud strategy is leading to hybrid networking for many enterprises. These market factors benefit Level 3. Our robust product portfolio and capabilities that range from dark fiber and advanced transport services like 100 GB waves, all the way up to CDN and our innovative threat intelligence services, position Level 3 well to meet enterprises' complex hybrid networking needs. 
As we look to 2016 and beyond, our strategy is unchanged. We remain focused on operational excellence throughout the business, providing a superior experience to our customers and developing the products and capabilities to meet their evolving needs. 
There are 4 key elements to our strategy. First, focusing on enterprises as the company's growth engine. We've been successful in capturing share of the global enterprise communications market, but our share remains low, and we see a continuing opportunity to grow across all 3 regions. In particular, companies who view the network as fundamental to their business strategy and an enabler of growth in their own businesses are targets for our continued growth. 
Second, continue investing in a comprehensive and evolving product portfolio. As I mentioned, the transformation in the communications industry is underway, and we continue to develop the capabilities we need to solve our customers' needs for growth, efficiency and security.
Third, expanding our network and building directly to our customers' locations. We believe that having our customers on our network, or on-net, enables us to provide better network performance and reliability as well as an improved experience for our customers. 
And fourth, but certainly not least, providing excellent customer experience. We are investing in operational excellence to continually improve our customers' interactions with Level 3 across every aspect of the business. 
Central to our strategy is our vision of one that I've discussed before: One set of products that we take to an expanding market, one network to deliver those products globally, one set of operational support systems to enable a differentiated customer experience and one team with the singular goal of making Level 3 the premier provider of enterprise networking services. 
Level 3 is a growth business. As I said on our fourth quarter earnings call, our goal is to achieve 8% year-over-year CNS enterprise revenue growth. While we aren't there yet, as a team, we are working toward accelerating growth. Our strategy and the operating plans that support our strategy are designed to deliver a differentiated customer experience and drive growth. Investing in the key areas of products, network, systems and customer service excellence are priorities for the business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit to discuss the first quarter results. Sunit?"

Jeff, before I start, on behalf of everyone here at Level 3, we are happy you're back. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'll start by covering key areas of focus and operational progress for the first quarter before I get to the financial results. As a company, we continue to strive towards operational excellence, and we are executing on many initiatives to drive growth. We are adding to our sales organization and improving sales productivity. We continue to expand the Level 3 network and enhance our products. We are operating well from a bottom line and cash flow perspective and remain focused on driving better top line growth. 
In the first quarter, from a sales perspective, production held steady year-over-year and grew nicely sequentially. Sales productivity continued to increase. We continue to improve our sales model, implementing a unified strategy to ensure consistency across our markets. Our local sales presence and willingness to bring fiber to customer locations have been a differentiator in our success. 
From a headcount perspective, the first quarter is typically when we see a higher level of churn from our quota-bearing headcount. During the first quarter of this year, we held quota-bearing headcount relatively steady, declining by roughly 10 people in the quarter. At the same time, we added more than 20 specialized nonquota-bearing security and CDN sales representatives to help identify and close opportunities for these growth products. The size of our overall sales organization has increased, and we expect that quota-bearing headcount will grow for the full year. 
During the quarter, we further consolidated our legacy billing systems and are now on a single platform across North America and EMEA. With the consolidation of Latin America into our end-state environment later this year, we expect to be on a single global billing platform by the end of the third quarter. Additionally, we now have a single customer self-service portal interface across North America and EMEA, with plans to incorporate Latin America in the future. 
From a product perspective, we continued investing to meet the needs of our customers. For example, we continue to strengthen our cloud offering with the introduction of Microsoft Office 365 to our Cloud Connect Solutions ecosystem. In general, we are seeing more secure enterprise connections to the cloud, driving revenue growth. 
Additionally, we were recently named an advanced partner in the AWS partner network, providing network connections to improve enterprise and public sector access to the AWS cloud computing platform and services. I'd like to note that Level 3 is connected to more AWS Direct Connect locations globally than any other network service provider. 
Wavelength revenue continues to grow, and we are seeing increased adoption of 100 GB wave services. Driven by strong interest from customers, we continue to invest in our security solutions. In February, Level 3 opened its first distributed denial of service, or DDoS, scrubbing center in LatAm. This addition complements the 8 other scrubbing locations we have across North America, where we have 5, and EMEA, where we have 3. During the quarter, in addition to the investments we made to the sales force and our product portfolio, we also continued to expand our on-net building footprint across all 3 of our regions. 
Turning to our results from a financial perspective. I'd like to start with some highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 4 of our presentation. We grew Core Network Services, or CNS, revenue by 4%. We grew CNS enterprise revenue 6%; grew North America CNS enterprise revenues 6% year-over-year and approximately 2% sequentially. We increased EBITDA by 15% to $710 million and generated strong free cash flow of $213 million. 
Turning to revenue results on Slide 5. As we've seen over the last year, the difference in constant currency and as-reported growth rates can be attributed to the strength of the dollar against many other currencies. As you can see on this slide, we have provided revenue growth rates by region on both a constant currency and an as-reported basis. Overall, total revenue grew 2.3%, and CNS revenue grew 3.6%. Within CNS, enterprise grew 5.7% while wholesale declined 1.4%. 
On a regional basis, we had a solid quarter in North America, highlighted by sequential CNS enterprise revenue growth of about 2%. In the first quarter, EMEA CNS revenue declined 4.9%, and CNS enterprise revenue, excluding U.K. government, declined 0.5%. First quarter enterprise sales, excluding U.K. government, were up 20% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. During the quarter, certain large disconnects and the timing of professional services and onetime items pressured revenue growth. 
We have invested in sales and marketing resources in the region, including new sales leaders in France and Germany. Additionally, we've been investing in product capabilities in the region, including CDN, security and Voice Complete, which should help drive revenue growth for the remainder of the year. In Latin America, CNS enterprise revenue remained strong, growing 10%. Also, CNS revenue growth was flat due to a few known disconnects. 
Wholesale Voice Services revenue, or WVS, declined 18% to $104 million in the first quarter 2016. For the full year, we continue to expect WVS revenue to decline by approximately 10%. As we said last quarter, excluding U.K. government revenue, we generally expect total CNS and CNS enterprise revenue growth to be stronger in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Looking at first quarter results, although EMEA started a bit weaker than expected, we are maintaining our full year 2016 outlook. Our revenue mix can be found on Slide 6, with North America representing 82% of our CNS revenue, followed by EMEA at 10% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 72% of CNS revenue, while wholesale customers make up the remaining 28%. 
Turning to Slide 7 and revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 7.2%, transport and fiber declined 0.3%, voice services grew 2.4% and the colocation and data services revenue declined 0.5%. A few highlights from an individual product perspective include CDN growth of 4%, dark fiber growth of 11% and managed security growth of 46%. From a pricing standpoint, we haven't seen much change over the last several quarters. 
Moving to Slide 8. Network Access margin expanded to 66.2% compared to 64.5% in the first quarter 2015. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven by continued high-margin CNS revenue growth combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines and continued expense savings from network consolidation. 
Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA was $710 million for the first quarter 2016. This compares to $620 million in the first quarter 2015. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the operating leverage from CNS revenue growth, the full benefit of synergies realized in 2015 and continued initiatives to manage costs. We also continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved to 34.6% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 30.5% in the first quarter 2015. The company generated free cash flow of $213 million in the quarter compared to $42 million from the year-ago quarter. 
After the close of the quarter, the company redeemed $775 million of our 7% senior notes funded by the net proceeds from our 700 -- our new $775 million 5.25% senior notes which closed during the first quarter. As a result of this transaction, in the second quarter 2016, we expect to recognize a loss before taxes of $40 million or $0.11 in basic earnings per share on the extinguishment and modification of debt. We exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7x and are focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4x.
In the first quarter 2016, the company generated net income of $124 million and basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.35 and $0.34, respectively. While the effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 43%, we continue to expect our GAAP income tax rate to average about 30% for the full year 2016. The effective income tax rate can fluctuate significantly in any quarter for discrete or unusual events. We expect the rate in the second quarter to be in the 15% to 20% range. 
Turning to the business outlook on Slide 10. We remain confident in our performance for the remainder of the year. With our continued focus on profitable revenue growth and strong adjusted EBITDA results in the first quarter 2016, we're increasing our outlook for full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth. We now expect full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 12% compared to our previous outlook of 9% to 12%. 
In addition, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Additionally, we've lowered our full year interest expense estimates based on our recent capital markets transactions. We also updated our noncash compensation estimate for 2016 to $170 million from $130 million, as we had underestimated the expenses for employees who'll become retirement-eligible in 2016 and certain performance-based stock grants. 
In summary, we're focused on sales momentum by growing both the sales force and sales productivity. We are driving profitable growth by executing on the investments we made through our network expansion and product portfolio enhancement initiatives. Finally, across the business, we are maintaining financial discipline and driving improved efforts to improve operational excellence and customer experience. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Valerie to start the Q&A."

But we've really been investing kind of in 4 key areas, which is: Metro fiber, continuing to build out to our customers in EMEA, build better metro access to reach those customers. Expanding our product portfolio. We've launched DDoS in EMEA. We have an excellent Ethernet footprint. We have 100 GB wave platform. We've talked about our Voice Complete launch that we're underway with and our security gateways that we've launched in the region. And we're also spending a lot of time and energy on market awareness and demand generation. And then the expansion of the sales channel. So I've talked about some of the people that we've hired in the past, but we've also been now hiring down a layer below that. So in the U.K., we've hired Mike Kennedy, who's a long-term Level 3 employee, but to focus on really driving those investments in EMEA and driving our sales performance, and in particular, our enterprise sales performance. Bart van Aanholt in Benelux, another long-term Level 3 employee, but now focused on making sure we're making the right investments in Benelux and driving the growth. In France and Germany, we've hired new people from outside, Thierry Brengard in France and Ralf Strausberger [ph] in Germany. So we think we're continuing to augment the team.

And within the Network Access costs, in general, we're looking to make investments to drive more off-net circuit costs on-net, but at the same time, we will have revenue growth which will drive the network expense up.

I realize you're not going to give us synergy numbers going forward, but I'm just trying to get a sense for I think as we exited last year, the network expense synergies were sort of trailing behind where expectations had been. So wondering if part of what we saw in the EBITDA side of the equation this quarter was driven by maybe an acceleration in those synergies as opposed to just other cost-cutting activity. And then secondly, just North America enterprise, if you look at the supplementals, it looks like 2.2% constant currency sequential growth, a good number out of the gate. I think 1Q is historically a slower quarter, and then we usually see it ramp throughout the year. Sunit, you mentioned bookings were strong and expectations going forward there.

So with respect to North America, again as Jeff outlined in his remarks, our goal going out there is to grow 8% year-over-year. And so I think back to the sequential performance, the sequential performance is lumpy in any given quarter there, onetime items and various other things involved. So 2% would mean anywhere from 1.5% to 2.5% -- or 1.5% to 2.49%. So I think that it's tough to really take anything from 1 quarter, but generally, I mean, our goal is to -- if we can achieve approximately 2%, which is 2 plus or minus 0.5 because it is lumpy when you look at sequential, then we should see the year-over-year growth trend improve, and that's really our goal on that front. As far as the cost goes, I think when you look at either the year-over-year or sequential changes on the cost side, certainly on the network expense side, we have been reducing what I'll call the fixed part of Network Access costs from optimization. So we did manage to do that sequentially in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, so that helped. Similarly, we had further optimization on circuit costs. So we did see the benefit on Network Access costs, so they went down from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So we are seeing the benefit. And also, we achieved some reductions on the nonheadcount side of the house. So I think both those things is what helped drive the cost down."

And so we've actually been pretty successful at buying some aspects of declining businesses, taking the strength of the growing businesses and offsetting the weaknesses from the declining business. So I wouldn't say that that's our preferred, but it's also not something that scares us away. We look at companies for a variety of different reasons: capabilities that we don't have, products and services that we don't have. If you look at our relatively small security acquisition of Black Lotus, it's because they had capabilities that we were wanting to put into our product road map and felt that was the best way to get them into the product road map, is just to acquire the capabilities and deploy them over our entire footprint.

Consistent with the SEC's recently issued compliance and disclosure interpretation relating to non-GAAP metrics, we have made some changes to some of our presentation. For example, in the revenue table on Page 3 of this morning's press release, the column labeled percent change modified and constant currency is equivalent to the column labeled percent change constant currency found in previous earnings press releases. 
The earnings presentation we will review this morning contains the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. This presentation, along with all of our other earnings materials, are available in the Investor Relations section of the Level 3 website at investors.level3.com. 
The modified prior period results we are discussing today exclude the company's Venezuelan subsidiary that was deconsolidated at the end of the third quarter 2015 and reflect changes made to customer assignments between the wholesale and enterprise channels at the beginning of 2016 due to mergers in certain customers and other changes. 
Unless otherwise noted, in our remarks today, revenue and sales comparisons to prior periods are provided on a year-over-year modified and constant currency basis.

Our focus on driving profitable revenue growth through taking share in the market has not changed.

I'll quickly share a few financial highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. We grew Core Network Services, or CNS, enterprise revenue by 5.3%. Excluding a contract renewa",1711,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly share a few financial highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. 
We grew Core Network Services, or CNS, enterprise revenue by 5.3%. Excluding a contract renewal we mentioned in the press release and U.K. government revenue, we grew CNS enterprise revenue by 6.3%. We increased adjusted EBITDA by 10% to $715 million. And finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $264 million. 
We continue to grow Core Network Services revenue this quarter and saw improvement in both EMEA and LatAm enterprise CNS revenue. In North America, as noted in the press release, we saw some headwinds in the quarter, mostly due to a onetime event and slightly higher enterprise disconnects at the small end of the customer base. 
Across all 3 regions, we also saw an increase in wholesale customer disconnects, primarily driven by industry consolidation that took place over the last couple of years. Overall, we are now pleased with the revenue performance in the quarter and feel we should be performing better, especially in North America. Additionally, as we have seen over the last year, the strength of the dollar against many of the currencies has affected our reported results and lead to differences in constant currency and actual growth rates. 
This is shown on Slide 4. As you can see on the slide, we provided revenue growth rates by region on both a constant currency and in actual basis. As a reminder, U.S. dollars make up 90% of revenue followed by the British pound at 4% and the euro at 3%, the Brazilian real at 2% and all other currencies making up the last 1%. Overall, total revenue grew 1.6%, and CNS revenue grew 2.8%. 
Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 5.9%. Revenue from our large multinational customers, which represents 17% of total enterprise CNS revenue, increased 12%. Total Wholesale CNS revenue declined 3.4%, driven by the disconnects I just mentioned. 
On a regional basis, CNS revenue grew 3.5% -- North America CNS revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year with flat performance on a sequential basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.9%, and Wholesale CNS revenue declined 2.2% this quarter. 
This quarter, as we indicated in the press release, enterprise performance experienced some pressure, resulting from a renewal and extension of a large contract to the top customer. With this renewal, we issued a $5 million credit in the quarter and extended the length of the contract by 2 years with more than $100 million in additional revenue expected during the extension period. Excluding the effects of this contract renewal, our North America enterprise CNS revenue would have grown 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. 
Additionally, we saw churn increase from a number of smaller, less profitable customers. Offsetting the industry consolidation impact in wholesale, we benefited from approximately $10 million in dispute settlements in the quarter. As you may recall, we had a similar amount of dispute settlements in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving to EMEA. In the second quarter, CNS revenue declined 4.6%, with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, growing 1.9%. On a sequential basis, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew a strong 2.9%. We saw continued strong sales production from enterprise customers, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 7.2%. 
Before we move on from EMEA, one topic that has recently gained attention is Brexit. Many of you have been asking us how this might affect our business in both the short and long term. As I mentioned earlier, the British pound represents approximately 4% of revenue, and the euro, about 3%. Looking back at the second quarter, the average rates for the pound was 1.44. The average rate since Brexit vote on June 23 has been 1.32. 
While it had a minimal effect on our second quarter results, the weaker pound will affect our reported revenue results in the third quarter but will have a minimal impact on adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the rest of 2016. At this point, we'd not seen any changes in customer buying patterns because of Brexit. We did not see any customers pause purchases at the end of the quarter based on the. And as I mentioned, sales were strong. We expect that Brexit could cause some uncertainty in the region and the macro environment in general over the next couple of years. 
In Latin America, the CNS enterprise revenue remains strong, growing 9.6% year-over-year and 2.5% on a sequential basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 9.4%. Wholesale customer consolidation also affected Wholesale Voice Services revenue, or WVS, which declined 16% to $100 [ph] million in the second quarter 2016. For the full year 2016, we now expect WVS revenue to decline by approximately 15%. 
Moving to our revenue mix, which can be found on Slide 5. North America represents 82% of our CNS revenue followed by EMEA at 10% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 72% of CNS revenue while wholesale customers make up the remaining 28%. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 5.1%. Transport and fiber grew 0.3%. Voice services declined 4.4%, and colocation and data services grew 14%, mostly due to the settlement in North America wholesale. 
A few highlights from an individual product perspective included managed security growth of 30%, CDN growth of 22% and dark fiber growth of 13%. From a sales or bookings perspective, for the second quarter, total sales production as well as sales productivity continued to improve. Sequentially, we saw sales production increase in all of the regions we serve. 
From a headcount perspective, we added both quota- and nonquota-bearing headcount to our sales organization. We increased QVAC by roughly 20 in the quarter. At the same time, we added 5 specialized nonquota-bearing security and CDN sales representatives to help identify and close opportunities for these growth products. From a pricing standpoint, we've not seen much overall change over the last several quarters. 
Moving to Slide 7. Network Access margin expanded to 67.1% compared to 66.0% in the second quarter 2015. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven by continued high-margin CNS growth combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines and the settlement, as I mentioned earlier, which was 100% margin. We expect continued margin expansion for the remainder of the year as we tightly manage third-party costs. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $715 million for the second quarter 2016. This compares to $650 million in the second quarter of 2015. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven by continued high-margin CNS growth combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines. We also expect while continue -- we also continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 34.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 31.9% in the second quarter of 2015. 
Year-to-date, capital expenditures were approximately 16% of total revenue. As a reminder, CapEx can be lumpy in any one quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 15% of total revenue. 
The company generated free cash flow of $264 million in the quarter compared to $90 million from the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, we successfully completed the refinancing of approximately $775 million in senior notes. As a result, the company incurred a loss on extinguishment and modification of debt before taxes of $40 million or approximately $0.11 in basic earnings per share. 
We exited the quarter with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.5x and remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4x. 
The effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 22%, resulting from the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of our German subsidiary. Year-to-date, our tax rate has been 33%. In the third quarter, we expect our tax rate to be higher than 33%. And for the full year 2016, we continue to expect our GAAP income tax rate to average about 30%. 
As I mentioned earlier, our revenue performance is not yet at a level that we are pleased with. Looking back at the effects of churn on our business from both enterprise and wholesale customers, we are updating our expectations on revenue performance for the full year and now believe that our CNS revenue percentage growth, with the exception of Latin America enterprise revenue growth, will not be as strong as last year. We do expect better enterprise CNS sequential performance for the remainder of the year, in line with growth rates that we've seen in previous quarters. 
Additionally, I would like to note as we look to the third quarter 2016, it has been a particularly hot summer, and we expect to see our typical increase in utility costs, generally in the high single-digit millions of dollars, resulting from higher summer cooling requirements in our data centers. 
Also from a North America Wholesale CNS revenue perspective, please keep in mind that we will not see the benefit of the second quarter dispute settlement reoccur in the third quarter. Because of our ongoing focus on profitable revenue growth, combined with our continued disciplined cost management, we remain confident and are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook of 10% to 12% growth, and we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
All other outlook measures remain the same and are highlighted on Slide 9. We made a lot of progress on profitability since the acquisition of tw telecom in the fourth quarter of 2014. Prior to the acquisition, Level 3's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% to 29%, and tw telecom's EBITDA margin was 33% to 34%. Today, our adjusted EBITDA margin is about 35%. 
In summary, we continue to make the right investments in the business to drive profitable revenue growth. Our financial position continues to strengthen with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio well within our target range and a cash position at nearly $1.3 billion. We are also focused on delivering better revenue performance for the remainder of the year, especially in our North American enterprise business. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."
30771,369946630,1013325,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sunit. I'd like to make a few additional comments on our revenue growth this quarter and provide our updated view of the market and the opportunity. On the wholesale side, we said for the past 3 or 4 years that we generally expect Wholesale C",1290,"Thank you, Sunit. I'd like to make a few additional comments on our revenue growth this quarter and provide our updated view of the market and the opportunity. 
On the wholesale side, we said for the past 3 or 4 years that we generally expect Wholesale CNS revenue to be flat to slightly down over the long term. We maintain that view, and nothing about the long-term wholesale opportunity is surprising to us. Just as we continue to reduce our Network Access costs, enabled both by the tw telecom acquisitions and our targeted network grooming activities, we see our wholesale customers doing the same with their own network costs. 
The timing of disconnects in the quarter was slightly surprising. And although we anticipated them over the long term, recently, we've seen more than expected. Having said that, these disconnects were largely the delayed result of wireless consolidation over the last couple of years. 
From an overall enterprise market perspective, our view of the opportunity has not changed. Market needs have been evolving. And as we've expected, customers whose networking capabilities are an integral part in driving the success of their own businesses need more and more bandwidth. They need sophisticated and adaptive security services to defend against escalating attacks. They want a smooth migration path to the cloud to help capture efficiencies in their businesses and to support their digital infrastructure. They require the ability to easily address all of their networking needs, including voice and video. And they want to address these challenges on a global basis. All of these requirements are not only still true but are accelerating for our large and multinational customers. 
Looking at enterprise revenue in North America, we saw several factors affect revenue growth, some beneficial and some challenging. Let me address the challenges first. As Sunit noted in conjunction with significant contract extension with one of our largest customers, we incurred a credit during the quarter. While the credit created a headwind on growth in the short term, this was an easy decision for the long term. 
Additionally, we've seen an increase in disconnects from smaller customers. While we don't like losing revenue, disconnects from lower profit or even unprofitable customers are acceptable. In general, we do a better job serving and our profitability is higher with larger customers. Even with the disconnects this quarter, adjusted EBITDA and margins grew nicely, reinforcing our focus on efficiency and profitable revenue as key drivers for us. 
However, to ensure we are managing our customer base appropriately and retaining every customer that makes sense, we have a number of initiatives to better manage that base of smaller customers. On a positive note, as Sunit mentioned, we saw strong growth from our largest customers. These customers tend to have the most advanced and complex network demand and tend to be the early adopters of our products and services. 
To give you an example, Johnson Matthey is a leading global specialties company, whose history dates back as far as the early 1800 as one of Britain's oldest multinational companies listed on the London Stock Exchange underpinned by science, technology and their people. As the global leader in sustainable technologies, they aim for their products to enhance the quality of life of millions through the beneficial impact on the environment, human health and well-being. They employ 13,000 people in 30 countries worldwide, and their products and services are sold across the world to a wide range of advanced technology industries. 
For example, as the world's largest manufacturer of catalytic converters, around 1/3 of all cars worldwide are fitted with the Johnson Matthey catalysts. Johnson Matthey has historically been managing their information technology and networking environment in-house in a localized fashion with different strategies based on the company's divisions and regions of operation. To support their objective to deliver superior long-term growth, they developed a global transformation program to centralize IT and technology, transitioning many varying strategies into one new vision. 
They view their global networking approach as critical -- as a critical enabler to the overall transformation, and one of the first steps in this large undertaking was to address their disparate network strategies with multiple incumbent vendors to a single, global networking provider. Many of the large global incumbent telcos competed for this business. 
Following a comprehensive RFP process to evaluate the market, Level 3 was selected as the global networking provider based on our global network footprint, our advanced capabilities to protect the network from security and cyber threats, our capabilities to provision direct access to key cloud vendors, a mature multiregional account team support program and the ongoing value partnership offered through the continued access to Level 3's expertise and people to support their transitional journey into the future. 
Throughout the process, Level 3 was able to demonstrate increased agility and flexibility over the incumbent providers in areas of technical, commercial and service management. This will see Johnson Matthey relinquishing the responsibility of managing a handful of disparate divisional networks in-house to a single global network managed fully by Level 3, bringing up numerous resources which can now be applied elsewhere to key business transformation initiatives. 
We will be providing Johnson Matthey with a global, fully managed, 130-site network layering managed security, LAN optimization, application performance management, cloud connect services and Voice Complete services across a single, global platform. We're also providing a comprehensive suite of professional service to simplify the delivery of this complex global solution and to maintain high service levels across the world. Johnson Matthey is an excellent example of a company that relies on their network to transform their operation. Level 3 is uniquely positioned to serve these types of companies. 
I'll spend just a minute on the investments we're making to improve our growth prospects across the board. As I've mentioned before, we are investing in the vision of one, which includes one set of products that we take to an expanding market, one network to deliver those products globally, one set of operational support systems to enable the differentiated customer experience and one team with a singular goal of making Level 3 the premier provider of enterprise networking services. 
From a product perspective, we continue to invest in a comprehensive and developing product portfolio, building on our existing capabilities, whether it's adding offerings to our security portfolio or enabling our hybrid LAN capabilities or continually expanding our cloud connect capabilities. Our goal is to ensure we are meeting our customers' growth, efficiency and security challenges now and in the future. 
We believe that investing to expand our network and build directly to our customers' locations provides a better experience and will facilitate future revenue growth as we add product capabilities to those customers' on-net locations. We've also standardized across the network on a global SD-enabled Ethernet platform, providing efficiency, both for our customers and for our own operations. 
Operational support systems remain a key focus for the company as well. I believe we have more to do to make it easier across our entire quote-to-build process, better systems and better data both drive efficiency, which drives effectiveness, resulting in a better customer experience and enabling greater sales. 
In other words, operational excellence drives growth. Beyond investing in the business, I want to take a minute to address the topic of capital allocation. We don't have an update at this time, but I wanted to note that we've heard your suggestions on our options for deploying any excess cash. We continue to work closely with our Board of Directors on the best and highest use of that cash, including M&A and the potential return of cash to stockholders. 
With that, let's get to your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

We're in decent shape as the margin expansion progress we've made demonstrates, and we continue to remain focused on organic revenue growth and continued EBITDA growth. So we're down to then M&A and returning capital to shareholders. On the returning capital to shareholders, as Jeff pointed out, I think this is a subject that we continue discussions with the board. Don't have an update at this point in time, but it is important to us. It's front and center. I think that's the key message from us. We're not yet at the low end of our leverage ratio, which is we said we want to be at the low end of 3 to 4, which means at 3x, but we obviously making good progress to get there in the next few quarters."

You continue to message that bookings trends are doing well, and I'm just trying to get a better sense of how much visibility you have on churn. It seems like you got caught off guard this quarter and, I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of what's to prevent that from happening in the third and fourth quarter and really on a go-forward basis. And then my other question has to do with M&A. When I think about the types of businesses that could be of interest to you, fiber companies, perhaps data center collocation companies, those companies from what I understand trade at multiples well above where you trade at least right now on an EBITDA basis and at least at this point, are less focused on free cash flow. Would that prevent you from chasing or going after those types of deals because the mandate you've given out to investors has been a focus on improving free cash flow per share? And does that, to some degree, restrict what you're really able to go after? And with that said, it seems like the likelihood of M&A then is pretty small."

Look, in general, our visibility has been pretty good as you pointed out. The bookings trends are positive and strong. We generally know what our install intervals are from the time we get a customer order, and that's been predictable. The churn has been relatively steady. It's picked up. I would say within the quarter really, there are 2 things that it's tough to have visibility into. One, customers that are going to disconnect, we don't typically know ahead of time. Remember in the wholesale business, these are carriers. I think while we knew the consolidation had happened, we hadn't seen any activity for a while, and it sort of all showed up in 1 quarter across all 3 regions. Some of that, as Jeff pointed out, will continue, but it's tough to evaluate the timing, and so it's tough to have visibility on that and customers don't tell you, especially on the wholesale side when they're going to disconnect some service. They don't have to. You only have 30 days notice. So I think [indiscernible] surprising, and it was the same thing across our 3 regions. Large carriers, consolidation activity and grooming activity. With respect to the enterprise business, again when you look at 3 regions that we have, North America being the largest, in general, our visibility is pretty good. I think the contract extension that was tough to see a quarter ahead of time. But as we -- as Jeff pointed out, we are very happy with that outcome. We think that's a great outcome for us. The churn picking up in the smaller customer base, some of that was unprofitable customers. Having said that, we certainly didn't like losing some of these customers, and as Jeff pointed out, we've taken measures to make sure that we are taking better care of those customers at the smaller end within our inside sales group or even in some cases, coverage within a GM's purview within a city. So we are going to stay pretty focused on that. So I think from a visibility perspective, and the other thing with respect to your question on third and fourth quarter, we do feel we should see pretty good trends comparable to what we've seen in previous quarters with respect to the North America Enterprise and overall, sequential performance in that sort of 1.5% to 2% type performance. So we did hit a speed bump in the quarter. No, it's been tough to get visibility for all the reasons I explained but -- and we've got a long track record of churn being quite predictable, just this quarter was a little tougher."

I think that we have lots of M&A opportunities out there, and that while we are focused on free cash flow per share, that is not our sole focus. We are also focused on being a growth company, and so we make decisions everyday that balance our free cash flow per share with our growth. For example, capital. We can cut our capital spending significantly and drive great free cash flow per share for a short while, but we're not focused on that. We're focused on being a growth company and driving the free cash flow per share. So as we look at M&A and you mentioned fiber companies, we look at fiber companies post synergies and believe that we are very good at acquiring and capturing synergies and moving networks together, combining networks and creating value for shareholders through that. And so I don't feel that the M&A environment is necessarily constrained. I think that we're going to be smart. We don't have to do M&A. we're going to be smart about the things that we do. We'll continue to be disciplined in our decision-making with a variety of factors, not just one, but with a variety of factors.

We didn't expect them maybe to come at the pace that they did. Some of them we thought we'd get last year, we didn't get last year. So we don't really know the timing, but we knew the magnitude of them. Within the enterprise space, customers can disconnect from one of our products and services and go to another of our products and services as they transition to newer and advanced technologies. They can leave us. They can just disconnect an old platform as they migrate locations to some other locations. So there are a variety of different reasons. What we saw in the second quarter more than we expected was the low end of our customer base, and so those, Sunit talked about a little bit of the efforts that we are going to do to make sure we're paying attention to them. We want to look at them from a full customer life cycle management perspective, make sure we're talking to them, make sure we have account reps assigned to them that we're dealing with them, and those are not profitable, that we help migrate off our services.

All of the trends that we see customers needing in the future are coming through. More and more bandwidth, increased complexity as they have to create hybrid networks for tying their own data centers together or content distribution in some places, the services and others. The mix of networking challenges they have fit our product portfolio very well. All the while, the increasing security challenges, where we can give them advanced threat intelligence. We can work with them to really protect their network to protect their data, to protect their enterprises. So as the market dynamics are continuing exactly as we talked about for the past couple of years. We're seeing them. The timing's always hard to predict. I think it will continue to accelerate. It has been accelerating. I think it will continue to accelerate for a while. It gives us great opportunity to take share to your point, Tim. We take share in the market. That's how we want to grow, by going to our -- the customers, the potential customers that are out there and saying, ""transition to a new network to new technologies and do that through Level 3."" And just like Jason -- Johnson Matthey, we can help you solve your global networking challenges whether they're voice services or security services or transport services, we can help you solve them because we have a wide product array over a global footprint with -- and yet we're still nimble and agile and flexible and the way that we can deal with customers, and so we are absolutely focused on taking advantage of that market opportunity to create share, take share from those customers. And Sunit referenced that our largest customers, which I think was about 17% of our revenue, grew at 12%, and that is a good growth rate for us among those customers. And that -- they are the vanguard of the companies that are making these transitions, but I believe the transitions happen for all customers that are out there. Now with respect to us being part of a bigger organization, I want to be part of a bigger organization, but I want to grow it organically. I want us continue to grow, satisfy our customers needs. We have to remain flexible. We have to remain nimble because that's how we win. We win by differentiating our experience against these massive companies that are out there, and so we don't comment on any rumors or speculations about one M&A project or another, but we do know that we control our own destiny, and that our ability to execute is what determines our success, and so we're going to stay focused on growing with our customers, on maintaining the nimble character of Level 3 and the flexible character of Level 3, but delivering those services globally for our customers in more and richer and deeper ways of interconnecting with them, and so we are focused on our own execution.
Thank you all for taking the call. I'd like to close with just a few thoughts that we've talked about expanding margins. We've talked about our sequential growth in EMEA. We think that we're making good progress there. We talked about our strong growth in Latin America, both sequentially year-over-year and our CNS enterprise CNS revenue, and so we're pleased with that. We're not yet pleased with our -- we're not pleased this quarter or with our revenue growth in North America, but we are focused on it. We are attendant to it and believe that we're making great progress with our customers, and we'll continue to focus on some of the issues that we talked about. We'd take market share. We grow by taking market share from the incumbent and expanding our customer base. We will stay focused on that. Our products and capabilities are meeting the evolving needs of those customers and the enterprise customers in particular. We continue to see the benefits of the operating leverage and expanding our margins and growing our adjusted EBITDA. And finally, we continue to focus on increasing free cash flow per share now and over the long term. Thank you all for joining today's call and for your support. Operator, that concludes the call."

Consistent with the SEC's recently issued compliance and disclosure interpretation relating to non-GAAP metrics, we have made some changes to some of our presentation. For example, in the revenue table on Page 3 of this morning's press release, the column labeled Percent Change, Modified and Constant Currency is equivalent to the column labeled Percent Change, Constant Currency found in previous earnings press releases. 
The earnings presentation we will review this morning contains the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. This presentation, along with all of our other earnings materials, are available in the Investor Relations section of the Level 3 website at investors.level3.com. 
The modified prior period results we are discussing today exclude the company's Venezuelan subsidiary that was deconsolidated at the end of the third quarter 2015 and reflect changes made to customer assignments between the wholesale and enterprise channels at the beginning of 2016 due to mergers in certain customers and other changes. 
Unless otherwise noted, in our remarks today, revenue and sales comparisons to prior periods are provided on a year-over-year modified and constant currency basis.
Our safe harbor statement can be found on Page 2 of our 2Q '16 earnings presentation. The presentation and remarks contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may vary significantly from those statements, and additional information is available in the Investor Relations section of the Level 3 website and in our filings with the SEC.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

Our focus on driving profitable revenue growth through taking share in the market has not changed. While results are never linear and North America Enterprise CNS revenue growth was below our expectations, we did see strong year-over-year and sequential CNS revenue growth from large multinational customers. 
We also continue to see the market moving toward Level 3 as our customers' networking requirements continue to grow and require the products and services we offer. Our focus on enterprise wireline services and our ability to solve our customers' challenges is a differentiating factor that is becoming more critical every day.

We grew Core Network Services, or CNS, enterprise revenue by 5.3%. Excluding a contract renewal we mentioned in the press release and U.K. government revenue, we grew CNS enterprise revenue by 6.3%. We increased adjusted EBITDA by 10% to $715 million. And finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $264 million. 
We continue to grow Core Network Services revenue this quarter and saw improvement in both EMEA and LatAm Enterprise CNS revenue. In North America, as noted in the press release, we saw some headwinds in the quarter, mostly due to a onetime event and slightly higher enterprise disconnects at the small end of the customer base. 
Across all 3 regions, we also saw an increase in wholesale customer disconnects, primarily driven by industry consolidation that took place over the last couple of years. Overall, we are now pleased with the revenue performance in the quarter and feel we should be performing better, especially in North America. 
Additionally, as we have seen over the last year, the strength of the dollar against many of the currencies has affected our reported results and lead to differences -- and led to differences in constant currency and actual growth rates. This is shown on Slide 4. 
As you can see on the slide, we provided revenue growth rates by region on both a constant currency and in actual basis. As a reminder, U.S. dollars make up 90% of revenue, followed by the British pound at 4% and the euro at 3%, the Brazilian real at 2% and all other currencies making up the last 1%. Overall, total revenue grew 1.6%, and CNS revenue grew 2.8%. 
Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 5.9%. Revenue from our large multinational customers, which represents 17% of total enterprise CNS revenue, increased 12%. Total Wholesale CNS revenue declined 3.4%, driven by the disconnects I just mentioned. 
On a regional basis, CNS revenue grew 3.5% -- North America CNS revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year with flat performance on a sequential basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.9%, and Wholesale CNS revenue declined 2.2% this quarter. 
This quarter, as we indicated in the press release, enterprise performance experienced some pressure resulting from a renewal and extension of a large contract to the top customer. With this renewal, we issued a $5 million credit in the quarter and extended the length of the contract by 2 years, with more than $100 million in additional revenue expected during the extension period. Excluding the effects of this contract renewal, our North America Enterprise CNS revenue would have grown 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we saw churn increase from a number of smaller, less profitable customers. 
Offsetting the industry consolidation impact in wholesale, we benefited from approximately $10 million in dispute settlements in the quarter. As you may recall, we had a similar amount of dispute settlement in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving to EMEA. In the second quarter, CNS revenue declined 4.6%, with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, growing 1.9%. On a sequential basis, enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew a strong 2.9%. We saw continued strong sales production from enterprise customers, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 7.2%. 
Before we move on from EMEA, one topic that has recently gained attention is Brexit. Many of you have been asking us how this might affect our business in both the short and long term. As I mentioned earlier, the British pound represents approximately 4% of revenue, and the euro, about 3%. Looking back at the second quarter, the average rate for the pound was 1.44. The average rate since Brexit vote on June 23 has been 1.32. 
While it had a minimal effect on our second quarter results, the weaker pound will affect our reported revenue results in the third quarter but will have a minimal impact on adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the rest of 2016. At this point, we've not seen any changes in customer buying patterns because of Brexit. We did not see any customers pause purchases at the end of the quarter based on the vote. And as I mentioned, sales were strong. We expect that Brexit could cause some uncertainty in the region and the macro environment in general over the next couple of years. 
In Latin America, the CNS enterprise revenue remained strong, growing 9.6% year-over-year and 2.5% on a sequential basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 9.4%. Wholesale customer consolidation also affected Wholesale Voice Services revenue, or WVS, which declined 16% to $100 million in the second quarter 2016. For the full year 2016, we now expect WVS revenue to decline by approximately 15%. 
Moving to our revenue mix, which can be found on Slide 5. North America represents 82% of our CNS revenue, followed by EMEA at 10% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 72% of CNS revenue, while wholesale customers make up the remaining 28%. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 5.1%. Transport and fiber grew 0.3%. Voice services declined 4.4%, and colocation and data services grew 14%, mostly due to the settlement in North America wholesale. 
A few highlights from an individual product perspective included managed security growth of 30%, CDN growth of 22% and dark fiber growth of 13%. From a sales or bookings perspective, for the second quarter, total sales production as well as sales productivity continued to improve. Sequentially, we saw sales production increase in all of the regions we serve. 
From a headcount perspective, we added both quota- and nonquota-bearing headcount to our sales organization. We increased QBHC by roughly 20 in the quarter. At the same time, we added 5 specialized nonquota-bearing security and CDN sales representatives to help identify and close opportunities for these growth products. From a pricing standpoint, we've not seen much overall change over the last several quarters. 
Moving to Slide 7. Network Access margin expanded to 67.1% compared to 66.0% in the second quarter 2015. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven by continued high-margin CNS growth, combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines and the settlement that I mentioned earlier, which was 100% margin. We expect continued margin expansion for the remainder of the year as we tightly manage third-party costs. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $715 million for the second quarter 2016. This compares to $650 million in the second quarter of 2015. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven by continued high-margin CNS growth, combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines. We also expect or continue to -- we also continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 34.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 31.9% in the second quarter of 2015. 
Year-to-date, capital expenditures were approximately 16% of total revenue. As a reminder, CapEx can be lumpy in any one quarter, and for the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 15% of total revenue. 
The company generated free cash flow of $264 million in the quarter compared to $90 million from the year-ago quarter. 
During the quarter, we successfully completed the refinancing of approximately $775 million in senior notes. As a result, the company incurred a loss on extinguishment and modification of debt before taxes of $40 million or approximately $0.11 in basic earnings per share. 
We exited the quarter with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.5x and remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4x. 
The effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 22%, resulting from the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of our German subsidiary. Year-to-date, our tax rate has been 33%. In the third quarter, we expect our tax rate to be higher than 33%. And for the full year 2016, we continue to expect our GAAP income tax rate to average about 30%. 
As I mentioned earlier, our revenue performance is not yet at a level that we are pleased with. Looking back at the effects of churn on our business from both enterprise and wholesale customers, we are updating our expectations on revenue performance for the full year and now believe that our CNS revenue percentage growth, with the exception of Latin America enterprise revenue growth, will not be as strong as last year. We do expect better enterprise CNS sequential performance for the remainder of the year, in line with growth rates that we have seen in previous quarters. 
Additionally, I would like to note, as we look to the third quarter 2016, it has been a particularly hot summer, and we expect to see our typical increase in utility costs, generally in the high single-digit millions of dollars, resulting from higher summer cooling requirements in our data centers. 
Also, from a North America Wholesale CNS revenue perspective, please keep in mind that we will not see the benefit of the second quarter dispute settlement reoccur in the third quarter. Because of our ongoing focus on profitable revenue growth, combined with our continued disciplined cost management, we remain confident and are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook of 10% to 12% growth, and we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. All other outlook measures remain the same and are highlighted on Slide 9. 
We made a lot of progress on profitability since the acquisition of tw telecom in the fourth quarter of 2014. Prior to the acquisition, Level 3's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% to 29%, and tw telecom's EBITDA margin was 33% to 34%. Today, our adjusted EBITDA margin is about 35%. 
In summary, we continue to make the right investments in the business to drive profitable revenue growth. Our financial position continues to strengthen with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio well within our target range and a cash position at nearly $1.3 billion. We are also focused on delivering better revenue performance for the remainder of the year, especially in our North American enterprise business. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."
30771,369946630,1013612,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sunit. I'd like to make a few additional comments on our revenue growth this quarter and provide our updated view of the market and the opportunity. On the wholesale side, we said for the past 3 or 4 years that we generally expect Wholesale C",1292,"Thank you, Sunit. I'd like to make a few additional comments on our revenue growth this quarter and provide our updated view of the market and the opportunity. 
On the wholesale side, we said for the past 3 or 4 years that we generally expect Wholesale CNS revenue to be flat to slightly down over the long term. We maintain that view, and nothing about the long-term wholesale opportunity is surprising to us. Just as we continue to reduce our Network Access costs, enabled both by the tw telecom acquisition and our targeted network grooming activities, we see our wholesale customers doing the same with their own network costs. 
The timing of disconnects in the quarter was slightly surprising. And although we anticipated them over the long term, recently, we've seen more than expected. Having said that, these disconnects were largely the delayed result of wireless consolidation over the last couple of years. 
From an overall enterprise market perspective, our view of the opportunity has not changed. Market needs have been evolving. And as we've expected, customers whose networking capabilities are an integral part in driving the success of their own businesses need more and more bandwidth. They need sophisticated and adaptive security services to defend against escalating attacks. They want a smooth migration path to the cloud to help capture efficiencies in their businesses and to support their digital infrastructure. They require the ability to easily address all of their networking needs, including voice and video. And they want to address these challenges on a global basis. All of these requirements are not only still true but are accelerating for our large and multinational customers. 
Looking at enterprise revenue in North America, we saw several factors affect revenue growth, some beneficial and some challenging. Let me address the challenges first. As Sunit noted, in conjunction with a significant contract extension with one of our largest customers, we incurred a credit during the quarter. While the credit created a headwind on growth in the short term, this was an easy decision for the long term. 
Additionally, we've seen an increase in disconnects from smaller customers. While we don't like losing revenue, disconnects from lower profit or even unprofitable customers are acceptable. In general, we do a better job serving and our profitability is higher with larger customers. Even with the disconnects this quarter, adjusted EBITDA and margins grew nicely, reinforcing our focus on efficiency and profitable revenue as key drivers for us. 
However, to ensure we are managing our customer base appropriately and retaining every customer that makes sense, we have a number of initiatives to better manage that base of smaller customers. On a positive note, as Sunit mentioned, we saw strong growth from our largest customers. These customers tend to have the most advanced and complex network demand and tend to be the early adopters of our products and services. 
To give you an example, Johnson Matthey is a leading global specialties company, whose history dates back as far as the early 1800 as one of Britain's oldest multinational companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, underpinned by science, technology and their people. As a global leader in sustainable technologies, they aim for their products to enhance the quality of life of millions through the beneficial impact on the environment, human health and well-being. They employ 13,000 people in 30 countries worldwide, and their products and services are sold across the world to a wide range of advanced technology industries. 
For example, as the world's largest manufacturer of catalytic converters, around 1/3 of all cars worldwide are fitted with the Johnson Matthey catalysts. Johnson Matthey has historically been managing their information technology and networking environment in-house in a localized fashion with different strategies based on the company's divisions and regions of operation. To support their objective to deliver superior long-term growth, they developed a global transformation program to centralize IT and technology, transitioning many varying strategies into one new vision. 
They view their global networking approach as critical -- as a critical enabler to the overall transformation, and one of the first steps in this large undertaking was to address their disparate network strategies with multiple incumbent vendors to a single, global networking provider. Many of the large global incumbent telcos competed for this business. 
Following a comprehensive RFP process to evaluate the market, Level 3 was selected as the global networking provider based on our global network footprint, our advanced capability to protect the network from security and cyber threats, our capability to provision direct access to key cloud vendors, a mature multiregional account team support program and the ongoing value partnership offered through the continued access to Level 3's expertise and people to support their transitional journey into the future. 
Throughout the process, Level 3 was able to demonstrate increased agility and flexibility over the incumbent providers in areas of technical, commercial and service management. This will see Johnson Matthey relinquishing the responsibility of managing a handful of disparate divisional networks in-house to a single global network managed fully by Level 3, bringing up numerous resources which can now be applied elsewhere to key business transformation initiatives. 
We will be providing Johnson Matthey with a global, fully managed, 130-site network layering managed security, LAN optimization, application performance management, cloud connect services and Voice Complete Services across a single, global platform. We are also providing a comprehensive suite of professional services to simplify the delivery of this complex global solution and to maintain high service levels across the world. Johnson Matthey is an excellent example of a company that relies on their network to transform their operation. Level 3 is uniquely positioned to serve these types of companies. 
I'll spend just a minute on the investments we're making to improve our growth prospects across the board. As I've mentioned before, we are investing in the vision of one, which includes one set of products that we take to an expanding market, one network to deliver those products globally, one set of operational support systems to enable the differentiated customer experience and one team with a singular goal of making Level 3 the premier provider of enterprise networking services. 
From a product perspective, we continue to invest in a comprehensive and developing product portfolio, building on our existing capabilities, whether it's adding offerings to our security portfolio or enabling our hybrid LAN capabilities or continually expanding our cloud connect capabilities. Our goal is to ensure we are meeting our customers' growth, efficiency and security challenges now and in the future. 
We believe that investing to expand our network and build directly to our customers' locations provides a better experience and will facilitate future revenue growth as we add product capabilities to those customers' on-net locations. We've also standardized across the network on a global SDN-enabled Ethernet platform, providing efficiency, both for our customers and for our own operations. 
Operational support systems remain a key focus for the company as well. I believe we have more to do to make it easier across our entire quote-to-bill process. Better systems and better data both drive efficiency, which drives effectiveness, resulting in a better customer experience and enabling greater sales. In other words, operational excellence drives growth. 
Beyond investing in the business, I want to take a minute to address the topic of capital allocation. We don't have an update at this time, but I wanted to note that we've heard your suggestions on our options for deploying any excess cash. We continue to work closely with our Board of Directors on the best and highest use of that cash, including M&A and the potential return of cash to stockholders. 
With that, let's get to your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

I think we're in decent shape as the margin expansion progress we've made demonstrates. And we continue to remain focused on organic revenue growth and continued EBITDA growth. So we're down to then M&A and returning capital to shareholders. On the returning capital to shareholders, as Jeff pointed out, I think this is a subject that we are in continued discussions with the board. Don't have an update at this point in time, but it is important to us. It's front and center. I think that's the key message from us. We're not yet at the low end of our leverage ratio, which is that we've said we want to be at the low end of 3 to 4, which means at 3x, but we're obviously making good progress to get there in the next few quarters."

It seems like the area of weakness is more so churn than it is bookings. You continue to message that bookings trends are doing well. And I'm just trying to get a better sense of how much visibility you have on churn. It seems like you kind of got caught off guard this quarter, and, I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of what's to prevent that from happening in the third and fourth quarter and really on a go-forward basis. And then my other question has to do with M&A. When I think about the types of businesses that could be of interest to you, fiber companies, perhaps data center collocation companies, those companies, from what I understand, trade at multiples well above where you trade at least right now on an EBITDA basis and at least at this point are less focused on free cash flow. Would that prevent you from chasing or going after those types of deals? Because the mandate you've given out to investors has been a focus on improving free cash flow per share. And does that, to some degree, restrict what you're really able to go after? And with that said, it seems like the likelihood of M&A then is pretty small."

As you pointed out, the bookings trends are positive and strong. We generally know what our install intervals are from the time we get a customer order, and that's been predictable. The churn has been relatively steady. It's picked up. I would say within the quarter, really, there are 2 things that it's tough to have visibility into. One, customers that are going to disconnect, we don't typically know ahead of time. Remember, in the wholesale business, these are carriers. I think while we knew the consolidation had happened, we hadn't seen any activity for a while, and it sort of all showed up in 1 quarter across all 3 regions. Some of that, as Jeff pointed out, will continue, but it's tough to evaluate the timing. And so it's tough to have visibility on that. Then customers don't tell you, especially on the wholesale side, when they're going to disconnect some service. They don't have to because they only have 30 days notice. So I think that one was surprising, and it was the same thing across all 3 regions: large carriers, consolidation activity and grooming activity. With respect to the enterprise business, again, when you look at the 3 regions that we have, North America being the largest, in general, our visibility is pretty good. I think the contract extension, that was tough to see a quarter ahead of time. But as we -- as Jeff pointed out, we are very happy with that outcome. We think that's a great outcome for us. The churn picking up in the smaller customer base, some of that was unprofitable customers. Having said that, we certainly didn't like losing some of these customers. And as Jeff pointed out, we've taken measures to make sure that we are taking better care of those customers at the smaller end within our inside sales group or even, in some cases, coverage within a GM's purview within a city. So we are going to stay pretty focused on that. So I think from a visibility perspective, and the other thing with respect to your question on third and fourth quarter, we do feel we should see pretty good trends comparable to what we've seen in previous quarters with respect to North America enterprise and overall sequential performance in that sort of 1.5% to 2% type performance. So we did hit a speed bump in the quarter. No, it had been tough to get full visibility into it for all the reasons I explained, but -- and we've got a long track record of churn being quite predictable. Just this quarter was a little tougher."

I think that we have lots of M&A opportunities out there in that while we are focused on free cash flow per share, that is not our sole focus. We're also focused on being a growth company. And so we make decisions every day that balance our free cash flow per share with our growth. For example, capital. We could cut our capital spending significantly and drive great free cash flow per share for a short while, but we're not focused on that. We're focused on being a growth company and driving the free cash flow per share. So as we look at M&A, and you mentioned fiber companies, we look at fiber companies post synergies and believe that we are very good at acquiring and capturing synergies and moving networks together, combining networks and creating value for shareholders through that. And so I don't feel that the M&A environment is necessarily constrained. I think that we're going to be smart. We don't have to do M&A. We're going to be smart about the things we're going -- that we do. We'll continue to be disciplined in our decision-making with a variety of factors, not just one, but with a variety of factors. And I mention every single time, our free cash flow per share target, and so that is an important aspect of the guidelines that Sunit and I use internally, but so is being a growth company and being efficient in the market."

And you were right, Eric, in characterizing it that way. There are lots of reasons that customers disconnect. Sunit was talking about the wholesale consolidation, and that was from carriers that had done some wireless combinations a couple of years ago. We knew those disconnects were coming. We didn't expect them maybe to come at the pace that they did. Some of them we thought we'd get last year, we didn't get last year. But -- so we don't really know the timing, but we knew the magnitude of them. Within the enterprise space, customers can disconnect from one of our products and services and go to another of our products and services as they transition to newer and advanced technologies. They can leave us. They can just disconnect an old platform as they migrate locations to some other locations. So there are a variety of different reasons. What we saw in the second quarter more than we expected was the low end of our customer base. And so those -- Sunit talked about a little bit of the efforts that we're going to do to make sure we're paying attention to them. We want to look at them from a full customer life cycle management perspective, make sure we're talking to them, make sure we have account reps assigned to them, that we're dealing with them and those that are not profitable, that we help migrate off our services.

Again, based on what we know today, we think that our churn will get back to -- will trend back down again. The -- it's not as big a portion of our business per se, but certainly, churn on the margin picking up in a quarter does hurt as the performance showed. With respect to the contract renewal, yes, it wasn't like the contract was expiring in the next year or 2. We had some couple of years, a year or so, 1 to 2 years left on them. So it's a 2-year extension, which we think is very good because we've already made the investment, and so we just get a lot more profitability out of that contract with the extension.

With respect to the market and what do we see in the market, yes, I talk about this a lot, and I hate to sound like a broken record for you, guys, but the market is good for our products and services. All of the trends that we see customers needing in the future are coming through, more and more bandwidth, increased complexity as they have to create hybrid networks for tying their own data centers together or content distribution in some places, the [indiscernible] services and others. The mix of networking challenges they have fit our product portfolio very well, all the while, the increasing security challenges, where we can give them advanced threat intelligence. We can work with them to really protect their network, to protect their data, to protect their enterprises. So the market dynamics are continuing exactly as we talked about for the past couple of years. We're seeing them. The timing is always hard to predict. I think it will continue to accelerate. It has been accelerating. I think it will continue to accelerate for a while. It gives us great opportunity to take share. To your point, Tim, we take share in the market. That's how we want to grow, by going to our -- the customers -- the potential customers that are out there and saying, ""Transition to a new network, to new technologies and do that through Level 3."" And just like Jason -- Johnson Matthey, we can help you solve your global networking challenges. Whether they're voice services or security services or transport services, we can help you solve them because we have a wide product array over a global footprint with -- and yet we're still nimble and agile and flexible in the way that we can deal with the customers. And so we are absolutely focused on taking advantage of that market opportunity to create share, take share from those customers. And Sunit referenced that our largest customers, which I think was about 17% of our revenue, grew at 12%, and that is a good growth rate for us among those customers. And that -- they are the vanguard of the companies that are making these transitions. But I believe the transitions happen for all customers that are out there. Now with respect to us being part of a bigger organization, I want to be part of a bigger organization, but I want to grow it organically. I want us continue to grow, satisfy our customers' need. But we have to remain flexible, we have to remain nimble because that's how we win. We win by differentiating our experience against these massive companies that are out there. And so we don't comment on any rumors or speculations about one M&A project or another, but we do know that we control our own destiny, and that our ability to execute is what determines our success. And so we are going to stay focused on growing with our customers on maintaining the nimble character of Level 3 and the flexible character of Level 3 but delivering those services globally for our customers in more and richer and deeper ways of interconnecting with them. And so we are focused on our own execution.
Thank you, all, for taking the call. I'd like to close with just a few thoughts. We've talked about expanding margins. We've talked about our sequential growth in EMEA. We think that we're making good progress there. We talked about our strong growth in Latin America, both sequentially and year-over-year, and our CNS -- enterprise CNS revenue. And so we're pleased with that. We're not yet pleased with our -- we're not pleased this quarter with our revenue growth in North America, but we are focused on it. We are attendant to it and believe that we're making great progress with our customers. And we'll continue to focus on some of the issues that we talked about. We take market share. We grow by taking market share from the incumbent and expanding our customer base. We will stay focused on that. Our products and capabilities are meeting the evolving needs of those customers and enterprise customers in particular. We continue to see the benefits of the operating leverage and expanding our margins and growing our adjusted EBITDA. And finally, we continue to focus on increasing free cash flow per share now and over the long term.

Consistent with the SEC's recently issued compliance and disclosure interpretation relating to non-GAAP metrics, we have made some changes to some of our presentation. For example, in the revenue table on Page 3 of this morning's press release, the column labeled Percent Change, Modified and Constant Currency is equivalent to the column labeled Percent Change, Constant Currency found in previous earnings press releases. 
The earnings presentation we will review this morning contains the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. This presentation, along with all of our other earnings materials, are available in the Investor Relations section of the Level 3 website at investors.level3.com. 
The modified prior period results we are discussing today exclude the company's Venezuelan subsidiary that was deconsolidated at the end of the third quarter 2015 and reflect changes made to customer assignments between the wholesale and enterprise channels at the beginning of 2016 due to mergers in certain customers and other changes. 
Unless otherwise noted, in our remarks today, revenue and sales comparisons to prior periods are provided on a year-over-year modified and constant currency basis.
Our safe harbor statement can be found on Page 2 of our 2Q '16 earnings presentation. The presentation and remarks contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may vary significantly from those statements, and additional information is available in the Investor Relations section of the Level 3 website and in our filings with the SEC.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you can see from our results, we continue to see good margin expansion, growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, solid sequential growth in EMEA Enterprise CNS revenue and strong growth in both sequential and year-over-year LatAm Enterprise CNS revenue. While we're pleased with our overall performance, we were not pleased with the revenue growth in North America Enterprise CNS and believe we have room to improve. 
Our focus on driving profitable revenue growth through taking share in the market has not changed. While results are never linear and North America Enterprise CNS revenue growth was below our expectations, we did see strong year-over-year and sequential CNS revenue growth from large multinational customers. 
We also continue to see the market moving toward Level 3 as our customers' networking requirements continue to grow and require the products and services we offer. Our focus on enterprise wireline services and our ability to solve our customers' challenges is a differentiating factor that is becoming more critical every day. Sunit will go into more detail that our capital investments, our relentless focus on execution and the operating leverage we gain from scale and efficiency are consistent with our guiding principles of managing the business for growth and increasing free cash flow per share.

30771,369946630,1013773,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly share a few financial highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. We grew Core Network Services or CNS Enterprise revenue by 5.3%. Excluding a contract renewal",1720,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly share a few financial highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. 
We grew Core Network Services or CNS Enterprise revenue by 5.3%. Excluding a contract renewal we mentioned in the press release and U.K. government revenue, we grew CNS Enterprise revenue by 6.3%. We increased adjusted EBITDA by 10% to $715 million. And finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $264 million. 
We continued to grow Core Network Services revenue this quarter and saw improvement in both EMEA and LatAm Enterprise CNS revenue. In North America, as noted in the press release, we saw some headwinds in the quarter, mostly due to a onetime event and slightly higher enterprise disconnects at the small end of the customer base. 
Across all 3 regions, we also saw an increase in wholesale customer disconnects, primarily driven by industry consolidation that took place over the last couple of years. Overall, we are not pleased with the revenue performance in the quarter and feel we should be performing better, especially in North America. 
Additionally, as we have seen over the last year, the strength of the dollar against many of the currencies has affected our reported results and leads to differences -- and led to differences in constant currency and actual growth rates. This is shown on Slide 4. 
As you can see on the slide, we provided revenue growth rates by region on both a constant currency and an actual basis. As a reminder, U.S. dollars make up 90% of revenue, followed by the British pound at 4% and the euro at 3%, the Brazilian real at 2% and all other currencies making up the last 1%. Overall, total revenue grew 1.6%, and CNS revenue grew 2.8%. 
Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 5.9%. Revenue from our large multinational customers, which represents 17% of total Enterprise CNS revenue, increased 12%. Total Wholesale CNS revenue declined 3.4%, driven by the disconnects I just mentioned. 
On a regional basis, CNS revenue grew 3.5% -- North America CNS revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year with flat performance on a sequential basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.9%, and Wholesale CNS revenue declined 2.2% this quarter. 
This quarter, as we indicated in the press release, enterprise performance experienced some pressure resulting from a renewal and extension of a large contract with a top customer. With this renewal, we issued a $5 million credit in the quarter and extended the length of the contract by 2 years, with more than $100 million in additional revenue expected during the extension period. Excluding the effects of this contract renewal, our North America Enterprise CNS revenue would have grown 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we saw churn increase from a number of smaller, less profitable customers. 
Offsetting the industry consolidation impact in Wholesale, we benefited from approximately $10 million in dispute settlements in the quarter. As you may recall, we had a similar amount of dispute settlement in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving to EMEA. In the second quarter, CNS revenue declined 4.6%, with Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, growing 1.9%. On a sequential basis, Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew a strong 2.9%. We saw continued strong sales production from enterprise customers, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 7.2%. 
Before we move on from EMEA, one topic that has recently gained attention is Brexit. Many of you have been asking us how this might affect our business in both the short and long term. As I mentioned earlier, the British pound represents approximately 4% of revenue, and the euro, about 3%. Looking back at the second quarter, the average rate for the pound was 1.44. The average rate since Brexit vote on June 23 has been 1.32. 
While it had a minimal effect on our second quarter results, the weaker pound will affect our reported revenue results in the third quarter but will have a minimal impact on adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the rest of 2016. At this point, we've not seen any changes in customer buying patterns because of Brexit. We did not see any customers pause purchases at the end of the quarter based on the vote. And as I mentioned, sales were strong. We expect that Brexit could cause some uncertainty in the region and the macro environment in general over the next couple of years. 
In Latin America, the CNS Enterprise revenue remained strong, growing 9.6% year-over-year and 2.5% on a sequential basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 9.4%. Wholesale customer consolidation also affected Wholesale Voice Services revenue, or WVS, which declined 16% to $100 million in the second quarter 2016. For the full year 2016, we now expect WVS revenue to decline by approximately 15%. 
Moving to our revenue mix, which can be found on Slide 5. North America represents 82% of our CNS revenue, followed by EMEA at 10% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 72% of CNS revenue, while wholesale customers make up the remaining 28%. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 5.1%. Transport and fiber grew 0.3%. Voice services declined 4.4%, and colocation and data services grew 14%, mostly due to the settlement in North America wholesale. 
A few highlights from an individual product perspective included managed security growth of 30%, CDN growth of 22% and dark fiber growth of 13%. From a sales or bookings perspective, for the second quarter, total sales production as well as sales productivity continued to improve. Sequentially, we saw sales production increase in all of the regions we serve. 
From a headcount perspective, we added both quota- and non-quota bearing headcount to our sales organization. We increased QBHC by roughly 20 in the quarter. At the same time, we added 5 specialized non-quota bearing security and CDN sales representatives to help identify and close opportunities for these growth products. From a pricing standpoint, we've not seen much overall change over the last several quarters. 
Moving to Slide 7. Network Access margin expanded to 67.1% compared to 66.0% in the second quarter 2015. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven by continued high-margin CNS growth, combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines and the settlement that I mentioned earlier, which was 100% margin. We expect continued margin expansion for the remainder of the year as we tightly manage third-party costs. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $715 million for the second quarter 2016. This compares to $650 million in the second quarter of 2015. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven by continued high-margin CNS growth, combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines. We also expect or continue to -- we also continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 34.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 31.9% in the second quarter of 2015. 
Year-to-date, capital expenditures were approximately 16% of total revenue. As a reminder, CapEx can be lumpy in any one quarter, and for the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 15% of total revenue. 
The company generated free cash flow of $264 million in the quarter compared to $90 million from the year-ago quarter. 
During the quarter, we successfully completed the refinancing of approximately $775 million in senior notes. As a result, the company incurred a loss on extinguishment and modification of debt before taxes of $40 million or approximately $0.11 in basic earnings per share. 
We exited the quarter with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.5x and remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4x. 
The effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 22%, resulting from the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of our German subsidiary. Year-to-date, our tax rate has been 33%. In the third quarter, we expect our tax rate to be higher than 33%. And for the full year 2016, we continue to expect our GAAP income tax rate to average about 30%. 
As I mentioned earlier, our revenue performance is not yet at a level that we are pleased with. Looking back at the effects of churn on our business from both enterprise and wholesale customers, we are updating our expectations on revenue performance for the full year and now believe that our CNS revenue percentage growth, with the exception of Latin America enterprise revenue growth, will not be as strong as last year. We do expect better Enterprise CNS sequential performance for the remainder of the year, in line with growth rates that we have seen in previous quarters. 
Additionally, I would like to note, as we look to the third quarter 2016, it has been a particularly hot summer, and we expect to see our typical increase in utility costs, generally in the high single-digit millions of dollars, resulting from higher summer cooling requirements in our data centers. 
Also, from a North America Wholesale CNS revenue perspective, please keep in mind that we will not see the benefit of the second quarter dispute settlement reoccur in the third quarter. Because of our ongoing focus on profitable revenue growth, combined with our continued disciplined cost management, we remain confident and are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook of 10% to 12% growth, and we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. All other outlook measures remain the same and are highlighted on Slide 9. 
We made a lot of progress on profitability since the acquisition of tw telecom in the fourth quarter of 2014. Prior to the acquisition, Level 3's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% to 29%, and tw telecom's EBITDA margin was 33% to 34%. Today, our adjusted EBITDA margin is about 35%. 
In summary, we continue to make the right investments in the business to drive profitable revenue growth. Our financial position continues to strengthen with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio well within our target range and a cash position at nearly $1.3 billion. We are also focused on delivering better revenue performance for the remainder of the year, especially in our North American enterprise business. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."
30771,369946630,1013773,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sunit. I'd like to make a few additional comments on our revenue growth this quarter and provide our updated view of the market and the opportunity. On the wholesale side, we've said for the past 3 or 4 years that we generally expect Wholesal",1292,"Thank you, Sunit. I'd like to make a few additional comments on our revenue growth this quarter and provide our updated view of the market and the opportunity. 
On the wholesale side, we've said for the past 3 or 4 years that we generally expect Wholesale CNS revenue to be flat to slightly down over the long term. We maintain that view and nothing about the long-term wholesale opportunity is surprising to us. Just as we continue to reduce our Network Access costs, enabled both by the tw telecom acquisition and our targeted network grooming activities, we see our wholesale customers doing the same with their own network costs. 
The timing of disconnects in the quarter was slightly surprising. And although we anticipated them over the long term, recently, we've seen more than expected. Having said that, these disconnects were largely the delayed result of wireless consolidation over the last couple of years. 
From an overall enterprise market perspective, our view of the opportunity has not changed. Market needs have been evolving. And as we've expected, customers whose networking capabilities are an integral part in driving the success of their own businesses need more and more bandwidth. They need sophisticated and adaptive security services to defend against escalating attacks. They want a smooth migration path to the cloud to help capture efficiencies in their businesses and to support their digital infrastructure. They require the ability to easily address all of their networking needs, including voice and video. And they want to address these challenges on a global basis. All of these requirements are not only still true but are accelerating for our large and multinational customers. 
Looking at enterprise revenue in North America, we saw several factors affect revenue growth, some beneficial and some challenging. Let me address the challenges first. As Sunit noted, in conjunction with a significant contract extension with one of our largest customers, we incurred a credit during the quarter. While the credit created a headwind on growth in the short term, this was an easy decision for the long term. 
Additionally, we've seen an increase in disconnects from smaller customers. While we don't like losing revenue, disconnects from lower profit or even unprofitable customers are acceptable. In general, we do a better job serving and our profitability is higher with larger customers. Even with the disconnects this quarter, adjusted EBITDA and margins grew nicely, reinforcing our focus on efficiency and profitable revenue as key drivers for us. 
However, to ensure we are managing our customer base appropriately and retaining every customer that makes sense, we have a number of initiatives to better manage that base of smaller customers. On a positive note, as Sunit mentioned, we saw strong growth from our largest customers. These customers tend to have the most advanced and complex network demands and tend to be the early adopters of our products and services. 
To give you an example, Johnson Matthey is a leading global specialties company, whose history dates back as far as the early 1800s as one of Britain's oldest multinational companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, underpinned by science, technology and their people. As a global leader in sustainable technologies, they aim for their products to enhance the quality of life of millions through the beneficial impact on the environment, human health and well-being. They employ 13,000 people in 30 countries worldwide, and their products and services are sold across the world to a wide range of advanced technology industries. 
For example, as the world's largest manufacturer of catalytic converters, around 1/3 of all cars worldwide are fitted with a Johnson Matthey catalyst. Johnson Matthey has historically been managing their information technology and networking environment in-house in a localized fashion with different strategies based on the company's divisions and regions of operation. To support their objective to deliver superior long-term growth, they developed a global transformation program to centralize IT and technology, transitioning many varying strategies into one new vision. 
They view their global networking approach as critical -- as a critical enabler to the overall transformation, and one of the first steps in this large undertaking was to address their disparate network strategies with multiple incumbent vendors to a single, global networking provider. Many of the large global incumbent telcos competed for this business. 
Following a comprehensive RFP process to evaluate the market, Level 3 was selected as the global networking provider based on our global network footprint, our advanced capability to protect the network from security and cyber threats, our capability to provision direct access to key cloud vendors, a mature multiregional account team support program and the ongoing value partnership offered through the continued access to Level 3's expertise and people to support their transitional journey into the future. 
Throughout the process, Level 3 was able to demonstrate increased agility and flexibility over the incumbent providers in areas of technical, commercial and service management. This will see Johnson Matthey relinquishing the responsibility of managing a handful of disparate divisional networks in-house to a single global network managed fully by Level 3, freeing up numerous resources which can now be applied elsewhere to key business transformation initiatives. 
We will be providing Johnson Matthey with a global, fully managed, 130-site network layering managed security, LAN optimization, application performance management, cloud connect services and Voice Complete Services across a single, global platform. We are also providing a comprehensive suite of professional services to simplify the delivery of this complex global solution and to maintain high service levels across the world. Johnson Matthey is an excellent example of a company that relies on their network to transform their operation. Level 3 is uniquely positioned to serve these types of companies. 
I'll spend just a minute on the investments we're making to improve our growth prospects across the board. As I've mentioned before, we are investing in the vision of one, which includes one set of products that we take to an expanding market, one network to deliver those products globally, one set of operational support systems to enable a differentiated customer experience and one team with the singular goal of making Level 3 the premier provider of enterprise networking services. 
From a product perspective, we continue to invest in a comprehensive and evolving product portfolio, building on our existing capabilities, whether it's adding offerings to our security portfolio or enabling our hybrid LAN capabilities or continually expanding our cloud connect capabilities. Our goal is to ensure we are meeting our customers' growth, efficiency and security challenges now and in the future. 
We believe that investing to expand our network and build directly to our customers' locations provides a better experience and will facilitate future revenue growth as we add product capabilities to those customers' on-net locations. We've also standardized across the network on a global SDN-enabled Ethernet platform, providing efficiency, both for our customers and for our own operations. 
Operational support systems remain a key focus for the company as well. I believe we have more to do to make it easier across our entire quote-to-bill process. Better systems and better data both drive efficiency which drives effectiveness, resulting in a better customer experience and enabling greater sales. In other words, operational excellence drives growth. 
Beyond investing in the business, I want to take a minute to address the topic of capital allocation. We don't have an update at this time, but I wanted to note that we've heard your suggestions on our options for deploying any excess cash. We continue to work closely with our Board of Directors on the best and highest use of that cash, including M&A and the potential return of cash to stockholders.

And then as far as M&A and return of capital goes, I think as we've said for some time, we were focused on integrating and putting both the companies together. I think we're in decent shape there as the margin expansion progress we've made demonstrates. And we continue to remain focused on organic revenue growth and continued EBITDA growth. So we're down to then M&A and returning capital to shareholders. On the returning capital to shareholders, as Jeff pointed out, I think this is a subject that we are in continued discussions with the board. Don't have an update at this point in time, but it is important to us. It's front and center. I think that's the key message from us. We're not yet at the low end of our leverage ratio, which is that we've said we want to be at the low end of 3 to 4, which means at 3x, but we're obviously making good progress to get there in the next few quarters."

You continue to message that the bookings trends are doing well. And I'm just trying to get a better sense of how much visibility you have on churn. It seems like you kind of got caught off guard this quarter, and, I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of what's to prevent that from happening in the third and fourth quarter and really on a go-forward basis. And then my other question has to do with M&A. When I think about the types of businesses that could be of interest to you, fiber companies, perhaps data center collocation companies, those companies, from what I understand, trade at multiples well above where you trade at least right now on an EBITDA basis and at least at this point are less focused on free cash flow. Would that prevent you from chasing or going after those types of deals? Because the mandate you've given out to investors has been a focus on improving free cash flow per share. And does that, to some degree, restrict what you're really able to go after? And with that said, it seems like the likelihood of M&A, then, is pretty small."

As you pointed out, the bookings trends are positive and strong. We generally know what our install intervals are from the time we get a customer order, and that's been predictable. The churn has been relatively steady. It's picked up. I would say within the quarter, really, there are 2 things that it's tough to have visibility into. One, customers that are going to disconnect, we don't typically know ahead of time. Remember, in the wholesale business, these are carriers. I think while we knew the consolidation had happened, we haven't seen any activity for a while, and it sort of all showed up in 1 quarter across all 3 regions. Some of that, as Jeff pointed out, will continue, but it's tough to evaluate the timing. And so it's tough to have visibility on that. Then customers don't tell you, especially on the wholesale side, when they're going to disconnect some service. They don't have to. So you only have 30-days notice. So I think that one was surprising, and it was the same thing across all 3 regions: large carriers, consolidation activity and grooming activity. With respect to the enterprise business, again, when you look at the 3 regions that we have, North America being the largest, in general, our visibility is pretty good. I think the contract extension, that was tough to see a quarter ahead of time. But as we -- as Jeff pointed out, we are very happy with that outcome. We think that's a great outcome for us. The churn picking up in the smaller customer base, some of that was unprofitable customers. Having said that, we certainly didn't like losing some of these customers. And as Jeff pointed out, we've taken measures to make sure that we are taking better care of those customers at the smaller end within our inside sales group or even, in some cases, coverage within a GM's purview within a city. So we are going to stay pretty focused on that. So I think from a visibility perspective -- and the other thing with respect to your question on third and fourth quarter, we do feel we should see pretty good trends comparable to what we've seen in previous quarters with respect to North America enterprise and overall sequential performance in that sort of 1.5% to 2% type performance. So we did hit a speed bump in the quarter. Know [ph] it had been tough to get full visibility into it for all the reasons I explained, but -- and we've got a long track record of churn being quite predictable. Just this quarter was a little tougher."

I think that we have lots of M&A opportunities out there and that while we are focused on free cash flow per share, that is not our sole focus. We're also focused on being a growth company. And so we make decisions every day that balance our free cash flow per share with our growth. For example, capital. We could cut our capital spending significantly and drive great free cash flow per share for a short while, but we're not focused on that. We're focused on being a growth company and driving the free cash flow per share. So as we look at M&A, and you mentioned fiber companies, we look at fiber companies post synergies and believe that we are very good at acquiring and capturing synergies and moving networks together, combining networks and creating value for shareholders through that. And so I don't feel that the M&A environment is necessarily constrained. I think that we're going to be smart. We don't have to do M&A. We're going to be smart about the things we're going -- that we do. We'll continue to be disciplined in our decision-making with a variety of factors, not just one, but with a variety of factors.

And you are right, Eric, in characterizing it that way. There are lots of reasons that customers disconnect. Sunit was talking about the wholesale consolidation, and that was from carriers that had done some wireless combinations a couple of years ago. We knew those disconnects were coming. We didn't expect them maybe to come at the pace that they did. Some of them we thought we'd get last year, we didn't get last year. But -- so we don't really know the timing, but we knew the magnitude of them. Within the enterprise space, customers can disconnect from one of our products and services and go to another of our products and services as they transition to newer and advanced technologies. They can leave us. They can just disconnect an old platform as they migrate locations to some other locations. So there are a variety of different reasons. What we saw in the second quarter more than we expected was the low end of our customer base. And so those -- Sunit talked about a little bit of the efforts that we're going to do to make sure we're paying attention to them. We want to look at them from a full customer life cycle management perspective, make sure we're talking to them, make sure we have account reps assigned to them, that we're dealing with them and those that are not profitable, that we help migrate off our services.

The -- it's not as big a portion of our business per se, but certainly, churn on the margin picking up in a quarter does hurt us as the performance showed. With respect to the contract renewal, yes, it wasn't like the contract was expiring in the next year or 2. We had some couple of years, a year or so, 1 to 2 years left on them. So it's a 2-year extension, which we think is very good because we've already made the investment, and so we just get a lot more profitability out of that contract with the extension.

Whether they're voice services or security services or transport services, we can help you solve them because we have a wide product array over a global footprint with -- and yet we're still nimble and agile and flexible in the way that we can deal with the customers. And so we are absolutely focused on taking advantage of that market opportunity to create share, take share from those customers. And Sunit referenced it. Our largest customers, which I think was about 17% of our revenue, grew at 12%, and that is a good growth rate for us among those customers. And that -- they are the vanguard of the companies that are making these transitions. But I believe the transitions happen for all customers that are out there. Now with respect to us being part of a bigger organization, I want to be part of a bigger organization, but I want to grow it organically. I want us continue to grow, satisfy our customers' needs. But we have to remain flexible, we have to remain nimble because that's how we win. We win by differentiating our experience against these massive companies that are out there. And so we don't comment on any rumors or speculations about one M&A project or another, but we do know that we control our own destiny, and that our ability to execute is what determines our success. And so we are going to stay focused on growing with our customers, on maintaining the nimble character of Level 3 and the flexible character of Level 3 but delivering those services globally for our customers in more and richer and deeper ways of interconnecting with them. And so we are focused on our own execution.
Thank you, all, for taking the call. I'd like to close with just a few thoughts. We've talked about expanding margins. We've talked about our sequential growth in EMEA. We think that we're making good progress there. We talked about our strong growth in Latin America, both sequentially and year-over-year, and our CNS -- Enterprise CNS revenue. And so we're pleased with that. We're not yet pleased with our -- we're not pleased this quarter with our revenue growth in North America, but we are focused on it. We are attentive to it and believe that we're making great progress with our customers. And we'll continue to focus on some of the issues that we talked about. We take market share. We grow by taking market share from the incumbent and expanding our customer base. We will stay focused on that. Our products and capabilities are meeting the evolving needs of those customers and enterprise customers in particular. We continue to see the benefits of the operating leverage and expanding our margins and growing our adjusted EBITDA. And finally, we continue to focus on increasing free cash flow per share now and over the long term. 
Thank you, all, for joining today's call and for your support. Operator, that concludes the call."

Consistent with the SEC's recently issued compliance and disclosure interpretation relating to non-GAAP metrics, we have made some changes to some of our presentation. For example, in the revenue table on Page 3 of this morning's press release, the column labeled Percent Change, Modified and Constant Currency is equivalent to the column labeled Percent Change, Constant Currency found in previous earnings press releases. 
The earnings presentation we will review this morning contains the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. This presentation, along with all of our other earnings materials, are available in the Investor Relations section of the Level 3 website at investors.level3.com. 
The modified prior period results we are discussing today exclude the company's Venezuelan subsidiary that was deconsolidated at the end of the third quarter 2015 and reflect changes made to customer assignments between the wholesale and enterprise channels at the beginning of 2016 due to mergers in certain customers and other changes. 
Unless otherwise noted, in our remarks today, revenue and sales comparisons to prior periods are provided on a year-over-year modified and constant currency basis.
Our safe harbor statement can be found on Page 2 of our 2Q '16 earnings presentation. The presentation and remarks contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may vary significantly from those statements, and additional information is available in the Investor Relations section of the Level 3 website and in our filings with the SEC.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you can see from our results, we continue to see good margin expansion, growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, solid sequential growth in EMEA Enterprise CNS revenue and strong growth in both sequential and year-over-year LatAm Enterprise CNS revenue. While we're pleased with our overall performance, we were not pleased with the revenue growth in North America Enterprise CNS and believe we have room to improve. 
Our focus on driving profitable revenue growth through taking share in the market has not changed. While results are never linear and North America Enterprise CNS revenue growth was below our expectations, we did see strong year-over-year and sequential CNS revenue growth from large multinational customers. 
We also continue to see the market moving toward Level 3 as our customers' networking requirements continue to grow and require the products and services we offer. Our focus on enterprise wireline services and our ability to solve our customers' challenges is a differentiating factor that is becoming more critical every day. Sunit will go into more detail that our capital investments, our relentless focus on execution and the operating leverage we gain from scale and efficiency are consistent with our guiding principles of managing the business for growth and increasing free cash flow per share. 
As usual, after Sunit reviews the detailed financial results, I'll provide commentary on what we're seeing in the market. After that, we will open it up for your questions. Sunit?"
30771,369946630,1014399,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly share a few financial highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. We grew Core Network Services or CNS Enterprise revenue by 5.3%. Excluding a contract renewal",1720,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly share a few financial highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. 
We grew Core Network Services or CNS Enterprise revenue by 5.3%. Excluding a contract renewal we mentioned in the press release and U.K. government revenue, we grew CNS Enterprise revenue by 6.3%. We increased adjusted EBITDA by 10% to $715 million. And finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $264 million. 
We continued to grow Core Network Services revenue this quarter and saw improvement in both EMEA and LatAm Enterprise CNS revenue. In North America, as noted in the press release, we saw some headwinds in the quarter, mostly due to a onetime event and slightly higher enterprise disconnects at the small end of the customer base. 
Across all 3 regions, we also saw an increase in wholesale customer disconnects, primarily driven by industry consolidation that took place over the last couple of years. Overall, we are not pleased with the revenue performance in the quarter and feel we should be performing better, especially in North America. 
Additionally, as we have seen over the last year, the strength of the dollar against many of the currencies has affected our reported results and leads to differences -- and led to differences in constant currency and actual growth rates. This is shown on Slide 4. 
As you can see on the slide, we provided revenue growth rates by region on both a constant currency and an actual basis. As a reminder, U.S. dollars make up 90% of revenue, followed by the British pound at 4% and the euro at 3%, the Brazilian real at 2% and all other currencies making up the last 1%. Overall, total revenue grew 1.6%, and CNS revenue grew 2.8%. 
Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 5.9%. Revenue from our large multinational customers, which represents 17% of total Enterprise CNS revenue, increased 12%. Total Wholesale CNS revenue declined 3.4%, driven by the disconnects I just mentioned. 
On a regional basis, CNS revenue grew 3.5% -- North America CNS revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year with flat performance on a sequential basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.9%, and Wholesale CNS revenue declined 2.2% this quarter. 
This quarter, as we indicated in the press release, enterprise performance experienced some pressure resulting from a renewal and extension of a large contract with a top customer. With this renewal, we issued a $5 million credit in the quarter and extended the length of the contract by 2 years, with more than $100 million in additional revenue expected during the extension period. Excluding the effects of this contract renewal, our North America Enterprise CNS revenue would have grown 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we saw churn increase from a number of smaller, less profitable customers. 
Offsetting the industry consolidation impact in Wholesale, we benefited from approximately $10 million in dispute settlements in the quarter. As you may recall, we had a similar amount of dispute settlement in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving to EMEA. In the second quarter, CNS revenue declined 4.6%, with Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, growing 1.9%. On a sequential basis, Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew a strong 2.9%. We saw continued strong sales production from enterprise customers, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 7.2%. 
Before we move on from EMEA, one topic that has recently gained attention is Brexit. Many of you have been asking us how this might affect our business in both the short and long term. As I mentioned earlier, the British pound represents approximately 4% of revenue, and the euro, about 3%. Looking back at the second quarter, the average rate for the pound was 1.44. The average rate since Brexit vote on June 23 has been 1.32. 
While it had a minimal effect on our second quarter results, the weaker pound will affect our reported revenue results in the third quarter but will have a minimal impact on adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the rest of 2016. At this point, we've not seen any changes in customer buying patterns because of Brexit. We did not see any customers pause purchases at the end of the quarter based on the vote. And as I mentioned, sales were strong. We expect that Brexit could cause some uncertainty in the region and the macro environment in general over the next couple of years. 
In Latin America, the CNS Enterprise revenue remained strong, growing 9.6% year-over-year and 2.5% on a sequential basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 9.4%. Wholesale customer consolidation also affected Wholesale Voice Services revenue, or WVS, which declined 16% to $100 million in the second quarter 2016. For the full year 2016, we now expect WVS revenue to decline by approximately 15%. 
Moving to our revenue mix, which can be found on Slide 5. North America represents 82% of our CNS revenue, followed by EMEA at 10% and Latin America at 8%. Our enterprise customers represent 72% of CNS revenue, while wholesale customers make up the remaining 28%. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. IP and data services grew 5.1%. Transport and fiber grew 0.3%. Voice services declined 4.4%, and colocation and data services grew 14%, mostly due to the settlement in North America wholesale. 
A few highlights from an individual product perspective included managed security growth of 30%, CDN growth of 22% and dark fiber growth of 13%. From a sales or bookings perspective, for the second quarter, total sales production as well as sales productivity continued to improve. Sequentially, we saw sales production increase in all of the regions we serve. 
From a headcount perspective, we added both quota- and non-quota bearing headcount to our sales organization. We increased QBHC by roughly 20 in the quarter. At the same time, we added 5 specialized non-quota bearing security and CDN sales representatives to help identify and close opportunities for these growth products. From a pricing standpoint, we've not seen much overall change over the last several quarters. 
Moving to Slide 7. Network Access margin expanded to 67.1% compared to 66.0% in the second quarter 2015. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven by continued high-margin CNS growth, combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines and the settlement that I mentioned earlier, which was 100% margin. We expect continued margin expansion for the remainder of the year as we tightly manage third-party costs. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $715 million for the second quarter 2016. This compares to $650 million in the second quarter of 2015. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven by continued high-margin CNS growth, combined with low-margin WVS revenue declines. We also expect or continue to -- we also continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 34.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 31.9% in the second quarter of 2015. 
Year-to-date, capital expenditures were approximately 16% of total revenue. As a reminder, CapEx can be lumpy in any one quarter, and for the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 15% of total revenue. 
The company generated free cash flow of $264 million in the quarter compared to $90 million from the year-ago quarter. 
During the quarter, we successfully completed the refinancing of approximately $775 million in senior notes. As a result, the company incurred a loss on extinguishment and modification of debt before taxes of $40 million or approximately $0.11 in basic earnings per share. 
We exited the quarter with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.5x and remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4x. 
The effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 22%, resulting from the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of our German subsidiary. Year-to-date, our tax rate has been 33%. In the third quarter, we expect our tax rate to be higher than 33%. And for the full year 2016, we continue to expect our GAAP income tax rate to average about 30%. 
As I mentioned earlier, our revenue performance is not yet at a level that we are pleased with. Looking back at the effects of churn on our business from both enterprise and wholesale customers, we are updating our expectations on revenue performance for the full year and now believe that our CNS revenue percentage growth, with the exception of Latin America enterprise revenue growth, will not be as strong as last year. We do expect better Enterprise CNS sequential performance for the remainder of the year, in line with growth rates that we have seen in previous quarters. 
Additionally, I would like to note, as we look to the third quarter 2016, it has been a particularly hot summer, and we expect to see our typical increase in utility costs, generally in the high single-digit millions of dollars, resulting from higher summer cooling requirements in our data centers. 
Also, from a North America Wholesale CNS revenue perspective, please keep in mind that we will not see the benefit of the second quarter dispute settlement reoccur in the third quarter. Because of our ongoing focus on profitable revenue growth, combined with our continued disciplined cost management, we remain confident and are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook of 10% to 12% growth, and we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. All other outlook measures remain the same and are highlighted on Slide 9. 
We made a lot of progress on profitability since the acquisition of tw telecom in the fourth quarter of 2014. Prior to the acquisition, Level 3's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% to 29%, and tw telecom's EBITDA margin was 33% to 34%. Today, our adjusted EBITDA margin is about 35%. 
In summary, we continue to make the right investments in the business to drive profitable revenue growth. Our financial position continues to strengthen with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio well within our target range and a cash position at nearly $1.3 billion. We are also focused on delivering better revenue performance for the remainder of the year, especially in our North American enterprise business. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."
30771,369946630,1014399,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sunit. I'd like to make a few additional comments on our revenue growth this quarter and provide our updated view of the market and the opportunity. On the wholesale side, we've said for the past 3 or 4 years that we generally expect Wholesal",1292,"Thank you, Sunit. I'd like to make a few additional comments on our revenue growth this quarter and provide our updated view of the market and the opportunity. 
On the wholesale side, we've said for the past 3 or 4 years that we generally expect Wholesale CNS revenue to be flat to slightly down over the long term. We maintain that view and nothing about the long-term wholesale opportunity is surprising to us. Just as we continue to reduce our Network Access costs, enabled both by the tw telecom acquisition and our targeted network grooming activities, we see our wholesale customers doing the same with their own network costs. 
The timing of disconnects in the quarter was slightly surprising. And although we anticipated them over the long term, recently, we've seen more than expected. Having said that, these disconnects were largely the delayed result of wireless consolidation over the last couple of years. 
From an overall enterprise market perspective, our view of the opportunity has not changed. Market needs have been evolving. And as we've expected, customers whose networking capabilities are an integral part in driving the success of their own businesses need more and more bandwidth. They need sophisticated and adaptive security services to defend against escalating attacks. They want a smooth migration path to the cloud to help capture efficiencies in their businesses and to support their digital infrastructure. They require the ability to easily address all of their networking needs, including voice and video. And they want to address these challenges on a global basis. All of these requirements are not only still true but are accelerating for our large and multinational customers. 
Looking at enterprise revenue in North America, we saw several factors affect revenue growth, some beneficial and some challenging. Let me address the challenges first. As Sunit noted, in conjunction with a significant contract extension with one of our largest customers, we incurred a credit during the quarter. While the credit created a headwind on growth in the short term, this was an easy decision for the long term. 
Additionally, we've seen an increase in disconnects from smaller customers. While we don't like losing revenue, disconnects from lower profit or even unprofitable customers are acceptable. In general, we do a better job serving and our profitability is higher with larger customers. Even with the disconnects this quarter, adjusted EBITDA and margins grew nicely, reinforcing our focus on efficiency and profitable revenue as key drivers for us. 
However, to ensure we are managing our customer base appropriately and retaining every customer that makes sense, we have a number of initiatives to better manage that base of smaller customers. On a positive note, as Sunit mentioned, we saw strong growth from our largest customers. These customers tend to have the most advanced and complex network demands and tend to be the early adopters of our products and services. 
To give you an example, Johnson Matthey is a leading global specialties company, whose history dates back as far as the early 1800s as one of Britain's oldest multinational companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, underpinned by science, technology and their people. As a global leader in sustainable technologies, they aim for their products to enhance the quality of life of millions through the beneficial impact on the environment, human health and well-being. They employ 13,000 people in 30 countries worldwide, and their products and services are sold across the world to a wide range of advanced technology industries. 
For example, as the world's largest manufacturer of catalytic converters, around 1/3 of all cars worldwide are fitted with a Johnson Matthey catalyst. Johnson Matthey has historically been managing their information technology and networking environment in-house in a localized fashion with different strategies based on the company's divisions and regions of operation. To support their objective to deliver superior long-term growth, they developed a global transformation program to centralize IT and technology, transitioning many varying strategies into one new vision. 
They view their global networking approach as critical -- as a critical enabler to the overall transformation, and one of the first steps in this large undertaking was to address their disparate network strategies with multiple incumbent vendors to a single, global networking provider. Many of the large global incumbent telcos competed for this business. 
Following a comprehensive RFP process to evaluate the market, Level 3 was selected as the global networking provider based on our global network footprint, our advanced capability to protect the network from security and cyber threats, our capability to provision direct access to key cloud vendors, a mature multiregional account team support program and the ongoing value partnership offered through the continued access to Level 3's expertise and people to support their transitional journey into the future. 
Throughout the process, Level 3 was able to demonstrate increased agility and flexibility over the incumbent providers in areas of technical, commercial and service management. This will see Johnson Matthey relinquishing the responsibility of managing a handful of disparate divisional networks in-house to a single global network managed fully by Level 3, freeing up numerous resources which can now be applied elsewhere to key business transformation initiatives. 
We will be providing Johnson Matthey with a global, fully managed, 130-site network layering managed security, LAN optimization, application performance management, cloud connect services and Voice Complete Services across a single, global platform. We are also providing a comprehensive suite of professional services to simplify the delivery of this complex global solution and to maintain high service levels across the world. Johnson Matthey is an excellent example of a company that relies on their network to transform their operation. Level 3 is uniquely positioned to serve these types of companies. 
I'll spend just a minute on the investments we're making to improve our growth prospects across the board. As I've mentioned before, we are investing in the vision of one, which includes one set of products that we take to an expanding market, one network to deliver those products globally, one set of operational support systems to enable a differentiated customer experience and one team with the singular goal of making Level 3 the premier provider of enterprise networking services. 
From a product perspective, we continue to invest in a comprehensive and evolving product portfolio, building on our existing capabilities, whether it's adding offerings to our security portfolio or enabling our hybrid LAN capabilities or continually expanding our cloud connect capabilities. Our goal is to ensure we are meeting our customers' growth, efficiency and security challenges now and in the future. 
We believe that investing to expand our network and build directly to our customers' locations provides a better experience and will facilitate future revenue growth as we add product capabilities to those customers' on-net locations. We've also standardized across the network on a global SDN-enabled Ethernet platform, providing efficiency, both for our customers and for our own operations. 
Operational support systems remain a key focus for the company as well. I believe we have more to do to make it easier across our entire quote-to-bill process. Better systems and better data both drive efficiency which drives effectiveness, resulting in a better customer experience and enabling greater sales. In other words, operational excellence drives growth. 
Beyond investing in the business, I want to take a minute to address the topic of capital allocation. We don't have an update at this time, but I wanted to note that we've heard your suggestions on our options for deploying any excess cash. We continue to work closely with our Board of Directors on the best and highest use of that cash, including M&A and the potential return of cash to stockholders.

And then my other question has to do with M&A. When I think about the types of businesses that could be of interest to you, fiber companies, perhaps data center collocation companies, those companies, from what I understand, trade at multiples well above where you trade at least right now on an EBITDA basis and at least at this point are less focused on free cash flow. Would that prevent you from chasing or going after those types of deals? Because the mandate you've given out to investors has been a focus on improving free cash flow per share. And does that, to some degree, restrict what you're really able to go after? And with that said, it seems like the likelihood of M&A, then, is pretty small."

As you pointed out, the bookings trends are positive and strong. We generally know what our install intervals are from the time we get a customer order, and that's been predictable. The churn has been relatively steady. It's picked up. I would say within the quarter, really, there are 2 things that it's tough to have visibility into. One, customers that are going to disconnect, we don't typically know ahead of time. Remember, in the wholesale business, these are carriers. I think while we knew the consolidation had happened, we haven't seen any activity for a while, and it sort of all showed up in 1 quarter across all 3 regions. Some of that, as Jeff pointed out, will continue, but it's tough to evaluate the timing. And so it's tough to have visibility on that. Then customers don't tell you, especially on the wholesale side, when they're going to disconnect some service. They don't have to. So you only have 30-days’ notice. So I think that one was surprising, and it was the same thing across all 3 regions: large carriers, consolidation activity and grooming activity. With respect to the enterprise business, again, when you look at the 3 regions that we have, North America being the largest, in general, our visibility is pretty good. I think the contract extension, that was tough to see a quarter ahead of time. But as we -- as Jeff pointed out, we are very happy with that outcome. We think that's a great outcome for us. The churn picking up in the smaller customer base, some of that was unprofitable customers. Having said that, we certainly didn't like losing some of these customers. And as Jeff pointed out, we've taken measures to make sure that we are taking better care of those customers at the smaller end within our inside sales group or even, in some cases, coverage within a GM's purview within a city. So we are going to stay pretty focused on that. So I think from a visibility perspective -- and the other thing with respect to your question on third and fourth quarter, we do feel we should see pretty good trends comparable to what we've seen in previous quarters with respect to North America enterprise and overall sequential performance in that sort of 1.5% to 2% type performance. So we did hit a speed bump in the quarter. Know [ph] it had been tough to get full visibility into it for all the reasons I explained, but -- and we've got a long track record of churn being quite predictable. Just this quarter was a little tougher."

I think that we have lots of M&A opportunities out there and that while we are focused on free cash flow per share, that is not our sole focus. We're also focused on being a growth company. And so we make decisions every day that balance our free cash flow per share with our growth. For example, capital. We could cut our capital spending significantly and drive great free cash flow per share for a short while, but we're not focused on that. We're focused on being a growth company and driving the free cash flow per share. So as we look at M&A, and you mentioned fiber companies, we look at fiber companies post synergies and believe that we are very good at acquiring and capturing synergies and moving networks together, combining networks and creating value for shareholders through that. And so I don't feel that the M&A environment is necessarily constrained. I think that we're going to be smart. We don't have to do M&A. We're going to be smart about the things we're going -- that we do. We'll continue to be disciplined in our decision-making with a variety of factors, not just one, but with a variety of factors. And I mention every single time, our free cash flow per share target, and so that is an important aspect of the guidelines that Sunit and I use internally, but so is being a growth company and being efficient in the market."

And you are right, Eric, in characterizing it that way. There are lots of reasons that customers disconnect. Sunit was talking about the wholesale consolidation, and that was from carriers that had done some wireless combinations a couple of years ago. We knew those disconnects were coming. We didn't expect them maybe to come at the pace that they did. Some of them we thought we'd get last year, we didn't get last year. But -- so we don't really know the timing, but we knew the magnitude of them. Within the enterprise space, customers can disconnect from one of our products and services and go to another of our products and services as they transition to newer and advanced technologies. They can leave us. They can just disconnect an old platform as they migrate locations to some other locations. So there are a variety of different reasons. What we saw in the second quarter more than we expected was the low end of our customer base. And so those -- Sunit talked about a little bit of the efforts that we're going to do to make sure we're paying attention to them. We want to look at them from a full customer life cycle management perspective, make sure we're talking to them, make sure we have account reps assigned to them, that we're dealing with them and those that are not profitable, that we help migrate off our services. But those that are marginally profitable, see if we can make them more profitable for us but work with them more closely across the life cycle of their customer experience with us."

Again, based on what we know today, we think that our churn will get back to -- will trend back down again. The -- it's not as big a portion of our business per se, but certainly, churn on the margin picking up in a quarter does hurt us as the performance showed. With respect to the contract renewal, yes, it wasn't like the contract was expiring in the next year or 2. We had some couple of years, a year or so, 1 to 2 years left on them. So it's a 2-year extension, which we think is very good because we've already made the investment, and so we just get a lot more profitability out of that contract with the extension. As far as -- there are no specific issues per se to cite other than it's a large customer that did have leverage.

All of the trends that we see customers needing in the future are coming through, more and more bandwidth, increased complexity as they have to create hybrid networks for tying their own data centers together or content distribution in some places that weigh [ph] services and others. The mix of networking challenges they have fit our product portfolio very well, all the while, the increasing security challenges, where we can give them advanced threat intelligence. We can work with them to really protect their network, to protect their data, to protect their enterprises. So the market dynamics are continuing exactly as we talked about for the past couple of years. We're seeing them. The timing is always hard to predict. I think it will continue to accelerate. It has been accelerating. I think it will continue to accelerate for a while. It gives us great opportunity to take share. To your point, Tim, we take share in the market. That's how we want to grow, by going to our -- the customers -- the potential customers that are out there and saying, ""Transition to a new network, to new technologies and do that through Level 3."" And just like Jason -- Johnson Matthey, we can help you solve your global networking challenges. Whether they're voice services or security services or transport services, we can help you solve them because we have a wide product array over a global footprint with -- and yet we're still nimble and agile and flexible in the way that we can deal with the customers. And so we are absolutely focused on taking advantage of that market opportunity to create share, take share from those customers. And Sunit referenced it. Our largest customers, which I think was about 17% of our revenue, grew at 12%, and that is a good growth rate for us among those customers. And that -- they are the vanguard of the companies that are making these transitions. But I believe the transitions happen for all customers that are out there. Now with respect to us being part of a bigger organization, I want to be part of a bigger organization, but I want to grow it organically. I want us continue to grow, satisfy our customers' needs. But we have to remain flexible, we have to remain nimble because that's how we win. We win by differentiating our experience against these massive companies that are out there. And so we don't comment on any rumors or speculations about one M&A project or another, but we do know that we control our own destiny, and that our ability to execute is what determines our success. And so we are going to stay focused on growing with our customers, on maintaining the nimble character of Level 3 and the flexible character of Level 3 but delivering those services globally for our customers in more and richer and deeper ways of interconnecting with them. And so we are focused on our own execution.
Thank you all for taking the call. I'd like to close with just a few thoughts. We've talked about expanding margins. We've talked about our sequential growth in EMEA. We think that we're making good progress there. We talked about our strong growth in Latin America, both sequentially and year-over-year, and our CNS -- Enterprise CNS revenue. And so we're pleased with that. We're not yet pleased with our -- we're not pleased this quarter with our revenue growth in North America, but we are focused on it. We are attentive to it and believe that we're making great progress with our customers. And we'll continue to focus on some of the issues that we talked about. We take market share. We grow by taking market share from the incumbent and expanding our customer base. We will stay focused on that. Our products and capabilities are meeting the evolving needs of those customers and enterprise customers in particular. We continue to see the benefits of the operating leverage and expanding our margins and growing our adjusted EBITDA. And finally, we continue to focus on increasing free cash flow per share now and over the long term.

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. This is an exciting today for CenturyLink and Level 3. Together, we will be the second-largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers. We believe we will create significant benefits and growth opportunities for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
We'll turn to Slide 5. Today marks an important day in advancing our shared visions and strategies. Together, we are creating a customer-centric focus and providing customers leading products and services. We are building scalable and agile network-based services to deliver industry-leading value, and both companies strive to adhere to our core values. Today, we really are announcing a new chapter for both companies.
We'll [ph] turn to Slide 7 to provide some key highlights of the transaction. First of all, the combined -- combined, we will create a leading facilities-based enterprise communications provider. We will have a strong financial profile, with pro forma total business revenue of approximately $19 billion and business strategic revenue of $13 billion. Total revenue, including our consumer business, will be approximately $26 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $11 billion, including synergies. We believe the transaction -- or the strategic combination, rather, will significantly improve CenturyLink's growth profile, and better position the combined company to improve its revenue growth, trend and drive meaningful operating cash flow growth in the first full year of post-closing, including synergies as realized and including integration costs.
Additionally, we believe the combined company will be able to achieve more than 10% growth and free cash flow per share in the full year post-closing, including synergies as realized, and again, including integration cost. We also expect this combination to drive significant improvement in free cash flow per share in subsequent years.
We will also be able to accelerate approximately $10 billion of Level 3 NOLs. These NOLs will significantly reduce the combined company's net cash tax expense, positioning us to create enhanced free cash flow. With that greater financial flexibility, we expect to significantly lower CenturyLink's dividend payout ratio, and this combination also positions us well for future growth. Together, we expect to be able to leverage Level 3's and CenturyLink's strong product portfolios across our combined customer bases. In addition, the increased network scale will provide advantages for our customers in numerous ways.
on [ph] to Slide 8, the transaction is structured in cash and stock, which we believe provides shareholders both immediate value and the ability to participate in the upside of the combination, as we work to realize the significant and compelling benefits of the transaction. CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 for $66.50 per share, which assumed a 60% stock consideration at $40 per share and 40% cash consideration at $26.50 per share. There's implied equity purchase price of approximately $24 billion and an enterprise value of $34 billion. 
Based on those numbers today -- based on those numbers, today's deal represents a premium of approximately 42% based on Level 3's unaffected share price. Once completed, the pro forma company is expected to be approximately 51% owned by CenturyLink shareholders and about 49% owned by Level 3 shareholders. Importantly, the combined company intends to maintain CenturyLink's annual dividend of $2.16 per share. In terms of financing, we have approximately $10.2 billion of financing in place, including a $2 billion unfunded revolver at close. 
Following the close of the transaction, I will continue as Chief Executive Officer and President, and we're pleased to have Sunit Patel join us as Chief Financial Officer. Following almost 35 years of -- at CenturyLink, Stewart Ewing has decided to retire following the close of this transaction. Stewart's been an important, really a vital part of our company, of this transaction and every other deal we've completed over the years. He is committed to seeing us through the integration and closing with Level 3. Stewart's a great leader. He is a good friend and our company is much stronger due to his many valuable contributions over the years.
In terms of board composition, the Chairman of CenturyLink's Board of Directors at the time of close will continue to serve as chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint 4 Level 3 board members, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Telemedia. We'll discuss the pathway to closing in detail later in the presentation, but we expect the transaction to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject of course to the receipt of regulatory approval, shareholder votes and other customary closing conditions. STT Crossing Ltd., which holds 18% of Level 3, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Before I do that, I just -- I do want to thank him and his team for the extraordinary effort they have put forth on this transaction. We've longed admired Level 3, and I'm excited to -- that we are now combining forces. Jeff?"

I'm very excited to be here today with Glen and his team announcing this combination. As you can see from Slide 9, we are 2 strong enterprise-focused companies coming together to build an even stronger company able to address the evolving and growing needs of our customers. As Glen mentioned, we believe this is great transaction for our stockholders, customers, employees and industry partners.
As I look at the enterprise marketplace, there are a number of trends that will shape the future of communications. First of all, the demand for bandwidth continues to escalate. The move to IT and IT-based services is not slowing but accelerating. With the Internet of Things, the number of connected devices will explode over the coming years. Hybrid computing architectures used by enterprises are driving the introduction of hybrid wide-area networking solutions that bring together multiple technologies to meet customer demand. The advent of technologies like SDN and NFV are redefining the ways customers interface with their networks. And lastly, the need to address all of these trends on a global basis.
The combination of these 2 great companies will enhance our ability to meet the opportunities that these trends create. Whether looking at the network footprint or the breadth of the combined product portfolio, this combined company will provide tremendous benefits to our customers.
CenturyLink's managed services portfolio with Level 3's CDN and IP VPN capabilities all delivered over an extensive local and even global network. Our ability to use advanced threat intelligence and security services delivered by the combined company. This creates a company that will offer customers industry-leading capabilities over a world-class network. 
I'd like to take a minute to give my perspective on why this is a compelling transaction for Level 3 stockholders, and why our Board of Directors unanimously approved this transaction. First of all, the purchase price is a premium to where our stock has been trading over the last year, with a meaningful portion of the consideration in cash. Shareholders also have the ability to participate in the upside of the powerful company we are creating together.
I truly believe that our ability to serve enterprise customers will be second to none. Communications is a scale business, and the combination of our substantial networks and platforms will enable us to deliver services to our customers more efficiently and effectively than either company could alone. I believe that our ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a result of this transaction. 
Before I turn the call over to Glen, I'd like to thank the Level 3 employees for their hard work through the years and into the future. Your dedication, vision for the company we are today and your unwavering commitment to our customers has built a great company. I feel lucky to be a part of such an incredible group of employees, and I'm excited to see what the future brings for us. Thank you.

As you can see, CenturyLink and Level 3's businesses are highly complementary. And once the transaction closes, stakeholders will benefit from a more diverse business mix, with pro forma revenue of $24.7 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue; and total core revenue of $24.2 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue and data integration revenue. Under these assumptions, we expect more than 75% of our revenues to come from business customers and 65% of our revenues will be strategic revenue.
As Jeff mentioned a moment ago, we will also have the ability to enhance the service and connectivity we provide CenturyLink's large enterprise customer base across Level 3's global footprint. Given the complementary nature of the product portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet the demand for bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.
Turning now to Slide 11, as you can see, a key differentiator for our company will be that of the top service providers in the country, we have about far [ph] the greatest percentage of our business focused on enterprise customers, and we will become the second-largest competitive provider of network services to businesses in the United States. 
Now turning to Slide 12, we highlight the significant total cash synergies we expect to achieve from this transaction, with $975 million, we believe, are very achievable annual operating and [ph] capital synergies. We expect approximately $850 million in annual operating cost synergies, mostly from corporate network and operational efficiencies and IT systems consolidation, along with purchasing synergies across our advertising and marketing efforts. And we believe we can realize 80% of this annual run rate savings within 36 months after closing.
Our anticipated approximately $125 million in annual CapEx cash savings will come from purchasing synergies, which we expect to be -- to realize fully within 36 months. We currently anticipate that our onetime integration cost to achieve these cash savings will be approximately $685 million, with a majority to be incurred between closing and year-end 2019. Both of our companies have significant M&A experience and a strong track record of execution, with a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. This gives us real confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our 2 companies.

Expanding on what Glen outlined earlier, as you can see on Slide 13, the result of this transaction is a company with meaningful scale and financial strength, which will enable us to grow and capitalize on these synergy opportunities. The combined company's capital structure will benefit from a strong liquidity profile, including an approximately $2 billion unfunded revolver; free cash flow accretion, with a focus on sustainable free cash flow growth; and improvements in our long-term dividend payout ratio.
Our expected free cash flow generation will grant us a flexibility to continue to deliver solid returns, while positioning us to invest in strategic growth initiatives and opportunities, allowing us to better compete in a complex operating environment. On a pro forma basis, we expect the combined company to have net leverage of approximately 3.7x and our long-term leverage target remains at approximately 3x.
Turning to Slide 14, this is an overview of the pro forma arch [ph] structure depicting the combination and the associated new debt raise. The acquisition is structured such that Level 3 will be a subsidiary of CenturyLink post-acquisition. Level 3's current debt will stay in place, and existing Level 3 entities will not incur or guarantee any acquisition debt. Based on expected ratings, change of control puts in the existing Level 3 debt will not be triggered. No consents are required from Level 3 lenders or noteholders for closing the acquisition.  
All the new acquisition debt will be raised at CenturyLink, and will rank ahead of the existing CenturyLink notes by virtue of expected guarantees from material nonregulated CenturyLink subs, including the EMBARQ parent, and the newly created Level 3 holdco. The new debt will also benefit from expected pledge of stock of QC and Level 3 Communications Inc. QC, a regulated entity, will not guarantee or provide explicit support for any new indebtedness.
Purchase price will be funded by cash on hand at closing for both CenturyLink and Level 3, as well as committed financing of $10.2 billion from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley financing, which includes a $2 billion revolver and $1.2 billion commitment to address upcoming maturities between signing and closing, resulting in incremental funded debt for the transaction of approximately $7 billion.

As previously mentioned, the transaction is also subject to approval by CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders, and we're pleased to have secured a voting agreement in favor of the transaction with STT Crossing Ltd. 
Now turning to Slide 16, and to conclude our remarks pertaining to the transaction before touching on our quarterly earnings, we're confident in the compelling strategic and financial rationale of this transaction and the many benefits it will bring to CenturyLink and Level 3 stakeholders. The combined company will provide our customers with the network they need to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses.
For employees of both companies, we believe this combination will also provide additional growth and advancement opportunities over the years to come, and I look forward to continue to work with our best-in-class team, welcoming the talented members of the Level 3 team.  We're truly excited about CenturyLink and Level 3's future as a combined company and sharing those benefits with all stakeholders as we move forward with this exciting combination.
As we transition to third quarter results -- earnings results, I want to provide a few high-level comments about CenturyLink's third quarter results before turning it over to Stewart. We continue to see the benefits of our [ph] operational initiatives and network-first focus, and we are making progress on our broadband enablement road map, which we believe is critical to meeting our customer's long-term growing demand for bandwidth. We remain focused on continuing our pivot to higher-quality broadband customers. And while we still have more improvement to achieve on a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter, we added higher ARPU customers, lower churn and fewer high credit risk -- high risk credit customers in the quarter. So we're making that pivot with our consumer base, and we saw those results -- those trends in the third quarter.
Business strategic service revenues grew 5% year-over-year, led by more than 6% growth in high-speed -- high-bandwidth data service revenues. Business revenue was negatively impacted by churn, along with a renewal of several large customers in the quarter, which included some repricing impact. However, we are pleased with these renewals that will help us to maintain long-term relationships and recontract a significant amount of revenue over extended terms.
And lastly, we are pursuing a number of activities with lower expenses, including a significant reduction in nonemployee-related expenses, and also a reduction of 78 -- 7% to 8% in employee-related costs. We remain focused on continuing -- excuse me, these cost reductions are part of our continued effort to keep costs in line with our revenue streams, will position us for the legacy revenue pressures going into 2017. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart."

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of the fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Now let's dive in. Today, CenturyLink reported solid third quarter results, with total and core revenues, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS, all within our guidance range. Third quarter operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 3.8% decrease from third quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues and a decrease of approximately $100 million in high-cost support revenues due to onetime out-of-period CAF Phase 2 support payments recognized in the third quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher strategic services revenues. Overall, strategic revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year. 
Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.92 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago period. Operating income was $595 million for the third quarter 2016, while we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion during the quarter. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income, was $186 million for the quarter.
You may remember last quarter, we had said that we expected higher cash taxes in the third quarter as the tax payment was deferred from the second quarter. In addition, we made a voluntary pension contribution of $100 million during the third quarter. These 2 items accounted for over $400 million of lower free cash flow in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.28, a decrease from $0.37 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.56, a decrease from $0.70 in the third quarter a year ago. 
Now moving to Slide 19 and our Business segment, in the third quarter, the Business segment generated $2.61 billion  in operating revenues, which decreased $30 million or 1.1% from the same period a year ago. Legacy revenues from the segment declined 7.6% from third quarter last year due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low bandwidth data services revenues.  Third quarter strategic revenue for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to third quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services. On a sequential quarter basis, we had a headwind from the onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 billion -- $10 million that was reported in high-bandwidth data services in the second quarter of this year.  Data integration revenues increased $10 million from third quarter 2015, due primarily to higher CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses increased $16 million or 1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by CPE costs related to the higher data integration revenues.
Now turning to Slide 20, the consumer segment generated $1.47 billion  in operating revenues, a decrease of $37 million or 2.5% from third quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 3.4% year-over-year to $789 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined 8.3% from third quarter a year ago, reflecting access line declines and lower long-distance revenues. Our operating expenses increased $19 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to higher content costs related to our Prism TV service.
Now turning to Slide 21, for fourth quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion, core revenues of $3.86 billion to $3.92 billion and operating cash flow between $1.58 billion and $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to raise from $0.53 to $0.59. In fourth quarter, we expected continued growth and strategic revenues to be offset by anticipated declines in legacy revenues and data integration revenues, resulting in lower fourth quarter 2016 operating revenues compared to third quarter of 2016.  Fourth quarter 2016 operating cash flow is expected to be relatively flat compared to third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the anticipated decline in revenues being offset by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the seasonality of [indiscernible] plant maintenance and utility costs, along with anticipated lower personnel and CPE costs. Additionally, as it pertains to the fourth quarter, we expect to incur severance costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million related to planned headcount reductions. These severance costs will be treated as a special item and are therefore excluded from fourth quarter guidance ranges provided.  As the fourth quarter guidance implies, we are currently expecting to come in below full year 2016 guidance ranges previously provided for certain financial metrics. This is primarily due to the weakness that we've experienced in customer units during the third, second and third quarter. We expect our dividend payout ratio to be in the mid-60% range now for 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to briefly discuss Level 3's third quarter results."

During the quarter, the benefits of our operating leverage and focus on profitable growth drove solid bottom-line performance. Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. However, from an enterprise core network services revenue perspective, I'm still not happy with our results. We did not see the improvement in CNS enterprise revenue growth in North America or in EMEA that we expect. Since our second quarter call, we spent quite a bit of time analyzing our own performance and addressing the issues we've identified. I will let them go to the numbers but I'll share a few thoughts about North America before handing the call over to him. 
First of all, a logical question is whether the revenue slowdown is associated with a lack of market opportunity for the types of products and services we sell. The answer to this is a firm and clear no. We continue to see market opportunity and demand for the services we provide. As examples, demand for transport services such as waves and dark fiber is strong, and we remain very capable in selling and delivering these services to customers. Cloud connect solutions, IT services, IT VPNs and hybrid LAN continue to address the key need in the marketplace. As a reminder, hybrid LANs are the unique ways we combine a mix of public and private networking services to address customers' desires to support hybrid computing architectures. As a final example, our ability to ramp security, managed services and professional services around these products is a key differentiator, and is also well-received within the market.  I have a great deal of confidence that the market opportunity remains attractive, that our competitive position is strong, that we have the right products and services to meet the needs of this market and that the market is moving toward Level 3's strength and capabilities, not away from us. If you look at the revenue growth from our large multinational customers and the higher end customers of our target market, you can see that our value proposition clearly resonates with these customers. As further evidence, in general, sales are good. However, our churn is too high. Over the past year and a half, we made a number of decisions that were relatively small in isolation but have the cumulative effect of pressuring revenue, particularly with the lower end of the base. These decisions can be broadly grouped into 2 categories. The first, our efforts to move upmarket. I still believe this is the right decision, but as I look back, we made a couple of mistakes that created customer coverage issues. First of all, we took a very aggressive approach and moved 8,000 customers to inside sales. Frankly, we didn't do it as well as we should have, and created a communication void [ph] at the lower end of our customer base. With slightly larger customers, they're still at the small end. We let those customers in the field sales organization and really lost focus on them as we asked our direct sales force to move upmarket, again, creating a communication void with these customers.  Sunit will share the numbers, but as a result, we saw elevated churn from both of these groups of customers. 
The second set of decisions were centered on evolving and rationalizing our product set. We firmly believe in our capabilities and are excited about moving customers to new technologies. We see great acceptance in the marketplace for these capabilities. However, coupling our desire to move upmarket, with higher sales quotas we assigned to the sales team and with compensation plans rewarding sales more than revenue, we transitioned our customers more rapidly than they would have moved on their own. But we recognize the transition to new technologies is good for our business, accelerating our own customer's transitions faster than their natural rate, resulting more work through our operations team while producing a net write-down in revenue.  We saw this dynamic effect customers across the various groups Sunit will discuss. 
If I can go back, I'll make some of these decisions differently. To become an aggressive company we move fast and lean into growth. Going forward, we have a number of initiatives to address the issues we found. We are implementing a customer retention group within our sales, inside sales and our field sales organizations to retain customers more effectively. We're augmenting our staff to reach out more frequently and communicate more effectively with smaller customers. We are reestablishing our focus on adding new logos. We've lost a little bit of attention to these. We are directing our teams to aggressively renew existing services with smaller customers rather than in sending sales of our customers to transition to new solutions today. We still want to transition to new services, but at their natural rate, not at an artificially accelerated rate because of the unintended consequences of other decisions.  In addition, we've realigned our sales compensation more heavily weighted revenue than sales. We made process in organizational restructure on changes designed to enhance the customer experience and service delivery and service assurance. While I'm optimistic about these changes, churn is a lagging indicator, and will take time to deliver results. 
Before I turn the call over to Sunit to provide the detailed financial results, I'd like to sum up by saying we are intently focused on improving enterprise revenue performance. We believe the market opportunity is strong, our value proposition resonates with our customers, and that is within our own execution to improve revenue growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit."

As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation, offset by softness in North America enterprise revenue performance. Overall, total revenue grew 0.4% and CNS revenue grew 1.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.7%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multinational enterprise customers increased 10%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 4.2%, primarily due to continued consolidation-driven disconnects.
I'll now shift to our recent results, which can be found on Slide 24. North America CNS revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 3.1%, driven by solid performance from our largest customers, offset by continued pressure from the low end of our base. As Jeff explained, revenue performance is the high end of our customer bases performing well. The challenges we've seen this year are really from the lower end of the base. As you can see on Slide 25, our largest global accounts customers who make up 17% of our North America Enterprise CNS revenue grew 1.9% sequentially. In the next year, customers that spend more than $20,000 per month grew 1.2% sequentially.  Customers who spend $2,000 -- between $2,000 and $220,000 [ph] per month declined 0.6% sequentially. Finally, our smallest customers, spending less than $2,000 per month and representing 5% of the North America enterprise base, declined 18% sequentially.
Moving to EMEA, CNS revenue declined 7.7% with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. Government, declining 3.7%. In the region, we've been successful with large multinational customers, but they usually order more complex services will longer installation [indiscernible]. Higher churn continues to be a challenge for the EMEA region, and we have implemented several improvement initiatives to improved churn. For the past couple of quarters, we experienced weakness in conferencing, co-location and lower speed services. Going forward, we are transitioning the business to focus on higher bandwidth On-Net services. Usage revenues also weakened in the third quarter driven by some large IP customer rebates. We expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter.  Overall, in EMEA, we are encouraged as Enterprises CNS sales bookings in EMEA are up about 40% year-to-date compared to 2015, and we expect improved revenue performance in the coming quarters. 
In Latin America, we saw strong enterprise performance, driven in part by the Olympics. CNS enterprise revenue grew 16% or 13% if you exclude the benefits from the Olympics, which was about $4 million in the third quarter. For the quarter, our overall sales bookings for the company were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and our sales funnel remains healthy. From a product group perspective, IP and data services grew 3%. Transport and fiber declined 1%. Voice services grew 0.4%, and co-location and data services revenue declined 0.2% year-over-year. From an individual product perspective, dark fiber grew 5%, CDN grew 15%, and managed security grew 16%.
Turning to Slide 26, adjusted EBITDA was $716 million for the third quarter of 2016. This compares to $641 million in the third quarter of 2015. The double-digit percentage improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the improvement in network access costs, along with tighter management of operating expenses. We also continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 35.2% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 31.5% in the third quarter 2015.  Year-to-date, capital expenditures were approximately 17% of total revenue. During the quarter, capital spending was higher than previous quarters, as we invested to meet stronger demand from fiber and [indiscernible] sales.
The company generated free cash flow of $281 million in the quarter compared to $237 million from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we remain focused on our revenue performance and have multiple initiatives in place to drive growth. We are excited about the combination with CenturyLink and look forward to what lies ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator so we could get your questions."

When we talk about our revenue growth, we have very clear expectations for what's acceptable, where we think we can be, and we look very diligently at what is -- what are those opportunities and are we executing on them effectively. So looking forward, as I mentioned earlier, I am very focused on making sure that we are just some of the decisions we made that moved us and our focus away from the smaller end customers. That's been a problem. If you look at the results that Sunit shared, it very clearly points out that it's not a problem in the market, is not a problem with our products and services. Our hiring customers where we are focused have been growing and growing nicely. The lower end customers where we took our eye out then, when you stop talking to customers, when you create that communication void, they start to look for other solutions and we just need to make sure that we are talking to them effectively. We know these are not customers that are early adopters for products and services, but that you have to stay focused on them if you want to maintain them. And so our revenue initiatives are more around churn control. We always want to do of sales. We always want to drive the top line growth. The bigger challenge for us right now is that churn in the smaller end of the base. Now Sunit also pointed out that small end of the base represents 5% of our revenue. And I'd also point out that it's one of the strengths of CenturyLink looking after those customers. And so we think there are things about this deal that are very, very good for our ability to grow revenue not only over the course of the next year and until this deal closes in the fall of 2017, but beyond that."

Sometimes that makes sense, but we're very good at capturing synergies both companies have demonstrated the capability over time to do this. So we're very confident about those. The network rationalization is more about converting off net to On-Net. And that really has a triple benefit to us. First of all, when we convert Off-net to on-net, we control the customer experience end to end, we provide a better customer experience. We save money, we're no longer paying somebody else to provide that service for us. And we reduce the revenue of our competitors because we're no longer paying our competitors to provide that service. And so we focus very aggressively, and I think both companies have this history focus very aggressively on network rationalization because usually moving from other competitors on to our backbone to provide a better customer experience."

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. This is an exciting today for CenturyLink and Level 3. Together, we will be the second-largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers. We believe we will create significant benefits and growth opportunities for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
We'll turn to Slide 5. Today marks an important day in advancing our shared visions and strategies. Together, we are creating a customer-centric focus and providing customers leading products and services. We are building scalable and agile network-based services to deliver industry-leading value, and both companies strive to adhere to our core values. Today, we really are announcing a new chapter for both companies.
We'll turn to Slide 7 to provide some key highlights of the transaction. First of all, the combined -- combined, we will create a leading facilities-based enterprise communications provider. We will have a strong financial profile, with pro forma total business revenue of approximately $19 billion and business strategic revenue of $13 billion. Total revenue, including our consumer business, will be approximately $26 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $11 billion, including synergies. We believe the transaction -- or the strategic combination, rather, will significantly improve CenturyLink's growth profile, and better position the combined company to improve its revenue growth, trend and drive meaningful operating cash flow growth in the first full year of post-closing, including synergies as realized and including integration costs.
Additionally, we believe the combined company will be able to achieve more than 10% growth and free cash flow per share in the full year post-closing, including synergies as realized, and again, including integration cost. We also expect this combination to drive significant improvement in free cash flow per share in subsequent years.
We will also be able to accelerate approximately $10 billion of Level 3 NOLs. These NOLs will significantly reduce the combined company's net cash tax expense, positioning us to create enhanced free cash flow. With that greater financial flexibility, we expect to significantly lower CenturyLink's dividend payout ratio, and this combination also positions us well for future growth. Together, we expect to be able to leverage Level 3's and CenturyLink's strong product portfolios across our combined customer bases. In addition, the increased network scale will provide advantages for our customers in numerous ways.
Going to Slide 8, the transaction is structured in cash and stock, which we believe provides shareholders both immediate value and the ability to participate in the upside of the combination, as we work to realize the significant and compelling benefits of the transaction. CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 for $66.50 per share, which assumed a 60% stock consideration at $40 per share and 40% cash consideration at $26.50 per share. There's implied equity purchase price of approximately $24 billion and an enterprise value of $34 billion. 
Based on those numbers today -- based on those numbers, today's deal represents a premium of approximately 42% based on Level 3's unaffected share price. Once completed, the pro forma company is expected to be approximately 51% owned by CenturyLink shareholders and about 49% owned by Level 3 shareholders. Importantly, the combined company intends to maintain CenturyLink's annual dividend of $2.16 per share. In terms of financing, we have approximately $10.2 billion of financing in place, including a $2 billion unfunded revolver at close. 
Following the close of the transaction, I will continue as Chief Executive Officer and President, and we're pleased to have Sunit Patel join us as Chief Financial Officer. Following almost 35 years of -- at CenturyLink, Stewart Ewing has decided to retire following the close of this transaction. Stewart's been an important, really a vital part of our company, of this transaction and every other deal we've completed over the years. He is committed to seeing us through the integration and closing with Level 3. Stewart's a great leader. He is a good friend and our company is much stronger due to his many valuable contributions over the years.
In terms of board composition, the Chairman of CenturyLink's Board of Directors at the time of close will continue to serve as chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint 4 Level 3 board members, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Telemedia. We'll discuss the pathway to closing in detail later in the presentation, but we expect the transaction to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject of course to the receipt of regulatory approval, shareholder votes and other customary closing conditions. STT Crossing Ltd., which holds 18% of Level 3, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Before I do that, I just -- I do want to thank him and his team for the extraordinary effort they have put forth on this transaction. We've longed admired Level 3, and I'm excited to -- that we are now combining forces. Jeff?"

I'm very excited to be here today with Glen and his team announcing this combination. As you can see from Slide 9, we are 2 strong enterprise-focused companies coming together to build an even stronger company able to address the evolving and growing needs of our customers. As Glen mentioned, we believe this is great transaction for our stockholders, customers, employees and industry partners.
As I look at the enterprise marketplace, there are a number of trends that will shape the future of communications. First of all, the demand for bandwidth continues to escalate. The move to IT and IT-based services is not slowing but accelerating. With the Internet of Things, the number of connected devices will explode over the coming years. Hybrid computing architectures used by enterprises are driving the introduction of hybrid wide-area networking solutions that bring together multiple technologies to meet customer demand. The advent of technologies like SDN and NFV are redefining the ways customers interface with their networks. And lastly, the need to address all of these trends on a global basis.
The combination of these 2 great companies will enhance our ability to meet the opportunities that these trends create. Whether looking at the network footprint or the breadth of the combined product portfolio, this combined company will provide tremendous benefits to our customers.
CenturyLink's managed services portfolio with Level 3's CDN and IP VPN capabilities all delivered over an extensive local and even global network. Our ability to use advanced threat intelligence and security services delivered by the combined company. This creates a company that will offer customers industry-leading capabilities over a world-class network. 
I'd like to take a minute to give my perspective on why this is a compelling transaction for Level 3 stockholders, and why our Board of Directors unanimously approved this transaction. First of all, the purchase price is a premium to where our stock has been trading over the last year, with a meaningful portion of the consideration in cash. Shareholders also have the ability to participate in the upside of the powerful company we are creating together.
I truly believe that our ability to serve enterprise customers will be second to none. Communications is a scale business, and the combination of our substantial networks and platforms will enable us to deliver services to our customers more efficiently and effectively than either company could alone. I believe that our ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a result of this transaction. 
Before I turn the call over to Glen, I'd like to thank the Level 3 employees for their hard work through the years and into the future. Your dedication, vision for the company we are today and your unwavering commitment to our customers has built a great company. I feel lucky to be a part of such an incredible group of employees, and I'm excited to see what the future brings for us. Thank you.

As you can see, CenturyLink and Level 3's businesses are highly complementary. And once the transaction closes, stakeholders will benefit from a more diverse business mix, with pro forma revenue of $24.7 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue; and total core revenue of $24.2 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue and data integration revenue. Under these assumptions, we expect more than 75% of our revenues to come from business customers and 65% of our revenues will be strategic revenue.
As Jeff mentioned a moment ago, we will also have the ability to enhance the service and connectivity we provide CenturyLink's large enterprise customer base across Level 3's global footprint. Given the complementary nature of the product portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet the demand for bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.
Turning now to Slide 11, as you can see, a key differentiator for our company will be that of the top service providers in the country, we have, by far, the greatest percentage of our business focused on enterprise customers, and we will become the second-largest competitive provider of network services to businesses in the United States. 
Now turning to Slide 12, we highlight the significant total cash synergies we expect to achieve from this transaction, with $975 million, we believe, are very achievable annual operating and capital synergies. We expect approximately $850 million in annual operating cost synergies, mostly from corporate network and operational efficiencies and IT systems consolidation, along with purchasing synergies across our advertising and marketing efforts. And we believe we can realize 80% of this annual run rate savings within 36 months after closing.
Our anticipated approximately $125 million in annual CapEx cash savings will come from purchasing synergies, which we expect to be -- to realize fully within 36 months. We currently anticipate that our onetime integration cost to achieve these cash savings will be approximately $685 million, with a majority to be incurred between closing and year-end 2019. Both of our companies have significant M&A experience and a strong track record of execution, with a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. This gives us real confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our 2 companies.

Expanding on what Glen outlined earlier, as you can see on Slide 13, the result of this transaction is a company with meaningful scale and financial strength, which will enable us to grow and capitalize on these synergy opportunities. The combined company's capital structure will benefit from a strong liquidity profile, including an approximately $2 billion unfunded revolver; free cash flow accretion, with a focus on sustainable free cash flow growth; and improvements in our long-term dividend payout ratio.
Our expected free cash flow generation will grant us a flexibility to continue to deliver solid returns, while positioning us to invest in strategic growth initiatives and opportunities, allowing us to better compete in a complex operating environment. On a pro forma basis, we expect the combined company to have net leverage of approximately 3.7x and our long-term leverage target remains at approximately 3x.
Turning to Slide 14, this is an overview of the pro forma arch structure depicting the combination and the associated new debt raise. The acquisition is structured such that Level 3 will be a subsidiary of CenturyLink post-acquisition. Level 3's current debt will stay in place, and existing Level 3 entities will not incur or guarantee any acquisition debt. Based on expected ratings, change of control puts in the existing Level 3 debt will not be triggered. No consents are required from Level 3 lenders or noteholders for closing the acquisition.  
All the new acquisition debt will be raised at CenturyLink, and will rank ahead of the existing CenturyLink notes by virtue of expected guarantees from material nonregulated CenturyLink subs, including the EMBARQ parent, and the newly created Level 3 holdco. The new debt will also benefit from expected pledge of stock of QC and Level 3 Communications Inc. QC, a regulated entity, will not guarantee or provide explicit support for any new indebtedness.
Purchase price will be funded by cash on hand at closing for both CenturyLink and Level 3, as well as committed financing of $10.2 billion from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley financing, which includes a $2 billion revolver and $1.2 billion commitment to address upcoming maturities between signing and closing, resulting in incremental funded debt for the transaction of approximately $7 billion.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Glen."

For employees of both companies, we believe this combination will also provide additional growth and advancement opportunities over the years to come, and I look forward to continue to work with our best-in-class team, welcoming the talented members of the Level 3 team.  We're truly excited about CenturyLink and Level 3's future as a combined company and sharing those benefits with all stakeholders as we move forward with this exciting combination.
As we transition to third quarter results -- earnings results, I want to provide a few high-level comments about CenturyLink's third quarter results before turning it over to Stewart. We continue to see the benefits of our operational initiatives and network-first focus, and we are making progress on our broadband enablement road map, which we believe is critical to meeting our customer's long-term growing demand for bandwidth. We remain focused on continuing our pivot to higher-quality broadband customers. And while we still have more improvement to achieve on a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter, we added higher ARPU customers, lower churn and fewer high credit risk -- high risk credit customers in the quarter. So we're making that pivot with our consumer base, and we saw those results -- those trends in the third quarter.
Business strategic service revenues grew 5% year-over-year, led by more than 6% growth in high-speed -- high-bandwidth data service revenues. Business revenue was negatively impacted by churn, along with a renewal of several large customers in the quarter, which included some repricing impact. However, we are pleased with these renewals that will help us to maintain long-term relationships and recontract a significant amount of revenue over extended terms.
And lastly, we are pursuing a number of activities with lower expenses, including a significant reduction in nonemployee-related expenses, and also a reduction of 78 -- 7% to 8% in employee-related costs. We remain focused on continuing -- excuse me, these cost reductions are part of our continued effort to keep costs in line with our revenue streams, will position us for the legacy revenue pressures going into 2017. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart."

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of the fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Now let's dive in. Today, CenturyLink reported solid third quarter results, with total and core revenues, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS, all within our guidance range. Third quarter operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 3.8% decrease from third quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues and a decrease of approximately $100 million in high-cost support revenues due to onetime out-of-period CAF Phase 2 support payments recognized in the third quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher strategic services revenues. Overall, strategic revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year. 
Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.92 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago period. Operating income was $595 million for the third quarter 2016, while we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion during the quarter. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income, was $186 million for the quarter.
You may remember last quarter, we had said that we expected higher cash taxes in the third quarter as the tax payment was deferred from the second quarter. In addition, we made a voluntary pension contribution of $100 million during the third quarter. These 2 items accounted for over $400 million of lower free cash flow in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.28, a decrease from $0.37 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.56, a decrease from $0.70 in the third quarter a year ago. 
Now moving to Slide 19 in our Business segment. In the third quarter, the Business segment generated $2.61 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $30 million or 1.1% from the same period a year ago. Legacy revenues from the segment declined 7.6% from third quarter last year due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services revenues. Third quarter strategic revenue for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to third quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services.
On a sequential quarter basis, we had a headwind from the onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 billion -- $10 million that was reported in high-bandwidth data services in the second quarter of this year. Data integration revenues increased $10 million from third quarter 2015, due primarily to higher CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses increased $16 million or 1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by CPE costs related to the higher data integration revenues.
Now turning to Slide 20, the Consumer segment generated $1.47 billion  in operating revenues, a decrease of $37 million or 2.5% from third quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 3.4% year-over-year to $789 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 8.3% from third quarter a year ago, reflecting access line declines and lower long-distance revenues. Our operating expenses increased $19 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to higher content costs related to our Prism TV service.
Now turning to Slide 21. For fourth quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion, core revenues of $3.86 billion to $3.92 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.58 billion and $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.59. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued growth in strategic revenues to be offset by anticipated declines in legacy revenues and data integration revenues, resulting in lower fourth quarter 2016 operating revenues compared to third quarter of 2016.
Fourth quarter 2016 operating cash flow is expected to be relatively flat compared to third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the anticipated decline in revenues being offset by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the seasonality of outside plant maintenance and utility costs, along with anticipated lower personnel and CPE costs. Additionally, as it pertains to the fourth quarter, we expect to incur severance costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million related to planned headcount reductions.
These severance costs will be treated as a special item and are therefore excluded from fourth quarter guidance ranges provided. As the fourth quarter guidance implies, we are currently expecting to come in below full year 2016 guidance ranges previously provided for certain financial metrics. This is primarily due to the weakness that we've experienced in customer units during the third -- second and third quarter. We expect our dividend payout ratio to be in the mid-60% range now for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to briefly discuss Level 3's third quarter results."
30771,402278150,1067315,"CenturyLink, Inc., Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Stewart.

During the quarter, the benefits of our operating leverage and focus on profitable growth drove solid bottom-line performance. Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. However, from an enterprise core network services revenue perspective, I'm still not happy with our results. We did not see the improvement in CNS enterprise revenue growth in North America or in EMEA that we expect. Since our second quarter call, we've spent quite a bit of time analyzing our own performance and addressing the issues we've identified. I will let Sunit go into the numbers, but I'll share a few thoughts about North America before handing the call over to him. 
First of all, a logical question is whether the revenue slowdown is associated with a lack of market opportunity for the types of products and services we sell. The answer to this is a firm and clear no. We continue to see market opportunity and demand for the services we provide. As examples, demand for transport services such as waves and dark fiber is strong, and we remain very capable in selling and delivering these services to customers.
Cloud Connect Solutions, IT services, IP VPNs and hybrid LANs continue to address the key need in the marketplace. As a reminder, hybrid LANs are the unique ways we combine a mix of public and private networking services to address customers' desires to support hybrid computing architectures. As a final example, our ability to ramp security, managed services and professional services around these products is a key differentiator, and is also well-received within the market.
I have a great deal of confidence that the market opportunity remains attractive, that our competitive position is strong, that we have the right products and services to meet the needs of this market and that the market is moving toward Level 3's strength and capabilities, not away from us. If you look at the revenue growth from our large multinational customers and the higher-end customers of our target market, you can see that our value proposition clearly resonates with these customers.
As further evidence, in general, sales are good. However, our churn is too high. Over the past year and a half, we made a number of decisions that were relatively small in isolation but have had the cumulative effect of pressuring revenue, particularly with the lower end of the base. These decisions can be broadly grouped into 2 categories. The first, our efforts to move upmarket. I still believe this is the right decision, but as I look back, we made a couple of mistakes that created customer coverage issues. First of all, we took a very aggressive approach and moved 8,000 customers to inside sales. Frankly, we didn't do it as well as we should have and created a communication void at the lower end of our customer base.
With slightly larger customers, but still at the small end, we left those customers in the field sales organization and really lost focus on them as we asked our direct sales force to move upmarket. Again, creating a communication void with these customers. Sunit will share the numbers, but as a result, we saw elevated churn from both of these groups of customers. 
The second set of decisions were centered on evolving and rationalizing our product set. We firmly believe in our capabilities and we're excited about moving customers to new technologies. We see great acceptance in the marketplace for these capabilities. However, coupling our desire to move upmarket, with higher sales quotas we assigned to the sales team and with compensation plans rewarding sales more than revenue, we transitioned our customers more rapidly than they would have moved on their own. While we recognize the transition to new technologies is good for our business, accelerating our own customers' transitions faster than their natural rate, results in more work for the operations team while producing a net write-down in revenue. We saw this dynamic effect customers across the various groups Sunit will discuss. 
If I can go back, I'd make some of these decisions differently. By being an aggressive company, we moved fast and leaned into growth. Going forward, we have a number of initiatives to address the issues we found. We are implementing a customer retention group within our sales -- inside sales and our field sales organizations to retain customers more effectively. We're augmenting our staff to reach out more frequently and communicate more effectively with smaller customers. We are reestablishing our focus on adding new logos, we've lost a little bit of attention to these.
We are directing our teams to aggressively renew existing services with smaller customers, rather than intending sales or the customers to transition to new solutions today. We still want to transition to new services, but at their natural rate, not at an artificially accelerated rate because of the unintended consequences of other decisions. In addition, we've realigned our sales compensation more heavily weighting revenue than sales. We made process and organizational and structural changes designed to enhance the customer experience and service delivery and service assurance. While I'm optimistic about these changes, churn is the lagging indicator and they'll take time to deliver results.
Before I turn the call over to Sunit to provide the detailed financial results, I'd like to sum up by saying we are intently focused on improving enterprise revenue performance. We believe the market opportunity is strong, our value proposition resonates with our customers, and that it's within our own execution to improve revenue growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit."
30771,402278150,1067315,"CenturyLink, Inc., Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted, on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation",668,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted, on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation, offset by softness in North America enterprise revenue performance. Overall, total revenue grew 0.4% and CNS revenue grew 1.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.7%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multinational enterprise customers increased 10%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 4.2%, primarily due to continued consolidation-driven disconnects.
I'll now shift to our regional results, which can be found on Slide 24. North America CNS revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 3.1%, driven by solid performance from our largest customers, offset by continued pressure from the low end of our base. As Jeff explained, revenue performance at the high end of our customer base is performing well. The challenges we've seen this year are really from the lower end of the base. As you can see on Slide 25, our largest global accounts customers, who make up 17% of our North America Enterprise CNS revenue, grew 1.9% sequentially. In the next year, customers that spend more than $20,000 per month grew 1.2% sequentially. Customers who spend $2,000 -- between $2,000 and $20,000 per month declined 0.6% sequentially. Finally, our smallest customers, spending less than $2,000 per month and representing 5% of the North America enterprise base, declined 18% sequentially.
Moving to EMEA, CNS revenue declined 7.7% with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. Government, declining 3.7%. In the region, we've been successful with large multinational customers, but they usually order more complex services with longer installation in tools [ph]. Higher churn continues to be a challenge for the EMEA region, and we have implemented several improvement initiatives to improved churn. For the past couple of quarters, we've experienced weakness in conferencing, co-location and lower-speed services.
Going forward, we are transitioning the business to focus on higher bandwidth On-Net services. Usage revenues also weakened in the third quarter driven by some large IP customer rerates. We expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. Overall, in EMEA, we are encouraged as enterprise CNS sales bookings in EMEA are up about 40% year-to-date compared to 2015, and we expect improved revenue performance in the coming quarters. 
In Latin America, we saw strong enterprise performance, driven in part by the Olympics. CNS enterprise revenue grew 16%, or 13% if you exclude the benefits from the Olympics, which was about $4 million in the third quarter. For the quarter, our overall sales bookings for the company were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and our sales funnel remains healthy. From a product group perspective, IP and data services grew 3%, transport and fiber declined 1%, voice services grew 0.4% and co-location and data services revenue declined 0.2% year-over-year. From an individual product perspective, dark fiber grew 5%, CDN grew 15%, and managed security grew 16%.
Turning to Slide 26, adjusted EBITDA was $716 million for the third quarter of 2016. This compares to $641 million in the third quarter of 2015. The double-digit percentage improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the improvement in network access costs, along with tighter management of operating expenses. We also continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 35.2% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 31.5% in the third quarter 2015.  
Year-to-date, capital expenditures were approximately 17% of total revenue. During the quarter, capital spending was higher than previous quarters, as we invested to meet stronger demand from fiber and wavelength sales. The company generated free cash flow of $281 million in the quarter compared to $237 million from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we remain focused on our revenue performance and have multiple initiatives in place to drive growth. We are excited about the combination with CenturyLink and look forward to what lies ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator so we can get to your questions."

Next year, because of the cash taxes that we anticipated increasing, our payout ratio is going to bump up to the low to mid-80s.

And this combination takes 2 fairly large companies and puts them together and brings to bear our ability to really scale each other's strengths. If you look at Level 3, we sell a large number of IP VPNs. When we have to go off-net, that reduces our margin. But it also reduces our ability to really control the customer experience end to end. By combining with CenturyLink, we will be able to put more of those locations on-net, we'll bring their scale to us. If you look at CenturyLink selling to global customers, they have historically a disadvantage in selling in EMEA or Latin America. We'll bring the Level 3 network to their customers and help them extend the products and services in the scope of those products and services. And so I believe scale matters. I believe the scope and the breadth of our product set matters. And then I look at Level 3 and our own performance from now until the time of closing, and I realize that the -- our performance is based on our execution. It's not a market challenge, the market is there. It's not an economic challenge. Our customers need our products and services and they're growing. It's not at a technology challenge.

But when we talk about our revenue growth, we have very clear expectations for what's acceptable, where we think we can be. And we look very diligently at what is -- what are those opportunities and are we executing on them effectively. So looking forward, as I mentioned earlier, I am very focused on making sure that we addressed some of the decisions we made that moved us and our focus away from the smaller-end customers. That's been our problem. And if you look at the results that Sunit shared, it very clearly points out that it's not a problem in the market, is not a problem with our products and services. Our hiring customers where we are focused have been growing and growing nicely. Now the lower-end customers, where we took our eye off then, when you stop talking to customers, when you create that communication void, they start to look for other solutions. And we just need to make sure that we are talking to them effectively. We know these are not customers that are early adopters for products and services, but that you have to stay focused on them if you want to maintain them. And so our revenue initiatives are more around churn control. We always want to drive sales and we always want to drive the top line growth. The bigger challenge for us right now is that churn in the smaller end of the base. Now Sunit also pointed out that, that small end of the base represents 5% of our revenue. And I'd also point out that it's one of the strengths of CenturyLink, looking after those customers. And so we think there are things about this deal that are very, very good for our ability to grow revenue not only over the course of the next year until this deal closes in the fall of 2017, but beyond that."

And that really has a triple benefit to us. First of all, when we convert off-net to on-net, we control the customer experience end to end, we provide a better customer experience. We save money. We're no longer paying somebody else to provide that service for us. And we reduce the revenue of our competitors, because we're no longer paying our competitors to provide that service.

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. This is an exciting today for CenturyLink and Level 3. Together, we will be the second-largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers. We believe we will create significant benefits and growth opportunities for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
We'll turn to Slide 5. Today marks an important day in advancing our shared visions and strategies. Together we are creating a customer-centric focus and providing customers leading products and services. We are building scalable and agile network-based services to deliver industry-leading value, and both companies strive to adhere to our core values. Today, we really are announcing a new chapter for both companies.
We'll turn to Slide 7 to provide some key highlights of the transaction. First of all, the combined -- combined, we will create a leading facilities-based enterprise communications provider. We will have a strong financial profile, with pro forma total business revenue of approximately $19 billion and business strategic revenue of $13 billion. Total revenue, including our consumer business, will be approximately $26 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $11 billion, including synergies. We believe the transaction -- or the strategic combination, rather, will significantly improve CenturyLink's growth profile and better position the combined company to improve its revenue growth trend and drive meaningful operating cash flow growth in the first full year post-closing, including synergies as realized and including integration costs.
Additionally, we believe the combined company will be able to achieve more than 10% growth and free cash flow per share in the full year post-closing, including synergies as realized, and again including integration cost. We also expect this combination to drive significant improvement in free cash flow per share in subsequent years.
We will also be able to accelerate approximately $10 billion of Level 3 NOLs. These NOLs will significantly reduce the combined company's net cash tax expense, positioning us to create enhanced free cash flow. With that greater financial flexibility, we expect to significantly lower CenturyLink's dividend payout ratio, and this combination also positions us well for future growth. Together, we expect to be able to leverage Level 3's and CenturyLink's strong product portfolios across our combined customer bases. In addition, the increased network scale will provide advantages for our customers in numerous ways.
Going to Slide 8.  The transaction is structured in cash and stock, which we believe provides shareholders both immediate value and the ability to participate in the upside of the combination as we work to realize the significant and compelling benefits of the transaction. CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 for $66.50 per share, which assumed a 60% stock consideration at $40 per share and 40% cash consideration at $26.50 per share. There's implied equity purchase price of approximately $24 billion and an enterprise value of $34 billion. 
Based on those numbers today -- based on those numbers, today's deal represents a premium of approximately 42% based on Level 3's unaffected share price. Once completed, the pro forma company is expected to be approximately 51% owned by CenturyLink shareholders and about 49% owned by Level 3 shareholders. Importantly, the combined company intends to maintain CenturyLink's annual dividend of $2.16 per share. In terms of financing, we have approximately $10.2 billion of financing in place, including a $2 billion unfunded revolver at close. 
Following the close of the transaction, I will continue as Chief Executive Officer and President, and we're pleased to have Sunit Patel join us as Chief Financial Officer. Following almost 35 years of -- at CenturyLink, Stewart Ewing has decided to retire following the close of this transaction. Stewart's been an important -- really a vital part of our company, of this transaction and every other deal we've completed over the years. He is committed to seeing us through the integration and closing with Level 3. Stewart's a great leader. He is a good friend and our company is much stronger due to his many valuable contributions over the years.
In terms of board composition, the Chairman of CenturyLink's Board of Directors at the time of close will continue to serve as chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint 4 Level 3 board members, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Telemedia. We'll discuss the pathway to closing in detail later in the presentation, but we expect the transaction to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject of course to the receipt of regulatory approval, shareholder votes and other customary closing conditions. STT Crossing Ltd., which holds 18% of Level 3, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. 
With that I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Before I do that, I just -- I do want to thank him and his team for the extraordinary effort they have put forth on this transaction. We've long admired Level 3, and I'm excited to -- that we are now combining forces. Jeff?"

I'm very excited to be here today with Glen and his team announcing this combination. As you can see from Slide 9, we are 2 strong enterprise-focused companies coming together to build an even stronger company, able to address the evolving and growing needs of our customers. As Glen mentioned, we believe this is great transaction for our stockholders, customers, employees and industry partners.
As I look at the enterprise marketplace, there are a number of trends that will shape the future of communications. First of all, the demand for bandwidth continues to escalate. The move to IT and IT-based services is not slowing, but accelerating. With the Internet of Things, the number of connected devices will explode over the coming years. Hybrid computing architectures used by enterprises are driving the introduction of hybrid wide-area networking solutions that bring together multiple technologies to meet customer demand. The advent of technologies like SDN and NFV are redefining the ways customers interface with their networks. And lastly, the need to address all of these trends on a global basis.
The combination of these 2 great companies will enhance our ability to meet the opportunities that these trends create. Whether looking at the network footprint or the breadth of the combined product portfolio, this combined company will provide tremendous benefits to our customers.
CenturyLink's managed services portfolio with Level 3's CDN and IP VPN capabilities all delivered over an extensive local and even global network. Our ability to use advanced threat intelligence and security services delivered by the combined company. This creates a company that will offer customers industry-leading capabilities over a world-class network. 
I'd like to take a minute to give my perspective on why this is a compelling transaction for Level 3 stockholders and why our Board of Directors unanimously approved this transaction. First of all, the purchase price is a premium to where our stock has been trading over the last year, with a meaningful portion of the consideration in cash. Shareholders also have the ability to participate in the upside of the powerful company we are creating together.
I truly believe that our ability to serve enterprise customers will be second-to-none. Communications is a scale business, and the combination of our substantial networks and platforms will enable us to deliver services to our customers more efficiently and effectively than either company could alone. I believe that our ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a result of this transaction. 
Before I turn the call over to Glen I'd like to thank the Level 3 employees for their hard work through the years and into the future. Your dedication, vision for the company we are today and your unwavering commitment to our customers has built a great company. I feel lucky to be a part of such an incredible group of employees and I'm excited to see what the future brings for us. Thank you.

As you can see, CenturyLink and Level 3's businesses are highly complementary. And once the transaction closes, stakeholders will benefit from a more diverse business mix, with pro forma revenue of $24.7 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue, and total core revenue of $24.2 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue and data integration revenue. Under these assumptions, we expect more than 75% of our revenues to come from business customers and 65% of our revenues will be strategic revenue.
As Jeff mentioned a moment ago, we will also have the ability to enhance the service and connectivity we provide CenturyLink's large enterprise customer base across Level 3's global footprint. Given the complementary nature of the product portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet the demand for bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.
Turning now to Slide 11.  As you can see, a key differentiator for our company will be that, of the top service providers in the country, we have by far the greatest percentage of our business focused on enterprise customers, and we will become the second-largest competitive provider of network services to businesses in the United States. 
Now turning to Slide 12.  We highlight the significant total cash synergies we expect to achieve from this transaction, with $975 million of what we believe are very achievable annual operating and capital synergies. We expect approximately $850 million in annual operating cost synergies, mostly from corporate network and operational efficiencies and IT systems consolidation, along with purchasing synergies across our advertising and marketing efforts. And we believe we can realize 80% of this annual run rate savings within 36 months after closing.
Our anticipated approximately $125 million in annual CapEx cash savings will come from purchasing synergies, which we expect to be -- to realize fully within 36 months. We currently anticipate our onetime integration cost to achieve these cash savings will be approximately $685 million, with a majority to be incurred between closing and year-end 2019. Both of our companies have significant M&A experience and a strong track record of execution, with a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. This gives us real confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our 2 companies.

Expanding on what Glen outlined earlier, as you can see on Slide 13, the result of this transaction is a combined company with meaningful scale and financial strength, which will enable us to grow and capitalize on these synergy opportunities. The combined company's capital structure will benefit from a strong liquidity profile, including an approximately $2 billion unfunded revolver, free cash flow accretion, with a focus on sustainable free cash flow growth and improvements in our long-term dividend payout ratio.
Our expected free cash flow generation will grant us a flexibility to continue to deliver solid returns, while positioning us to invest in strategic growth initiatives and opportunities, allowing us to better compete in the complex operating environment. On a pro forma basis we expect the combined company to have net leverage of approximately 3.7x and our long-term leverage target remains at approximately 3x.
Turning to Slide 14.  This is an overview of the pro forma arch structure, depicting the combination and the associated new debt raised. The acquisition is structured such that Level 3 will be a subsidiary of CenturyLink, post-acquisition. Level 3's current debt will stay in place, and existing Level 3 entities will not incur or guarantee any acquisition debt. Based on expected ratings, change of control puts in the existing Level 3 debt will not be triggered. No consents are required from Level 3 lenders or note-holders for closing the acquisition.  
All the new acquisition debt will be raised at CenturyLink, and will rank ahead of the existing CenturyLink notes by virtue of expected guarantees from material nonregulated CenturyLink subs, including the EMBARQ parent and the newly created Level 3 holdco. The new debt will also benefit from the expected pledge of stock of QC and Level 3 Communications Inc. QC, a regulated entity, will not guarantee or provide explicit support for any new indebtedness.
Purchase price will be funded by cash on hand at closing for both CenturyLink and Level 3, as well as committed financing of $10.2 billion from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley financing, which includes a $2 billion revolver and $1.2 billion commitment to address upcoming maturities between signing and closing, resulting in incremental funded debt for the transaction of approximately $7 billion.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Glen."

As previously mentioned, the transaction is also subject to approval by CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders, and we're pleased to have secured a voting agreement in favor of the transaction with STT Crossing Ltd. 
Now turning to Slide 16.  And to conclude our remarks pertaining to the transaction, before touching on our quarterly earnings, we're confident in the compelling strategic and financial rationale of this transaction and the many benefits it will bring to CenturyLink and Level 3 stakeholders. The combined company will provide our customers with the network they need to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses.
For employees of both companies, we believe this combination will also provide additional growth and advancement opportunities over the years to come, and I look forward to continue to work with our best-in-class team, welcoming the talented members of the Level 3 team.  We're truly excited about CenturyLink and Level 3's future as a combined company and sharing those benefits with all stakeholders as we move forward with this exciting combination.
As we transition to third quarter results -- earnings results, I want to provide a few high-level comments about CenturyLink's third quarter results before turning it over to Stewart. We continue to see the benefits of our operational initiatives and network-first focus, and we are making progress on our broadband enablement road map, which we believe is critical to meeting our customer's long-term growing demand for bandwidth. We remain focused on continuing our pivot to higher-quality broadband customers. And while we still have more improvement to achieve on a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter we added higher ARPU customers, lower churn and fewer high credit risk -- high-risk credit customers in the quarter. So we're making that pivot with our consumer base, and we saw those results -- those trends in the third quarter.
Business strategic service revenues grew 5% year-over-year, led by more than 6% growth in high-speed -- high-bandwidth data service revenues. Business revenue was negatively impacted by churn, along with a renewal of several large customers in the quarter, which included some repricing impact. However, we are pleased with these renewals that will help us to maintain long-term relationships and re-contract a significant amount of revenue over extended terms.
And lastly, we are pursuing a number of activities with lower expenses, including a significant reduction in nonemployee-related expenses, and also a reduction of 7% to 8% in employee-related costs. We remain focused on continuing -- excuse me, these cost reductions are part of our continued effort to keep costs in line with our revenue streams, will position us for the legacy revenue pressures going into 2017. 
With that I'll turn it over to Stewart."

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning.

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Now let's dive in. Today, CenturyLink reported solid third quarter results with total and core revenues, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS all within our guidance range. Third quarter operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 3.8% decrease from third quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues and a decrease of approximately $100 million in high-cost support revenues due to onetime out-of-period CAF Phase 2 support payments recognized in the third quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher strategic services revenues. Overall, strategic revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year. 
Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.92 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago period. Operating income was $595 million for the third quarter 2016, while we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion during the quarter. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income, was $186 million for the quarter.
You may remember last quarter, we had said that we expected higher cash taxes in the third quarter, as the tax payment was deferred from the second quarter. In addition, we made a voluntary pension contribution of $100 million during the third quarter. These 2 items accounted for over $400 million of lower free cash flow in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.28, a decrease from $0.37 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.56, a decrease from $0.70 in the third quarter a year ago. 
Now moving to Slide 19, in our Business segment. In the third quarter the Business segment generated $2.61 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $30 million or 1.1% from the same period a year ago. Legacy revenues from the segment declined 7.6% from third quarter last year due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services revenues. Third quarter strategic revenue for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to third quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services.
On a sequential quarter basis, we had a headwind from the onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 billion -- $10 million that was reported in high-bandwidth data services in the second quarter of this year. Data integration revenues increased $10 million from third quarter 2015, due primarily to higher CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses increased $16 million or 1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by CPE costs related to the higher data integration revenues.
Now turning to Slide 20, the Consumer segment generated $1.47 billion  in operating revenues, a decrease of $37 million or 2.5% from third quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 3.4% year-over-year to $789 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 8.3% from third quarter a year ago, reflecting access line declines and lower long-distance revenues. Our operating expenses increased $19 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to higher content costs related to our Prism TV service.
Now turning to Slide 21. For fourth quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion, core revenues of $3.86 billion to $3.92 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.58 billion and $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.59. In fourth quarter we expect continued growth in strategic revenues to be offset by anticipated declines in legacy revenues and data integration revenues, resulting in lower fourth quarter 2016 operating revenues compared to third quarter of 2016.
Fourth quarter 2016 operating cash flow is expected to be relatively flat compared to third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the anticipated decline in revenues being offset by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the seasonality of outside plant maintenance and utility costs, along with anticipated lower personnel and CPE costs. Additionally, as it pertains to the fourth quarter, we expect to incur severance costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million, related to planned headcount reductions.
These severance costs will be treated as a special item and are therefore excluded from fourth quarter guidance ranges provided. As the fourth quarter guidance implies, we are currently expecting to come in below full-year 2016 guidance ranges previously provided for certain financial metrics. This is primarily due to the weakness that we've experienced in customer units during the third -- second and third quarter. We expect our dividend payout ratio to be in the mid-60% range now for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to briefly discuss Level 3's third quarter results."

During the quarter, the benefits of our operating leverage and focus on profitable growth drove solid bottom-line performance. Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. However, from an enterprise core network services revenue perspective, I'm still not happy with our results. We did not see the improvement in CNS enterprise revenue growth in North America or in EMEA that we expect. Since our second quarter call, we've spent quite a bit of time analyzing our own performance and addressing the issues we've identified. I will let Sunit go into the numbers, but I'll share a few thoughts about North America before handing the call over to him. 
First of all, a logical question is whether the revenue slowdown is associated with a lack of market opportunity for the types of products and services we sell. The answer to this is a firm and clear no. We continue to see market opportunity and demand for the services we provide. As examples, demand for transport services such as waves and dark fiber is strong, and we remain very capable in selling and delivering these services to customers.
Cloud Connect Solutions, IT services, IP VPNs and hybrid LANs continue to address a key need in the marketplace. As a reminder, hybrid LANs are the unique ways we combine a mix of public and private networking services to address customers' desires to support hybrid computing architectures. As a final example, our ability to wrap security, managed services and professional services around these products is a key differentiator and is also well-received within the market.
I have a great deal of confidence that the market opportunity remains attractive, that our competitive position is strong, that we have the right products and services to meet the needs of this market and that the market is moving toward Level 3's strength and capabilities, not away from us. If you look at the revenue growth from our large multinational customers and the higher-end customers of our target market, you can see that our value proposition clearly resonates with these customers.
As further evidence, in general sales are good. However our churn is too high. Over the past year and a half, we've made a number of decisions that were relatively small in isolation but have had the cumulative effect of pressuring revenue, particularly with the lower end of the base. These decisions can be broadly grouped into 2 categories. The first, our efforts to move upmarket. I still believe this is the right decision, but as I look back, we made a couple of mistakes that created customer coverage issues. First of all, we took a very aggressive approach and moved 8,000 customers to inside sales. Frankly, we didn't do it as well as we should have and created a communication void at the low end of our customer base.
With slightly larger customers, but still at the small end, we left those customers in the field sales organization but really lost focus on them as we asked our direct sales force to move upmarket. Again creating a communication void with these customers. Sunit will share the numbers, but as a result, we saw elevated churn from both of these groups of customers. 
The second set of decisions were centered on evolving and rationalizing our product set. We firmly believe in our capabilities and are excited about moving customers to new technologies. We see great acceptance in the marketplace for these capabilities. However, coupling our desire to move upmarket, with higher sales quotas we assigned to the sales team and with compensation plans rewarding sales more than revenue, we transitioned our customers more rapidly than they would have moved on their own. While we recognize the transition to new technologies is good for our business, accelerating your own customers' transitions faster than their natural rate results in more work for your operations team while producing a net write-down in revenue. We saw this dynamic affect customers across the various groups Sunit will discuss. 
If I can go back, I'd make some of these decisions differently. But being an aggressive company, we move fast and lean into growth. Going forward, we have a number of initiatives to address the issues we found. We are implementing a customer retention group within our sales -- inside sales and our field sales organizations to retain customers more effectively. We're augmenting our staff to reach out more frequently and communicate more effectively with smaller customers. We are reestablishing our focus on adding new logos.  We've lost a little bit of attention to this.
We are directing our teams to aggressively renew existing services with smaller customers rather than in sending sales or the customers to transition to new solutions today. We still want to transition to new services, but at their natural rate, not in an artificially accelerated rate because of the unintended consequences of other decisions. In addition, we've realigned our sales compensation, more heavily weighting revenue than sales. We've made process and organizational and structural changes designed to enhance the customer experience in service delivery and service assurance. While I'm optimistic about these changes, churn is a lagging indicator and they will take time to deliver results.
Before I turn the call over to Sunit to provide the detailed financial results, I'd like to sum up by saying we are intently focused on improving enterprise revenue performance. We believe the market opportunity is strong, our value proposition resonates with our customers, and that it's within our own execution to improve revenue growth. 
With that I'll turn the call over to Sunit."

As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation offset by softness in North America enterprise revenue performance. Overall, total revenue grew 0.4% and CNS revenue grew 1.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.7%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multinational enterprise customers increased 10%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 4.2%, primarily due to continued consolidation-driven disconnects.
I'll now shift to our regional results, which can be found on Slide 24. North America CNS revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 3.1%, driven by solid performance from our largest customers, offset by continued pressure from the low end of our base. As Jeff explained, revenue performance at the high end of our customer base is performing well. The challenges we've seen this year are really from the lower end of the base. As you can see on Slide 25, our largest global accounts customers, who make up 17% of our North America Enterprise CNS revenue, grew 1.9% sequentially. In the next year, customers that spend more than $20,000 per month grew 1.2% sequentially. Customers who spend $2,000 -- between $2,000 and $20,000 per month declined 0.6% sequentially. Finally, our smallest customers, spending less than $2,000 per month and representing 5% of the North America enterprise base, declined 18% sequentially.
Moving to EMEA, CNS revenue declined 7.7% with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. Government, declining 3.7%. In the region, we've been successful with large multinational customers, but they usually order more complex services with longer installation intervals. Higher churn continues to be a challenge for the EMEA region, and we have implemented several improvement initiatives to improve churn. For the past couple of quarters, we've experienced weakness in conferencing, co-location and lower-speed services.
Going forward, we are transitioning the business to focus on higher-bandwidth On-Net services. Usage revenues also weakened in the third quarter, driven by some large IP customer re-rates. We expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. Overall in EMEA, we are encouraged as enterprise CNS sales bookings in EMEA are up about 40% year-to-date compared to 2015, and we expect improved revenue performance in the coming quarters. 
In Latin America, we saw strong enterprise performance, driven in part by the Olympics. CNS enterprise revenue grew 16%, or 13% if you exclude the benefits from the Olympics, which was about $4 million in the third quarter. For the quarter, our overall sales bookings for the company were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and our sales funnel remains healthy. From a product group perspective, IP and data services grew 3%; transport and fiber declined 1%; voice services grew 0.4%; and co-location and data services revenue declined 0.2% year-over-year. From an individual product perspective, dark fiber grew 5%, CDN grew 15%, and managed security grew 16%.
Turning to Slide 26.  Adjusted EBITDA was $716 million for the third quarter of 2016. This compares to $641 million in the third quarter of 2015. The double-digit percentage improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the improvement in network-access costs, along with tighter management of operating expenses. We also continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 35.2% in the third quarter 2016 compared to 31.5% in the third quarter 2015.  
Year to date, capital expenditures were approximately 17% of total revenue. During the quarter, capital spending was higher than previous quarters, as we invested to meet stronger demand from fiber and wavelength sales. The company generated free cash flow of $281 million in the quarter compared to $237 million from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we remain focused on our revenue performance and have multiple initiatives in place to drive growth. We are excited about the combination with CenturyLink and look forward to what lies ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator so we can get  your questions."

On the fiber side, because we are seeing strong demand in fiber and many of our fiber customers pay cash up front, you'll note that we increased the CapEx guidance for the year from 15% to 16% of revenue, but we did not change our free cash flow guidance because we are getting paid in cash for turning up those fiber segments. So it's actually quite a strong sign for both our wavelength business and our fiber business."

There's a fair amount of uncertainty in the market regarding your longer-term revenue growth outlook given the performance over the last couple of quarters, and you've been clear that you're not happy with where it stands. Even if it's not in quantitative terms, can you talk a bit about what sort of stand-alone growth expectations you used when assessing the value of your equity?

And so I look at our revenue growth and our ability to satisfy those customers and feel that we were negotiating from a position of strength with respect to what type of company could we build. And so I look at -- when we talk about our revenue -- I'm not going to give quantitative numbers. But when we talk about our revenue growth, we have very clear expectations for what's acceptable and where we think we can be. And we look very diligently at what is -- what are those opportunities and are we executing on them effectively. So looking forward, as I mentioned in the -- earlier, I am very focused on making sure that we addressed some of the decisions we made that moved us and our focus away from the smaller-end customers. That's been our problem. And if you look at the results that Sunit shared, it very clearly points out that it's not a problem in the market, it's not a problem with our products and services. Our higher-end customers, where we are focused, have been growing and growing nicely. Now the lower-end customers, where we took our eye off them, when you stop talking to customers, when you create that communication void, they start to look for other solutions. And we just need to make sure that we are talking to them effectively. We know these are not customers that are early adopters for products and services, but that you have to stay focused on them if you want to maintain them. And so our revenue initiatives are more around churn control. We always want to drive sales and we always want to drive the top line growth. The bigger challenge for us right now is that churn in the smaller end of the base. Now Sunit also pointed out that, that small end of the base represents 5% of our revenue. And I'd also point out it's one of the strengths of CenturyLink, looking after those customers. And so we think there are things about this deal that are very, very good for our ability to grow revenue, not only over the course of the next year until this deal closes in the fall of 2017, but beyond that."

Both companies have demonstrated a capability over time to do this. And so we're very confident about those. But network rationalization is more about converting off-net to on-net. And that really has a triple benefit to us. First of all, when we convert off-net to on-net, we control the customer experience end to end.  We provide a better customer experience. We save money. We're no longer paying somebody else to provide that service for us. And we reduce the revenue of our competitors, because we're no longer paying our competitors to provide that service. And so we focus very aggressively, and I think both companies have this history, focus very aggressively on network rationalization.

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. This is an exciting today for CenturyLink and Level 3. Together, we will be the second-largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers. We believe we will create significant benefits and growth opportunities for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
We'll turn to Slide 5. Today marks an important day in advancing our shared visions and strategies. Together we are creating a customer-centric focus and providing customers leading products and services. We are building scalable and agile network-based services to deliver industry-leading value, and both companies strive to adhere to our core values. Today, we really are announcing a new chapter for both companies.
We'll turn to Slide 7 to provide some key highlights of the transaction. First of all, the combined -- combined, we will create a leading facilities-based enterprise communications provider. We will have a strong financial profile, with pro forma total business revenue of approximately $19 billion and business strategic revenue of $13 billion. Total revenue, including our consumer business, will be approximately $26 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $11 billion, including synergies. We believe the transaction -- or the strategic combination, rather, will significantly improve CenturyLink's growth profile and better position the combined company to improve its revenue growth trend and drive meaningful operating cash flow growth in the first full year post-closing, including synergies as realized and including integration costs.
Additionally, we believe the combined company will be able to achieve more than 10% growth and free cash flow per share in the full year post-closing, including synergies as realized, and again including integration cost. We also expect this combination to drive significant improvement in free cash flow per share in subsequent years.
We will also be able to accelerate approximately $10 billion of Level 3 NOLs. These NOLs will significantly reduce the combined company's net cash tax expense, positioning us to create enhanced free cash flow. With that greater financial flexibility, we expect to significantly lower CenturyLink's dividend payout ratio, and this combination also positions us well for future growth. Together, we expect to be able to leverage Level 3's and CenturyLink's strong product portfolios across our combined customer bases. In addition, the increased network scale will provide advantages for our customers in numerous ways.
Going to Slide 8.  The transaction is structured in cash and stock, which we believe provides shareholders both immediate value and the ability to participate in the upside of the combination as we work to realize the significant and compelling benefits of the transaction. CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 for $66.50 per share, which assumed a 60% stock consideration at $40 per share and 40% cash consideration at $26.50 per share. There's implied equity purchase price of approximately $24 billion and an enterprise value of $34 billion. 
Based on those numbers today -- based on those numbers, today's deal represents a premium of approximately 42% based on Level 3's unaffected share price. Once completed, the pro forma company is expected to be approximately 51% owned by CenturyLink shareholders and about 49% owned by Level 3 shareholders. Importantly, the combined company intends to maintain CenturyLink's annual dividend of $2.16 per share. In terms of financing, we have approximately $10.2 billion of financing in place, including a $2 billion unfunded revolver at close. 
Following the close of the transaction, I will continue as Chief Executive Officer and President, and we're pleased to have Sunit Patel join us as Chief Financial Officer. Following almost 35 years of -- at CenturyLink, Stewart Ewing has decided to retire following the close of this transaction. Stewart's been an important -- really a vital part of our company, of this transaction and every other deal we've completed over the years. He is committed to seeing us through the integration and closing with Level 3. Stewart's a great leader. He is a good friend and our company is much stronger due to his many valuable contributions over the years.
In terms of board composition, the Chairman of CenturyLink's Board of Directors at the time of close will continue to serve as chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint 4 Level 3 board members, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Telemedia. We'll discuss the pathway to closing in detail later in the presentation, but we expect the transaction to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject of course to the receipt of regulatory approval, shareholder votes and other customary closing conditions. STT Crossing Ltd., which holds 18% of Level 3, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. 
With that I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Before I do that, I just -- I do want to thank him and his team for the extraordinary effort they have put forth on this transaction. We've long admired Level 3, and I'm excited to -- that we are now combining forces. Jeff?"

I'm very excited to be here today with Glen and his team announcing this combination. As you can see from Slide 9, we are 2 strong enterprise-focused companies coming together to build an even stronger company, able to address the evolving and growing needs of our customers. As Glen mentioned, we believe this is great transaction for our stockholders, customers, employees and industry partners.
As I look at the enterprise marketplace, there are a number of trends that will shape the future of communications. First of all, the demand for bandwidth continues to escalate. The move to IT and IT-based services is not slowing, but accelerating. With the Internet of Things, the number of connected devices will explode over the coming years. Hybrid computing architectures used by enterprises are driving the introduction of hybrid wide-area networking solutions that bring together multiple technologies to meet customer demand. The advent of technologies like SDN and NFV are redefining the ways customers interface with their networks. And lastly, the need to address all of these trends on a global basis.
The combination of these 2 great companies will enhance our ability to meet the opportunities that these trends create. Whether looking at the network footprint or the breadth of the combined product portfolio, this combined company will provide tremendous benefits to our customers.
CenturyLink's managed services portfolio with Level 3's CDN and IP VPN capabilities all delivered over an extensive local and even global network. Our ability to use advanced threat intelligence and security services delivered by the combined company. This creates a company that will offer customers industry-leading capabilities over a world-class network. 
I'd like to take a minute to give my perspective on why this is a compelling transaction for Level 3 stockholders and why our Board of Directors unanimously approved this transaction. First of all, the purchase price is a premium to where our stock has been trading over the last year, with a meaningful portion of the consideration in cash. Shareholders also have the ability to participate in the upside of the powerful company we are creating together.
I truly believe that our ability to serve enterprise customers will be second-to-none. Communications is a scale business, and the combination of our substantial networks and platforms will enable us to deliver services to our customers more efficiently and effectively than either company could alone. I believe that our ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a result of this transaction. 
Before I turn the call over to Glen I'd like to thank the Level 3 employees for their hard work through the years and into the future. Your dedication, vision for the company we are today and your unwavering commitment to our customers has built a great company. I feel lucky to be a part of such an incredible group of employees and I'm excited to see what the future brings for us. Thank you.

As you can see, CenturyLink and Level 3's businesses are highly complementary. And once the transaction closes, stakeholders will benefit from a more diverse business mix, with pro forma revenue of $24.7 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue, and total core revenue of $24.2 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue and data integration revenue. Under these assumptions, we expect more than 75% of our revenues to come from business customers and 65% of our revenues will be strategic revenue.
As Jeff mentioned a moment ago, we will also have the ability to enhance the service and connectivity we provide CenturyLink's large enterprise customer base across Level 3's global footprint. Given the complementary nature of the product portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet the demand for bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.
Turning now to Slide 11.  As you can see, a key differentiator for our company will be that, of the top service providers in the country, we have by far the greatest percentage of our business focused on enterprise customers, and we will become the second-largest competitive provider of network services to businesses in the United States. 
Now turning to Slide 12.  We highlight the significant total cash synergies we expect to achieve from this transaction, with $975 million of what we believe are very achievable annual operating and capital synergies. We expect approximately $850 million in annual operating cost synergies, mostly from corporate network and operational efficiencies and IT systems consolidation, along with purchasing synergies across our advertising and marketing efforts. And we believe we can realize 80% of this annual run rate savings within 36 months after closing.
Our anticipated approximately $125 million in annual CapEx cash savings will come from purchasing synergies, which we expect to be -- to realize fully within 36 months. We currently anticipate our onetime integration cost to achieve these cash savings will be approximately $685 million, with a majority to be incurred between closing and year-end 2019. Both of our companies have significant M&A experience and a strong track record of execution, with a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. This gives us real confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our 2 companies.

Expanding on what Glen outlined earlier, as you can see on Slide 13, the result of this transaction is a combined company with meaningful scale and financial strength, which will enable us to grow and capitalize on these synergy opportunities. The combined company's capital structure will benefit from a strong liquidity profile, including an approximately $2 billion unfunded revolver, free cash flow accretion, with a focus on sustainable free cash flow growth and improvements in our long-term dividend payout ratio.
Our expected free cash flow generation will grant us a flexibility to continue to deliver solid returns, while positioning us to invest in strategic growth initiatives and opportunities, allowing us to better compete in the complex operating environment. On a pro forma basis we expect the combined company to have net leverage of approximately 3.7x and our long-term leverage target remains at approximately 3x.
Turning to Slide 14.  This is an overview of the pro forma arch structure, depicting the combination and the associated new debt raised. The acquisition is structured such that Level 3 will be a subsidiary of CenturyLink, post-acquisition. Level 3's current debt will stay in place, and existing Level 3 entities will not incur or guarantee any acquisition debt. Based on expected ratings, change of control puts in the existing Level 3 debt will not be triggered. No consents are required from Level 3 lenders or note-holders for closing the acquisition.  
All the new acquisition debt will be raised at CenturyLink, and will rank ahead of the existing CenturyLink notes by virtue of expected guarantees from material nonregulated CenturyLink subs, including the EMBARQ parent and the newly created Level 3 holdco. The new debt will also benefit from the expected pledge of stock of QC and Level 3 Communications Inc. QC, a regulated entity, will not guarantee or provide explicit support for any new indebtedness.
Purchase price will be funded by cash on hand at closing for both CenturyLink and Level 3, as well as committed financing of $10.2 billion from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley financing, which includes a $2 billion revolver and $1.2 billion commitment to address upcoming maturities between signing and closing, resulting in incremental funded debt for the transaction of approximately $7 billion.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Glen."

Before this transaction closes, there are a number of key conditions that must be met, including HSR and FCC review and certain state regulatory approvals. We believe regulators will see the benefits of this transaction once they learn more about the details and the benefits to customers. We look forward to discussing this transaction with regulators. As previously mentioned, the transaction is also subject to approval by CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders, and we're pleased to have secured a voting agreement in favor of the transaction with STT Crossing Ltd. 
Now turning to Slide 16.  And to conclude our remarks pertaining to the transaction, before touching on our quarterly earnings, we're confident in the compelling strategic and financial rationale of this transaction and the many benefits it will bring to CenturyLink and Level 3 stakeholders. The combined company will provide our customers with the network they need to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses.
For employees of both companies, we believe this combination will also provide additional growth and advancement opportunities over the years to come, and I look forward to continue to work with our best-in-class team, welcoming the talented members of the Level 3 team.  We're truly excited about CenturyLink and Level 3's future as a combined company and sharing those benefits with all stakeholders as we move forward with this exciting combination.
As we transition to third quarter results -- earnings results, I want to provide a few high-level comments about CenturyLink's third quarter results before turning it over to Stewart. We continue to see the benefits of our operational initiatives and network-first focus, and we are making progress on our broadband enablement road map, which we believe is critical to meeting our customer's long-term growing demand for bandwidth. We remain focused on continuing our pivot to higher-quality broadband customers. And while we still have more improvement to achieve on a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter we added higher ARPU customers, lower churn and fewer high credit risk -- high-risk credit customers in the quarter. So we're making that pivot with our consumer base, and we saw those results -- those trends in the third quarter.
Business strategic service revenues grew 5% year-over-year, led by more than 6% growth in high-speed -- high-bandwidth data service revenues. Business revenue was negatively impacted by churn, along with a renewal of several large customers in the quarter, which included some repricing impact. However, we are pleased with these renewals that will help us to maintain long-term relationships and re-contract a significant amount of revenue over extended terms.
And lastly, we are pursuing a number of activities with lower expenses, including a significant reduction in nonemployee-related expenses, and also a reduction of 7% to 8% in employee-related costs. We remain focused on continuing -- excuse me, these cost reductions are part of our continued effort to keep costs in line with our revenue streams, will position us for the legacy revenue pressures going into 2017. 
With that I'll turn it over to Stewart."
30771,402278150,1067702,"CenturyLink, Inc., Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning.

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Now let's dive in. Today, CenturyLink reported solid third quarter results with total and core revenues, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS all within our guidance range. Third quarter operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 3.8% decrease from third quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues and a decrease of approximately $100 million in high-cost support revenues due to onetime out-of-period CAF Phase 2 support payments recognized in the third quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher strategic services revenues. Overall, strategic revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year. 
Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.92 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago period. Operating income was $595 million for the third quarter 2016, while we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion during the quarter. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income, was $186 million for the quarter.
You may remember last quarter, we had said that we expected higher cash taxes in the third quarter, as the tax payment was deferred from the second quarter. In addition, we made a voluntary pension contribution of $100 million during the third quarter. These 2 items accounted for over $400 million of lower free cash flow in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.28, a decrease from $0.37 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.56, a decrease from $0.70 in the third quarter a year ago. 
Now moving to Slide 19, in our Business segment. In the third quarter the Business segment generated $2.61 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $30 million or 1.1% from the same period a year ago. Legacy revenues from the segment declined 7.6% from third quarter last year due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services revenues. Third quarter strategic revenue for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to third quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services.
On a sequential quarter basis, we had a headwind from the onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 billion -- $10 million that was reported in high-bandwidth data services in the second quarter of this year. Data integration revenues increased $10 million from third quarter 2015, due primarily to higher CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses increased $16 million or 1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by CPE costs related to the higher data integration revenues.
Now turning to Slide 20, the Consumer segment generated $1.47 billion  in operating revenues, a decrease of $37 million or 2.5% from third quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 3.4% year-over-year to $789 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 8.3% from third quarter a year ago, reflecting access line declines and lower long-distance revenues. Our operating expenses increased $19 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to higher content costs related to our Prism TV service.
Now turning to Slide 21. For fourth quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion, core revenues of $3.86 billion to $3.92 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.58 billion and $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.59. In fourth quarter we expect continued growth in strategic revenues to be offset by anticipated declines in legacy revenues and data integration revenues, resulting in lower fourth quarter 2016 operating revenues compared to third quarter of 2016.
Fourth quarter 2016 operating cash flow is expected to be relatively flat compared to third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the anticipated decline in revenues being offset by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the seasonality of outside plant maintenance and utility costs, along with anticipated lower personnel and CPE costs. Additionally, as it pertains to the fourth quarter, we expect to incur severance costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million, related to planned headcount reductions.
These severance costs will be treated as a special item and are therefore excluded from fourth quarter guidance ranges provided. As the fourth quarter guidance implies, we are currently expecting to come in below full-year 2016 guidance ranges previously provided for certain financial metrics. This is primarily due to the weakness that we've experienced in customer units during the third -- second and third quarter. We expect our dividend payout ratio to be in the mid-60% range now for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to briefly discuss Level 3's third quarter results."

During the quarter, the benefits of our operating leverage and focus on profitable growth drove solid bottom-line performance. Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. However, from an enterprise core network services revenue perspective, I'm still not happy with our results. We did not see the improvement in CNS enterprise revenue growth in North America or in EMEA that we expect. Since our second quarter call, we've spent quite a bit of time analyzing our own performance and addressing the issues we've identified. I will let Sunit go into the numbers, but I'll share a few thoughts about North America before handing the call over to him. 
First of all, a logical question is whether the revenue slowdown is associated with a lack of market opportunity for the types of products and services we sell. The answer to this is a firm and clear no. We continue to see market opportunity and demand for the services we provide. As examples, demand for transport services such as waves and dark fiber is strong, and we remain very capable in selling and delivering these services to customers.
Cloud Connect Solutions, IT services, IP VPNs and hybrid LANs continue to address a key need in the marketplace. As a reminder, hybrid LANs are the unique ways we combine a mix of public and private networking services to address customers' desires to support hybrid computing architectures. As a final example, our ability to wrap security, managed services and professional services around these products is a key differentiator and is also well-received within the market.
I have a great deal of confidence that the market opportunity remains attractive, that our competitive position is strong, that we have the right products and services to meet the needs of this market and that the market is moving toward Level 3's strength and capabilities, not away from us. If you look at the revenue growth from our large multinational customers and the higher-end customers of our target market, you can see that our value proposition clearly resonates with these customers.
As further evidence, in general sales are good. However our churn is too high. Over the past year and a half, we've made a number of decisions that were relatively small in isolation but have had the cumulative effect of pressuring revenue, particularly with the lower end of the base. These decisions can be broadly grouped into 2 categories. The first, our efforts to move upmarket. I still believe this is the right decision, but as I look back, we made a couple of mistakes that created customer coverage issues. First of all, we took a very aggressive approach and moved 8,000 customers to inside sales. Frankly, we didn't do it as well as we should have and created a communication void at the low end of our customer base.
With slightly larger customers, but still at the small end, we left those customers in the field sales organization but really lost focus on them as we asked our direct sales force to move upmarket. Again creating a communication void with these customers. Sunit will share the numbers, but as a result, we saw elevated churn from both of these groups of customers. 
The second set of decisions were centered on evolving and rationalizing our product set. We firmly believe in our capabilities and are excited about moving customers to new technologies. We see great acceptance in the marketplace for these capabilities. However, coupling our desire to move upmarket, with higher sales quotas we assigned to the sales team and with compensation plans rewarding sales more than revenue, we transitioned our customers more rapidly than they would have moved on their own. While we recognize the transition to new technologies is good for our business, accelerating your own customers' transitions faster than their natural rate results in more work for your operations team while producing a net write-down in revenue. We saw this dynamic affect customers across the various groups Sunit will discuss. 
If I can go back, I'd make some of these decisions differently. But being an aggressive company, we move fast and lean into growth. Going forward, we have a number of initiatives to address the issues we found. We are implementing a customer retention group within our sales -- inside sales and our field sales organizations to retain customers more effectively. We're augmenting our staff to reach out more frequently and communicate more effectively with smaller customers. We are reestablishing our focus on adding new logos.  We've lost a little bit of attention to this.
We are directing our teams to aggressively renew existing services with smaller customers rather than in sending sales or the customers to transition to new solutions today. We still want to transition to new services, but at their natural rate, not in an artificially accelerated rate because of the unintended consequences of other decisions. In addition, we've realigned our sales compensation, more heavily weighting revenue than sales. We've made process and organizational and structural changes designed to enhance the customer experience in service delivery and service assurance. While I'm optimistic about these changes, churn is a lagging indicator and they will take time to deliver results.
Before I turn the call over to Sunit to provide the detailed financial results, I'd like to sum up by saying we are intently focused on improving enterprise revenue performance. We believe the market opportunity is strong, our value proposition resonates with our customers, and that it's within our own execution to improve revenue growth. 
With that I'll turn the call over to Sunit."
30771,402278150,1067702,"CenturyLink, Inc., Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation",664,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation offset by softness in North America enterprise revenue performance. Overall, total revenue grew 0.4% and CNS revenue grew 1.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.7%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multinational enterprise customers increased 10%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 4.2%, primarily due to continued consolidation-driven disconnects.
I'll now shift to our regional results, which can be found on Slide 24. North America CNS revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 3.1%, driven by solid performance from our largest customers, offset by continued pressure from the low end of our base. As Jeff explained, revenue performance at the high end of our customer base is performing well. The challenges we've seen this year are really from the lower end of the base. As you can see on Slide 25, our largest global accounts customers, who make up 17% of our North America Enterprise CNS revenue, grew 1.9% sequentially. In the next year, customers that spend more than $20,000 per month grew 1.2% sequentially. Customers who spend $2,000 -- between $2,000 and $20,000 per month declined 0.6% sequentially. Finally, our smallest customers, spending less than $2,000 per month and representing 5% of the North America enterprise base, declined 18% sequentially.
Moving to EMEA, CNS revenue declined 7.7% with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. Government, declining 3.7%. In the region, we've been successful with large multinational customers, but they usually order more complex services with longer installation intervals. Higher churn continues to be a challenge for the EMEA region, and we have implemented several improvement initiatives to improve churn. For the past couple of quarters, we've experienced weakness in conferencing, co-location and lower-speed services.
Going forward, we are transitioning the business to focus on higher-bandwidth On-Net services. Usage revenues also weakened in the third quarter, driven by some large IP customer re-rates. We expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. Overall in EMEA, we are encouraged as enterprise CNS sales bookings in EMEA are up about 40% year-to-date compared to 2015, and we expect improved revenue performance in the coming quarters. 
In Latin America, we saw strong enterprise performance, driven in part by the Olympics. CNS enterprise revenue grew 16%, or 13% if you exclude the benefits from the Olympics, which was about $4 million in the third quarter. For the quarter, our overall sales bookings for the company were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and our sales funnel remains healthy. From a product group perspective, IP and data services grew 3%; transport and fiber declined 1%; voice services grew 0.4%; and co-location and data services revenue declined 0.2% year-over-year. From an individual product perspective, dark fiber grew 5%, CDN grew 15%, and managed security grew 16%.
Turning to Slide 26.  Adjusted EBITDA was $716 million for the third quarter of 2016. This compares to $641 million in the third quarter of 2015. The double-digit percentage improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the improvement in network-access costs, along with tighter management of operating expenses. We also continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 35.2% in the third quarter 2016 compared to 31.5% in the third quarter 2015.  
Year to date, capital expenditures were approximately 17% of total revenue. During the quarter, capital spending was higher than previous quarters, as we invested to meet stronger demand from fiber and wavelength sales. The company generated free cash flow of $281 million in the quarter compared to $237 million from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we remain focused on our revenue performance and have multiple initiatives in place to drive growth. We are excited about the combination with CenturyLink and look forward to what lies ahead.

Next year, because of the cash taxes that we anticipated increasing, our payout ratio is going to bump up to the low to mid-80s.

And we look very diligently at what is -- what are those opportunities and are we executing on them effectively. So looking forward, as I mentioned in the -- earlier, I am very focused on making sure that we addressed some of the decisions we made that moved us and our focus away from the smaller-end customers. That's been our problem. And if you look at the results that Sunit shared, it very clearly points out that it's not a problem in the market, it's not a problem with our products and services. Our higher-end customers, where we are focused, have been growing and growing nicely. Now the lower-end customers, where we took our eye off them, when you stop talking to customers, when you create that communication void, they start to look for other solutions. And we just need to make sure that we are talking to them effectively. We know these are not customers that are early adopters for products and services, but that you have to stay focused on them if you want to maintain them. And so our revenue initiatives are more around churn control. We always want to drive sales and we always want to drive the top line growth. The bigger challenge for us right now is that churn in the smaller end of the base. Now Sunit also pointed out that, that small end of the base represents 5% of our revenue. And I'd also point out it's one of the strengths of CenturyLink, looking after those customers. And so we think there are things about this deal that are very, very good for our ability to grow revenue, not only over the course of the next year until this deal closes in the fall of 2017, but beyond that."

We're no longer paying somebody else to provide that service for us. And we reduce the revenue of our competitors, because we're no longer paying our competitors to provide that service.

It increases our network reach. The combined company will have 75,000 on-net buildings. We'll have expanded products and services, solutions really to meet the global enterprise needs of customers. And we will have -- we'll create significant synergies, again, $175 million in cash synergies. We'll have nearly $10 billion in net operating losses to offset our cash taxes. We create the ability to de-lever from 3.7x, including run rate synergies, to 3x or less within 4 years of closing. This transaction significantly improves our dividend payout ratio, approximately 60% level within 4 years post-closing. It strengthens our liquidity profile, including being accretive to free cash flow per share in the first year.
So overall, this is a great transaction, I believe, for both companies, in so many different levels, so many ways. So we're looking forward to the months ahead as we move toward the approval -- the proper approvals, bringing these companies together. 
I want to thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to talking with you further in the weeks and months ahead. Thank you."
