Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2016. Our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussions and analysis for the results, will be available later today. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations web page. This teleconference is being webcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 1 month.
On today's call, I'll review the highlights of the third quarter related to sales and operations and product development. Efrain will review our third quarter financial results in more detail and discuss our full year guidance, and then we'll open it up for any questions.
Once again, we've experienced growth across our major human capital management solutions during the third quarter. Our third quarter financial results reflected total service revenue growth of 7%, including 4% in payroll service revenue and continued double-digit growth in our HRS revenue. We experienced positive sales growth for the first 9 months, including a strong selling season. We were particularly pleased with our results in the mid-market space. Our HR outsourcing services also continued to reflect strong growth. 
Mark Bottinicome, our head of sales, and his organization has done a terrific job working as a team to demonstrate to new clients the value of our full suite of products that are -- the full -- the value of our full suite of products that they offer. Our sales force turnovers are at its lowest level in years and we are already ramping up for additional reps to be fully staffed for the start of fiscal 2017. 
Our service execution continues to excel, demonstrated by continuing high levels of client satisfaction and retention. We completed a successful calendar year-end and our employees continue providing great service as we have moved to an even more flexible service options. Year-to-date, we are experiencing the best net client gains since the recession as a result of both positive and effective selling and solid retention results. 
In terms of product development, we continue to focus on enhancing the user experience and flexibility with Paychex Flex, our cloud-based human capital management platform. Paychex Flex delivers access to payroll, human resources and benefits information, creating a streamlined and integrated approach to workforce management. 
Earlier this fiscal year, we launched new and integrated modules within the Flex platform. This included the addition of Paychex Flex Time, Paychex Flex Benefits Administration and Paychex Flex Hiring, which includes paperless recruiting, screening and on boarding. This integrated suite allows for a simpler user interface that is supported by an industry-leading service model. We are very proud of our Paychex Flex platform and we're pleased to be recognized for the value our technology brings to our clients. In addition to the recognition from the Brandon Hall Group and Gartner increasing our position in the Magic Quadrant earlier this year, PC Magazine recently recognized Paychex Flex as one of the best cloud-based payroll services for 2016. We are very proud of the increased recognition that Paychex Software-as-a-Service based products and service are experiencing and we see this played out with solid sales and retention performance. 
Last fiscal year, we launched our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service, which is our full service Affordable Care Act, more commonly know as ACA solution. Our ESR product includes a multi-monitoring service with automatic alerts as well as year-end reporting. Our revenue from this ACA solution has increased as we assist clients with their monitoring and year-end reporting requirements. As a result of the demand for this service, we have increased our implementation and support spending. 
On December 22, we completed the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance Partners offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. We are excited about the opportunity this acquisition provides and believe it's a great fit. The temporary staffing industry has experienced expanded growth in clients are within our target market of small and midsized businesses. Our consolidated financial results include Advance Partners from the date of the acquisition in late December. 
We remain committed to adding value to our shareholders. Last July, we increased our dividend by 11% to $0.42 per share and have maintained a strong dividend yield of over 3%, one of the highest in our industry. Our stock repurchase program remains in place and we have required 2.2 million shares of common stock during the first 9 months of fiscal '16. 
I would like to take a moment to mention something else we're very proud of. On March 10, we were recognized by Institute as a 2016 World's Most Ethical Company. As an 8-year [indiscernible], we believe this award underscores our commitment to leading ethical business practices and standards and practices, ensuring long-term value to key stakeholders, including our customers, our investors and employees. We are 1 of only 2 companies in the outsourcing services category honored this year. 
In summary, we saw continued strong execution from our sales and service teams, our product and financial performance remains strong and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team. We are focused on a strong finish to fiscal 2016 in a few months here. And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

Good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's -- during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and thus involve risks. refer to the usual disclosures.
As Marty indicated, our third quarter financial results for this fiscal year reflect continued progress across major product lines. I'll cover the highlights and provide greater detail on certain areas then wrap wit a review of the 2016 outlook. 
Total revenues, as you saw, grew 7% for the third quarter and 9 months to $753 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. Total service revenue also grew 7% for the third quarter and 9 months to $741 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the third quarter and 8% for the 9 months to $12 million and $34 million, respectively. We are beginning to see some positive impact from recent increases in interest rates, average invested balances for clients funds were basically flat year-over-year as positive impact from client growth was roughly offset by lower stake unemployment insurance rates. 
Total expenses increased 7% for both the third quarter and 9 months. Compensation related costs were the largest contributor to this growth, driven by higher wages and performance-based comp. In addition, strong growth in the PEO and the additional cost for Advance Partners in this quarter were factors in expense growth. Operating income net of certain items increased 6% for the third quarter and 9% for the 9 months to $268 million and $837 million, respectively. We've maintained strong operating margins of 36% for the third quarter and 39% for the 9 months, but anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance of approximately 38%. As a reminder, we typically experience lower operating margins in the back half of the fiscal year. 
Net income was up 7% to $180 million for the third quarter and 13% to $579 million for the 9 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.50 per share for the third quarter and 13% to $1.60 per share for the 9 months. The 9-month period was positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to prior year revenues that were recognized in the first quarter. Excluding this impact, net income and diluted earnings per share would have risen 9% and 10%, respectively, and what you see in EPS is a functional so of the effect of buybacks that we've done over the past year.
Payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the third quarter and 9 months to $440 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. Advance Partners considered slightly less than 1% to payroll service for the third quarter. Let me repeat that, slightly less than 1% to payroll service revenue growth for the quarter. And I would say one other thing. Checks per client in the quarter moderated. This was partly a result of 2 things. One is in the third quarter benefit, I should say, bonus checks are typically we assume they're going to be a little bit higher than the year before. They didn't end up being the case this year. Although it's difficult to quantify. And we had a little bit of impact that was a result of client mix in the quarter. So Q3 is a little bit tough to predict in that respect. We ended up a little lighter than we had projected.
HRS revenue increased 12% to $301 million for the third quarter and 13% to $865 million for the 9 months. We are pleased with the growth for the quarter. Through call last quarter, we indicated that we anticipated Q3 HRS revenue growth to be below the low end of the range for annual guidance. This was due to a comparison to a stronger quarter in the prior year. We exceeded expectations, landing in the middle of the range. The increase reflected strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR Services, our largest HRS revenue stream, which includes ASO and PEO products. And we had -- continued to have strong growth in PEO revenue in the quarter. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our ACA product that assist clients with health care reform and an increase in health and benefits [indiscernible] . Together with higher average premiums and clients in our workers' comp insurance programs. 
One other note, and we call this out in our Investor Day, I want to just highlight this. HCM module revenues that assist clients in HR administration and time and attendance also were strong in the quarter. You don't see that in the payroll service revenue because of the way we account for it, but as we discussed during -- we will discuss during the call, when we get questions on sales, we had a strong performance in mid-market. And you see that reflected in HRS, not in payroll. Advance Partners contributed slightly more than 1% to HRS revenue growth for the quarter.
Now turning to our investment portfolio. Our goal continues to be the protection of principle and optimization of liquidity. On a short-term site, our primary short-term interest vehicles were banked and deposit accounts, U.S. Treasury securities and high-quality commercial paper appeared. In our longer term portfolio, we best primarily in high credit quality and municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Long-term portfolio had an average yield to maturity currently of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1% for the third quarter and 1.1% for the 9 months.
In December, the Fed raised federal funds rates by 25 basis points. It's the first interest rate hike in a decade, as you know. With this, we have raised our guidance and our interest on funds held for clients to high single digits where we had previously indicated it will be relatively flat, but simply reflects what you're already seeing in the numbers. So it's really not a significant change in guidance.
I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. We had cash and total investments of $756 million as of the end of the quarter. Note that funds held for clients as of February 29 were $4.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis, and averaged $4.5 billion for the quarter and $4 billion for the 9 months.
Total available for sale investments included corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net capitalized gains -- unrealized, I should say, gains of $61 million as of February 29th compared with net unrealized gains of $40 million as of May 31, 2015. Total stockholder's equity was 1.9 million as of February 29, reflecting $455 million in dividends paid during the 9 months and 108 million of common shares repurchased or return on equity for the past 12 months with a sterling 39%.
Our cash flows from operations were also strong this quarter and I want to call that out. They totaled $791 million for the first 9 months and again, a very, very strong 14% increase from the prior year. The chance change was a result of higher net income, higher noncash adjusted net income fluctuations and working capital. So from a financial metrics perspective, very pleased with where we ended.
Now onto the 2016 guidance. I'd like to remind you that it's based on current view of economic and industry conditions. Guidance for the full year is unchanged from previous quarter, except as I mentioned for interest on funds held for clients. I'll reiterate some of our full year ranges and then give some concluding color. Payroll service revenue anticipated to be in the range of 4% to 5%. That obviously also includes the addition of advanced payroll in that number. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 10% to 13%. Again, Advance is in that number and obviously expected will be at the high end of that number. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 7% to 8%. Again, towards the high end of that number. And net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Please note that the range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit to be recorded in the first quarter. 
Effective tax rate for the year, also excluding the impact of the net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, will be approximately 36%. Our interest on funds held for clients are now expected to grow in the high single digits, as I said, as a result of recently increases in interest rates, current guidance, we do not anticipate any additional increases in the Fed funds rate for the remainder of the fiscal year. And if someone can decide for what the Fed is saying, I will -- I would be interested in getting schooled on the subject. But finally, we anticipate the contribution of Advance Partners is going to add somewhere between 1% and 1.5% to total service revenue in the fourth quarter. So that's a bit of color on what's happening there. Finally, we anticipate higher selling expense in the last quarter of the year. We had strong sales and comp will be up as a result of that. And higher ops expense due to stronger sales also. And also, client on boarding for ACA compliance solution. We anticipate, with all this, that our operating margins in the fourth quarter will be between 35% and 36%, bringing the full year margin in line with our previous guidance of approximately 38%. 
And with that, I will turn it back to Marty."

So let me unpack that. So I think you're right that about 3% is correct. In my comments, I called out specifically that the driver of that being the 3%, which by the way, is up sequentially from last -- from the comparable quarter a year ago where we were a little bit over 2%, really was driven by checks. And there's 2 things that happened because I'll get a number questions of this -- on the call. Third quarter is unusual compared to every other quarter in the year because third quarter is a quarter where you have more checks than normal due to the bonus checks. There's simply no way to figure it out. I have spent a lot of time looking at dollars to figure out whether they equate to checks. So we don't know whether there just may have been lower checked by in part because of bonus checks. And then the second thing that I called out is our client mix was a little bit lower in the quarter than we modeled. And so the combination of both of those drove the rate down a little bit. We'll have to see whether that's a trend that continues. In part, there's a good point to that. Our unit sales growth is, at this point, trending about 2x double what it was last year. So when you have that, you tend to have a mix that does skews a little bit lower. And then one other point that I would make on that is that the way that we report numbers, what you see is payroll is simply the portion of a bundle that is payroll. It really says nothing literally until you can aggregate so that the non-payroll portion of the sales that are made in the mid-market. And there, we saw some nice pickup in the quarter. So I think that the short of it, after I've said all of that, checks were a little bit lighter in the quarter than we anticipated. We'll see whether that's a trend that continues. Client mix skewed a little bit smaller than we had projected, but we'll see where we go from here. And no, when I say those of you will know when we talk about guidance, when I say it's between 4 and 5, you can peg where we expect it to be."

And for every large staffing company, there's always spinoffs that need financing and funding and back-office services.

And we look at strategies that drive that. And we're fairly unique in that. We play both in the micro space with everything from SurePayroll to the mid-market space with our Paychex Flex integrated solutions. So we'll have to have a number of continued strong quarters in terms of unit growth to drive that higher. But one thing I want to emphasize, which I said earlier. For us, as we think about payroll service revenue growth, increasingly, what we think about is HCM platform service growth, and we're seeing that already. You see that in the HRS numbers. What our salespeople do -- a salesperson in our 1 to 50 or small-market sales force, they are not simply selling a payroll only solution. They are increasingly selling a bundled HCM solution. And we're seeing benefits from that. The benefits don't flow into the payroll service revenue line because the portion of the HCM platform, particularly HR administration and time and attendance, where we've seen really good growth, really is reflected in HRS. So I think were seeing a bit of both and we're going to focus on both driving revenue by selling more integrated HCM and also, driving units by approaching that smaller market aggressively."

And look, frankly, just to kind of expand on that, and you've covered the company for a long time. 10 years ago, what we did was we saw a payroll sales person, either in the small-market. Sold payroll. That's what they sold. And then if there were ancillaries, they were sold by an ancillary sales force. That was the product we had. I would say in the last 5 years, certainly since Marty was CEO, that dynamic has changed pretty significantly. Our financials reflect the old dynamic, not the new one. And the new dynamic is this. 2 things. Much, much better sales efficiency so that when Mark has a client of a certain type that we've identified, it's a team sale. But we've already discussed that in prior calls. What's changed really over the last 18 months is that a small-market payroll salesperson has -- is able to sell a HCM bundled product. And they are increasingly doing that. Meaning, our payroll sales people who used to sell payroll only, now sell products that are actually included in the HRS revenue, which is time and attendance and also HR administration. So it is very, very possible that total revenue can grow nicely and payroll service revenue doesn't seem to be moving up significantly. And that's a function of where the technology has been and where the market is heading. So we're going to have to figure out how we represent that a little bit more clearly. I think it is the case as we put more emphasis on selling more integrated bundles that you could very well see payroll service revenue not growing quite as fast, but you've seen sustained growth in HRS because that's where the other components of the HCM revenue are being recorded. It wasn't a big deal several years ago. It's a bigger deal now."

I think for the mid-market where we've been talking a lot about this morning, I think that the biggest -- the best impact for our clients has been the multiproduct centers that we've been putting together. So in the past, you would have your payroll support and then you would have your additional products in unique support where they're uniquely trained on that product time and attendance and HRO. And while that worked well, sometimes clients would say this would be even better if your kind of more connected as a team so that things between various products if I had questions on how to use something or best get the most value out of it. And so those multiproduct centers have been established by John Gibson and the team. And we're stuffing those up now. And we're seeing more clients come into those multiproduct centers. That's probably been the biggest benefit. The other one is last year at some point, we went to a 7 by 24 service. And that's been a benefit. I would say that's more of a benefit on a small end of clients then we seen an increase use of that where, hey, they're doing payroll themselves online and it's off hours. It's Saturday. It's Sunday. It's weeknight, late at tonight and they get hung up on something that they want to do and they can call for that 7 by 24 support now. And that's gained a lot of interest and a lot of positive feedback as well. So I think it's that flexibility or and is well, of course, they can do a lot more self-service. They can do a lot more things themselves. And we're finding that clients don't actually stick to one service model. There, this week might want to be more themselves then get hung up on creating a couple of special bonuses or something the next week and need support. And the next week, they might need after hours support. So it's that flexibility that we're finding us getting positive feedback."

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2016. Our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussions and analysis of the results, will be available later today. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations web page. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 1 month.
On today's call, I'll review the highlights of the third quarter related to sales and operations and product development. Efrain will review our third quarter financial resorts -- results in more detail and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for any questions.
Once again, we've experienced growth across our major human capital management solutions during the third quarter. Our third quarter financial results reflected total service revenue growth of 7%, including 4% in payroll service revenue and continued double-digit growth in our HRS revenue. We experienced positive sales growth through the first 9 months, including a strong selling season. We were particularly pleased with our results in the mid-market space. Our HR outsourcing services also continued to reflect strong growth. 
Mark Bottini, our Head of Sales, and his organization have done a terrific job working as a team to demonstrate to new clients the value of our full suite of products that are -- the full -- the value of our full suite of products that they offer. Our sales force turnover is at its lowest level in years, and we are already ramping up for additional reps to be fully staffed for the start of fiscal 2017. 
Our service execution continues to excel, demonstrated by continuing high levels of client satisfaction and retention. We completed a successful calendar year-end, and our employees continued providing great service as we have moved to even more flexible service options. Year-to-date, we are experiencing the best net client gains since the recession as a result of both positive and effective selling and solid retention results. 
In terms of product development, we continue to focus on enhancing the user experience and flexibility with Paychex Flex, our cloud-based human capital management platform. Paychex Flex delivers access to payroll, human resources and benefits information, creating a streamlined and integrated approach to workforce management. Earlier this fiscal year, we launched new and integrated modules within the Flex platform. This included the addition of Paychex Flex Time, Paychex Flex Benefits Administration and Paychex Flex Hiring, which includes paperless recruiting, screening and onboarding. This integrated suite allows for a simpler user interface that is supported by an industry-leading service model. 
We are very proud of our Paychex Flex platform, and we're pleased to be recognized for the value our technology brings to our clients. In addition to the recognition from the Brandon Hall Group and Gartner increasing our position in the Magic Quadrant earlier this year, PC Magazine recently recognized Paychex Flex as one of the best cloud-based payroll services for 2016. We are very proud of the increased recognition that Paychex software-as-a-service-based products and service are experiencing, and we see this played out with solid sales and retention performance. 
Last fiscal year, we launched our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service, which is our full service Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as ACA, solution. Our ESR product includes a multi-monitoring service with automatic alerts as well as year-end reporting. Our revenue from this ACA solution has increased as we assist clients with their monitoring and year-end reporting requirements. As a result of the demand for this service, we have increased our implementation and support spending. 
On December 22, we completed the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance Partners offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. We are excited about the opportunity this acquisition provides and believe it's a great fit. The temporary staffing industry has experienced expanded growth, and clients are within our targeted market of small and midsized businesses. Our consolidated financial results include Advance Partners from the date of the acquisition in late December. 
We remain committed to adding value to our shareholders. Last July, we increased our dividend by 11% to $0.42 a share and have maintained a strong dividend yield of over 3%, one of the highest in our industry. Our stock repurchase program remains in place, and we have acquired 2.2 million shares of common stock during the first 9 months of fiscal '16. 
I would like to take a moment to mention something else we're very proud of. On March 10, we were recognized by Ethisphere Institute as a 2016 World's Most Ethical Company. As an 8-year honoree, we believe this award underscores our commitment to leading ethical business practices and -- standards and practices, ensuring long-term value to key stakeholders, including our customers, our investors and employees. We are 1 of only 2 companies in the outsourcing services category honored this year. 
In summary, we saw continued strong execution from our sales and service teams. Our product and financial performance remains strong, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team. We are focused on a strong finish to fiscal 2016 in a few months here. 
And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

I'd like to remind everyone that today's -- during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, thus, involve risks. Refer to the usual disclosures.
As Marty indicated, our third quarter financial results for this fiscal year reflect continued progress across major product lines. I'll cover the highlights and provide greater detail on certain areas then wrap with a review of the 2016 outlook. 
Total revenues, as you saw, grew 7% for the third quarter and 9 months to $753 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. Total service revenue also grew 7% for the third quarter and 9 months to $741 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the third quarter and 8% for the 9 months to $12 million and $34 million, respectively. We are beginning to see some positive impact from recent increases in interest rates. Average invested balances for client funds were basically flat year-over-year as positive impact from client growth was roughly offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates. 
Total expenses increased 7% for both the third quarter and 9 months. Compensation-related costs were the largest contributor to this growth, driven by higher wages and performance-based comp. In addition, strong growth in the PEO and the additional cost for Advance Partners in this quarter were factors in expense growth. 
Operating income net of certain items increased 6% for the third quarter and 9% for the 9 months to $268 million and $837 million, respectively. We've maintained strong operating margins of 36% for the third quarter and 39% for the 9 months but anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance of approximately 38%. As a reminder, we typically experience lower operating margins in the back half of the fiscal year. 
Net income was up 7% to $180 million for the third quarter and 13% to $579 million for the 9 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.50 per share for the third quarter and 13% to $1.60 per share for the 9 months. The 9-month period was positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to prior year revenues that were recognized in the first quarter. Excluding this impact, net income and diluted earnings per share would have risen 9% and 10%, respectively. And what you see in EPS is a function also of the effect of buybacks that we've done over the past year.
Payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the third quarter and 9 months to $440 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. Advance Partners contributed slightly less than 1% to payroll service revenue growth for the third quarter. And let me repeat that, slightly less than 1% to payroll service revenue growth for the quarter. 
And I would say one other thing. Checks per client in the quarter moderated. This was partly a result of 2 things. One is in the third quarter, a benefit -- I should say, bonus checks are typically we assume they're going to be a little bit higher than the year before. That didn't end up being the case this year, although it's difficult to quantify. And we had a little bit of impact that was a result of client mix in the quarter. So Q3 is a little bit tough to predict in that respect. We ended up a little bit lighter than we had projected.
HRS revenue increased 12% to $301 million for the third quarter and 13% to $865 million for the 9 months. We are pleased with the growth for the quarter. Through our call last quarter, we indicated that we anticipated Q3 HRS revenue growth to be below the low end of the range of our annual guidance. This was due to a comparison to a stronger quarter in the prior year. We exceeded expectations, landing in the middle of the range. 
The increase reflected strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR Services, our largest HRS revenue stream, which includes ASO and PEO products, and we had -- continued to have strong growth in PEO revenue in the quarter. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our ACA product that assist clients with health care reform and an increase in health and benefits applicants, together with higher average premiums and clients in our workers' comp insurance programs. 
One other note, and we called this out in our Investor Day, I want to just highlight this. HCM module revenues that assist clients in HR administration and time and attendance also were strong in the quarter. You don't see that in the payroll service revenue because of the way we account for it. But as we discussed during -- we will discuss during the call, when we get questions on sales, we had a strong performance in mid-market. And you see that reflected in HRS not in payroll. Advance Partners contributed slightly more than 1% to HRS revenue growth for the quarter.
Now turning to our investment portfolio. Our goal continues to be the protection of principal and optimization of liquidity. On the short-term side, our primary short-term interest vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts, U.S. treasury securities and high-quality commercial paper. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high-credit-quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Long-term portfolio has an average yield to maturity currently of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1% for the third quarter and 1.1% for the 9 months.
In December, the Fed raised federal funds rates by 25 basis points. This is the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, as you know. With this, we have raised our guidance on our interest on funds held for clients to high single digits, where we had previously indicated it would be relatively flat. That simply reflects what you're already seeing in the numbers, so it's really not a significant change in guidance.
I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. We had cash and total investments of $756 million as of the end of the quarter. Note that funds held for clients as of February 29 were $4.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $4.5 billion for the quarter and $4 billion for the 9 months.
Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net capitalized gains -- unrealized, I should say, gains of $61 million as of February 29 compared with net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May 31, 2015. Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 million (sic) [$1.9 billion] as of February 29, reflecting $455 million in dividends paid during the 9 months and 108 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 39%.
Our cash flows from operations were also strong this quarter, and I want to call that out. They totaled $791 million for the first 9 months and, again, a very, very strong 14% increase from the prior year. The change was a result of higher net income, higher noncash adjusted net income and positive fluctuations in working capital. So from a financial metrics perspective, very pleased with where we ended.
Now on to the 2016 guidance. I'd like to remind you that it's based on current view of economic and industry conditions. Guidance for the full year is unchanged from previous quarters, except, as I mentioned, for interest on funds held for clients. I'll reiterate some of our full year ranges and then give some concluding color. 
Payroll service revenue anticipated to be in the range of 4% to 5%. That obviously also includes the addition of Advance payroll in that number. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 10% to 13%. Again, Advance is in that number and, obviously, expected will be at the high end of that number. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 7% to 8%, again, towards the high end of that number. And net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Please note that the range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter. Effective tax rate for the year, also excluding the impact of the net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, will be approximately 36%. 
Our interest on funds held for clients is now expected to grow in the high single digits, as I said, as a result of recent increases in interest rates. Current guidance does not anticipate any additional increases in the Fed funds rate for the remainder of the fiscal year. And if someone can decide for what the Fed is saying, I will -- I would be interested in getting schooled on the subject. But finally, we anticipate the contribution of Advance Partners is going to add somewhere between 1% and 1.5% to total service revenue in the fourth quarter. So that's a bit of color on what's happening there. 
Finally, we anticipate higher selling expense in the last quarter of the year, we had strong sales and comp will be up as a result of that; and higher ops expense due to stronger sales also; and also, client onboarding for ACA compliance solution. We anticipate, with all of this, that our operating margins in the fourth quarter will be between 35% and 36%, bringing the full year margin in line with our previous guidance of approximately 38%. 
And with that, I will turn it back to Marty."

So let me unpack that. So I think you're right that about 3% is correct. In my comments, I called out specifically that the driver of that being -- of the 3%, which, by the way, is up sequentially from last -- from the comparable quarter a year ago, where we were a little bit over 2%, really was driven by checks. And there's 2 things that happened, because I'll get a number of questions on this on the call. Third quarter is unusual compared to every other quarter in the year because third quarter is a quarter where you have more checks than normal due to bonus checks. There's simply no way to figure it out, and I've spent a lot of time looking at dollars to figure out whether they equate to checks. So we don't know whether there just may have been lower check volume in part because of bonus checks. And then the second thing that I called out is our client mix was a little bit lower in the quarter than we modeled. And so the combination of both of those drove the rate down a little bit. We'll have to see whether that's a trend that continues. In part, there's a good point to that. Our unit sales growth is, at this point, trending about 2x, double what it was last year. So when you have that, you tend to have a mix that skews a little bit lower. And then one other point that I would make on that is that the way that we report numbers, what you see is payroll is simply the portion of a bundle that is payroll. It really says nothing literally until you can aggregate to that the payroll -- the non-payroll portion of the sales that are made in the mid-market, and there, we saw some nice pickup in the quarter. So I think that the short of it, after I've said all of that, checks were a little bit lighter in the quarter than we anticipated. We'll see whether that's a trend that continues. Client mix skewed a little bit smaller than we had projected, but we'll see where we go from here. And no, when I say -- those of you who know, when we talk about guidance, when I say it's between 4% and 5%, you can peg where we expect it to be."

The second part is we are not in the staffing business, and we are not -- have no interest in being in the staffing business. But we have a lot of interest in providing back-office services to the staffing business because we think, from a secular growth perspective, and Marty alluded to it earlier in his comments, we think temp staffing is going to do nothing but go up. Part A. Part B is there's lots of small- and medium-sized staffing firms, and those of you who cover that industry know that. And for every large staffing company, there's always spinoffs that need financing and funding and back-office services. So we had looked at this transaction literally for 3 years before we pulled the trigger to convince ourselves that the growth rates were real and that there's an opportunity for someone with the right kind of both service and capital availability to come in and make an impact.

So I think we had been very effective at the low end of the market in capturing units as compared to last year. In order to have significant growth in unit acceleration, that would be visible in 2, 3 quarters. We need to have sustained -- continued sustained unit growth. And we look at strategies that drive that. And we're fairly unique, in that we play both in the micro space, with everything from SurePayroll, to the mid-market space with our Paychex Flex integrated solutions. So we'll have to have a number of continued strong quarters in terms of unit growth to drive that higher. But one thing I want to emphasize, which I said earlier. For us, as we think about payroll service revenue growth, increasingly, what we think about is HCM platform service growth, and we're seeing that already. You see that in the HRS numbers. What our salespeople do, a salesperson in our 1 to 50 [ph] or small-market sales force, they are not simply selling a payroll-only solution. They are increasingly selling a bundled HCM solution, and we're seeing benefits from that. The benefits don't flow into the payroll service revenue line because the portion of the HCM platform, particularly HR administration and time and attendance, where we've seen really good growth, really is reflected in HRS. So I think we're seeing a bit of both, and we're going to focus on both driving revenue by selling more integrated HCM and also driving units by approaching that smaller market aggressively."

And look, frankly, just to kind of expand on that -- and you've covered the company for a long time. 10 years ago, what we did was we saw a payroll salesperson, either -- in the small market, sold payroll. That's what they sold.",318,"Yes, that's right, David. And look, frankly, just to kind of expand on that -- and you've covered the company for a long time. 10 years ago, what we did was we saw a payroll salesperson, either -- in the small market, sold payroll. That's what they sold. And then, if there were ancillaries, they were sold by an ancillary sales force. That was the product we had. I would say, in the last 5 years, certainly since Marty was CEO, that dynamic has changed pretty significantly. Our financials reflect the old dynamic, not the new one. And the new dynamic is this. Two things. Much, much better sales efficiency so that when Mark has a client of a certain type that we've identified, it's a team sale. But we've already discussed that in prior calls. What's changed really over the last 18 months is that a small-market payroll salesperson has -- is able to sell a HCM bundled product, and they are increasingly doing that. Meaning, our client -- our payroll salespeople, who used to sell payroll only, now sell products that are actually included in the HRS revenue, which is time and attendance and also HR administration. So it is very, very possible that total revenue can grow nicely and payroll service revenue doesn't seem to be moving significantly. And that's a function of where the technology has been and where the market is heading. So we're going to have to figure out how we represent that a little bit more clearly. I think it is the case, as we put more emphasis on selling more integrated bundles, that you could very well see payroll service revenue not growing quite as fast, but you're seeing seen sustained growth in HRS, because that's where the other components of that HCM revenue are being recorded. It wasn't a big deal several years ago. It's a bigger deal now."

Minimum cash, it's lower than what we have on the balance sheet now, but this is a business where you have to project a sense of financial strength to the customers to whom we're entrusting $4.5 billion of cash to use.

I think, for the mid-market where we've been talking a lot about this morning, I think that the biggest -- the best impact for our clients has been the multiproduct centers that we've been putting together. So in the past, you would have your payroll support, and then you would have your additional products in unique support, where they're uniquely trained on that product, time and attendance and HRO. And while that worked well, sometimes clients would say, ""Geez, it would be even better if you were kind of more connected as a team, so that things between various products if I had questions on how to use something or best get the most value out of it."" And so those multiproduct centers have been established by John Gibson and the team, and we're staffing those up now. And we're seeing more clients come into those multiproduct centers. That's probably been the biggest benefit. The other one is, last year at some point, we went to the 7-by-24 service, and that's been a benefit. I would say that's more of a benefit on the small end of clients, and we've seen an increased use of that where, hey, they're doing payroll themselves online, and it's off-hours. It's Saturday. It's Sunday. It's weeknight, late at night, and they get hung up on something that they want to do, and they can call for that 7-by-24 support now. And that's gained a lot of interest and a lot of positive feedback as well. So I think it's that flexibility or -- and as well, of course, they can do a lot more self-service. They can do a lot more things themselves. And we're finding that clients don't actually stick to one service model. There -- this week, might want to be doing more things themselves than get hung up on creating a couple of special bonuses or something the next week and need a support. And the next week, they might need after-hours support. So it's that flexibility that, we're finding, is getting positive feedback."

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2016. Our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussions and analysis of the results, will be available later today. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations web page. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 1 month.
On today's call, I'll review the highlights of the third quarter related to sales and operations and product development. Efrain will review our third quarter financial resorts -- results in more detail and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for any questions.
Once again, we've experienced growth across our major human capital management solutions during the third quarter. Our third quarter financial results reflected total service revenue growth of 7%, including 4% in payroll service revenue and continued double-digit growth in our HRS revenue. We experienced positive sales growth through the first 9 months, including a strong selling season. We were particularly pleased with our results in the mid-market space. Our HR outsourcing services also continued to reflect strong growth. 
Mark Bottini, our Head of Sales, and his organization have done a terrific job working as a team to demonstrate to new clients the value of our full suite of products that are -- the full -- the value of our full suite of products that they offer. Our sales force turnover is at its lowest level in years, and we are already ramping up for additional reps to be fully staffed for the start of fiscal 2017. 
Our service execution continues to excel, demonstrated by continuing high levels of client satisfaction and retention. We completed a successful calendar year-end, and our employees continued providing great service as we have moved to an even more flexible service options. Year-to-date, we are experiencing the best net client gains since the recession as a result of both positive and effective selling and solid retention results. 
In terms of product development, we continue to focus on enhancing the user experience and flexibility with Paychex Flex, our cloud-based human capital management platform. Paychex Flex delivers access to payroll, human resources and benefits information, creating a streamlined and integrated approach to workforce management. Earlier this fiscal year, we launched new and integrated modules within the Flex platform. This included the addition of Paychex Flex Time, Paychex Flex Benefits Administration and Paychex Flex Hiring, which includes paperless recruiting, screening and onboarding. This integrated suite allows for a simpler user interface that is supported by an industry-leading service model. 
We are very proud of our Paychex Flex platform, and we're pleased to be recognized for the value our technology brings to our clients. In addition to the recognition from the Brandon Hall Group and Gartner increasing our position in the Magic Quadrant earlier this year, PC Magazine recently recognized Paychex Flex as one of the best cloud-based payroll services for 2016. We are very proud of the increased recognition that Paychex software-as-a-service-based products and service are experiencing, and we see this played out with solid sales and retention performance. 
Last fiscal year, we launched our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service, which is our full service Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as ACA, solution. Our ESR product includes a monthly monitoring service with automatic alerts as well as year-end reporting. Our revenue from this ACA solution has increased as we assist clients with their monitoring and year-end reporting requirements. As a result of the demand for this service, we have increased our implementation and support spending. 
On December 22, we completed the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance Partners offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. We are excited about the opportunity this acquisition provides and believe it's a great fit. The temporary staffing industry has experienced expanded growth, and clients are within our targeted market of small and midsized businesses. Our consolidated financial results include Advance Partners from the date of the acquisition in late December. 
We remain committed to adding value to our shareholders. Last July, we increased our dividend by 11% to $0.42 a share and have maintained a strong dividend yield of over 3%, one of the highest in our industry. Our stock repurchase program remains in place, and we have acquired 2.2 million shares of common stock during the first 9 months of fiscal '16. 
I would like to take a moment to mention something else we're very proud of. On March 10, we were recognized by Ethisphere Institute as a 2016 World's Most Ethical Company. As an 8-year honoree, we believe this award underscores our commitment to leading ethical business practices and -- standards and practices, ensuring long-term value to key stakeholders, including our customers, our investors and employees. We are 1 of only 2 companies in the outsourcing services category honored this year. 
In summary, we saw continued strong execution from our sales and service teams. Our product and financial performance remain strong, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team. We are focused on a strong finish to fiscal 2016 in a few months here. 
And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

Refer to the usual disclosures.As Marty indicated,",1652,"Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's -- during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, thus, involve risks. Refer to the usual disclosures.
As Marty indicated, our third quarter financial results for this fiscal year reflect continued progress across major product lines. I'll cover the highlights and provide greater detail in certain areas then wrap with a review of the 2016 outlook. 
Total revenues, as you saw, grew 7% for the third quarter and 9 months to $753 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. Total service revenue also grew 7% for the third quarter and 9 months to $741 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the third quarter and 8% for the 9 months to $12 million and $34 million, respectively. We are beginning to see some positive impact from recent increases in interest rates. Average invested balances for client funds were basically flat year-over-year, as a positive impact from client growth was roughly offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates. 
Total expenses increased 7% for both the third quarter and 9 months. Compensation-related costs were the largest contributor to this growth, driven by higher wages and performance-based comp. In addition, strong growth in the PEO and the additional cost for Advance Partners in this quarter were factors in expense growth. 
Operating income net of certain items increased 6% for the third quarter and 9% for the 9 months to $268 million and $837 million, respectively. We've maintained strong operating margins of 36% for the third quarter and 39% for the 9 months but anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance of approximately 38%. As a reminder, we typically experience lower operating margins in the back half of the fiscal year. 
Net income was up 7% to $180 million for the third quarter and 13% to $579 million for the 9 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.50 per share for the third quarter and 13% to $1.60 per share for the 9 months. The 9-month period was positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to prior year revenues that were recognized in the first quarter. Excluding this impact, net income and diluted earnings per share would have risen 9% and 10%, respectively. And what you see in EPS is a function also of the effect of buybacks that we've done over the past year.
Payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the third quarter and 9 months to $440 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. Advance Partners contributed slightly less than 1% to payroll service revenue growth for the third quarter. And let me repeat that, slightly less than 1% to payroll service revenue growth for the quarter. 
And I would say one other thing. Checks per client in the quarter moderated. This was partly a result of 2 things. One is in the third quarter, benefit -- I should say, bonus checks are typically we assume they're going to be a little bit higher than the year before. That didn't end up being the case this year, although it's difficult to quantify. And we had a little bit of impact that was a result of client mix in the quarter. So Q3 is a little bit tough to predict in that respect. We ended up a little bit lighter than we had projected.
HRS revenue increased 12% to $301 million for the third quarter and 13% to $865 million for the 9 months. We are pleased with the growth for the quarter. If you recall last quarter, we indicated that we anticipated Q3 HRS revenue growth to be below the low end of the range for our annual guidance. This was due to a comparison to a stronger quarter in the prior year. We exceeded expectations, landing in the middle of the range. 
The increase reflected strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR Services, our largest HRS revenue stream, which includes ASO and PEO products, and we had -- continued to have strong growth in PEO revenue in the quarter. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our ACA product that assist clients with health care reform and an increase in health and benefits applicants, together with higher average premiums and clients in our workers' comp insurance programs. 
One other note, and we called this out in our Investor Day, I want to just highlight this. HCM module revenues that assist clients in HR administration and time and attendance also were strong in the quarter. You don't see that in the payroll service revenue because of the way we account for it. But as we discussed during -- we will discuss during the call, when we get questions on sales, we had a strong performance in mid-market. And you see that reflected in HRS not in payroll. Advance Partners contributed slightly more than 1% to HRS revenue growth for the quarter.
Now turning to our investment portfolio. Our goal continues to be the protection of principal and optimization of liquidity. On the short-term side, our primary short-term interest vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts, U.S. treasury securities and high-quality commercial paper. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high-credit-quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Long-term portfolio has an average yield to maturity currently of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1% for the third quarter and 1.1% for the 9 months.
In December, the Fed raised federal funds rates by 25 basis points. This is the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, as you know. With this, we have raised our guidance on our interest on funds held for clients to high single digits, where we had previously indicated it would be relatively flat. That simply reflects what you're already seeing in the numbers, so it's really not a significant change in guidance.
I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. We had cash and total investments of $756 million as of the end of the quarter, no debt. Funds held for clients as of February 29 were $4.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.5 billion for the quarter and $4 billion for the 9 months.
Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net capitalized gains -- unrealized, I should say, gains of $61 million as of February 29 compared with net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May 31, 2015. Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 million (sic) [$1.9 billion] as of February 29, reflecting $455 million in dividends paid during the 9 months and $108 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 39%.
Our cash flows from operations were also strong this quarter, and I want to call that out. They totaled $791 million for the first 9 months and, again, a very, very strong 14% increase from the prior year. The change was a result of higher net income, higher noncash adjusted net income and positive fluctuations in working capital. So from a financial metrics perspective, very pleased with where we ended.
Now on to the 2016 guidance. I'd like to remind you that it's based on current view of economic and interest rate conditions. Guidance for the full year is unchanged from previous quarters, except, as I mentioned, for interest on funds held for clients. I'll reiterate some of our full year ranges and then give some concluding color. 
Payroll service revenue anticipated to be in the range of 4% to 5%. That obviously also includes the addition of Advance payroll in that number. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 10% to 13%. Again, Advance is in that number and, obviously, expect it will be at the high end of that number. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 7% to 8%, again, towards the high end of that number. And net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Please note that the range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter. Effective tax rate for the year, also excluding the impact of the net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, will be approximately 36%. 
Our interest on funds held for clients is now expected to grow in the high single digits, as I said, as a result of recent increases in interest rates. Current guidance does not anticipate any additional increases in the Fed funds rate for the remainder of the fiscal year. And if someone can decipher what the Fed is saying, I will -- I would be interested in getting schooled on the subject. But finally, we anticipate the contribution of Advance Partners is going to add somewhere between 1% and 1.5% to total service revenue in the fourth quarter. So that's a bit of color on what's happening there. 
Finally, we anticipate higher selling expense in the last quarter of the year, we had strong sales and comp will be up as a result of that; and higher ops expense due to stronger sales also; and also, client onboarding for ACA compliance solution. We anticipate, with all of this, that our operating margins in the fourth quarter will be between 35% and 36%, bringing the full year margin in line with our previous guidance of approximately 38%. 
And with that, I will turn it back to Marty."

Just wanted to ask a question on the growth of the core payroll business in the quarter, which came in a little bit below where we had modeled. I know you'd called out growth for the quarter to be at the low end of the full year range, kind of the 4% to 5%. Once I exclude the benefit from Advance, it looks like the growth is more in that 3% range. So first, is this the right way to be thinking about this? And second, anything in particular that was a drag in the quarter? And then just lastly, how should we think about the full year guidance range? Should we now expect growth maybe at the lower end of the range?"

So let me unpack that. So I think you're right that about 3% is correct. In my comments, I called out, specifically, that the driver of that being -- of the 3%, which, by the way, is up sequentially from last -- from the comparable quarter a year ago, where we were a little bit over 2%, really was driven by checks. And there's 2 things that happened, because I'll get a number of questions on this on the call. Third quarter is unusual compared to every other quarter in the year because third quarter is a quarter where you have more checks than normal due to bonus checks. There's simply no way to figure it out, and I've spent a lot of time looking at dollars to figure out whether they equate to checks. So we don't know whether there just may have been lower check volume in part because of bonus checks. And then the second thing that I called out is our client mix was a little bit lower in the quarter than we modeled. And so the combination of both of those drove the rate down a little bit. We'll have to see whether that's a trend that continues. In part, there's a good point to that. Our unit sales growth is, at this point, trending about 2x, double what it was last year. So when you have that, you tend to have a mix that skews a little bit lower. And then one other point that I would make on that is that the way that we report numbers, what you see as payroll is simply the portion of a bundle that is payroll. It really says nothing, literally, until you can aggregate to that the payroll -- the non-payroll portion of the sales that are made in the mid-market, and there, we saw some nice pickup in the quarter. So I think that the short of it, after I've said all of that, checks were a little bit lighter in the quarter than we anticipated. We'll see whether that's a trend that continues. Client mix skewed a little bit smaller than we had projected, but we'll see where we go from here. And no, when I say -- those of you who know, when we talk about guidance, when I say it's between 4% and 5%, you can peg where we expect it to be."

Because if we adjust, last year, for the change in PEO presentation, it really doesn't look like you've seen any acceleration in service revenue growth.

And if I just pick on the quarter and project Q3 forward and say what do you assume about that, I think you got to add in Q4 to get a better picture because the back half takes -- tells a better picture. And sequentially, Q4 is going to be stronger than Q3. But I think you need to take both of those quarters together, and that gives you a more accurate picture of where the company is going. And I think that, obviously, you've got projections and there's 3 projections out there, and they seem reasonably in line with what we expect is going to happen. And then we'll issue guidance off of that. So I don't -- this is not a business that -- where you can project one quarter to tell you what the rest of the year is going to look like because there's always elements of timing, when days fall. For example, this quarter ended on a Monday. Whether the quarter ends on a Monday or a Thursday can have some impacts on revenue. So I'd say you really need to look at 3 and 4 to kind of form a better opinion. We're very pleased -- but we're pleased. Just one other thing, Gary. When we look at the key indicators -- so before this call, I looked at 12 key indicators. I'm looking at client base. I'm looking at discounting. I'm looking at net client growth. I'm looking at sales units. I'm looking at sales, annualized sales revenue. I mean every vector was pointing in the right direction. The only item in the quarter that was a little bit lighter than we anticipated was checks. And there's some variability in that, so it doesn't concern me, significantly."

But I also think, in a general sense that we've talked about the last few years, you see the need for HR and the acceptance of outsourcing and going to an HR administration and a SaaS-based product for time and attendance, HR administration, benefit enrollment, payroll. We've seen that certainly come down in size from 50 employees to 100 employees down below 50. So I think there's still plenty of opportunity to have strong sales even -- it's not just the Affordable Care Act. So I -- we still feel good about the opportunity for future sales because the demand has come down, so meaning more clients are interested in it and gaining value from it and the fact that I think we've invested very timely in our products and service model to be able to respond to that increased demand."

The second part is we are not in the staffing business, and we are not -- have no interest in being in the staffing business. But we have a lot of interest in providing back-office services to the staffing business because we think, from a secular growth perspective, and Marty alluded to it earlier in his comments, we think temp staffing is going to do nothing but go up. Part A. Part B is there's lots of small- and medium-sized staffing firms, and those of you who cover that industry know that. And for every large staffing company, there's always spinoffs that need financing and funding and back-office services. So we had looked at this transaction literally for 3 years before we pulled the trigger to convince ourselves that the growth rates were real and that there's an opportunity for someone with the right kind of both service and capital availability to come in and make an impact.

That's a growing industry with their clients. We were -- when we started getting into this, we were surprised at the thousands of small independent staffing firms that needed that support.

So what we do have, we added share buybacks into the -- into our capital distribution approach. But Kartik, the second point is that -- and Advance is one example of it. So for a number of years, you've heard us say that we wanted to keep some powder dry to be able to move quickly to do acquisitions. The pipeline is as robust as it's really been in the last 3 or 4 years. And there are a number of acquisitions that we're looking at that could consume much or all or even more of that cash. And so we prefer, at this point, until that pipeline dries up, to focus on the right kinds of selective M&A as a use of that cash. If in the next 12 months, that -- those opportunities don't materialize, then we'll have that discussion.

So I think we had been very effective at the low end of the market in capturing units as compared to last year. In order to have significant growth in unit acceleration that would be visible in 2 or 3 quarters, we need to have sustained -- continued sustained unit growth. And we look at strategies that drive that. And we're fairly unique, in that we play both in the micro space, with everything from SurePayroll, to the mid-market space with our Paychex Flex integrated solution. So we'll have to have a number of continued strong quarters in terms of unit growth to drive that higher. But one thing I want to emphasize, which I said earlier. For us, as we think about payroll service revenue growth, increasingly, what we think about is HCM platform service growth, and we're seeing that already. You see that in the HRS numbers. What our salespeople do, a salesperson in our 1 to 50 or small-market sales force, they are not simply selling a payroll-only solution. They are increasingly selling a bundled HCM solution, and we're seeing benefits from that. The benefits don't flow into the payroll service revenue line because the portion of the HCM platform, particularly HR administration and time and attendance, where we're seeing really good growth, really is reflected in HRS. So I think we're seeing a bit of both, and we're going to focus on both driving revenue by selling more integrated HCM and also driving units by approaching that smaller market aggressively."

And look, frankly, just to kind of expand on that -- and you've covered the company for a long time. 10 years ago, what we did was we saw a payroll salesperson, either -- in the small market, sold payroll. That's what they sold. And then, if there were ancillaries, they were sold by an ancillary sales force. That was the product we had. I would say, in the last 5 years, certainly since Marty was CEO, that dynamic has changed pretty significantly. Our financials reflect the old dynamic, not the new one. And the new dynamic is this. Two things. Much, much better sales efficiency so that when Mark has a client of a certain type that we've identified, it's a team sale. But we've already discussed that in prior calls. What's changed really over the last 18 months is that a small-market payroll salesperson has -- is able to sell a HCM bundled product, and they are increasingly doing that. Meaning, our client -- our payroll salespeople, who used to sell payroll only, now sell products that are actually included in the HRS revenue, which is time and attendance and also HR administration. So it is very, very possible that total revenue can grow nicely and payroll service revenue doesn't seem to be moving significantly. And that's a function of where the technology has been and where the market is heading. So we're going to have to figure out how we represent that a little bit more clearly. I think it is the case, as we put more emphasis on selling more integrated bundles, that you could very well see payroll service revenue not growing quite as fast, but you're seeing sustained growth in HRS, because that's where the other components of that HCM revenue are being recorded. It wasn't a big deal several years ago. It's a bigger deal now."

I think, for the mid-market where we've been talking a lot about this morning, I think that the biggest -- the best impact for our clients has been the multiproduct centers that we've been putting together. So in the past, you would have your payroll support, and then you would have your additional products in unique support, where they're uniquely trained on that product, time and attendance and HRO. And while that worked well, sometimes clients would say, ""Geez, it would be even better if you were kind of more connected as a team, so that things between various products if I had questions on how to use something or best get the most value out of it."" And so those multiproduct centers have been established by John Gibson and the team, and we're staffing those up now. And we're seeing more clients come into those multiproduct centers. That's probably been the biggest benefit. The other one is, last year at some point, we went to the 24/7 service, and that's been a benefit. I would say that's more of a benefit on the small end of clients, and we've seen an increased use of that where, hey, they're doing payroll themselves online, and it's off-hours. It's Saturday. It's Sunday. It's weeknight, late at night, and they get hung up on something that they want to do, and they can call for that 24/7 support now. And that's gained a lot of interest and a lot of positive feedback as well. So I think it's that flexibility or -- and as well, of course, they can do a lot more self-service. They can do a lot more things themselves. And we're finding that clients don't actually stick to one service model. They're -- this week, might want to be doing more things themselves, then get hung up on creating a couple of special bonuses or something the next week and need support. And the next week, they might need after-hours support. So it's that flexibility that, we're finding, is getting positive feedback."

I mean, I do think there's -- it's going both ways. You're seeing those with needs coming down. So I'd say even 20-plus employees, sometimes 15, depending on the business, they want more of a full-service solution. So they're not just looking for payroll. They're looking for help with recruiting and onboarding their clients and screening and all that, that's tied right in with their payroll. They're not just looking for payroll. So there's that growth in demand. Then there's also, on the low end, much more of a -- there's more clients who say, ""Hey, I just want an online solution with 24/7 support when I need it, and I'm willing to do -- and I want to do more things myself. So we're trying -- the changes we've been making the last few years in technology and service models have been to respond to kind of all of that. So if you're an online client, we made the online, and continuing to do that, actually, this next 12 months, make it much more easier, make it kind of an employee journey for the clients so that they can walk through all the way from hiring right through to payroll, HR, et cetera, in a very self-service format, if that's the way they want to do it."

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results",995,"Thank you, and good morning, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings release call and webcast. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage, and we will file our Form 10-K by the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month. 
On today's call, I will review highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 related to sales, operations and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions. 
We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2016. Our momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Efrain will talk in more detail about the financial results, but I want to touch on a couple of key points. First, total revenue was up 9% in the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year, reaching nearly $3 billion, a new record for Paychex. Payroll service revenue continued to experience steady growth of 4% for fiscal '16, driven by growth in client base and revenue per check, and our payroll quite this finish this year at approximately 605,000 clients, the highest client growth in recent years. 
Solid sales execution during fiscal '16, along with high client retention in excess of 82% positively impacted our client base. Client retention was consistent with last year's record-high retention. 
HRS revenue benefited from strong demand for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services as we once again realized double-digit growth in client worksite employees that we serve. In particular, our PEO has been an area of strong growth. In addition, our full service Affordable Care Act product contributed to the HRS revenue increase. 
During fiscal 2016, we made significant enhancements to our Paychex Flex platform, which is our proprietary cloud-based human capital management, or HCM, solution. Paychex Flex is a robust technology and service model that supports our clients' delivery phase of their employees' journey from recruiting to retirement. This model allows business owners and HR professionals to tailor a solution encompassing tools, capabilities and services that meet the unique needs of their organization and employees. 
Earlier this year, we completed the integration of the remaining key HCM modules with Paychex Hiring, Paychex Time and Paychex Benefits. We believe we also have the best-in-market mobility offerings for both administrative users and employee self-service that allows access to our HCM suite with a single mobile application. 
Paychex Flex continues to receive positive reviews evidenced by multiple awards and acknowledgments received throughout this year. Earlier in the year, we earned recognition from the Brandon Hall Group Excellence awards for advancements in workforce management technology for small and midsize businesses. PC Magazine's review referred to Paychex Flex as excellent, calling it more robust and scalable than some of our competitors' platforms. And most recently in the quarter, we received the 2016 TekTonic Award for HR -- from HRO Today for the best-in-class mobile and cloud-based technology suite for comprehensive integrated HCM services. We are very pleased by this recognition, and it supports our belief that Paychex Flex technology, combined with the unique mix of personalized, flexible service options, sets us apart and provides great value to our clients. We remain committed to our investments and product development and technology to keep us a market leader. 
Sales execution during '16 was strong, with another year double-digit growth, especially within the mid-market space. We believe the value that our Flex platform provides is a key driver to this success. 
During fiscal '16, we announced the acquisition of Advance Partners, who joined the Paychex' team during the third quarter. Advance Partners offers customized -- customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. Advance Partners and its leadership team has already proven to be a great addition with our positive results and opportunity for growth in the expanding staffing market. 
Throughout the year, we have continued our shareholder-friendly actions. We maintain a strong dividend yield. And in July of '15, we increased our regular quarterly dividend by 11%. The dividend increase supports our history of providing exceptional shareholder value while continuing to make strategic investments for the long-term sustained growth of Paychex. We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired an additional 2.2 million shares of common stock for $108 million in fiscal 2016. 
As of May 31, 2016, our stock price was over $54 per share, and that is a total return of over 102% or 15% on an annualized basis over the past 5-year period. 
The regulatory landscape for HCM continues to get more complicated, making managing HR increasingly difficult. We strive to be a valuable resource to our clients to educate them on changes and assist them with compliance. Recently, new overtime rules were approved by the Department of Labor that will expand overtime protection to millions of workers. We are well positioned to help our clients comply with these new regulations. Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, can assist companies with the scheduling, tracking and reporting of time, which will be critical to managing this new regulation. 
In summary, I'm extremely proud of the leadership team and all of our employees at Paychex who have continued to deliver great service and product solutions, resulting in continued high client satisfaction and continued high levels of client retention. We also continue to focus on providing leading-edge, user-friendly technology and unique personalized service to our clients, while delivering solid, consistent, top line growth, strong operating margins and excellent returns to our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and thus, involve some risks. Refer to the customary disclosures. 
As Marty indicated, we had a strong finish to 2016. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the quarter and for the fiscal year and then provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2017 outlook. 
Total service revenue grew 9% for the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $12 million and 9% for the fiscal year to $46 million. Increases were primarily the result of higher average interest rates earned. Average investment balances were up 1% for the fiscal year, showing a positive impact from client growth, which is offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates. 
Total expenses increased by 8% in the fourth quarter and by 7% for the fiscal year. These increases were mainly in compensation-related costs, resulting from higher wages and higher performance-based comp. Strong growth in our PEO also contributed to the increases. 
Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of the growth in total expenses for the fourth quarter, but less than 1% for the fiscal year. Operating margin was 36% for the fourth quarter and 38% for fiscal 2016. operating income, net of certain items, increased 10% to $264 million for the fourth quarter and 9% to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2016. 
Our effective tax rate was 34.3% for the year compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2015. This is due to software production tax benefits as we've discussed in prior calls. In our first quarter, we recognized a discrete item in the form of a tax benefit derived on income from prior year related to customer-facing software we produced. This discrete item was the largest -- had the largest impact on the effective tax rate. While we have ongoing benefits, the impact is not as significant. 
Net income growth increased 11% to $178 million for the fourth quarter and 12% to $757 million for the fiscal year. Diluted EPS increased 11% to $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter and increased 13% to $2.09 per share for fiscal 2016. Net income and diluted earnings per share would have increased 9%, respectively, without the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. 
Payroll service revenue increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounts. 
Fiscal 2016 also benefited from 2 additional processing days during the year, 1 day in the first quarter and 1 day in this quarter, fourth quarter. The extra days added approximately 1/2 percent to total payroll revenue as did the acquisition of Advance. 
HRS revenue increased 14% to $311 million for the fourth quarter and 13% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. HRS service continued to experience solid growth in clients and client worksite employees served. The PEO, in particular, contributed double-digit growth in client worksite employees served. Insurance services revenue growth benefited from continued growth of our ACA product and an increase in health and benefit applicants. The workers' compensation portion continued to grow with higher average premiums and growth in clients. Advance Partners contributed approximately a little bit less than 2% to growth in HRS revenue for the fourth quarter and approximately 1% to fiscal year growth. 
Investments and income. Our primary goal, as you know, continues to be to protect principal and to optimize liquidity. Combined portfolio, including both short-term and long-term investments, have average return rate of return of 1.1% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We did see moderate benefit from the 25 basis point increase by the Federal Reserve on the short-term portion of our portfolio. But our long-term portfolio as of May 31, 2016, has an average yield maturity of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.1 years. Fairly unchanged from last year. 
Average investment balances for our client funds were flat for the quarter and up 1% for the fiscal year. Our client growth positively impacted our average balances. This was offset by the impact of lower state unemployment insurance rates this year. 
The average invested balances for our corporate funds were down 9% for the year, largely due to the cash outflow for the business acquisition as well as share repurchases. 
I'll now walk you through the highlights on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $793 million as of May 31, 2016, and no debt. Our cash flows from operations hit a milestone, exceeding $1 billion for the fiscal year, 14% higher than last year. Our net income, non-cash adjustments and favorable working capital changes all contributed to the increase. 
Funds held for clients as of May 31, 2016, were $4 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.1 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of approximately 1%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflecting net unrealized gains of $48 million as of May 31, 2016, compared to $14 million as of the end of last year. 
Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 billion as of May 31, reflecting $607 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 80% of net income. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 40%. 
Now let's turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. I'd like to remind you that the guidance and our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing without significant changes. Payroll service revenue is projected to increase approximately 4% compared to fiscal 2016. The projected growth is based on an anticipated client-based growth and increases in revenue per check. This growth is tempered by 1 less processing day in fiscal 2017. So we'll have 1 less processing day this year, and that day will occur in the third quarter. So I'll come back to that in a second. So 1 less day occurs in the third quarter. 
HRS revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Net income is expected to increase approximately 8%, excluding the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And that's important to bear in mind when the 2 years are compared. 
Our operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue, is expected to be approximately 38%. We anticipate a modest impact on leverage growth as we are making investment in operations to support both mid-market and compliance solution services. So I will get the question, and I'll answer it now. So we don't anticipate -- do we anticipate leverage? Yes, we do. We think it will be modest because, as I just called out, we're making investments in with operations and compliance service solutions to bolster and to support that growth. 
With respect to the quarters, as previously mentioned, there'll be 1 less processing day in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Now let me get a little bit more granular so you can fine-tune your models. Payroll revenue for the first and second quarters is expected to be at/or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue. The third quarter, we expect to be below. We've -- I just mentioned we have 1 less day. It'll be below the full year range. And then the fourth quarter, at this stage, we anticipate will be between 3% and 4%. 
So just to reiterate. First and second quarters, we expect to be at/or above full year guidance for payroll revenue; third quarter, below; and fourth quarter, below 3% and 4% at this point. 
HRS is expected to be within the full year guidance range with the exception of the third quarter, which will fall below the full year range. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36%. 
Interest on funds is anticipated to be in the mid-single-digit range. We have not included any potential Fed fund rate increases in our guidance. 
I'd like to call out that when I reviewed consensus models, many of the numbers were close to what I'm reporting, but there was one important difference. Interest on funds held for clients was higher in the consensus models, and it looked like to the tune of about $0.01 to $0.02. We are not including any assumptions with respect to Fed rate rise increases. And as you well can appreciate, those look a lot more uncertain than they did even 3 or 4 weeks ago. 
And then finally, with respect to EPS, we expect EPS in each of the quarters to be comparable, meaning pretty similar, with the following exception. First quarter, we expect will be modestly higher and the third quarter, modestly lower. The third quarter, in particular, because of the 1 less day on payroll processing. So that's the fine tuning on the guidance. 
And then just want to make one final comment. It was about 5 years ago that Marty started to assemble the team that has led Paychex over the 5-year period. And he set an ambitious goal. The goal was to hit $3 billion in revenue. That was an ambitious goal because when we finished 2011, we were growing 4%. This quarter, we're really on the cusp of that goal. It's an important milestone internally for us. Marty cited the returns for the past 5 years. We compared very favorably versus the S&P 500 and even against the S&P Technology Index. Those results are a testament to both employees, the executive team and to Marty's leadership. 
We're not the kind of people who brag or smack talk, but we're quietly very, very pleased that we've -- we're on the cusp of that milestone. But we're also grounded enough to understand that we have to earn the trust of our clients, employees and our shareholders every day if we want to succeed. Every question you've asked in the last 5 years has caused us to think, to question and it's challenged us. And we've appreciated that. And yes, finally, we're not satisfied. We're hungry for more. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Marty."

Now what you're seeing there is the fact that 2 things that are implicit there. Number one, we had a really good year in mid-market sales. In some areas, our win rates were really, really strong. And as we look into the year, we did 2 things this year. In 2016, we added to the mid-market sales force, which we don't typically do mid-year, but we did. And as we added to the mid-year sales force, we were also transforming the service model. So we've made a lot of changes on the service model to improve service to mid-market clients. And just in anticipation of that growth, we decided that it was important to have a year where we put more money into bolstering our service there. So that's what happened. I think it's really kind of more of a 1- to 2-year thing than a long-term issue in terms of affecting leverage. And finally, to your point, PEOs just not big enough to really move the needle.

However, when you think about how many new clients come into us every year, we think we'll have a great attachment rate of that product. It really is necessary work. And one of the costs, as Efrain said, with the investment in the mid-market, one of those costs is continuing to invest in the ACA support. Because as we've learned, as we've gone through, this requires even more support of the clients and the filing requirements and a little more technology to kind of help the clients through the process.

I really struggle to understand why revenue wouldn't accelerate at least modestly, and the guidance implies none. So is there something else going on like less pricing? It just feels like something doesn't add up here with a simple math. And I did hear you clearly that the checks per client is not as big a driver as it's been in the past.

So checks per client, when they go flat to modestly negative because of client mix, you end up having an impact on payroll service growth, number one. Number two, it is -- it's not 7 months. It's actually about 6 months' worth of revenue that will get it from Advance. So although that's pretty minor number, it's not quite as much as you're suggesting. And I think there's more -- I think what we've recognized as we've gone through the year is that the higher the client growth and we've set pretty ambitious goals again next year I think between 2% and 3%. Initially, that comes at some impact in terms of what you're expecting on overall pricing. So we recoup that over time. But as you grow, and this has been history of the company prior to the recession, you pay a little bit of a price on checks and also on overall rate by -- based on what's happening with client growth. So it's all of that. And then the third thing that I would say, which you're not factoring in, is we had a nice bump -- uplift from the ACA compliance product. And while I mentioned it earlier in response to Jason's question that we absorbed it in the guidance, of course, we're not having that uplift in growth this year that we had last year. So if you stripped all of that out, you'd see underlying acceleration. We're obviously not going to detail all of that out to get to the guidance. So those are the factors that are -- that affect the overall rate.
Sorry, one other thing. By the way -- sorry, about that, Gary. We had 1 less day in the year, so that's the other part of payroll service growth.
So all of those things imply, if you made it won't put you through the pain of doing, you'd see that we're actually accelerating a bit."

The vast majority of our clients have -- are on the Flex platform.

So a lot of work now is going to making mobility and the online visibility into a simpler, easier to use, more HTML5 kind of language, also the options for -- we haven't talked about it, but the options for Spanish. We've really put most everything in Spanish now, and we're seeing a nice uptick in sales to Hispanic businesses, which has been a focus for us the last few years from both a sales and service perspective.

So you have ACA, but you have the recently done overtime regulations. You have paid leave now for families you got to keep track of. You have a lot more immigration and keeping track of who your employees are and all that, that you have to be backed up with. And the enforcement of the rules is we see are stronger. So more businesses are being impacted by audits, by investigations, by are you following the rules correctly. And because states and the Fed's are also looking for more revenue sources, so states can go after things. So I think that whole regulation side is becoming increasingly more complex at a lower level. So we're seeing people -- we're seeing clients buy time and attendance that normally were probably 40 employees and higher, 30. PEO tended to be higher. Now it's coming down lower. They're looking for help with insurance and benefit plans because they have to be more competitive. The other second thing would be the market is more competitive now for employees as you get closer to lower unemployment and full employment. And so people need more help with having more competitive benefits, more competitive recruiting tools, being able to recruit online, paperless, attract new employees. And I think -- there was another one there I was thinking about -- oh, and I think the acceptance of cloud-based technology and having -- and getting away from desktop and on-premise solutions has rapidly increased the last 3 to 4 years. But we're still seeing that increase where years ago, you -- people want to do more things themselves, worry about their security. Now they want to trust their security of information with a third-party outsourcer. Kind of totally reversed from 5 or 6 years ago. Now they just Paychex is large enough and a big enough IT security team that they're going to do their best to protect their information where I used to have to do it inside. So I think there's just a big push of regulations, compliance and the need, therefore, pushing down to a lower level. And so we're seeing -- that mid-market that I would say used to be 50 to 500 or 1,000 has really pushed down to maybe 15 or 20 to 500 is a real sweet spot right now that a lot of focus."

I don't necessarily see it going down because there's always technology, and we want to stay on the leading edge from a competitive standpoint. But -- and then there's not as much operational leverage. But we continue to, as Efrain said, we're going to -- we continue to try to look.

And because there is continued more temporary helping staffing that's going to be needed, I think particularly with the overtime rules and so forth. So we saw them as a component of the portfolio to grow revenue. There'll be some overlap between us and the fact that we have a number of staffing companies that are payroll clients or other products. And so we'll look to refer. We're already doing that, looking to see if those staffing companies who are clients of us for payroll could be helped by payroll funding and other support from Advance.

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations web page, and we will file our Form 10-K by the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.
On today's call, I will review highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 related to sales, operations and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions.
We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2016. Our momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Efrain will talk in more detail about the financial results, but I want to touch on a couple of key points. First, total revenue was up 9% in the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year, reaching nearly $3 billion, a new record for Paychex. Payroll service revenue continued to experience steady growth of 4% for fiscal '16, driven by growth in client base and revenue per check, and our payroll client base finished this year at approximately 605,000 clients, the highest client growth in recent years.
Solid sales execution during fiscal '16, along with high client retention in excess of 82%, positively impacted our client base. Client retention was consistent with last year's record-high retention.
HRS revenue benefited from strong demand for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services as we once again realized double-digit growth in client worksite employees that we serve. In particular, our PEO has been an area of strong growth. In addition, our full service Affordable Care Act product contributed to the HRS revenue increase.
During fiscal 2016, we made significant enhancements to our Paychex Flex platform, which is our proprietary cloud-based human capital management or HCM solution. Paychex Flex is a robust technology and service model that supports our clients' delivery phase of their employees' journey from recruiting to retirement. This model allows business owners and HR professionals to tailor a solution encompassing tools, capabilities and services that meet the unique needs of their organization and employees.
Earlier this year, we completed the integration of the remaining key HCM modules with Paychex Hiring, Paychex Time and Paychex Benefits. We believe we also have the best-in-market mobility offerings for both administrative users and employee self-service that allows access to our HCM suite with a single mobile application.
Paychex Flex continues to receive positive reviews evidenced by multiple awards and acknowledgments received throughout this year. Earlier in the year, we earned recognition from the Brandon Hall Group Excellence awards for advancements in workforce management technology for small and midsize businesses. PC Magazine's review referred to Paychex Flex as excellent, calling it more robust and scalable than some of our competitors' platforms.
And most recently in the quarter, we received the 2016 TekTonic Award for HR -- from HRO Today for the best-in-class mobile and cloud-based technology suite for comprehensive integrated HCM services. We are very pleased by this recognition, and it supports our belief that Paychex Flex technology, combined with a unique mix of personalized, flexible service options, sets us apart and provides great value to our clients. We remain committed to our investments and product development and technology to keep us a market leader.
Sales execution during '16 was strong with another year of double-digit growth, especially within the mid-market space. We believe the value that our Flex platform provides is a key driver to this success.
During fiscal '16, we announced the acquisition of Advance Partners, who joined the Paychex team during the third quarter. Advance Partners offers customized -- customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. Advance Partners and its leadership team has already proven to be a great addition with our positive results and opportunity for growth in the expanding staffing market.
Throughout the year, we have continued our shareholder-friendly actions. We maintained a strong dividend yield. And in July of '15, we increased our regular quarterly dividend by 11%. The dividend increase supports our history of providing exceptional shareholder value while continuing to make strategic investments for the long-term sustained growth of Paychex.
We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired an additional 2.2 million shares of common stock for $108 million in fiscal 2016. As of May 31, 2016, our stock price was over $54 per share, and that is a total return of over 102% or 15% on an annualized basis over the past 5-year period.
The regulatory landscape for HCM continues to get more complicated, making managing HR increasingly difficult. We strive to be a valuable resource to our clients to educate them on changes and assist them with compliance. Recently, new overtime rules were approved by the Department of Labor that will expand overtime protection to millions of workers. We are well positioned to help our clients comply with these new regulations. Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, can assist companies with the scheduling, tracking and reporting of time, which will be critical to managing this new regulation.
In summary, I'm extremely proud of the leadership team and all of our employees at Paychex who have continued to deliver great service and product solutions, resulting in continued high client satisfaction and continued high levels of client retention. We also continue to focus on providing leading-edge, user-friendly technology and unique personalized service to our clients while delivering solid, consistent, top line growth, strong operating margins and excellent returns to our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

I'd like to remind everyone that at today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and thus, involve some risks. Refer to the customary disclosures.
As Marty indicated, we had a strong finish to 2016. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the quarter and for the fiscal year and then provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2017 outlook.
Total service revenue grew 9% for the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $12 million and 9% for the fiscal year to $46 million. Increases were primarily the result of higher average interest rates earned. Average investment balances were up 1% for the fiscal year, showing a positive impact from client growth, which is offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates.
Total expenses increased by 8% in the fourth quarter and by 7% for the fiscal year. These increases were mainly in compensation-related costs, resulting from higher wages and higher performance-based comp. Strong growth in our PEO also contributed to the increases.
Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of the growth in total expenses for the fourth quarter, but less than 1% for the fiscal year. Operating margin was 36% for the fourth quarter and 38% for fiscal 2016. Operating income net of certain items increased 10% to $264 million for the fourth quarter and 9% to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2016.
Our effective tax rate was 34.3% for the year compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2015. This is due to software production tax benefits as we've discussed in prior calls. In our first quarter, we recognized a discrete item in the form of a tax benefit derived on income from prior years related to customer-facing software we produced. This discrete item was the largest -- had the largest impact on the effective tax rate. While we have ongoing benefits, the impact is not as significant.
Net income growth increased 11% to $178 million for the fourth quarter and 12% to $757 million for the fiscal year. Diluted EPS increased 11% to $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter and increased 13% to $2.09 per share for fiscal 2016. Net income and diluted earnings per share would have increased 9%, respectively, without the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter.
Payroll service revenue increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounts.
Fiscal 2016 also benefited from 2 additional processing days during the year, 1 day in the first quarter and 1 day in this quarter, the fourth quarter. The extra days added approximately 1/2 percent to total payroll revenue as did the acquisition of Advance.
HRS revenue increased 14% to $311 million for the fourth quarter and 13% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. Paychex HR services continued to experience solid growth in clients and client worksite employees served. The PEO, in particular, contributed double-digit growth in client worksite employees served. Insurance services revenue growth benefited from continued growth of our ACA product and an increase in health and benefit applicants. The workers' compensation portion continued to grow with higher average premiums and growth in clients. Advance Partners contributed approximately a little bit less than 2% to growth in HRS revenue for the fourth quarter and approximately 1% to fiscal year growth.
Investments and income. Our primary goal, as you know, continues to be to protect principal and to optimize liquidity. Combined portfolio, including both short-term and long-term investments, have had an [ph] average return -- rate of return of 1.1% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We did see moderate benefit from the 25 basis point increase by the Federal Reserve on the short-term portion of our portfolio. But our long-term portfolio, as of May 31, 2016, has an average yield to maturity of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.1 years, fairly unchanged from last year.
Average investment balances for our client funds were flat for the quarter and up 1% for the fiscal year. Our client growth positively impacted our average balances. This was offset by the impact of lower state unemployment insurance rates this year. The average invested balances for our corporate funds were down 9% for the year, largely due to the cash outflow for the business acquisition as well as share repurchases.
I'll now walk you through the highlights on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $793 million as of May 31, 2016, and no debt. Our cash flows from operations hit a milestone, exceeding $1 billion for the fiscal year, 14% higher than last year. Our net income, noncash adjustments and favorable working capital changes all contributed to the increase.
Funds held for clients as of May 31, 2016, were $4 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.1 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of approximately 1%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $48 million as of May 31, 2016, compared to $14 million as of the end of last year.
Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 billion as of May 31, reflecting $607 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 80% of net income. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 40%.
Now let's turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. I'd like to remind you that the guidance and our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing without significant changes. Payroll service revenue is projected to increase approximately 4% compared to fiscal 2016. The projected growth is based on anticipated client-based growth and increases in revenue per check. This growth is tempered by 1 less processing day in fiscal 2017. So we'll have 1 less processing day this year, and that day will occur in the third quarter. So I'll come back to that in a second. So 1 less day occurs in the third quarter.
HRS revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Net income is expected to increase approximately 8%, excluding the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And that's important to bear in mind when the 2 years are compared.
Our operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be approximately 38%. We anticipate a modest impact on leverage growth as we are making investment in operations to support both mid-market and compliance solution services. So I will get the question and I'll answer it now. So we don't anticipate -- do we anticipate leverage? Yes, we do. We think it will be modest because as I just called out, we're making investments in -- with operations and compliance service solutions to bolster and to support that growth. With respect to the quarters, as previously mentioned, there'll be 1 less processing day in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Now let me get a little bit more granular so you can fine-tune your models. Payroll revenue for the first and second quarters is expected to be at or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue. The third quarter, we expect to be below. We -- I just mentioned we have 1 less day. It'll be below the full year range. And then the fourth quarter, at this stage, we anticipate, will be between 3% and 4%.
So just to reiterate, first and second quarters, we expect to be at or above full year guidance for payroll revenue; third quarter, below; and fourth quarter, below 3% and 4% at this point.
HRS is expected to be within the full year guidance range with the exception of the third quarter, which will fall below the full year range. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36%. Interest on funds is anticipated to be in the mid-single-digit range. We have not included any potential Fed fund rate increases in our guidance.
I'd like to call out that when I reviewed consensus models, many of the numbers were close to what I'm reporting, but there was one important difference. Interest on funds held for clients was higher in the consensus models, and it looked like to the tune of about $0.01 to $0.02. We are not including any assumptions with respect to Fed rate rise increases. And as you well can appreciate, those look a lot more uncertain than they did even 3 or 4 weeks ago.
And then finally, with respect to EPS, we expect EPS in each of the quarters to be comparable, meaning pretty similar, with the following exception. The first quarter, we expect, will be modestly higher and the third quarter, modestly lower, the third quarter, in particular, because of the 1 less day on payroll processing. So that's the fine-tuning on the guidance.
And then just want to make one final comment. It was about 5 years ago that Marty started to assemble the team that has led Paychex over the 5-year period and he set an ambitious goal. The goal was to hit $3 billion in revenue. That was an ambitious goal because when we finished 2011, we were growing 4%. This quarter, we're really on the cusp of that goal. It's an important milestone internally for us. Marty cited the returns for the past 5 years. We compared very favorably versus the S&P 500 and even against the S&P Technology Index. Those results are a testament to both employees', the executive team and to Marty's leadership.
We're not the kind of people who brag or smack talk, but we're quietly very, very pleased that we've -- we're on the cusp of that milestone. But we're also grounded enough to understand that we have to earn the trust of our clients, employees and our shareholders every day if we want to succeed. Every question you've asked in the last 5 years has caused us to think, to question and it's challenged us, and we've appreciated that. And yes, finally, we're not satisfied. We're hungry for more.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Marty."

I mean, I'm thinking about areas like PEO, which are obviously growing very well for you but presumably carries lower-margin percentage. So when we think about the ability for the business over multiple years to drive meaningful operating margin expansion, is that an inhibitor? Is it big enough?"

Now what you're seeing there is the fact that -- 2 things that are implicit there. Number one, we had a really good year in mid-market sales. In some areas, our win rates were really, really strong. And as we look into the year, we did 2 things this year. In 2016, we added to the mid-market sales force, which we don't typically do mid-year, but we did. And as we added to the mid-year sales force, we were also transforming the service model. So we've made a lot of changes on the service model to improve service to mid-market clients. And just in anticipation of that growth, we decided that it was important to have a year where we put more money into bolstering our service there. So that's what happened. I think it's really kind of more of a 1- to 2-year thing than a long-term issue in terms of affecting leverage. And finally, to your point, PEO's just not big enough to really move the needle yet. It could if it really grew significantly but beyond where it is now, but not affecting it now."

Probably the most complicated is just helping clients through the process, what was needed and especially those clients that came in kind of later in taking the product, but an outstanding job by the employee teams that have been working on it. And we feel pretty good about the filing that we're doing and a lot of work, by the way, with the IRS to our compliance teams working with the IRS for this first year of real true filing. I think you'll see some of that sales. Obviously, there was a lot of upfront sales, and I think you'll see some of that slow down some. However, when you think about how many new clients come into us every year, we think we'll have a great attachment rate of that product. It really is necessary. And one of the costs, as Efrain said, with the investment in the mid-market, one of those costs is continuing to invest in the ACA support. Because as we've learned, as we've gone through, this requires even more support of the clients and the filing requirements and a little more technology to kind of help the clients through the process. So feel good about it. It's been a tough number of months to get through this, but we're excited on the filing date and on the additional investments we're going to make."

You've had a real ramp in bookings the last 2 years. Float's no longer a big drag. You've got 7 months for the acquisition in the upcoming year versus 5 in the year you just finished. I really struggle to understand why revenue wouldn't accelerate at least modestly, and the guidance implies none. So is there something else going on like less pricing? It just feels like something doesn't add up here with a simple math. And I did hear you clearly that the checks per client is not as big a driver as it's been in the past.

So checks per client, when they go flat to modestly negative because of client mix, you end up having an impact on payroll service growth, number one. Number two, it's not 7 months. It's actually about 6 months' worth of revenue that we'll get it from Advance. So although that's a pretty minor number, it's not quite as much as you're suggesting. And I think there's more -- I think what we've recognized as we've gone through the year is that the higher the client growth, and we've set pretty ambitious goals again next year, I think between 2% and 3%, initially, that comes at some impact in terms of what you're expecting on overall pricing. So we recoup that over time. But as you grow, and this has been the history of the company prior to the recession, you pay a little bit of a price on checks and also on overall rate by -- based on what's happening with client growth. So it's all of that. And then the third thing that I would say, which you're not factoring in, is we had a nice bump -- uplift from the ACA compliance product. And while I mentioned it earlier in the -- in response to Jason's question that we absorbed it in the guidance, of course, we're not having that uplift in growth this year that we had last year. So if you stripped all of that out, you'd see underlying acceleration. We're obviously not going to detail all of that out to get to the guidance.

The vast majority of our clients have -- are on the Flex platform.

So you have ACA, but you have the recently done -- overtime regulations. You have paid leave now for families you got to keep track of. You have a lot more immigration and keeping track of who your employees are and all that, that you have to be backed up with. And the enforcement of the rules, we see are stronger. So more businesses are being impacted by audits, by investigations, by are you following the rules correctly. And because states and the Feds are also looking for more revenue sources, so states can go after things. So I think that whole regulation side has become increasingly more complex at a lower level. So we're seeing people -- we're seeing clients buy time and attendance that normally were probably 40 employees and higher, 30. PEO tended to be higher, now it's coming down lower. They're looking for help with insurance and benefit plans because they have to be more competitive. The other second thing would be the market is more competitive now for employees as you get closer to lower unemployment and full employment. And so people need more help with having more competitive benefits, more competitive recruiting tools, being able to recruit online, paperless, attract new employees. And I think -- there was another one there I was thinking about. Oh, and I think the acceptance of cloud-based technology and having -- and getting away from desktop and on-premise solutions has rapidly increased the last 3 to 4 years. But we're still seeing that increase, where years ago you -- people want to do more things themselves, worry about their security. Now they want to trust their security of information with a third-party outsourcer. Kind of totally reversed from 5 or 6 years ago. Now they trust -- they have Paychex, is large enough and a big enough IT security team that they're going to do their best to protect our information where I used to have to do it inside. So I think there's just a big push of regulations, compliance and the need, therefore, pushing down to a lower level. And so we're seeing -- that mid-market that I would say used to be 50 to 500 or 1,000 has really pushed down to maybe 15 or 20 to  500 is a real sweet spot right now that has a lot of focus."

But I think there's -- that the real sweet spot of what has taken off and made many companies, at least appear to do well, and I know how we're doing well, is really even that 15 or 20 to 500. I mean, we were still selling anywhere from 1 employee to 1,000. But I would say the hottest area right now is 20 to 250 or 20 to 500. Those are the clients that really have been pushed with much more regulation and need for the products and are now much more open to outsourcing. So I think we feel good about the opportunity that's ahead of us that that's going to drive our growth. And it also allows us to really focus on those market. That's a pretty huge market, 1 to 1,000. And we feel pretty good that, hey, we're very focused on that and that's where we provide the best service and the best products to."

And so now we kind of feel like the technology spend got to a point where it's pretty normalized. It's in a good place. We don't see that going up dramatically. I don't necessarily see it going down because there's always technology and we want to stay on the leading edge from a competitive standpoint. But -- and then there's not as much operational leverage. But we continue to, as Efrain said, we're going to -- we continue to try to look. It's kind of in our DNA here that we always are looking, hey, if revenue growth is x, we're always trying to look for 50 basis points or so to see if we can continue to leverage the business. And obviously, the better that growth rate is, the better opportunity we have to leverage. And that's a constant focus. Anything you want to add to that?"

To us, it was broadening really the markets that we serve. So here's a company that is profitable, is -- had nice revenue growth, good leadership team, saw a lot of potential and the staffing business that they support those staffing companies, we saw as a growing market. And because there's continued more temporary help in staffing, help that's going to be needed, I think particularly with the overtime rules and so forth, so we saw them as a component of the portfolio to grow revenue. There'll be some overlap between us in the fact that we have a number of staffing companies that are payroll clients or other products, and so we'll look to refer. We're already doing that, looking to see if those staffing companies who are clients of us for payroll could be helped by payroll funding and other support from Advance. But I think that's how we look at it as another opportunity to broaden our revenue growth because we see staffing companies as a real growth opportunity.

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations web page, and we will file our Form 10-K by the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.
On today's call, I will review highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 related to sales, operations and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions.
We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2016. Our momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Efrain will talk in more detail about the financial results, but I want to touch on a couple of key points. First, total revenue was up 9% in the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year, reaching nearly $3 billion, a new record for Paychex. Payroll service revenue continued to experience steady growth of 4% for fiscal '16, driven by growth in client base and revenue per check, and our payroll client base finished this year at approximately 605,000 clients, the highest client growth in recent years.
Solid sales execution during fiscal '16, along with high client retention in excess of 82%, positively impacted our client base. Client retention was consistent with last year's record-high retention.
HRS revenue benefited from strong demand for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services as we once again realized double-digit growth in client worksite employees that we serve. In particular, our PEO has been an area of strong growth. In addition, our full service Affordable Care Act product contributed to the HRS revenue increase.
During fiscal 2016, we made significant enhancements to our Paychex Flex platform, which is our proprietary cloud-based human capital management or HCM solution. Paychex Flex is a robust technology and service model that supports our clients' delivery phase of their employees' journey from recruiting to retirement. This model allows business owners and HR professionals to tailor a solution encompassing tools, capabilities and services that meet the unique needs of their organization and employees.
Earlier this year, we completed the integration of the remaining key HCM modules with Paychex Hiring, Paychex Time and Paychex Benefits. We believe we also have the best-in-market mobility offerings for both administrative users and employee self-service that allows access to our HCM suite with a single mobile application.
Paychex Flex continues to receive positive reviews evidenced by multiple awards and acknowledgments received throughout this year. Earlier in the year, we earned recognition from the Brandon Hall Group Excellence awards for advancements in workforce management technology for small and midsize businesses. PC Magazine's review referred to Paychex Flex as excellent, calling it more robust and scalable than some of our competitors' platforms.
And most recently in the quarter, we received the 2016 TekTonic Award for HR -- from HRO Today for the best-in-class mobile and cloud-based technology suite for comprehensive integrated HCM services. We are very pleased by this recognition, and it supports our belief that Paychex Flex technology, combined with a unique mix of personalized, flexible service options, sets us apart and provides great value to our clients. We remain committed to our investments in product development and technology to keep us a market leader.
Sales execution during '16 was strong with another year of double-digit growth, especially within the mid-market space. We believe the value that our Flex platform provides is a key driver to this success.
During fiscal '16, we announced the acquisition of Advance Partners, who joined the Paychex team during the third quarter. Advance Partners offers customized -- customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. Advance Partners and its leadership team has already proven to be a great addition with their positive results and opportunity for growth in the expanding staffing market.
Throughout the year, we have continued our shareholder-friendly actions. We maintained a strong dividend yield. And in July of '15, we increased our regular quarterly dividend by 11%. The dividend increase supports our history of providing exceptional shareholder value while continuing to make strategic investments for the long-term sustained growth of Paychex.
We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired an additional 2.2 million shares of common stock for $108 million in fiscal 2016. As of May 31, 2016, our stock price was over $54 per share, and that is a total return of over 102% or 15% on an annualized basis over the past 5-year period.
The regulatory landscape for HCM continues to get more complicated, making managing HR increasingly difficult. We strive to be a valuable resource to our clients to educate them on changes and assist them with compliance. Recently, new overtime rules were approved by the Department of Labor that will expand overtime protection to millions of workers. We are well positioned to help our clients comply with these new regulations. Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, can assist companies with the scheduling, tracking and reporting of time, which will be critical to managing this new regulation.
In summary, I'm extremely proud of the leadership team and all of our employees at Paychex who have continued to deliver great service and product solutions, resulting in continued high client satisfaction and continued high levels of client retention. We also continue to focus on providing leading-edge, user-friendly technology and unique personalized service to our clients while delivering solid, consistent, top line growth, strong operating margins and excellent returns to our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

I'd like to remind everyone that at today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and thus, involve some risks. Refer to the customary disclosures.
As Marty indicated, we had a strong finish to 2016. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the quarter and for the fiscal year and then provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2017 outlook.
Total service revenue grew 9% for the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $12 million and 9% for the fiscal year to $46 million. Increases were primarily the result of higher average interest rates earned. Average investment balances were up 1% for the fiscal year, showing a positive impact from client growth, which is offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates.
Total expenses increased by 8% in the fourth quarter and by 7% for the fiscal year. These increases were mainly in compensation-related costs, resulting from higher wages and higher performance-based comp. Strong growth in our PEO also contributed to the increases.
Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of the growth in total expenses for the fourth quarter, but less than 1% for the fiscal year. Operating margin was 36% for the fourth quarter and 38% for fiscal 2016. Operating income net of certain items increased 10% to $264 million for the fourth quarter and 9% to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2016.
Our effective tax rate was 34.3% for the year compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2015. This is due to software production tax benefits as we've discussed in prior calls. In our first quarter, we recognized a discrete item in the form of a tax benefit derived on income from prior years related to customer-facing software we produced. This discrete item was the largest -- had the largest impact on the effective tax rate. While we have ongoing benefits, the impact is not as significant.
Net income growth increased 11% to $178 million for the fourth quarter and 12% to $757 million for the fiscal year. Diluted EPS increased 11% to $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter and increased 13% to $2.09 per share for fiscal 2016. Net income and diluted earnings per share would have increased 9%, respectively, without the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter.
Payroll service revenue increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounts.
Fiscal 2016 also benefited from 2 additional processing days during the year, 1 day in the first quarter and 1 day in this quarter, the fourth quarter. The extra days added approximately 1/2 percent to total payroll revenue as did the acquisition of Advance.
HRS revenue increased 14% to $311 million for the fourth quarter and 13% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. Paychex HR services continued to experience solid growth in clients and client worksite employees served. The PEO, in particular, contributed double-digit growth in client worksite employees served. Insurance services revenue growth benefited from continued growth of our ACA product and an increase in health and benefit applicants. The workers' compensation portion continued to grow with higher average premiums and growth in clients. Advance Partners contributed approximately a little bit less than 2% to growth in HRS revenue for the fourth quarter and approximately 1% to fiscal year growth.
Investments and income. Our primary goal, as you know, continues to be to protect principal and to optimize liquidity. Combined portfolios, including both short-term and long-term investments, have ended average return -- rate of return of 1.1% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We did see moderate benefit from the 25 basis point increase by the Federal Reserve on a short-term portion of our portfolio. But our long-term portfolio, as of May 31, 2016, has an average yield to maturity of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.1 years, fairly unchanged from last year.
Average investment balances for our client funds were flat for the quarter and up 1% for the fiscal year. Our client growth positively impacted our average balances. This was offset by the impact of lower state unemployment insurance rates this year. The average invested balances for our corporate funds were down 9% for the year, largely due to the cash outflow for the business acquisition as well as share repurchases.
I'll now walk you through the highlights on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $793 million as of May 31, 2016, and no debt. Our cash flows from operations hit a milestone, exceeding $1 billion for the fiscal year, 14% higher than last year. Our net income, noncash adjustments and favorable working capital changes all contributed to the increase.
Funds held for clients as of May 31, 2016, were $4 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.1 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of approximately 1%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $48 million as of May 31, 2016, compared to $14 million as of the end of last year.
Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 billion as of May 31, reflecting $607 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 80% of net income. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 40%.
Now let's turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. I'd like to remind you that the guidance and our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing without significant changes. Payroll service revenue is projected to increase approximately 4% compared to fiscal 2016. The projected growth is based on anticipated client-based growth and increases in revenue per check. This growth is tempered by 1 less processing day in fiscal 2017. So we'll have 1 less processing day this year, and that day will occur in the third quarter. So I'll come back to that in a second. So 1 less day occurs in the third quarter.
HRS revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Net income is expected to increase approximately 8%, excluding the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And that's important to bear in mind when the 2 years are compared.
Our operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be approximately 38%. We anticipate a modest impact on leverage growth as we are making investment in operations to support both mid-market and compliance solution services. So I will get the question and I'll answer it now. So we don't anticipate -- do we anticipate leverage? Yes, we do. We think it will be modest because as I just called out, we're making investments in -- with operations and compliance service solutions to bolster and to support that growth. With respect to the quarters, as previously mentioned, there'll be 1 less processing day in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Now let me get a little bit more granular so you can fine-tune your models. Payroll revenue for the first and second quarters is expected to be at or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue. The third quarter, we expect to be below. We -- I just mentioned we have 1 less day. It'll be below the full year range. And then the fourth quarter, at this stage, we anticipate will be between 3% and 4%.
So just to reiterate, first and second quarters, we expect to be at or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue; third quarter, below; and fourth quarter, between 3% and 4% at this point.
HRS is expected to be within the full year guidance range with the exception of the third quarter, which will fall below the full year range. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36%. Interest on funds is anticipated to be in the mid-single-digit range. We have not included any potential Fed Fund rate increases in our guidance.
I'd like to call out that when I reviewed consensus models, many of the numbers were close to what I'm reporting, but there was one important difference. Interest on funds held for clients was higher in the consensus models, and it looked like to the tune of about $0.01 to $0.02. We are not including any assumptions with respect to Fed rate rise increases. And as you well can appreciate, those look a lot more uncertain than they did even 3 or 4 weeks ago.
And then finally, with respect to EPS, we expect EPS in each of the quarters to be comparable, meaning pretty similar, with the following exception. The first quarter, we expect will be modestly higher and the third quarter, modestly lower. The third quarter, in particular, because of the 1 less day on payroll processing. So that's the fine-tuning on the guidance.
And then just want to make one final comment. It was about 5 years ago that Marty started to assemble the team that has led Paychex over the 5-year period and he set an ambitious goal. The goal was to hit $3 billion in revenue. That was an ambitious goal because when we finished 2011, we were growing 4%. This quarter, we're really on the cusp of that goal. It's an important milestone internally for us. Marty cited the returns for the past 5 years. We compared very favorably versus the S&P 500 and even against the S&P Technology Index. Those results are a testament to both employees', the executive team and to Marty's leadership.
We're not the kind of people who brag or smack talk, but we're quietly very, very pleased that we've -- we're on the cusp of that milestone. But we're also grounded enough to understand that we have to earn the trust of our clients, employees and our shareholders every day if we want to succeed. Every question you've asked in the last 5 years has caused us to think, to question and it's challenged us, and we've appreciated that. And yes, finally, we're not satisfied. We're hungry for more.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Marty."

Now what you're seeing there is the fact that -- 2 things that are implicit there. Number one, we had a really good year in mid-market sales. In some areas, our win rates were really, really strong. And as we looked into the year, we did 2 things this year. In 2016, we added to the mid-market sales force, which we don't typically do mid-year, but we did. And as we added to the mid-year sales force, we were also transforming the service model. So we've made a lot of changes on the service model to improve service to mid-market clients. And just in anticipation of that growth, we decided that it was important to have a year where we put more money into bolstering our service there. So that's what happened. I think it's really kind of more of a 1- to 2-year thing than a long-term issue in terms of affecting leverage. And finally, to your point, PEO's just not big enough to really move the needle yet. It could if it really grew significantly but -- beyond where it is now, but not affecting it now."

I think you'll see some of that sales. Obviously, there was a lot of upfront sales, and I think you'll see some of that slow down some. However, when you think about how many new clients come into us every year, we think we'll have a great attachment rate of that product. It really is necessary. And one of the costs, as Efrain said, with the investment in the mid-market, one of those costs is continuing to invest in the ACA support. Because as we've learned, as we've gone through, this requires even more support of the clients and the filing requirements and a little more technology to kind of help the clients through the process.

I really struggle to understand why revenue wouldn't accelerate at least modestly, and the guidance implies none. So is there something else going on like less pricing? It just feels like something doesn't add up here with the simple math. And I did hear you clearly that the checks per client is not as big a driver as it's been in the past.

So checks per client, when they go flat to modestly negative because of client mix, you end up having an impact on payroll service growth, number one. Number two, it's not 7 months. It's actually about 6 months' worth of revenue that we'll get from Advance. So although that's a pretty minor number, it's not quite as much as you're suggesting. And I think there's more -- I think what we've recognized as we've gone through the year is that the higher the client growth, and we've set pretty ambitious goals again next year, to be between 2% and 3%. Initially, that comes at some impact in terms of what you're expecting on overall pricing. So we recoup that over time. But as you grow, and this has been the history of the company prior to the recession, you pay a little bit of a price on checks and also on overall rate by -- based on what's happening with client growth. So it's all of that. And then the third thing that I would say, which you're not factoring in, is we had a nice bump -- uplift from the ACA compliance product. And while I mentioned it earlier in the -- in response to Jason's question, that we absorbed it in the guidance, of course, we're not having that uplift in growth this year that we had last year. So if you stripped all of that out, you'd see underlying acceleration. We're obviously not going to detail all of that out to get to the guidance.

So you have ACA, but you have the recently done -- overtime regulations. You have paid leave now for families you got to keep track of. You have a lot more immigration and keeping track of who your employees are and all that, that you have to be backed up with. And the enforcement of the rules, we see, are stronger. So more businesses are being impacted by audits, by investigations, by are you following the rules correctly. And because states and the Feds are also looking for more revenue sources, so states can go after things. So I think that whole regulation side has become increasingly more complex at a lower level. So we're seeing people -- we're seeing clients buy time and attendance that normally were probably 40 employees and higher, 30. PEO tended to be higher, now it's coming down lower. They're looking for help with insurance and benefit plans because they have to be more competitive. The other second thing would be the market is more competitive now for employees as you get closer to lower unemployment and full employment. And so people need more help with having more competitive benefits, more competitive recruiting tools, being able to recruit online, paperless, attract new employees. And I think -- there was another one there I was thinking about. Oh, and I think the acceptance of cloud-based technology and having -- and getting away from desktop and on-premise solutions has rapidly increased the last 3 to 4 years.

Now they trust -- they have Paychex, is large enough and a big enough IT security team that they're going to do their best to protect our information where I used to have to do it inside. So I think there's just a big push of regulations, compliance and the need, therefore, pushing down to a lower level. And so we're seeing -- that mid-market that I would say used to be 50 to 500 or 1,000 has really pushed down to maybe 15 or 20 to  500 is a real sweet spot right now that has a lot of focus."

Because last -- any time a recessionary-type thing happens, it has impact on the payroll service revenue growth because the clients either -- more go loss because they can't sustain the business and fewer start up. So the client growth puts obviously a damper on that. I don't think we've definitely laid it out what exactly that would be. It doesn't always have an impact on the number of products they buy because they typically buy those that bundle, but let's say, because they need it, for those that are staying in business. The biggest impact will be losses, client retention and new business startups would be the biggest impact, I'd say."

And so now we kind of feel like the technology spend got to a point where it's pretty normalized. It's in a good place. We don't see that going up dramatically. I don't necessarily see it going down because there's always technology and we want to stay on the leading edge from a competitive standpoint. But -- and then there's not as much operational leverage. But we continue to, as Efrain said, we're going to -- we continue to try to look. It's kind of in our DNA here that we always are looking, hey, if revenue growth is x, we're always trying to look for 50 basis points or so to see if we can continue to leverage the business. And obviously, the better that growth rate is, the better opportunity we have to leverage. And that's a constant focus. Anything you want to add to that?"

To us, it was broadening really the markets that we serve. So here's a company that is profitable, is -- had nice revenue growth, good leadership team, saw a lot of potential. And the staffing business, that they support those staffing companies, we saw as a growing market. And because there's continued more temporary help in staffing, help that's going to be needed, I think particularly with overtime rules and so forth, so we saw them as a component of the portfolio to grow revenue. There'll be some overlap between us in the fact that we have a number of staffing companies that are payroll clients or other products, and so we'll look to refer. We're already doing that, looking to see if those staffing companies who are clients of us for payroll could be helped by payroll funding and other support from Advance. But I think that's how we look at it as another opportunity to broaden our revenue growth because we see staffing companies as a real growth opportunity.

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations web page, and we will file our Form 10-K by the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.
On today's call, I will review highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 related to sales, operations and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions.
We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2016. Our momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Efrain will talk in more detail about the financial results, but I want to touch on a couple of key points. First, total revenue was up 9% in the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year, reaching nearly $3 billion, a new record for Paychex. Payroll service revenue continued to experience steady growth of 4% for fiscal '16, driven by growth in client base and revenue per check, and our payroll client base finished this year at approximately 605,000 clients, the highest client growth in recent years.
Solid sales execution during fiscal '16, along with high client retention in excess of 82%, positively impacted our client base. Client retention was consistent with last year's record-high retention.
HRS revenue benefited from strong demand for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services as we once again realized double-digit growth in client worksite employees that we serve. In particular, our PEO has been an area of strong growth. In addition, our full service Affordable Care Act product contributed to the HRS revenue increase.
During fiscal 2016, we made significant enhancements to our Paychex Flex platform, which is our proprietary cloud-based human capital management or HCM solution. Paychex Flex is a robust technology and service model that supports our clients' delivery phase of their employees' journey from recruiting to retirement. This model allows business owners and HR professionals to tailor a solution encompassing tools, capabilities and services that meet the unique needs of their organization and employees.
Earlier this year, we completed the integration of the remaining key HCM modules with Paychex Hiring, Paychex Time and Paychex Benefits. We believe we also have the best-in-market mobility offerings for both administrative users and employee self-service that allows access to our HCM suite with a single mobile application.
Paychex Flex continues to receive positive reviews evidenced by multiple awards and acknowledgments received throughout this year. Earlier in the year, we earned recognition from the Brandon Hall Group Excellence awards for advancements in workforce management technology for small and midsize businesses. PC Magazine's review referred to Paychex Flex as excellent, calling it more robust and scalable than some of our competitors' platforms.
And most recently in the quarter, we received the 2016 TekTonic Award for HR -- from HRO Today for the best-in-class mobile and cloud-based technology suite for comprehensive integrated HCM services. We are very pleased by this recognition, and it supports our belief that Paychex Flex technology, combined with a unique mix of personalized, flexible service options, sets us apart and provides great value to our clients. We remain committed to our investments in product development and technology to keep us a market leader.
Sales execution during '16 was strong with another year of double-digit growth, especially within the mid-market space. We believe the value that our Flex platform provides is a key driver to this success.
During fiscal '16, we announced the acquisition of Advance Partners, who joined the Paychex team during the third quarter. Advance Partners offers customized -- customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. Advance Partners and its leadership team has already proven to be a great addition with their positive results and opportunity for growth in the expanding staffing market.
Throughout the year, we have continued our shareholder-friendly actions. We maintained a strong dividend yield. And in July of '15, we increased our regular quarterly dividend by 11%. The dividend increase supports our history of providing exceptional shareholder value while continuing to make strategic investments for the long-term sustained growth of Paychex.
We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired an additional 2.2 million shares of common stock for $108 million in fiscal 2016. As of May 31, 2016, our stock price was over $54 per share, and that is a total return of over 102% or 15% on an annualized basis over the past 5-year period.
The regulatory landscape for HCM continues to get more complicated, making managing HR increasingly difficult. We strive to be a valuable resource to our clients to educate them on changes and assist them with compliance. Recently, new overtime rules were approved by the Department of Labor that will expand overtime protection to millions of workers. We are well positioned to help our clients comply with these new regulations. Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, can assist companies with the scheduling, tracking and reporting of time, which will be critical to managing this new regulation.
In summary, I'm extremely proud of the leadership team and all of our employees at Paychex who have continued to deliver great service and product solutions, resulting in continued high client satisfaction and continued high levels of client retention. We also continue to focus on providing leading-edge, user-friendly technology and unique personalized service to our clients while delivering solid, consistent, top line growth, strong operating margins and excellent returns to our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

I'd like to remind everyone that at today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and thus, involve some risks. Refer to the customary disclosures.
As Marty indicated, we had a strong finish to 2016. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the quarter and for the fiscal year and then provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2017 outlook.
Total service revenue grew 9% for the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $12 million and 9% for the fiscal year to $46 million. Increases were primarily the result of higher average interest rates earned. Average investment balances were up 1% for the fiscal year, showing a positive impact from client growth, which is offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates.
Total expenses increased by 8% in the fourth quarter and by 7% for the fiscal year. These increases were mainly in compensation-related costs, resulting from higher wages and higher performance-based comp. Strong growth in our PEO also contributed to the increases.
Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of the growth in total expenses for the fourth quarter, but less than 1% for the fiscal year. Operating margin was 36% for the fourth quarter and 38% for fiscal 2016. Operating income net of certain items increased 10% to $264 million for the fourth quarter and 9% to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2016.
Our effective tax rate was 34.3% for the year compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2015. This is due to software production tax benefits as we've discussed in prior calls. In our first quarter, we recognized a discrete item in the form of a tax benefit derived on income from prior years related to customer-facing software we produced. This discrete item was the largest -- had the largest impact on the effective tax rate. While we have ongoing benefits, the impact is not as significant.
Net income growth increased 11% to $178 million for the fourth quarter and 12% to $757 million for the fiscal year. Diluted EPS increased 11% to $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter and increased 13% to $2.09 per share for fiscal 2016. Net income and diluted earnings per share would have increased 9%, respectively, without the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter.
Payroll service revenue increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounts.
Fiscal 2016 also benefited from 2 additional processing days during the year, 1 day in the first quarter and 1 day in this quarter, the fourth quarter. The extra days added approximately 1/2 percent to total payroll revenue as did the acquisition of Advance.
HRS revenue increased 14% to $311 million for the fourth quarter and 13% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. Paychex HR services continued to experience solid growth in clients and client worksite employees served. The PEO, in particular, contributed double-digit growth in client worksite employees served. Insurance services revenue growth benefited from continued growth of our ACA product and an increase in health and benefit applicants. The workers' compensation portion continued to grow with higher average premiums and growth in clients. Advance Partners contributed approximately a little bit less than 2% to growth in HRS revenue for the fourth quarter and approximately 1% to fiscal year growth.
Investments and income. Our primary goal, as you know, continues to be to protect principal and to optimize liquidity. Combined portfolios, including both short-term and long-term investments, have ended average return -- rate of return of 1.1% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We did see moderate benefit from the 25 basis point increase by the Federal Reserve on a short-term portion of our portfolio. But our long-term portfolio, as of May 31, 2016, has an average yield to maturity of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.1 years, fairly unchanged from last year.
Average investment balances for our client funds were flat for the quarter and up 1% for the fiscal year. Our client growth positively impacted our average balances. This was offset by the impact of lower state unemployment insurance rates this year. The average invested balances for our corporate funds were down 9% for the year, largely due to the cash outflow for the business acquisition as well as share repurchases.
I'll now walk you through the highlights on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $793 million as of May 31, 2016, and no debt. Our cash flows from operations hit a milestone, exceeding $1 billion for the fiscal year, 14% higher than last year. Our net income, noncash adjustments and favorable working capital changes all contributed to the increase.
Funds held for clients as of May 31, 2016, were $4 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.1 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of approximately 1%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $48 million as of May 31, 2016, compared to $14 million as of the end of last year.
Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 billion as of May 31, reflecting $607 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 80% of net income. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 40%.
Now let's turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. I'd like to remind you that the guidance and our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing without significant changes. Payroll service revenue is projected to increase approximately 4% compared to fiscal 2016. The projected growth is based on anticipated client-based growth and increases in revenue per check. This growth is tempered by 1 less processing day in fiscal 2017. So we'll have 1 less processing day this year, and that day will occur in the third quarter. So I'll come back to that in a second. So 1 less day occurs in the third quarter.
HRS revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Net income is expected to increase approximately 8%, excluding the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And that's important to bear in mind when the 2 years are compared.
Our operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be approximately 38%. We anticipate a modest impact on leverage growth as we are making investment in operations to support both mid-market and compliance solution services. So I will get the question and I'll answer it now. So we don't anticipate -- do we anticipate leverage? Yes, we do. We think it will be modest because as I just called out, we're making investments in -- with operations and compliance service solutions to bolster and to support that growth. With respect to the quarters, as previously mentioned, there'll be 1 less processing day in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Now let me get a little bit more granular so you can fine-tune your models. Payroll revenue for the first and second quarters is expected to be at or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue. The third quarter, we expect to be below. We -- I just mentioned we have 1 less day. It'll be below the full year range. And then the fourth quarter, at this stage, we anticipate will be between 3% and 4%.
So just to reiterate, first and second quarters, we expect to be at or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue; third quarter, below; and fourth quarter, between 3% and 4% at this point.
HRS is expected to be within the full year guidance range with the exception of the third quarter, which will fall below the full year range. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36%. Interest on funds is anticipated to be in the mid-single-digit range. We have not included any potential Fed Fund rate increases in our guidance.
I'd like to call out that when I reviewed consensus models, many of the numbers were close to what I'm reporting, but there was one important difference. Interest on funds held for clients was higher in the consensus models, and it looked like to the tune of about $0.01 to $0.02. We are not including any assumptions with respect to Fed rate rise increases. And as you well can appreciate, those look a lot more uncertain than they did even 3 or 4 weeks ago.
And then finally, with respect to EPS, we expect EPS in each of the quarters to be comparable, meaning pretty similar, with the following exception. The first quarter, we expect will be modestly higher and the third quarter, modestly lower. The third quarter, in particular, because of the 1 less day on payroll processing. So that's the fine-tuning on the guidance.
And then just want to make one final comment. It was about 5 years ago that Marty started to assemble the team that has led Paychex over the 5-year period and he set an ambitious goal. The goal was to hit $3 billion in revenue. That was an ambitious goal because when we finished 2011, we were growing 4%. This quarter, we're really on the cusp of that goal. It's an important milestone internally for us. Marty cited the returns for the past 5 years. We compared very favorably versus the S&P 500 and even against the S&P Technology Index. Those results are a testament to both employees', the executive team and to Marty's leadership.
We're not the kind of people who brag or smack talk, but we're quietly very, very pleased that we've -- we're on the cusp of that milestone. But we're also grounded enough to understand that we have to earn the trust of our clients, employees and our shareholders every day if we want to succeed. Every question you've asked in the last 5 years has caused us to think, to question and it's challenged us, and we've appreciated that. And yes, finally, we're not satisfied. We're hungry for more.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Marty."

Now what you're seeing there is the fact that -- 2 things that are implicit there. Number one, we had a really good year in mid-market sales. In some areas, our win rates were really, really strong. And as we looked into the year, we did 2 things this year. In 2016, we added to the mid-market sales force, which we don't typically do mid-year, but we did. And as we added to the mid-year sales force, we were also transforming the service model. So we've made a lot of changes on the service model to improve service to mid-market clients. And just in anticipation of that growth, we decided that it was important to have a year where we put more money into bolstering our service there. So that's what happened. I think it's really kind of more of a 1- to 2-year thing than a long-term issue in terms of affecting leverage. And finally, to your point, PEO's just not big enough to really move the needle yet.

However, when you think about how many new clients come into us every year, we think we'll have a great attachment rate of that product. It really is necessary. And one of the costs, as Efrain said, with the investment in the mid-market, one of those costs is continuing to invest in the ACA support. Because as we've learned, as we've gone through, this requires even more support of the clients and the filing requirements and a little more technology to kind of help the clients through the process.

I really struggle to understand why revenue wouldn't accelerate at least modestly, and the guidance implies none. So is there something else going on like less pricing? It just feels like something doesn't add up here with the simple math. And I did hear you clearly that the checks per client is not as big a driver as it's been in the past.

So checks per client, when they go flat to modestly negative because of client mix, you end up having an impact on payroll service growth, number one. Number two, it's not 7 months. It's actually about 6 months' worth of revenue that we'll get from Advance. So although that's a pretty minor number, it's not quite as much as you're suggesting. And I think there's more -- I think what we've recognized as we've gone through the year is that the higher the client growth, and we've set pretty ambitious goals again next year, to be between 2% and 3%. Initially, that comes at some impact in terms of what you're expecting on overall pricing. So we recoup that over time. But as you grow, and this has been the history of the company prior to the recession, you pay a little bit of a price on checks and also on overall rate by -- based on what's happening with client growth. So it's all of that. And then the third thing that I would say, which you're not factoring in, is we had a nice bump -- uplift from the ACA compliance product. And while I mentioned it earlier in the -- in response to Jason's question, that we absorbed it in the guidance, of course, we're not having that uplift in growth this year that we had last year. So if you stripped all of that out, you'd see underlying acceleration. We're obviously not going to detail all of that out to get to the guidance.

On the Flex product, I think, Gary, we've got most of everything, the main pieces in there, particularly the paperless onboarding and recruiting and the benefits administration. Now they came in from BeneTrac that we integrated in. So we feel pretty good. I think there's always other components that we're looking at competitively to see if we need to add. But for the most part, kind of the vast majority of everything is in now and integrated on a kind of single employee record, which is working well for the sales and so forth. The vast majority of our clients have -- are on the Flex platform. And so while we continue to work on some of the mid-market, the vast majority of the clients are already on Flex, and there isn't a migration that's needed from that standpoint. So I think we're in good shape with people on Flex. And they're gaining -- any one on Flex is gaining all the mobility addition. So a lot of work now is going to making mobility and the online visibility into a simpler, easier to use, more HTML5 kind of language, also the options for -- we haven't talked about it, but the options for Spanish. We've really put most everything in Spanish now, and we're seeing a nice uptick in sales to Hispanic businesses, which has been a focus for us the last few years from both a sales and service perspective. So I think what you'll see now is not as much product functionality that's missing as it is the look, the feel and the mobility piece of it. And by the way, everything's being developed now here mobile first. So basically, you make it simple so that almost everything can be done on the phone, and then it grows more complex online."

So you have ACA, but you have the recently done -- overtime regulations. You have paid leave now for families you got to keep track of. You have a lot more immigration and keeping track of who your employees are and all that, that you have to be backed up with. And the enforcement of the rules, we see, are stronger. So more businesses are being impacted by audits, by investigations, by are you following the rules correctly. And because states and the Feds are also looking for more revenue sources, so states can go after things. So I think that whole regulation side has become increasingly more complex at a lower level. So we're seeing people -- we're seeing clients buy time and attendance that normally were probably 40 employees and higher, 30. PEO tended to be higher, now it's coming down lower. They're looking for help with insurance and benefit plans because they have to be more competitive. The other second thing would be the market is more competitive now for employees as you get closer to lower unemployment and full employment. And so people need more help with having more competitive benefits, more competitive recruiting tools, being able to recruit online, paperless, attract new employees. And I think -- there was another one there I was thinking about. Oh, and I think the acceptance of cloud-based technology and having -- and getting away from desktop and on-premise solutions has rapidly increased the last 3 to 4 years. But we're still seeing that increase, where years ago you -- people who'd want to do more things themselves, worry about their security. Now they want to trust their security of information with a third-party outsourcer. Kind of totally reversed from 5 or 6 years ago. Now they trust -- they have Paychex, is large enough and a big enough IT security team that they're going to do their best to protect our information where I used to have to do it inside. So I think there's just a big push of regulations, compliance and the need, therefore, pushing down to a lower level. And so we're seeing -- that mid-market that I would say used to be 50 to 500 or 1,000 has really pushed down to maybe 15 or 20 to  500 is a real sweet spot right now that has a lot of focus."

So I think we feel good about the opportunity that's ahead of us that, that's going to drive our growth. And it also allows us to really focus on those market. That's a pretty huge market, 1 to 1,000. And we feel pretty good that, hey, we're very focused on that and that's where we provide the best service and the best products to."

And we've -- I think we've talked about the fact that we went after a larger, what we call a large market or higher-asset clients, and we feel that, that's got a great opportunity as well. A lot of things kick around about 401(k)s and so forth, but we're still doing very well, really introduce and sell more 401(k) recordkeeping plans than anybody else, and we've got a solid sales and service team that really do very well there.

It doesn't always have an impact on the number of products they buy because they typically buy those that bundle, but let's say, because they need it, for those that are staying in business. The biggest impact will be losses, client retention and new business startups would be the biggest impact, I'd say."

And so now we kind of feel like the technology spend got to a point where it's pretty normalized. It's in a good place. We don't see that going up dramatically. I don't necessarily see it going down because there's always technology and we want to stay on the leading edge from a competitive standpoint. But -- and then there's not as much operational leverage. But we continue to, as Efrain said, we're going to -- we continue to try to look. It's kind of in our DNA here that we always are looking, hey, if revenue growth is x, we're always trying to look for 50 basis points or so to see if we can continue to leverage the business. And obviously, the better that growth rate is, the better opportunity we have to leverage. And that's a constant focus. Anything you want to add to that?"

To us, it was broadening really the markets that we serve. So here's a company that is profitable, is -- had nice revenue growth, good leadership team, saw a lot of potential. And the staffing business, that they support those staffing companies, we saw as a growing market. And because there's continued more temporary help in staffing, help that's going to be needed, I think particularly with overtime rules and so forth, so we saw them as a component of the portfolio to grow revenue. There'll be some overlap between us in the fact that we have a number of staffing companies that are payroll clients or other products, and so we'll look to refer. We're already doing that, looking to see if those staffing companies who are clients of us for payroll could be helped by payroll funding and other support from Advance. But I think that's how we look at it as another opportunity to broaden our revenue growth because we see staffing companies as a real growth opportunity.

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for first quarter ended August 31, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage as they become available. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month. 
On today's call, I'll review highlights for the first quarter in relationship -- in relation to sales and ops and product management, development areas. Efrain will review first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance, and then we'll open it up your questions. 
We are off to a solid start for Fiscal 2017 with positive results across all major product lines. The number of client worksite employees served by our human resource outsourcing services grew by double digits over -- on a year-over-year basis. Our cloud-based HCM services, including time and attendance and human resource management, continued to gain strong market acceptance in the quarter as well as last year. 
Payroll service revenue grew 4% for the first quarter. HRS revenue increased 15% for the quarter, driven largely by growth in the client base across all major HCM categories. Total service revenue, up 9%. We acquired Advance Partners last December and are very pleased with their contribution to our results. Advance Partners contributed approximately 1.5% to the growth in the service revenue for the first quarter. 
Client retention has remained strong, providing excellent customer service as our top priority. We've continued to invest in our operations and compliant services to support growth and ensure we maintain best-in-class client service. 
One area of focus has been the expansion of our multiproduct service center, which primarily assist our mid-market clients who attach additional services with payroll. We have also invested in our insurance operations [indiscernible] to increase support for our Affordable Care Act service clients as we approach the 2016 calendar ry filing. 
We usually announced the expansion of the AICPA Paychex partner program to include Human Resource Services in addition to payroll and retirement benefits. This program allows CPAs who refer to us to broaden our advisory role with clients by offering them a suite of best-in-class services and provide a strong referral channel for us. We are proud to be the preferred provider of payroll retirement and now human resource outsourcing services for the AICPA, CPA.com and its CPA members. 
The Department of Labor's Final Overtime Rule has become effective -- will become effective December 1, which will expand overtime for millions of workers. This new legislation makes accurate time and attendance tracking more important than ever, and we have found that many business remain unaware of the legislation and the impact on their business. We recently announced enhancements to our time and service portfolio with the addition of Paychex Flex Time essentials, TrueShift timeclock and an advanced scheduling feature within our Paychex Flex Time module. The investment in this technology demonstrates our continued commitment to providing industry-leading solutions that educate and assist our clients to comply with the new regulations and stay more connected to their employees and their businesses. These new products enhance our commitment to supporting our clients through the entire employee journey, from the posting of a position, interviewing and job offer, onboarding the new employee and handling all the daily tasks and life events with a simple, integrated, SaaS software-as-a-solution platform, combined with personalized and flexible service options. We're very proud of the support our employees provide small and midsized businesses with this broad and advanced product set in commitment to great service, particularly as we enter our 45th [ph] year in business. 
Along with that, I'm very proud of some recent recognition our Paychex team has received. Our insurance agency ranked #23 on Business Insurance magazine's 2016 list of top 100 brokers of U.S. business. This is our sixth appearance on the list, and we once again ranked as one of the fastest-growing insurance agencies in the nation. 
We've been named to Selling Power Magazine's 2016 list of 50 Best Companies To Sell For, landing at #7. This is the fourth consecutive year of Paychex has appeared in the list, moving up from the #9 spot last year. Very proud to be in the top 10 of best companies to sell for. 
And Paychex was once again ranked as the largest 401(k) recordkeeper by total number of defined contribution plans according to the recent survey [indiscernible] sponsored magazine, a national publication dedicated to the pension and retirement industry. 
We also continue with our shareholder friendly actions in the first quarter. In July, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% or $0.04 per share to $0.46 per share. Our Board of Directors also approved an additional authorization to repurchase up to $350 million of our outstanding common stock, which expires now in May of 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter, but will continue to assess the opportunity to buy back shares during the year to offset dilution. 
In summary, we are off to a great solid start. We're receiving very good recognition, and I'm very appreciative of the great work of our Paychex employee team, sales ops and all the support teams in the company. 
I'll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

As discussed, first quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 represent a solid start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and end with the review of our 2017 outlook. 
Total service revenue grew 9% for the first quarter to [ph] $774 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the first quarter to $12 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Expenses increased 8% for the first quarter, and Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of this growth. Compensation-related expenses increased 6%, primarily due to higher wages resulting from growth in headcount in both operations and sales. Our effective income tax rate was 33% [ph] for the first quarter compared to 29.7% to the prior year's first quarter. The effective income tax rates have been impacted by discrete tax items recognized in both of these periods, so last quarter -- last year's first quarter [indiscernible] year's first quarter. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, we recorded the tax benefit resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance, partially offset by the recognition of an additional provision related to a state tax matter. These items increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 2 and 1/2 cents share to be precise. If you remember last year in the first quarter, we recognized a net tax benefit, an income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produced. This resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.06 per share for that period. So now if I could just do an editorial. 
You'll see that when we talk about net income, we carefully say as reported net income. So we're going to give you guidance on as reported net income and net income excluding discrete items. The punchline to that is that there's been no change. We just need you to look at those 2 items down to discrete items. We'll talk about that in a second and see that essentially, it doesn't change the guidance. I have seen some notes that seem to think it does. It doesn't. I'll come to that in a second. 
I just mentioned adoption of new accounting guidance impacting the effective tax rate. We early adopted new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payment. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit and an income statement. This was previously required to be recorded as additional paid in capital in equity. On an as reported basis, net income increased 4% to $217 million and diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.60 per share in the first quarter. Growth rates for net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted by approximately 5% and 6% as a result of the recognition of the discrete items in the respective periods. So I give you those numbers so you can reconcile back to what it would look like if you excluded those items. 
Let's talk about payroll service revenue. Increased 4% for the first quarter to $451 million. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. 
In addition, Advance Partners, which we acquired last year, contributed approximately 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for the first quarter. Checks per payroll were not a contributing factor in the recorded payroll revenue growth, and we expect to continue to see that to be the case. 
HRS revenue increased strongly to 15% in the first quarter, $323 million. Increase reflected strong growth in client base across all major HCM services, including our comprehensive outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. I take this point or pause to just say that remember that part of what we report nature [ph] as are the modules that we sell on the HCM system. So in order to understand clearly what we're doing, you need to look at both categories. 
Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see strong demand, which is reflected in a double-digit year-over-year growth in a number of client worksite employees served. 
Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our full service Affordable Care Act product and growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers' comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue benefited from increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value purchase and funds as well as an increase in clients served. 
Last, Advance Partners contributed approximately 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for the first quarter. 
Investments in income. Our goal is to predict principal and optimize liquidity. As you all know, on the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles are bank demand, deposit accounts and variable-rate demand notes in our longer-term portfolio. We invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. 
Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.3 [ph] years. Combined portfolios [indiscernible] had an average of 1.2% for the first quarter, which is up from 1% last year. I'd just say one note on that. The Fed, it's very difficult to figure out what exactly is going on. Our guidance at this point does not include or anticipate any increases in the interest rate. As I look at consensus model, looked like some of you are modeling an increase in there. At this point, it's not in our guidance. 
Average balances for interest on funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% during the first quarter, primarily as a result of lower state unemployment rates, partially offset by growth in client base. 
I'll now walk you to the highlights of our financial position. It remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $944 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of August 31, were $3.4 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 2016. But as you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they average $3.8 billion for the quarter. 
Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $63 million as of the end of the quarter, and this compares with the net unrealized gains of $48 million as of the end of May 31. 
Total stockholder's equity was $2 billion as of August 31, 2016, reflecting $166 million in dividends paid during the first quarter, our return on equity for the past 12 months with a sterling 39%. Our cash flows from operations were $295 million for first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change was primarily a result of higher net income, a slight increase in net Cash adjustment and situations in working capital. 
Now guidance for the remainder of the year. So with the close of the first quarter, we're going to take the opportunity to fine-tune the guidance we've provided last quarter. We remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes [indiscernible] for the full year of fiscal 2017 is as follows: Payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. And if you recall, this is a change we had said 4%. And from our perspective, it's fine tuning. Let me give you some detail on the quarter so you know how we expect to get to that. 
On a quarterly basis, if you look at the second and the fourth quarters, second and fourth quarters, we expect it to be in this strange. In the third quarter, which is where we lose 1 day this year, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. So let me just reiterate that. Second and fourth quarters, comparable on a day basis to last year, we expect to be in that range of 3% to 4%. In the third quarter, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. We have 1 less day in the third quarter. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain the same, which is 12% to 14%. 
Total service revenue continues to be in the range of 7% to 8% also. Consistent with prior guidance, income, excluding float as a percentage of total service revenue, is expected to be approximately 38%. As you know, first quarter has typically had a higher margin. And we expect that operating income, excluding float in that second quarter, won't be as high. We expect it to be between 38% and 39%. Now as reported net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. Some people took that and assumed it was a change in guidance. It's simply reflecting the fact that we now have discrete items in first quarter and discrete items in the prior year first quarter. We wanted to give you a number that you can anchor your model on to understand what it looks like before you subtract them. So as reported, I repeat that again, net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. This reflects the impact of the discrete tax items I just mentioned, which were recognized in both this quarter and the prior year first quarter. And it should be obvious that our previous guidance with adjusted for the discrete item in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Obviously, we did not know at the time we're going to record a discrete item in the first quarter where we would have told you. 
When you make the adjustments, and we exclude non-recruiting items, net income will be the same as our prior guidance. So there's no change to the guidance. It simply gives you another data point on which to anchor the model. 
Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%, which also reflects the impact of the discrete tax items. So you can see our tax rate in the first quarter was lower. Subsequent quarters will be higher to get us to approximately 35% for the year. Other aspects of our guidance have remained unchanged from what we previously provided. So I hope that clarifies the guidance, and I will turn it now back to Marty."

It's basically a scaled-down version of our web-based flextime Paychex Flex Time offering so to make it easier for clients to get started and to have a product that doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles on it, but that they need it. So we do think there's going to be some uplift. We've seen high -- double-digit increases in the sales. I'd say the penetration still pretty low, so it's definitely -- I would say where we are now, 10% or somewhere in there, a little bit more. But with a lot of room to grow. And our biggest opportunity I think right now is we still see 50%, slightly over 50% of our clients based on our surveys are in businesses in general, small businesses that are impacted who are not even aware of the overtime regulation.

Now you're selling more to those clients that in our client base either weren't -- were not aware of it, it didn't apply to them or they just didn't bother to buy it and try to get through it on their own. And then new clients coming out, of course, that now needed more changing. So I think you'll see that has some impact this year because there's not as obviously as much opportunity as doing it last year. But what then -- on the hand, we see time and attendance in the overtime regulations as the new opportunity. Not quite as big as the ACA opportunity, but I think yes, the [indiscernible] get tough run at only -- but more to last year because you had that initial that can sell a lot of clients that my existing client base that doesn't have."

When you think about time and attendance, for example, we saw that the existing module is very good for mid-market and more complex clients, but that we had a real opportunity. One of the difficulties with time and attendance is it's somewhat complex to get started and that turns clients off sometimes. And so we scaled down and rolled out the flextime essentials now just this quarter. And so I think you'll see continued investments like that. The other thing is analytics. We're getting more into data analytics and using our reporting packages to guide to make them more flexible and easier to gain data out of the reporting packages to offer data analytics to our clients frankly of all sizes. And you'll see continued investment in analytics and reporting. And I would say as well, continued kind of adding more kind of bells and whistles. At the same time, we're building out a simpler interface to HTML5 for all of our products and mobile first design.

But from that perspective, can you just help us understand, how much of your selling efforts headcount, time in the field, however, you want to talk about it, is focused on up selling more components to broader product fit into a pretty sticky and large base versus people who are out there prospecting for new payroll customers? Has that changed? Is more of the focus telling more stuff into the base today than it was in the past?"

Well, obviously, there's a lot more opportunity, but I would say if you took -- probably if you thought about core payroll and that sales team and then the way MMS -- the mid-market team goes after it, probably, 40%, 50% is still on acquiring new clients and going after them and getting them on board and the other 50% is really there -- because when you think about all of HRS really, they're selling into the base for the most part. And then a number of the core and MMS payroll teams are back selling more client, more products, but I'd say it's probably around 50-50. And I don't know if it's changed all that much. I think their focus though on selling the full package upfront is different. So while it's a little bit different than the way I would probably you're thinking about it, we sell a lot more full package right upfront. Our old style would be sell you payroll. You get used to us. You get happy with us. 6 months later, I come back and see if a 401(k) is a value to our workers' compre health insurance. Now what we're finding is clients want the full value upfront. They want -- they have a full need in mind and it's not just, yes, I want payroll for now and then I'll come talk to me. So we're selling more what we call integrated sales approach where multiple teams will go and see a brand-new client and sell them could be everything, including HR outsourcing because that's what they really were looking for and payroll was just coming along with it. So -- but I think if you say 50-50 roughly, that would be fine. It's just the focus is very different now for the sales teams, every from core right through."

It's a combination of what is the client see the value in for like a 401(k) for example and -- or do they feel the pressure from their employee base? We're feeling more clients come to us for products like insurance and 401(k) because, hey, there's -- it's harder with full employment. They're moving towards full employment, it's harder for them to capture new employees unless they have the benefit packages that they might not have needed 2 years ago in order to compete for their employees. So it's the need in the market. It's the value to the client and it's execution. Obviously, we spent a tremendous amount of time training, making sure the products are available, making sure that we have the training and all the sales force tools. We've added a tremendous amount of tools to the sales force, data analytics, what clients we have that are most likely to buy a 401(k), most likely to buy insurance, sales force, all of the tools all help execution. So it's a number of things. I would say penetration rate still give us a tremendous amount of opportunity. We're moving them up, but there's still a lot of room to grow and I think we're putting everything in place to be successful about it."

Cities are different, and the really help a lot of our clients help -- we help them through our payroll service only or our HR outsourcing to stay up with minimum wage changes because not only are they -- they're not changing once. They're changing over a period of years, and you have to make sure that you stay current with those. And there's a lot of work on identifying like who's a -- the kind of immigration type thing. You got to know your customer. You got to know your employees. You got to make sure you got all of that well-documented. So the rules keep coming. I don't think that helps necessarily the business environment in general because of overregulation, but it certainly gives Paychex a lot of opportunities to go and talk to clients about their payroll need and their HR outsourcing need because small to midsized businesses just can't keep up with all of these changes. The other thing is that the enforcement and the penalties have increased as states and federal governments have looked for revenue sources. So not only is there an issue about whether you are a compliant, but if you're challenged on your compliance, we can provide a tremendous amount of help if you get a penalty in payroll, if you get a penalty for a time issue, a time and attendance issue, we're there to support you with expert documentation and background and relationships with federal state and local governments. And that's a big plus that we sell to clients that they don't realize sometimes until they're hit with an audit or enforcement penalty."

So if you look at our mid-market platform taken as a whole, including the modules that are typically sold with them, which are HR, online in time and attendance, you'd seem nice growth over the last 2 or 3 years. Payroll has done fine, too, but it has a little bit of that headwind because of slightly lower clients driven by some of the positive which is increasing client growth. So we've gone from growing the client base at 1% to growing between 2% and 3%. And hopefully, that continues to grow. The reason why we're not as concerned about that is that those clients eventually become larger and purchase more services. So we want to keep the final reasonably open at the top."

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for first quarter ended August 31, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations web page as they become available. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.
On today's call, I'll review highlights for the first quarter in relationship -- in relation to sales and ops and product management, development areas. Efrain will review first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance, and then we'll open it up your questions.
We are off to a solid start for Fiscal 2017 with positive results across all major product lines. The number of client worksite employees served by our human resource outsourcing services grew by double digits over -- on a year-over-year basis. Our cloud-based HCM services, including time and attendance and human resource management, continued to gain strong market acceptance in the quarter as well as last year.
Payroll service revenue grew 4% for the first quarter. HRS revenue increased 15% for the quarter, driven largely by growth in the client base across all major HCM categories. Total service revenue, up 9%. We acquired Advance Partners last December and are very pleased with their contribution to our results. Advance Partners contributed approximately 1.5% to the growth in the service revenue for the first quarter.
Client retention has remained strong, providing excellent customer service as our top priority. We've continued to invest in our operations and compliant services to support growth and ensure we maintain best-in-class client service.
One area of focus has been the expansion of our multiproduct service center, which primarily assists our mid-market clients who attach additional services with payroll. We have also invested in our insurance operations team to increase support for our Affordable Care Act service clients as we approach the 2016 calendar year filing. 
We usually announced the expansion of the AICPA Paychex partner program to include Human Resource Services in addition to payroll and retirement benefits. This program allows CPAs who refer to us to broaden their advisory role with clients by offering them a suite of best-in-class services and provides a strong referral channel for us. We are proud to be the preferred provider of payroll, retirement and now human resource outsourcing services for the AICPA, CPA.com and its CPA members.
The Department of Labor's final Overtime Rule has become effective -- will become effective December 1, which will expand over time for millions of workers. This new legislation makes accurate time and attendance tracking more important than ever, and we have found that many businesses remain unaware of the legislation and the impact on their business.
We recently announced enhancements to our time and attendance service portfolio with the addition of Paychex Flex Time Essentials, TrueShift time clock and an advanced scheduling feature within our Paychex Flex Time module. The investment in this technology demonstrates our continued commitment to providing industry-leading solutions that educate and assist our clients to comply with the new regulations and stay more connected to their employees and their businesses.
These new products enhance our commitment to supporting our clients through the entire employee journey, from the posting of a position, interviewing and job offer, onboarding the new employee and handling all the daily tasks and life events with a simple, integrated, SaaS software-as-a-solution platform combined with personalized and flexible service options. We're very proud of the support our employees provide small and midsized businesses with this broad and advanced product set in commitment to great service, particularly as we enter our 45th year in business.
Along with that, I'm very proud of some recent recognition our Paychex team has received. Our insurance agency ranked #23 on Business Insurance magazine's 2016 list of top 100 brokers of U.S. business. This is our sixth appearance on the list, and we once again ranked as one of the fastest-growing insurance agencies in the nation.
We've been named to Selling Power Magazine's 2016 list of 50 Best Companies to Sell For, landing at #7. This is the fourth consecutive year that Paychex has appeared in the list, moving up from the #9 spot last year. Very proud to be in the top 10 of best companies to sell for.
And Paychex was once again ranked as the largest 401(k) recordkeeper by total number of defined contribution plans according to the recent survey by PLANSPONSOR magazine, a national publication dedicated to the pension and retirement industry.
We also continue with our shareholder-friendly actions in the first quarter. In July, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% or $0.04 per share to $0.46 per share. Our Board of Directors also approved an additional authorization to repurchase up to $350 million of our outstanding common stock, which expires now and [ph] May of 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter but will continue to assess the opportunity to buy back shares during the year to offset dilution.
In summary, we are off to a great solid start. We're receiving very good recognition, and I'm very appreciative of the great work of our Paychex employee team, sales ops and all the support teams in the company.
I'll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

As discussed, first quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 represent a solid start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and end with a review of our 2017 outlook.
Total service revenue grew 9% for the first quarter to $774 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the first quarter to $12 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Expenses increased 8% for the first quarter, and Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of this growth. Compensation-related expenses increased 6%, primarily due to higher wages resulting from growth in headcount in both operations and sales.
Our effective income tax rate was 33% for the first quarter compared to 29.7% to the prior year's first quarter. The effective income tax rates have been impacted by discrete tax items recognized in both of these periods, so last quarter -- last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, we recorded a tax benefit resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance, partially offset by the recognition of an additional provision related to a state tax matter.
These items increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.025 share to be precise. If you remember, last year in the first quarter, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produced. This resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.06 per share for that period.
So now if I could just do an editorial. You'll see that when we talk about net income, we carefully say as reported net income. So we're going to give you guidance on as reported net income and net income excluding discrete items. The punchline to that is that there's been no change. We just need you to look at those 2 items down to discrete items, we'll talk about that in a second, and see that essentially, it doesn't change the guidance. I have seen some notes that seem to think it does. It doesn't. I'll come to that in a second.
I just mentioned adoption of new accounting guidance impacting the effective tax rate. We early adopted new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payment. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit in the income statement. This was previously required to be recorded as additional paid in capital in equity.
On an as reported basis, net income increased 4% to $217 million, and diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.60 per share in the first quarter. Growth rates for net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted by approximately 5% and 6% as a result of the recognition of the discrete items in the respective periods. So I give you those numbers so you can reconcile back to what it would look like if you excluded those items.
Let's talk about payroll service revenue, increased 4% for the first quarter to $451 million. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. In addition, Advance Partners, which we acquired last year, contributed approximately 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for the first quarter. Checks per payroll were not a contributing factor in the recorded payroll revenue growth, and we expect to continue to see that to be the case.
HRS revenue increased strongly to 15% in the first quarter, $323 million. The increase reflected strong growth in client base across all major HCM services, including our comprehensive outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. I take this point or pause to say that remember that part of what we report in HRS are the modules that we sell on the HCM system. So in order to understand clearly what we're doing, you need to look at both categories.
Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth in the number of client worksite employees served.
Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our full service Affordable Care Act product and growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers' comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue benefited from the increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of purchased [ph] funds as well as an increase in clients served. Last, Advance Partners contributed approximately 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for the first quarter.
Investments in income. Our goal is to predict principal and optimize liquidity. As you all know, on the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles are bank demand, deposit accounts and variable-rate demand notes in our longer-term portfolio. We invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.
Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Combined portfolios are at an average of 1.2% for the first quarter, which is up from 1% last year. I'd just say one note on that. The Fed, it's very difficult to figure out what exactly is going on. Our guidance at this point does not include or anticipate any increases in the interest rate. As I look at consensus model, looked like some of you are modeling an increase in there. At this point, it's not in our guidance.
Average balances for interest on funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% during the first quarter, primarily as a result of lower state unemployment rates, partially offset by growth in client base.
I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $944 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of August 31, were $3.4 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 2016. But as you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they average $3.8 billion for the quarter.
Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $63 million as of the end of the quarter, and this compares with net unrealized gains of $48 million as of the end of May 31.
Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of August 31, 2016, reflecting $166 million in dividends paid during the first quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 39%. Our cash flows from operations were $295 million for the first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change was primarily a result of higher net income, a slight increase in noncash adjustment and fluctuations in working capital.
Now guidance for the remainder of the year. So with the close of the first quarter, we're going to take the opportunity to fine-tune the guidance we've provided last quarter. We remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes.
Our guidance for the full year of fiscal 2017 is as follows: payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. And if you recall, this is a change. We had said 4%. And from our perspective, it's fine-tuning. Let me give you some detail on the quarter so you know how we expect to get to that.
On a quarterly basis, if you look at the second and the fourth quarters -- second and fourth quarters, we expect it to be in this strange. In the third quarter, which is where we lose 1 day this year, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. So let me just reiterate that. Second and fourth quarters, comparable on a day basis to last year, we expect to be in that range of 3% to 4%. In the third quarter, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. We have 1 less day in the third quarter. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain the same, which is 12% to 14%.
Total service revenue continues to be in the range of 7% to 8% also. Consistent with prior guidance, income, excluding float as a percentage of total service revenue, is expected to be approximately 38%. As you know, first quarter has typically had a higher margin. And we expect that operating income, excluding float in the second quarter, won't be as high. We expect it to be between 38% and 39%.
Now as reported net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. Some people took that and assumed it was a change in guidance. It's simply reflecting the fact that we now have discrete items in first quarter and discrete items in the prior year first quarter. We wanted to give you a number that you can anchor your model on to understand what it looks like before you subtract them.
So as reported, I repeat that again, net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. This reflects the impact of the discrete tax items I just mentioned, which were recognized in both this quarter and the prior year first quarter. And it should be obvious that our previous guidance with -- adjusted for the discrete item in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Obviously, we did not know at the time we're going to record a discrete item in the first quarter, where we would have told you.
When you make the adjustments, and we exclude nonrecurring items, net income will be the same as our prior guidance. So there's no change to the guidance. It simply gives you another data point on which to anchor the model.
Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%, which also reflects the impact of the discrete tax items. So you can see our tax rate in the first quarter was lower. Subsequent quarters will be higher to get us to approximately 35% for the year.
Other aspects of our guidance have remained unchanged from what we previously provided. So I hope that clarifies the guidance, and I will turn it now back to Marty."

It's basically a scaled-down version of our web-based Flex Time, Paychex Flex Time offering, sort of make it easier for clients to get started and to have a product that doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles on it, but that they need it. So we do think there's going to be some uplift. We've seen high -- double-digit increases in the sales. I'd say the penetration is still pretty low. So it's definitely -- I would say where we are now, 10% or somewhere in there, a little bit more. But it will -- a lot of room to grow.

Now you're selling more to those clients that -- in our client base that either were not aware of it, it didn't apply to them or they just didn't bother to buy it and tried to get through it on their own and then new clients coming out, of course, that now needed more changing. So I think you'll see that has some impact this year because there's not as -- obviously as much opportunity as last year. But what then -- on the hand, we see time and attendance and the overtime regulations as the new opportunity. Not quite as big as the ACA opportunity, but I think yes, the comps will get tougher on that only -- but more to last year because you had that initial, ""Hey, I can sell a lot of clients that my existing client base, that doesn't have it."""

And so we scaled down and rolled out the flextime essentials now just this quarter. And so I think you'll see continued investments like that. The other thing is analytics. We're getting more into data analytics and using our reporting packages to guide to make them more flexible and easier to gain data out of the reporting packages to offer data analytics to our clients, frankly, of all sizes.

And I guess, it seems to me that you've alluded a couple of times and maybe the distinction isn't as strong as it was in the past. But from that perspective, can you just help us understand, how much of your selling efforts headcount, time in the field, however, you want to talk about it, is focused on up-selling more components to broader product set into a pretty sticky and large base versus people who are out there prospecting for new payroll customers? Has that changed? Is more of the focus selling more stuff into the base today than it was in the past?"

Well, obviously, there's a lot more opportunity, but I would say, if you took -- probably, if you thought about core payroll and that sales team and then the way MMS -- the mid-market team goes after it, probably, 40%, 50% is still on acquiring new clients and going after them and getting them on board and the other 50% is really -- because when you think about all of HRS really, they're selling into the base for the most part. And then a number of the core and MMS payroll teams are back selling more client, more products, but I'd say it's probably around 50:50, and I don't know if it's changed all that much. I think their focus though on selling the full package upfront is different. So while -- so it's a little bit different than the way I would probably you're thinking about it. We sell a lot more full package right upfront. Our old style would be, ""Hey, I sell you payroll, you get used to us, you get happy with us."" Six months later, I come back and see if a 401(k) is a value to you or workers' comp or health insurance. Now what we're finding is clients want the full value upfront. They want -- they have a full need in mind, and it's not just, ""Yes, I want payroll for now, and then I'll [ph] come talk to me."" So we're selling more what we call integrated sales approach where multiple teams will go and see a brand-new client and sell them -- it could be everything, including HR outsourcing because that's what they really were looking for and payroll was just coming along with it. So -- but I think if you say 50:50 roughly, that would be fine. It's just the focus is very different now for the sales teams, every from core right through."

It's a combination of what is the client see the value in, like a 401(k), for example, and -- or do they feel the pressure from their employee base? We're feeling more clients come to us for products like insurance and 401(k) because, ""Hey, there's -- it's harder with full employment."" They're moving towards full employment, it's harder for them to capture new employees unless they have the benefit packages that they might not have needed 2 years ago in order to compete for their employees. So it's the need in the market, it's the value to the client and it's execution. Obviously, we spent a tremendous amount of time training, making sure the products are available, making sure that we have the training and all the sales force tools. We've added a tremendous amount of tools to the sales force, data analytics, what clients we have that are most likely to buy a 401(k), most likely to buy insurance, sales force, all of the tools, all help execution. So it's a number of things. I would say penetration rate still give us a tremendous amount of opportunity.

And that group has been doing very well, particularly in first quarter, we had some nice growth there. So we're building relationships with brokers who refer us now. And as these rules get more complex for brokers, I think they're bringing our talented kind of tenured team on the large market into more deals, so that's very good.

Minimum-",348,"Yes, there hasn't been -- there's been a steady flow based on current administration and probably won't change much in the election, which could have some impact. But minimum wage, for example, right now, it's extremely confusing for our clients. Minimum-wage rules are different by state. The Fed's talk about changing minimum-wage they have for government, but in some of those that they are in, they are tied into government. But states are different, cities are different and we really help a lot of our clients help -- we help them through our payroll service only or our HR outsourcing to stay up with minimum wage changes, because not only are they -- they're not changing once, they're changing over a period of years, and you have to make sure that you stay current with those. And there's a lot of work on identifying like who's a -- the kind of immigration-type things. You got to know your customer. You got to know your employees. You got to make sure you've got all of that well documented. So the rules keep coming. I don't think that helps necessarily the business environment in general because of overregulation, but it certainly gives Paychex a lot of opportunities to go in and talk to clients about their payroll need and their HR outsourcing need, because small to midsized businesses just can't keep up with all of these changes. The other thing is that the enforcement and the penalties have increased as states and federal governments have looked for revenue sources. So not only is there an issue about whether you are compliant, but if you're challenged on your compliance, we can provide a tremendous amount of help if you get a penalty in payroll, if you get a penalty for a time issue, a time and attendance issue, we're there to support you with expert documentation and background and relationships with federal state and local governments. And that's a big plus that we sell to clients that they don't realize sometimes until they're hit with an audit or an enforcement penalty."

So if you look at our mid-market platform taken as a whole, including the modules that are typically sold with them, which are HR, online in time and attendance, you'd seem nice growth over the last 2 or 3 years. Payroll has done fine, too, but it has a little bit of that headwind because of slightly lower clients, driven by some of it is positive which is increasing client growth. So we've gone from growing the client base at 1% to growing between 2% and 3%, and hopefully, that continues to grow. The reason why we're not as concerned about that is that those clients eventually become larger and purchase more services. So we want to keep the funnel reasonably open at the top."

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for first quarter ended August 31, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations web page as they become available. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.
On today's call, I'll review highlights for the first quarter in relationship -- in relation to sales and ops and product management, development areas. Efrain will review first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance, and then we'll open it up your questions.
We are off to a solid start for Fiscal 2017 with positive results across all major product lines. The number of client worksite employees served by our human resource outsourcing services grew by double digits over -- on a year-over-year basis. Our cloud-based HCM services, including time and attendance and human resource management, continued to gain strong market acceptance in the quarter as well as last year.
Payroll service revenue grew 4% for the first quarter. HRS revenue increased 15% for the quarter, driven largely by growth in the client base across all major HCM categories. Total service revenue, up 9%. We acquired Advance Partners last December and are very pleased with their contribution to our results. Advance Partners contributed approximately 1.5% to the growth in the service revenue for the first quarter.
Client retention has remained strong, providing excellent customer service as our top priority. We've continued to invest in our operations and compliant services to support growth and ensure we maintain best-in-class client service.
One area of focus has been the expansion of our multiproduct service center, which primarily assists our mid-market clients who attach additional services with payroll. We have also invested in our insurance operations team to increase support for our Affordable Care Act service clients as we approach the 2016 calendar year filing. 
We recently announced the expansion of the AICPA Paychex partner program to include Human Resource Services in addition to payroll and retirement benefits. This program allows CPAs who refer to us to broaden their advisory role with clients by offering them a suite of best-in-class services and provides a strong referral channel for us. We are proud to be the preferred provider of payroll, retirement and now human resource outsourcing services for the AICPA, CPA.com and its CPA members.
The Department of Labor's final Overtime Rule has become effective -- will become effective December 1, which will expand overtime for millions of workers. This new legislation makes accurate time and attendance tracking more important than ever, and we have found that many businesses remain unaware of the legislation and the impact on their business.
We recently announced enhancements to our time and attendance service portfolio with the addition of Paychex Flex Time Essentials, TrueShift time clock and an advanced scheduling feature within our Paychex Flex Time module. The investment in this technology demonstrates our continued commitment to providing industry-leading solutions that educate and assist our clients to comply with the new regulations and stay more connected to their employees and their businesses.
These new products enhance our commitment to supporting our clients through the entire employee journey, from the posting of a position, interviewing and job offer, onboarding the new employee and handling all the daily tasks and life events with a simple, integrated, SaaS software-as-a-solution platform combined with personalized and flexible service options. We're very proud of the support our employees provide small and midsized businesses with this broad and advanced product set in commitment to great service, particularly as we enter our 45th year in business.
Along with that, I'm very proud of some recent recognition our Paychex team has received. Our insurance agency ranked #23 on Business Insurance magazine's 2016 list of top 100 brokers of U.S. business. This is our sixth appearance on the list, and we once again ranked as one of the fastest-growing insurance agencies in the nation.
We've been named to Selling Power Magazine's 2016 list of 50 Best Companies to Sell For, landing at #7. This is the fourth consecutive year that Paychex has appeared in the list, moving up from the #9 spot last year. Very proud to be in the top 10 of best companies to sell for.
And Paychex was once again ranked as the largest 401(k) record keeper by total number of defined contribution plans according to the recent survey by PLANSPONSOR magazine, a national publication dedicated to the pension and retirement industry.
We also continue with our shareholder-friendly actions in the first quarter. In July, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% or $0.04 per share to $0.46 per share. Our Board of Directors also approved an additional authorization to repurchase up to $350 million of our outstanding common stock, which expires now and May of 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter but will continue to assess the opportunity to buy back shares during the year to offset dilution.
In summary, we are off to a great solid start. We're receiving very good recognition, and I'm very appreciative of the great work of our Paychex employee team, sales ops and all the support teams in the company.
I'll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

As discussed, first quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 represent a solid start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and end with a review of our 2017 outlook.
Total service revenue grew 9% for the first quarter to $774 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the first quarter to $12 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Expenses increased 8% for the first quarter, and Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of this growth. Compensation-related expenses increased 6%, primarily due to higher wages resulting from growth in headcount in both operations and sales.
Our effective income tax rate was 33% for the first quarter compared to 29.7% to the prior year's first quarter. The effective income tax rates have been impacted by discrete tax items recognized in both of these periods, so last quarter -- last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, we recorded a tax benefit resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance, partially offset by the recognition of an additional provision related to a state tax matter.
These items increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.025 share to be precise. If you remember, last year in the first quarter, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produced. This resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.06 per share for that period.
So now if I could just do an editorial. You'll see that when we talk about net income, we carefully say as reported net income. So we're going to give you guidance on as reported net income and net income excluding discrete items. The punchline to that is that there's been no change. We just need you to look at those 2 items down to discrete items, we'll talk about that in a second, and see that essentially, it doesn't change the guidance. I have seen some notes that seem to think it does. It doesn't. I'll come to that in a second.
I just mentioned adoption of new accounting guidance impacting the effective tax rate. We early adopted new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payment. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit in the income statement. This was previously required to be recorded as additional paid in capital in equity.
On an as reported basis, net income increased 4% to $217 million, and diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.60 per share in the first quarter. Growth rates for net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted by approximately 5% and 6% as a result of the recognition of the discrete items in the respective periods. So I give you those numbers so you can reconcile back to what it would look like if you excluded those items.
Let's talk about payroll service revenue, increased 4% for the first quarter to $451 million. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. In addition, Advance Partners, which we acquired last year, contributed approximately 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for the first quarter. Checks per payroll were not a contributing factor in the recorded payroll revenue growth, and we expect to continue to see that to be the case.
HRS revenue increased strongly to 15% in the first quarter, $323 million. The increase reflected strong growth in client base across all major HCM services, including our comprehensive outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. I take this point or pause to say that remember that part of what we report in HRS are the modules that we sell on the HCM system. So in order to understand clearly what we're doing, you need to look at both categories.
Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth in the number of client worksite employees served.
Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our full service Affordable Care Act product and growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers' comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue benefited from the increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of purchased [ph] funds as well as an increase in plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed approximately 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for the first quarter.
Investments in income. Our goal is to predict principal and optimize liquidity. As you all know, on the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles are bank demand, deposit accounts and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.
Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Combined portfolios earned an average of 1.2% for the first quarter, which is up from 1% last year. I'd just say one note on that. The Fed, it's very difficult to figure out what exactly is going on. Our guidance at this point does not include or anticipate any increases in the interest rate. As I look at consensus model, looked like some of you are modeling an increase in there. At this point, it's not in our guidance.
Average balances for interest on funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% during the first quarter, primarily as a result of lower state unemployment rates, partially offset by growth in client base.
I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $944 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of August 31, were $3.4 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 2016. But as you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they average $3.8 billion for the quarter.
Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $63 million as of the end of the quarter, and this compares with net unrealized gains of $48 million as of the end of May 31.
Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of August 31, 2016, reflecting $166 million in dividends paid during the first quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 39%. Our cash flows from operations were $295 million for the first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change was primarily a result of higher net income, a slight increase in noncash adjustment and fluctuations in working capital.
Now guidance for the remainder of the year. So with the close of the first quarter, we're going to take the opportunity to fine-tune the guidance we've provided last quarter. We remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes.
Our guidance for the full year of fiscal 2017 is as follows: payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. And if you recall, this is a change. We had said 4%. And from our perspective, it's fine-tuning. Let me give you some detail on the quarter so you know how we expect to get to that.
On a quarterly basis, if you look at the second and the fourth quarters -- second and fourth quarters, we expect it to be in this range. In the third quarter, which is where we lose 1 day this year, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. So let me just reiterate that. Second and fourth quarters, comparable on a day basis to last year, we expect to be in that range of 3% to 4%. In the third quarter, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. We have 1 less day in the third quarter. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain the same, which is 12% to 14%.
Total service revenue continues to be in the range of 7% to 8% also. Consistent with prior guidance, income, excluding float as a percentage of total service revenue, is expected to be approximately 38%. As you know, first quarter has typically had a higher margin. And we expect that operating income, excluding float in the second quarter, won't be as high. We expect it to be between 38% and 39%.
Now as reported net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. Some people took that and assumed it was a change in guidance. It's simply reflecting the fact that we now have discrete items in first quarter and discrete items in the prior year first quarter. We wanted to give you a number that you can anchor your model on to understand what it looks like before you subtract them.
So as reported, I repeat that again, net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. This reflects the impact of the discrete tax items I just mentioned, which were recognized in both this quarter and the prior year first quarter. And it should be obvious that our previous guidance with -- adjusted for the discrete item in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Obviously, we did not know at the time we're going to record a discrete item in the first quarter, or we would have told you.
When you make the adjustments, and we exclude nonrecurring items, net income will be the same as our prior guidance. So there's no change to the guidance. It simply gives you another data point on which to anchor the model.
Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%, which also reflects the impact of the discrete tax items. So you can see our tax rate in the first quarter was lower. Subsequent quarters will be higher to get us to approximately 35% for the year.
Other aspects of our guidance have remained unchanged from what we previously provided. So I hope that clarifies the guidance, and I will turn it now back to Marty."

Payroll service revenue is core payroll plus the portions of the HCM bundle that are payroll.

It's basically a scaled-down version of our web-based Flex Time, Paychex Flex Time offering, sort of make it easier for clients to get started and to have a product that doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles on it, but that they need it. So we do think there's going to be some uplift. We've seen high -- double-digit increases in the sales. I'd say the penetration is still pretty low. So it's definitely -- I would say where we are now, 10% or somewhere in there, a little bit more. But it will -- a lot of room to grow. And our biggest opportunity, I think, right now is we still see 50%, slightly over 50% of our clients, based on our surveys, are in businesses in general, small businesses that are impacted who are not even aware of the overtime regulation.

So I think you'll see that has some impact this year because there's not as -- obviously as much opportunity as last year. But what then -- on the hand, we see time and attendance and the overtime regulations as the new opportunity.

Well, obviously, there's a lot more opportunity, but I would say, if you took -- probably, if you thought about core payroll and that sales team and then the way MMS -- the mid-market team goes after it, probably, 40%, 50% is still on acquiring new clients and going after them and getting them on board and the other 50% is really -- because when you think about all of HRS really, they're selling into the base for the most part. And then a number of the core and MMS payroll teams are back selling more client, more products, but I'd say it's probably around 50:50, and I don't know if it's changed all that much. I think their focus though on selling the full package upfront is different. So while -- so it's a little bit different than the way I would probably you're thinking about it. We sell a lot more full package right upfront. Our old style would be, ""Hey, I sell you payroll, you get used to us, you get happy with us."" Six months later, I come back and see if our 401(k) is a value to you or workers' comp or health insurance. Now what we're finding is clients want the full value upfront. They want -- they have a full need in mind, and it's not just, ""Yes, I want payroll for now, and then I'll come talk to me."" So we're selling more what we call integrated sales approach where multiple teams will go and see a brand-new client and sell them -- it could be everything, including HR outsourcing because that's what they really were looking for and payroll was just coming along with it. So -- but I think if you say 50:50 roughly, that would be fine. It's just the focus is very different now for the sales teams, every from core right through."

It's a combination of what is the client see the value in, like a 401(k), for example, and -- or do they feel the pressure from their employee base? We're feeling more clients come to us for products like insurance and 401(k) because, ""Hey, there's -- it's harder with full employment."" They're moving towards full employment, it's harder for them to capture new employees unless they have the benefit packages that they might not have needed 2 years ago in order to compete for their employees. So it's the need in the market, it's the value to the client and it's execution. Obviously, we spent a tremendous amount of time training, making sure the products are available, making sure that we have the training in all the sales force tools. We've added a tremendous amount of tools to the sales force, data analytics, what clients we have that are most likely to buy a 401(k), most likely to buy insurance, sales force, all of the tools, all help execution.

And that group has been doing very well, particularly in first quarter, we had some nice growth there. So we're building relationships with brokers who refer us now. And as these rules get more complex for brokers, I think they're bringing our talented kind of tenured team on the large market into more deals, so that's very good.

Minimum-",348,"Yes, there hasn't been -- there's been a steady flow based on current administration and probably won't change much in the election, which could have some impact. But minimum wage, for example, right now, it's extremely confusing for our clients. Minimum-wage rules are different by state. The Fed's talk about changing minimum-wage they have for government, but in some of those that they are in, they are tied into government. But states are different, cities are different and we really help a lot of our clients help -- we help them through our payroll service only or our HR outsourcing to stay up with minimum wage changes, because not only are they -- they're not changing once, they're changing over a period of years, and you have to make sure that you stay current with those. And there's a lot of work on identifying like who's a -- the kind of immigration-type things. You got to know your customer. You got to know your employees. You got to make sure you've got all of that well documented. So the rules keep coming. I don't think that helps necessarily the business environment in general because of overregulation, but it certainly gives Paychex a lot of opportunities to go in and talk to clients about their payroll need and their HR outsourcing need, because small to midsized businesses just can't keep up with all of these changes. The other thing is that the enforcement and the penalties have increased as states and federal governments have looked for revenue sources. So not only is there an issue about whether you are compliant, but if you're challenged on your compliance, we can provide a tremendous amount of help if you get a penalty in payroll, if you get a penalty for a time issue, a time and attendance issue, we're there to support you with expert documentation in background and relationships with federal state and local governments. And that's a big plus that we sell to clients that they don't realize sometimes until they're hit with an audit or an enforcement penalty."

So if you look at our mid-market platform taken as a whole, including the modules that are typically sold with them, which are HR, online and time and attendance, you'd seem nice growth over the last 2 or 3 years. Payroll has done fine, too, but it has a little bit of that headwind because of slightly lower client size, driven by some of it is positive which is increasing client growth. So we've gone from growing the client base at 1% to growing between 2% and 3%, and hopefully, that continues to grow. The reason why we're not as concerned about that is that those clients eventually become larger and purchase more services. So we want to keep the funnel reasonably open at the top."

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for first quarter ended August 31, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations web page as they become available. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.
On today's call, I'll review highlights for the first quarter in relationship -- in relation to sales and ops and product management, development areas. Efrain will review first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance, and then we'll open it up your questions.
We are off to a solid start for Fiscal 2017 with positive results across all major product lines. The number of client worksite employees served by our human resource outsourcing services grew by double digits over -- on a year-over-year basis. Our cloud-based HCM services, including time and attendance and human resource management, continued to gain strong market acceptance in the quarter as well as last year.
Payroll service revenue grew 4% for the first quarter. HRS revenue increased 15% for the quarter, driven largely by growth in the client base across all major HCM categories. Total service revenue, up 9%. We acquired Advance Partners last December and are very pleased with their contribution to our results. Advance Partners contributed approximately 1.5% to the growth in the service revenue for the first quarter.
Client retention has remained strong, providing excellent customer service as our top priority. We've continued to invest in our operations and compliant services to support growth and ensure we maintain best-in-class client service.
One area of focus has been the expansion of our multiproduct service center, which primarily assists our mid-market clients who attach additional services with payroll. We have also invested in our insurance operations team to increase support for our Affordable Care Act service clients as we approach the 2016 calendar year filing. 
We recently announced the expansion of the AICPA Paychex partner program to include Human Resource Services in addition to payroll and retirement benefits. This program allows CPAs who refer to us to broaden their advisory role with clients by offering them a suite of best-in-class services and provides a strong referral channel for us. We are proud to be the preferred provider of payroll, retirement and now human resource outsourcing services for the AICPA, CPA.com and its CPA members.
The Department of Labor's final Overtime Rule has become effective -- will become effective December 1, which will expand overtime for millions of workers. This new legislation makes accurate time and attendance tracking more important than ever, and we have found that many businesses remain unaware of the legislation and the impact on their business.
We recently announced enhancements to our time and attendance service portfolio with the addition of Paychex Flex Time Essentials, TrueShift time clock and an advanced scheduling feature within our Paychex Flex Time module. The investment in this technology demonstrates our continued commitment to providing industry-leading solutions that educate and assist our clients to comply with the new regulations and stay more connected to their employees and their businesses.
These new products enhance our commitment to supporting our clients through the entire employee journey, from the posting of a position, interviewing and job offer, onboarding the new employee and handling all the daily tasks and life events with a simple, integrated, SaaS software-as-a-solution platform combined with personalized and flexible service options. We're very proud of the support our employees provide small and midsized businesses with this broad and advanced product set in commitment to great service, particularly as we enter our 45th year in business.
Along with that, I'm very proud of some recent recognition our Paychex team has received. Our insurance agency ranked #23 on Business Insurance magazine's 2016 list of top 100 brokers of U.S. business. This is our sixth appearance on the list, and we once again ranked as one of the fastest-growing insurance agencies in the nation.
We've been named to Selling Power Magazine's 2016 list of 50 Best Companies to Sell For, landing at #7. This is the fourth consecutive year that Paychex has appeared in the list, moving up from the #9 spot last year. Very proud to be in the top 10 of best companies to sell for.
And Paychex was once again ranked as the largest 401(k) record keeper by total number of defined contribution plans according to the recent survey by PLANSPONSOR magazine, a national publication dedicated to the pension and retirement industry.
We also continue with our shareholder-friendly actions in the first quarter. In July, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% or $0.04 per share to $0.46 per share. Our Board of Directors also approved an additional authorization to repurchase up to $350 million of our outstanding common stock, which expires now and May of 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter but will continue to assess the opportunity to buy back shares during the year to offset dilution.
In summary, we are off to a great solid start. We're receiving very good recognition, and I'm very appreciative of the great work of our Paychex employee team, sales ops and all the support teams in the company.
I'll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

As discussed, first quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 represent a solid start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and end with a review of our 2017 outlook.
Total service revenue grew 9% for the first quarter to $774 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the first quarter to $12 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Expenses increased 8% for the first quarter, and Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of this growth. Compensation-related expenses increased 6%, primarily due to higher wages resulting from growth in headcount in both operations and sales.
Our effective income tax rate was 33% for the first quarter compared to 29.7% to the prior year's first quarter. The effective income tax rates have been impacted by discrete tax items recognized in both of these periods, so last quarter -- last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, we recorded a tax benefit resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance, partially offset by the recognition of an additional provision related to a state tax matter.
These items increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.025 share to be precise. If you remember, last year in the first quarter, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produced. This resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.06 per share for that period.
So now if I could just do an editorial. You'll see that when we talk about net income, we carefully say as reported net income. So we're going to give you guidance on as reported net income and net income excluding discrete items. The punchline to that is that there's been no change. We just need you to look at those 2 items down to discrete items, we'll talk about that in a second, and see that essentially, it doesn't change the guidance. I have seen some notes that seem to think it does. It doesn't. I'll come to that in a second.
I just mentioned adoption of new accounting guidance impacting the effective tax rate. We early adopted new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payment. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit in the income statement. This was previously required to be recorded as additional paid in capital in equity.
On an as reported basis, net income increased 4% to $217 million, and diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.60 per share in the first quarter. Growth rates for net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted by approximately 5% and 6% as a result of the recognition of the discrete items in the respective periods. So I give you those numbers so you can reconcile back to what it would look like if you excluded those items.
Let's talk about payroll service revenue, increased 4% for the first quarter to $451 million. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. In addition, Advance Partners, which we acquired last year, contributed approximately 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for the first quarter. Checks per payroll were not a contributing factor in the recorded payroll revenue growth, and we expect to continue to see that to be the case.
HRS revenue increased strongly to 15% in the first quarter, $323 million. The increase reflected strong growth in client base across all major HCM services, including our comprehensive outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. I take this point or pause to say that remember that part of what we report in HRS are the modules that we sell on the HCM system. So in order to understand clearly what we're doing, you need to look at both categories.
Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth in the number of client worksite employees served.
Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our full service Affordable Care Act product and growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers' comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue benefited from the increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of purchased [ph] funds as well as an increase in plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed approximately 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for the first quarter.
Investments in income. Our goal is to predict principal and optimize liquidity. As you all know, on the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles are bank demand, deposit accounts and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.
Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Combined portfolios earned an average of 1.2% for the first quarter, which is up from 1% last year. I'd just say one note on that. The Fed, it's very difficult to figure out what exactly is going on. Our guidance at this point does not include or anticipate any increases in the interest rate. As I look at consensus model, looked like some of you are modeling an increase in there. At this point, it's not in our guidance.
Average balances for interest on funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% during the first quarter, primarily as a result of lower state unemployment rates, partially offset by growth in client base.
I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $944 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of August 31, were $3.4 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 2016. But as you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they average $3.8 billion for the quarter.
Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $63 million as of the end of the quarter, and this compares with net unrealized gains of $48 million as of the end of May 31.
Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of August 31, 2016, reflecting $166 million in dividends paid during the first quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 39%. Our cash flows from operations were $295 million for the first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change was primarily a result of higher net income, a slight increase in noncash adjustment and fluctuations in working capital.
Now guidance for the remainder of the year. So with the close of the first quarter, we're going to take the opportunity to fine-tune the guidance we've provided last quarter. We remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes.
Our guidance for the full year of fiscal 2017 is as follows: payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. And if you recall, this is a change. We had said 4%. And from our perspective, it's fine-tuning. Let me give you some detail on the quarter so you know how we expect to get to that.
On a quarterly basis, if you look at the second and the fourth quarters -- second and fourth quarters, we expect it to be in this range. In the third quarter, which is where we lose 1 day this year, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. So let me just reiterate that. Second and fourth quarters, comparable on a day basis to last year, we expect to be in that range of 3% to 4%. In the third quarter, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. We have 1 less day in the third quarter. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain the same, which is 12% to 14%.
Total service revenue continues to be in the range of 7% to 8% also. Consistent with prior guidance, income, excluding float as a percentage of total service revenue, is expected to be approximately 38%. As you know, first quarter has typically had a higher margin. And we expect that operating income, excluding float in the second quarter, won't be as high. We expect it to be between 38% and 39%.
Now as reported net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. Some people took that and assumed it was a change in guidance. It's simply reflecting the fact that we now have discrete items in first quarter and discrete items in the prior year first quarter. We wanted to give you a number that you can anchor your model on to understand what it looks like before you subtract them.
So as reported, I repeat that again, net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. This reflects the impact of the discrete tax items I just mentioned, which were recognized in both this quarter and the prior year first quarter. And it should be obvious that our previous guidance with -- adjusted for the discrete item in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Obviously, we did not know at the time we're going to record a discrete item in the first quarter, or we would have told you.
When you make the adjustments, and we exclude nonrecurring items, net income will be the same as our prior guidance. So there's no change to the guidance. It simply gives you another data point on which to anchor the model.
Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%, which also reflects the impact of the discrete tax items. So you can see our tax rate in the first quarter was lower. Subsequent quarters will be higher to get us to approximately 35% for the year.
Other aspects of our guidance have remained unchanged from what we previously provided. So I hope that clarifies the guidance, and I will turn it now back to Marty."

It's basically a scaled-down version of our web-based Flex Time, Paychex Flex Time offering, sort of make it easier for clients to get started and to have a product that doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles on it, but that they need it. So we do think there's going to be some uplift. We've seen high -- double-digit increases in the sales. I'd say the penetration is still pretty low. So it's definitely -- I would say where we are now, 10% or somewhere in there, a little bit more. But it will -- a lot of room to grow. And our biggest opportunity, I think, right now is we still see 50%, slightly over 50% of our clients, based on our surveys, are in businesses in general, small businesses that are impacted who are not even aware of the overtime regulation.

So pulling our folks together to service multiple products in those bundles together, driving a little bit more self-service so clients can do more things and their employees can on the web or on mobile apps. I think it's always going to be about service. It's how you define service, and the service definition has become a lot more about technology and how easy it is for clients to use it if they want to use it and when and how they want to use it. So we feel very good about the balance of investments that we've made in technology and service and continue to make."

So I think you'll see that has some impact this year because there's not as -- obviously as much opportunity as last year. But what then -- on the hand, we see time and attendance and the overtime regulations as the new opportunity. Not quite as big as the ACA opportunity, but I think yes, the comps will get tougher on that only -- but more to last year because you had that initial, ""Hey, I can sell a lot of clients that my existing client base, that doesn't have it."""

And then a number of the core and MMS payroll teams are back selling more client, more products, but I'd say it's probably around 50:50, and I don't know if it's changed all that much. I think their focus though on selling the full package upfront is different. So while -- so it's a little bit different than the way I would probably you're thinking about it. We sell a lot more full package right upfront. Our old style would be, ""Hey, I sell you payroll, you get used to us, you get happy with us."" Six months later, I come back and see if our 401(k) is a value to you or workers' comp or health insurance. Now what we're finding is clients want the full value upfront. They want -- they have a full need in mind, and it's not just, ""Yes, I want payroll for now, and then I'll come talk to me."" So we're selling more what we call integrated sales approach where multiple teams will go and see a brand-new client and sell them -- it could be everything, including HR outsourcing because that's what they really were looking for and payroll was just coming along with it. So -- but I think if you say 50:50 roughly, that would be fine. It's just the focus is very different now for the sales teams, every from core right through."

It's a combination of what is the client see the value in, like a 401(k), for example, and -- or do they feel the pressure from their employee base? We're feeling more clients come to us for products like insurance and 401(k) because, ""Hey, there's -- it's harder with full employment."" They're moving towards full employment, it's harder for them to capture new employees unless they have the benefit packages that they might not have needed 2 years ago in order to compete for their employees. So it's the need in the market, it's the value to the client and it's execution. Obviously, we spent a tremendous amount of time training, making sure the products are available, making sure that we have the training in all the sales force tools. We've added a tremendous amount of tools to the sales force, data analytics, what clients we have that are most likely to buy a 401(k), most likely to buy insurance, sales force, all of the tools, all help execution.

And that group has been doing very well, particularly in first quarter, we had some nice growth there. So we're building relationships with brokers who refer us now. And as these rules get more complex for brokers, I think they're bringing our talented kind of tenured team on the large market into more deals, so that's very good.

And it's not as probably as far-reaching or as demanding or as creating as much angst with clients as the Affordable Care Act was because of the penalty situation. Now the overtime stuff could start to pick up if enforcement picks up as well. But I think that's just going to take a little bit longer. So again, it's having some impact versus last year, but it's not a huge thing but it's having some impact."

Minimum-",348,"Yes, there hasn't been -- there's been a steady flow based on current administration and probably won't change much in the election, which could have some impact. But minimum wage, for example, right now, it's extremely confusing for our clients. Minimum-wage rules are different by state. The Fed's talk about changing minimum-wage they have for government, but in some of those that they are in, they are tied into government. But states are different, cities are different and we really help a lot of our clients help -- we help them through our payroll service only or our HR outsourcing to stay up with minimum wage changes, because not only are they -- they're not changing once, they're changing over a period of years, and you have to make sure that you stay current with those. And there's a lot of work on identifying like who's a -- the kind of immigration-type things. You got to know your customer. You got to know your employees. You got to make sure you've got all of that well documented. So the rules keep coming. I don't think that helps necessarily the business environment in general because of overregulation, but it certainly gives Paychex a lot of opportunities to go in and talk to clients about their payroll need and their HR outsourcing need, because small to midsized businesses just can't keep up with all of these changes. The other thing is that the enforcement and the penalties have increased as states and federal governments have looked for revenue sources. So not only is there an issue about whether you are compliant, but if you're challenged on your compliance, we can provide a tremendous amount of help if you get a penalty in payroll, if you get a penalty for a time issue, a time and attendance issue, we're there to support you with expert documentation in background and relationships with federal state and local governments. And that's a big plus that we sell to clients that they don't realize sometimes until they're hit with an audit or an enforcement penalty."

So if you look at our mid-market platform taken as a whole, including the modules that are typically sold with them, which are HR, online and time and attendance, you'd seem nice growth over the last 2 or 3 years. Payroll has done fine, too, but it has a little bit of that headwind because of slightly lower client size, driven by some of it is positive which is increasing client growth. So we've gone from growing the client base at 1% to growing between 2% and 3%, and hopefully, that continues to grow. The reason why we're not as concerned about that is that those clients eventually become larger and purchase more services. So we want to keep the funnel reasonably open at the top."

Thank you and thank you for joining us on our discussion of Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. You can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations web page. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month. 
On today's call, I will update you on the results of our business in the second quarter, and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our full year guidance. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
Our results for the second quarter reflected good progress. We continue to see positive results across our major product lines. And service revenue for the second quarter grew by 7% year-over-year. We achieved a new milestone this quarter as we attained 1 million client worksite employees served by our Paychex HR Services. Paychex HR Services is our comprehensive outsourcing services product line, and that includes our ASO, or administrative services organization, and our PEO, or professional employer organization as well. Our cloud-based HCM services and, particularly, time and attendance, continued to show strong growth in the quarter. 
Tomorrow is the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance has been an excellent addition to the Paychex family. We're very pleased with the leadership and the team's contribution to our financial results and the future opportunities for growth we see in that business particularly timely as the staffing business is picking up some expanded growth today. 
With the success of our HCM solutions, we have continued to invest in operations personnel as we've expanded our multiproduct service centers, including our time and attendance support and our ACA product compliance and service teams. Client retention remains at consistent high levels. We have also invested in our service and our sales organization over the last year, adding headcount across all sales teams. And we are well-positioned going into our third quarter. We will have a better idea of overall sales performance and the impact of the fiscal year next quarter after the end of our peak sales season. 
We continue to make it a priority to provide robust HCM solutions that meet the evolving needs of our client base. At the recent HR Technology Conference and Exposition in October, we showcased enhancements to Paychex Flex that address 2 of the biggest trends in the HR industry: mobile user experience and the HR analytics. Attendees at the conference were able to view a demo of Paychex Flex which included these enhancements. 
We also announced that we shifted to a mobile-first design of our HCM suite. This approach allows Paychex Flex users to have full functionality of all application components regardless of device or screen size. The growing trend for both HR leaders and employees is the use of a mobile device. Shifting to a mobile-first design demonstrates our commitment to putting the needs of our clients and their employees first so that they can accomplish their HR tasks where they want, when they want and on whatever device they want. 
We continue to receive positive recognition of our Flex platform. In November, we were honored to be recognized as a leader in the 2016 NelsonHall Payroll Outsourcing NEAT, a component of the firm's speed-to source initiative. NEAT stands for NelsonHall's Evaluation and Assessment Tool, and is a vendor evaluation report tool that can be utilized by managers to evaluate outsourcing vendors. 
This was the first time we participated in this initiative, and we were placed in the Leader quadrant for 3 areas: technology and user experience, analytics and reporting, and HR cloud integration. The client feedback that goes into this ranking makes this honor even more important to us and reinforces our commitment to delivering the best and most robust solutions in the market today with our Paychex Flex platform. 
This has been a transition period in the U.S. with the presidential election and the move to the Trump administration. We have been asked a few times how we anticipate the new administration will impact the economy overall and, more specifically, the payroll and human capital management outsourcing industry. In this transition time, many business owners could be hesitant to make longer-term decisions. We see this as being more likely to impact the mid to large-sized businesses, rather than small businesses. President-elect Trump has indicated that he intends to lower taxes and create less regulation. This would be a positive for small businesses. It would lower the cost and allow them to invest and hire more. Paychex would benefit as our clients expand and add employees and potentially see value in our HCM services.  
While complex regulations tend to drive companies to an outsourcing solution, we believe any change in regulation is good for Paychex. We remain informed about what is happening in the regulatory environment and are well positioned to continue to educate our clients and assist them with their compliance needs through our technology and service support. 
Over the last year, the Affordable Care Act has been a tailwind for Paychex outsourcing companies, including ourselves. Any rollback of Obamacare or Affordable Care Act or a reduction in compliance and administration requirements will impact the HCM outsourcing industry. Given our target market of small to medium-sized businesses, a large portion of our client base is not -- has not impact -- been impacted by ACA. In November, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the Department of Labor's final Overtime Rule that would have become effective December 1. This rule would expand overtime for millions of workers. As a result of this injunction, employers did not have to be in compliance with the new rules as of December 1. The ruling is temporary but creates substantial uncertainty for businesses. The proposed rules created an enhanced awareness for the need for time and attendance solutions, particularly to those integrated within their -- with a clients' HCM product suite. This brought an increased demand for our products that we don't see diminishing with the delay in the rules. We will continue to monitor the status of these regulations and ensure our clients remain informed as to how any changes may affect them. 
Shifting the discussion from clients to shareholders. We continued with shareholder-friendly actions. During the second quarter we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166 million. And we will continue to maintain an industry-leading dividend yield of over 3% with a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share. 
In summary, we have made solid progress and growth in our financial performance during the past quarter, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employees and management team. And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"
295368,412267678,1104355,"Paychex, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","Paychex, Inc.","Executives","Good morning.

As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results fo",1523,"Good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. And as such, involve risk. Refer to the customary disclosures. 
As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the second quarter and the 6 months, provide greater detail on certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2017 outlook. 
Total service revenue grew 7% for the second quarter to $760 million and 8% for the 6 months to $1.5 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the 6 months to $11 million and $23 million, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. The growth was tempered by a slight decrease in the average investment balances by approximately 1% for both periods. This is really a timing issue that we call out in the press release. 
Expenses increased 8% for both the second quarter and 6 months, with Advance Partners contributing approximately 1.5% to this growth for both periods. Expense growth was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area. 
Selling expenses have shown modest growth, reflecting strong sales performance in the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin was approximately 40.3% for the second quarter and 40.7% year-to-date comparable with the prior year periods. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins while investing in our operations. 
Our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the second quarter and 34.1% for the 6 months, compared to 36% and 32.9% for the respective periods last year. As we discussed on our last quarterly call, we had several discrete items, tax items, in the first quarter of both years that have impacted the year-to-date effective income tax rates. In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation, which has resulted in discrete tax benefits now being recognized upon exercise or a lapse of stock-based awards. The impact with this in the second quarter was immaterial but had a larger impact in the first quarter. Last year, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produce. Because there have been ins and outs, refer to the press release and you'll see we provide a non-GAAP EBITDA comparison -- I should say, non-GAAP EPS comparison with and without these items. 
Net income increased 7% to $202 million for the second quarter and 5% to $420 million for the 6 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 5% to $1.16 per share for the 6 months. On a non-GAAP basis, as I mentioned just a second ago, adjusted net income increased 6% to $201 million for the second quarter and 7% to $405 million for the 6 months. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 8% to $1.12 per share for the 6 months. Note that these 2 non-GAAP measures exclude certain discrete tax items previously discussed. Refer to the table if you have any questions about that. 
Payroll service revenue increased 3% for the second quarter to $441 million and 4% to $892 million for the 6 months. Advance Partners contributed 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. We benefited from increases in client-based and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. 
Payroll client size impacted revenue as average client size trended modestly lower. We discussed that in the first quarter. We saw a continuation of that trend in the second quarter. 
While we continue to present payroll service revenue and HRS revenue, I want to emphasize one important point: With the evolving nature of our businesses to an HCM provider, we now offer more product bundles that are bundled with payroll. Revenue from these bundles is allocated among payroll and HRS. The payroll growth remains steady, but HRS growth reflects the sale of more services to clients and greater revenue per client. And I call out specifically that we had another strong quarter in time and attendance sales. 
HRS revenue increased 12% to $319 million for the second quarter, 14% to $642 million for the 6 months. This increase reflects continued growth across our client base and all HCM services, including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. 
Within Paychex HR Services, we've continued to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth and the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our ESR services as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers' comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds as well as an increase in the number of plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed a little bit less than 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for both the second quarter and the 6 months. 
Investments and income. Turning to our portfolio. Our goal is, as you know, to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles remain  bank demand deposit accounts and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit-quality municipal bonds, some corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Long-term portfolio has -- now has an average yield of 1.7% and average duration of 3.3 years. 
Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for the second quarter and 6 months, up from 1.1% last [indiscernible]. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year as the impact from growth in client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities. We expect that in the second half of the year, that will change and we'll -- we expect client base -- client growth -- client funds growth, I should say, sorry, to grow about 1%. 
I'll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $725 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.2 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely, as you know, and may average $3.7 billion for both the quarter and the 6 months. 
Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized losses of $16 million as of November 30 compared with a net unrealized gain of $48 million as of May 31. Recently, interest rates for intermediate term investors -- investments, I should say, have rallied resulting in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio. 
Total stockholder's equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, 2016, reflecting $331 million in dividends and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 40%. 
Cash flows from operations were $413 million for the first 6 months, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. This decrease was a result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and noncash adjustments. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We remind you that the outlook is based in our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. And what I mean by that is we do factor in the recent Fed rate raise, but we don't factor in any continuing raises beyond that. We'll update as we see those. We obviously expect that there will be some, but they're not baked into this guidance. 
Payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. We anticipate payroll revenue growth in the third quarter will be below the range of full year guidance. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we now expect that it will be approximately 2%. Remember that the third quarter is impacted by 1 less processing day. 
HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is anticipated to remain in the range of 7% to 8%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the upper single digits. The impact of the recent increase in short-term rates will be modest but would be more accretive as we enter into 2018. 
Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with the guidance previously provided. Effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis, net income growth is expected to be approximately 7%. We said that last quarter. Adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain discrete tax items, is anticipated to grow approximately 8%, consistent with the guidance that we gave in June. 
Turn it back to Marty."

We've been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our client base is up over last year, and we've said we'd be between 1% to 3%. Last year, we were 2%. We're in that range. So what accounts for the difference? It is accounted for by the fact that our client -- average client size is a little bit smaller. So to put this in context, if you go back 10 years, go back to 2007, our average client size is 17. But some years, it's 17.1. Last year we ended at 16.73. And at this point, we are trending slightly down from that number. And so that the effect of that mix is basically taking payroll service revenue down. This happens from time to time. It happens more when 2 things are present: The first is that we start to see a flattening in checks per payroll, which is what we've been seeing over the last 3 to 4 quarters. Actually, this quarter, our checks per payroll went negative. So what that means is that -- and by the way, that's on a same-store basis, so I want to clarify that. What that means is that, particularly our clients in the under 50 space, simply aren't adding a lot of employees at this stage. Will that continue? We'll see. It's been bouncing around quarter-to-quarter. And if you look at our index that we publish each month, you'll see that reflected in the numbers. But that's part a. And then part b is that as we sell clients that are a little bit lower than those that we lose, we have this drag effect. In most years, that basically is offset by some client checks per payroll growth. This is a year where we're not seeing that. So we're monitoring that and saw some of it in Q1, and we'll see if it continues into Q2. It can bounce around. I would just caution not to assume that that's exactly what you're going to see through the balance of the year. But we're assuming at this point some drag in checks per payroll as we go through the year."

And to get in and buy those services and therefore, it got you in the door a lot more for sales and that kind of ticked up the size of the average client because we sold a little bit more in the mid market. So it's an interesting time with the election to see how much the Affordable Care Act last year versus this year had an impact. And because we sold those clients pretty much who needed it. Now the retention has been very strong on that product even with the uncertainty. But that was higher last year. It got you in the door a lot more in the mid market because they were interested in not only the Affordable Care Act but how you integrated with the payroll services. And so that may have been an impact. And then as Efrain mentioned, on our Small Business Index, we've seen a flattening out of hiring in the small business sector, the under 50 employees sector, and for a couple of months now. And that could be around the election or not. So it's kind of an interesting quarter because of the election and the possible changes coming up as well."

So I'd say, let me just say broadly and then I'll come back to ACA and other regulatory changes. Marty, obviously, will have some thoughts on that. But our guidance contemplates all of those issues obviously. We just answered a question on payroll services, revenue growth. HRS has remained unchanged. So from that standpoint, we feel comfortable with where we are for the remainder of the year. And for the full year, we don't focus necessarily on quarters unless there's something unusual in the quarter that we want to call out like Q3, which has one less day. Feel comfortable about where we are in terms of margins and expenses. So that outlook that we're providing basically encompasses what we understand the environment to be. Don't anticipate it will change significantly. Now with respect to ACA and with respect to other changes in regulation, it's a little bit early to call those. The Overtime Rules change, at this point, don't see a lot of impact on the balance of the year. It could impact next year. And then on what exactly happens with ACA, that's a question to be answered at this point. What I would say is, if we were to see some sort of significant movement to repeal starting sometime in late spring, our anticipation of -- if that were to roll out over a, let's say, call it a 2- to 3-year period, is that we'd see about an impact of 1% on EPS per year. If it was more accelerated, it might be more. But we're still waiting -- that, by the way, is more of a worst-case scenario, 1% to 1.5% EPS. We think we have other options to replace that revenue. But at this point, we'd frame sort of the risk if the ACA got repealed in an orderly fashion. If it got replaced and repealed immediately, that would be a different conversation. We'll have to wait and see where we end up."

Of course, clients are looking for us to file in March now for them and I don't think you're going to see much movement, at least through that filing period. And I think it's going to be a longer thing, which as Efrain mentioned, we're looking at, depending on what happens, a number of products. My guess is clients are still going to have to do something, and they're going to need some support for that. So we feel pretty good that we will be able to adapt to that. Might not make up all the revenue, but it certainly has some opportunity there. From a time and attendance, it's been interesting that we've had very strong sales of our time and attendance solutions. And we've introduced a new one, that is Flex Essentials [ph]. That is a no-clock, all-web or mobile punch, much simpler to set up, and we've seen an acceleration there. So I think the whole Overtime Rule issue, even though it's now been delayed and may end up never being enacted, who knows, has driven a lot of interest in time and attendance. And so that's driven sales that I don't think somebody's going to necessarily get rid of that product. And in fact, it may keep kind of a heightened demand now.

The only other thing I would add to that is that because the PEO, we report healthcare attachment as part of the revenues of the PEO. When we get better healthcare attachment in the quarter, then you have better PEO growth. That really doesn't have much of an impact on the margins in this quarter. We did not have as significant healthcare attachments we had in the quarter before, but that bounces around every single quarter. So Q3, we'll see where we end up."

As Efrain said, the attachment of the health can swing from kind of quarter-to-quarter even month-to-month. But -- and again, I think it's going to be interesting to see kind of what comes out of it. Now you have a quarter where a lot of discussion about health care and you may have a number of clients deciding to kind of hold and wait and see what's going to happen. But we see good growth.

So I think it's a lot of optimism on pay lower corporate tax rates to drive a lot of less expense and more to what they could invest and more employees and so forth. Affordable Care Act looks like those costs could come down for a lot of companies and not forcing them to have the product but we'll see. Time and attendance rules, though it's a little bit separate, but less regulation. I think overall, it's a very optimistic attitude from the clients but not necessarily turning that into action yet because they got to see it. So they're feeling good about the fact that it looks like there's going to be a better business environment. Consumer confidence is also up. NIFB was one of the biggest increases we've seen in over the 42-year average, for the 1 of the 3 times I think in the last almost 10 years. So there's a lot of optimism but I don't think again they're turning that into action, hiring and so forth, at least yet until they see kind of what the first few months of the new administration brings. That's what -- we're kind of getting great optimism but the small business index, at least for November, our last one, would show still not a big uptick in hiring kind of at the same growth rate it was last year for at least small business. So very positive, but kind of waiting to see what happens."

Certainly feel good about, as I mentioned, the competitiveness. No change really in the competitive environment. And we're fully staffed and gaining more and more experience on the newer reps that we added at the beginning of the fiscal year. So we'll be able to talk more about it after the selling season. The only real difference from first quarter, I would say, is with the election, which really changed quite rapidly, at least a view of the election and who won, I think that just put people in a little bit more cautious period for switching anything or making buying decisions in the second quarter."

So that reprices immediately or very quickly, I shouldn't say -- should say. Let me just be careful, that's an overstatement. It doesn't reprice immediately, it typically reprices in somewhere between 45 and 60 days. So the answer to your first question, portfolio composition is yes, that's correct. And then the second is yes, also. Yes, the bonds that we would invest in going forward currently have yields that are significantly higher than the ones that are rolling off. So if I were to call it today and I am not doing that, but if I were to call it today, and I assume no more Fed increases other than what we have gotten at this point, the portfolio would be about $8 million higher in value than it is today. I'll just caution anyone from taking that to the bank because we'll have much more granular information once we get through the next couple of quarters and see what the fate -- what the Fed actually does. And the reason why I say that is we look at and we could give you a big forecast based on yield curves. I'm distrust [ph] that approach. I'd rather tell you what we think our portfolios will do based on what I know at the time I'm saying it. But you can do some math and the numbers start to get pretty significant if the Fed does what it says it's going to do.

So that's been helpful to get in front of clients and offer them. A great timing for us in the product suite that we have. So that drove a lot of interest and, frankly, still is, I think, it kind of geared up a lot of interest that whether the Overtime Rule is going to affect or not, I think it's going to be a plus for us. From -- when you start talking about Overtime Rules, that also drags in HR. So whether it was ASO or PEO, that brought a lot of interest in HR support. So companies that would have said, hey, going to continue  to try to deal with the HR myself internally, now said, jeez, I think with all these Overtime Rules, who's exempt, who isn't? A lot more discussion about moving people to exempt or not based on the Overtime Rules brought in some HR sales as well, both in the ASO and PEO platform. And then I think a little bit probably of a drag might have been the fact that, okay, now the Affordable Care Act, as we've said, is up in the air, but what's going to happen? Maybe I don't rush the buy as much from an insurance or a PEO side do I need it or not. So I think those were kind of the major changes. I think right now, what we expect is less regulation based on the platforms of the Trump administration. But I think there's still going to be enough change that those things will still help us. And in fact, just a level of change makes people worry about can they keep up with everything, if the tax rates change, if the rules change on maybe when to file, if overtime is in or out, then all drives people to say, I can't keep up with that, I'm going to turn it over to an outsourcer like Paychex who has over 200 people who just track compliance and realize what has to happen and so forth.

But a little bit tick up in the bankruptcies, which is interesting, it doesn't seem like that should happen. But we've seen a few more losses because of that, nothing that would change our overall number."

The other will be continue to be a mobile-first design and we're seeing a good uptick in mobile usage. As I mentioned before, not only decline. But from the employee standpoint. So we're spending a lot of time kind of adjusting our language in our display much more now, pretty much 99% -- over 99% of the display is HTML5. So it's a much cleaner and easier use for the client, much more flexible for the client and the employees on mobile use. But we've still got long ways to go on mobile adoption. So getting the client and our employees to download the app and use it. It is growing fast but we still got a long ways to go. And I think that's going to be a big part of assisting in the value of our products and services. The full suite is there and we're constantly adding to it, like affect the new Flex Essentials, Flex Time Essentials and you'll see a lot more paperless. So everything pretty much can be paperless today, right, even PEO onboarding now is all paperless function. So I think you'll continue to see us add to the functionality. And even in time and attendance, we are adding new modules all the time. So a budgeting module, we just where you'll be able to track your time to your budget and so forth. So you're going to continue to see, not only the products expand, but the modules within each kind of distinct products."

This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results",1179,"All right. Thank you and thank you for joining us on our discussion of Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. You can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations web page. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month. 
On today's call, I will update you on the results of our business in the second quarter, and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our full year guidance. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
Our results for the second quarter reflected good progress. We continue to see positive results across our major product lines. And service revenue for the second quarter grew by 7% year-over-year. We achieved a new milestone this quarter as we attained 1 million client worksite employees served by our Paychex HR Services. Paychex HR Services is our comprehensive outsourcing services product line, and that includes our ASO, or administrative services organization, and our PEO, or professional employer organization as well. Our cloud-based HCM services and, particularly, time and attendance, continued to show strong growth in the quarter. 
Tomorrow is the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance has been an excellent addition to the Paychex family. We're very pleased with the leadership and the team's contribution to our financial results and the future opportunities for growth we see in that business particularly timely as the staffing business is picking up some expanded growth today. 
With the success of our HCM solutions, we have continued to invest in operations personnel as we've expanded our multiproduct service centers, including our time and attendance support and our ACA product compliance and service teams. Client retention remains at consistent high levels. We have also invested in our service and our sales organization over the last year, adding headcount across all sales teams. And we are well-positioned going into our third quarter. We will have a better idea of overall sales performance and the impact of the fiscal year next quarter after the end of our peak sales season. 
We continue to make it a priority to provide robust HCM solutions that meet the evolving needs of our client base. At the recent HR Technology Conference and Exposition in October, we showcased enhancements to Paychex Flex that address 2 of the biggest trends in the HR industry: mobile user experience and the HR analytics. Attendees at the conference were able to view a demo of Paychex Flex which included these enhancements. 
We also announced that we shifted to a mobile-first design of our HCM suite. This approach allows Paychex Flex users to have full functionality of all application components regardless of device or screen size. The growing trend for both HR leaders and employees is the use of a mobile device. Shifting to a mobile-first design demonstrates our commitment to putting the needs of our clients and their employees first so that they can accomplish their HR tasks where they want, when they want and on whatever device they want. 
We continue to receive positive recognition of our Flex platform. In November, we were honored to be recognized as a leader in the 2016 NelsonHall Payroll Outsourcing NEAT, a component of the firm's speed-to source initiative. NEAT stands for NelsonHall's Evaluation and Assessment Tool, and is a vendor evaluation report tool that can be utilized by managers to evaluate outsourcing vendors. 
This was the first time we participated in this initiative, and we were placed in the Leader quadrant for 3 areas: technology and user experience, analytics and reporting, and HR cloud integration. The client feedback that goes into this ranking makes this honor even more important to us and reinforces our commitment to delivering the best and most robust solutions in the market today with our Paychex Flex platform. 
This has been a transition period in the U.S. with the presidential election and the move to the Trump administration. We have been asked a few times how we anticipate the new administration will impact the economy overall and, more specifically, the payroll and human capital management outsourcing industry. In this transition time, many business owners could be hesitant to make longer-term decisions. We see this as being more likely to impact the mid to large-sized businesses, rather than small businesses. President-elect Trump has indicated that he intends to lower taxes and create less regulation. This would be a positive for small businesses. It would lower the cost and allow them to invest and hire more. Paychex would benefit as our clients expand and add employees and potentially see value in our HCM services. 
While complex regulations tend to drive companies to an outsourcing solution, we believe any change in regulation is good for Paychex. We remain informed about what is happening in the regulatory environment and are well positioned to continue to educate our clients and assist them with their compliance needs through our technology and service support. 
Over the last year, the Affordable Care Act has been a tailwind for Paychex outsourcing companies, including ourselves. Any rollback of Obamacare or Affordable Care Act or a reduction in compliance and administration requirements will impact the HCM outsourcing industry. Given our target market of small to medium-sized businesses, a large portion of our client base is not -- has not impact -- been impacted by ACA. In November, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the Department of Labor's final Overtime Rule that would have become effective December 1. This rule would expand overtime for millions of workers. As a result of this injunction, employers did not have to be in compliance with the new rules as of December 1. The ruling is temporary but creates substantial uncertainty for businesses. The proposed rules created an enhanced awareness for the need for time and attendance solutions, particularly to those integrated within their -- with a clients' HCM product suite. This brought an increased demand for our products that we don't see diminishing with the delay in the rules. We will continue to monitor the status of these regulations and ensure our clients remain informed as to how any changes may affect them. 
Shifting the discussion from clients to shareholders. We continued with shareholder-friendly actions. During the second quarter we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166 million. And we will continue to maintain an industry-leading dividend yield of over 3% with a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share. 
In summary, we have made solid progress and growth in our financial performance during the past quarter, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employees and management team. And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

And as such, involve risk. Refer to the customary disclosures. 
As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the second quarter and the 6 months, provide greater detail on certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2017 outlook. 
Total service revenue grew 7% for the second quarter to $760 million and 8% for the 6 months to $1.5 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the 6 months to $11 million and $23 million, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. The growth was tempered by a slight decrease in the average investment balances by approximately 1% for both periods. This is really a timing issue that we call out in the press release. 
Expenses increased 8% for both the second quarter and 6 months, with Advance Partners contributing approximately 1.5% to this growth for both periods. Expense growth was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area. 
Selling expenses have shown modest growth, reflecting strong sales performance in the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin was approximately 40.3% for the second quarter and 40.7% year-to-date comparable with the prior year periods. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins while investing in our operations. 
Our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the second quarter and 34.1% for the 6 months, compared to 36% and 32.9% for the respective periods last year. As we discussed on our last quarterly call, we had several discrete items, tax items, in the first quarter of both years that have impacted the year-to-date effective income tax rates. In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation, which has resulted in discrete tax benefits now being recognized upon exercise or a lapse of stock-based awards. The impact with this in the second quarter was immaterial but had a larger impact in the first quarter. Last year, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produce. Because there have been ins and outs, refer to the press release and you'll see we provide a non-GAAP EBITDA comparison -- I should say, non-GAAP EPS comparison with and without these items. 
Net income increased 7% to $202 million for the second quarter and 5% to $420 million for the 6 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 5% to $1.16 per share for the 6 months. On a non-GAAP basis, as I mentioned just a second ago, adjusted net income increased 6% to $201 million for the second quarter and 7% to $405 million for the 6 months. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 8% to $1.12 per share for the 6 months. Note that these 2 non-GAAP measures exclude certain discrete tax items previously discussed. Refer to the table if you have any questions about that. 
Payroll service revenue increased 3% for the second quarter to $441 million and 4% to $892 million for the 6 months. Advance Partners contributed 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. We benefited from increases in client-based and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. 
Payroll client size impacted revenue as average client size trended modestly lower. We discussed that in the first quarter. We saw a continuation of that trend in the second quarter. 
While we continue to present payroll service revenue and HRS revenue, I want to emphasize one important point: With the evolving nature of our businesses to an HCM provider, we now offer more product bundles that are bundled with payroll. Revenue from these bundles is allocated among payroll and HRS. The payroll growth remains steady, but HRS growth reflects the sale of more services to clients and greater revenue per client. And I call out specifically that we had another strong quarter in time and attendance sales. 
HRS revenue increased 12% to $319 million for the second quarter, 14% to $642 million for the 6 months. This increase reflects continued growth across our client base and all HCM services, including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. 
Within Paychex HR Services, we've continued to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth and the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our ESR services as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers' comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds as well as an increase in the number of plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed a little bit less than 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for both the second quarter and the 6 months. 
Investments and income. Turning to our portfolio. Our goal is, as you know, to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles remain bank demand deposit accounts and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit-quality municipal bonds, some corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Long-term portfolio has -- now has an average yield of 1.7% and average duration of 3.3 years. 
Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for the second quarter and 6 months, up from 1.1% last year. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year as the impact from growth in client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities. We expect that in the second half of the year, that will change and we'll -- we expect client base -- client growth -- client funds growth, I should say, sorry, to grow about 1%. 
I'll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $725 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.2 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely, as you know, and may average $3.7 billion for both the quarter and the 6 months. 
Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized losses of $16 million as of November 30 compared with a net unrealized gain of $48 million as of May 31. Recently, interest rates for intermediate term investors -- investments, I should say, have rallied resulting in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio. 
Total stockholder's equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, 2016, reflecting $331 million in dividends and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 40%. 
Cash flows from operations were $413 million for the first 6 months, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. This decrease was a result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and noncash adjustments. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We remind you that the outlook is based in our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. And what I mean by that is we do factor in the recent Fed rate raise, but we don't factor in any continuing raises beyond that. We'll update as we see those. We obviously expect that there will be some, but they're not baked into this guidance. 
Payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. We anticipate payroll revenue growth in the third quarter will be below the range of full year guidance. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we now expect that it will be approximately 2%. Remember that the third quarter is impacted by 1 less processing day. 
HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is anticipated to remain in the range of 7% to 8%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the upper single digits. The impact of the recent increase in short-term rates will be modest but would be more accretive as we enter into 2018. 
Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with the guidance previously provided. Effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis, net income growth is expected to be approximately 7%. We said that last quarter. Adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain discrete tax items, is anticipated to grow approximately 8%, consistent with the guidance that we gave in June.

We've been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our client base is up over last year, and we've said we'd be between 1% to 3%. Last year, we were 2%. We're in that range. So what accounts for the difference? It is accounted for by the fact that our client -- average client size is a little bit smaller. So to put this in context, if you go back 10 years, go back to 2007, our average client size is 17. But some years, it's 17.1. Last year we ended at 16.73. And at this point, we are trending slightly down from that number. And so that the effect of that mix is basically taking payroll service revenue down. This happens from time to time. It happens more when 2 things are present: The first is that we start to see a flattening in checks per payroll, which is what we've been seeing over the last 3 to 4 quarters. Actually, this quarter, our checks per payroll went negative. So what that means is that -- and by the way, that's on a same-store basis, so I want to clarify that. What that means is that, particularly our clients in the under 50 space, simply aren't adding a lot of employees at this stage. Will that continue? We'll see. It's been bouncing around quarter-to-quarter. And if you look at our index that we publish each month, you'll see that reflected in the numbers. But that's part a. And then part b is that as we sell clients that are a little bit lower than those that we lose, we have this drag effect. In most years, that basically is offset by some client checks per payroll growth. This is a year where we're not seeing that. So we're monitoring that and saw some of it in Q1, and we'll see if it continues into Q2. It can bounce around. I would just caution not to assume that that's exactly what you're going to see through the balance of the year. But we're assuming at this point some drag in checks per payroll as we go through the year."

And to get in and buy those services and therefore, it got you in the door a lot more for sales and that kind of ticked up the size of the average client because we sold a little bit more in the mid market. So it's an interesting time with the election to see how much the Affordable Care Act last year versus this year had an impact. And because we sold those clients pretty much who needed it. Now the retention has been very strong on that product even with the uncertainty. But that was higher last year. It got you in the door a lot more in the mid market because they were interested in not only the Affordable Care Act but how you integrated with the payroll services. And so that may have been an impact. And then as Efrain mentioned, on our Small Business Index, we've seen a flattening out of hiring in the small business sector, the under 50 employees sector, and for a couple of months now. And that could be around the election or not. So it's kind of an interesting quarter because of the election and the possible changes coming up as well."

So I'd say, let me just say broadly and then I'll come back to ACA and other regulatory changes. Marty, obviously, will have some thoughts on that. But our guidance contemplates all of those issues obviously. We just answered a question on payroll services, revenue growth. HRS has remained unchanged. So from that standpoint, we feel comfortable with where we are for the remainder of the year. And for the full year, we don't focus necessarily on quarters unless there's something unusual in the quarter that we want to call out like Q3, which has one less day. Feel comfortable about where we are in terms of margins and expenses. So that outlook that we're providing basically encompasses what we understand the environment to be. Don't anticipate it will change significantly. Now with respect to ACA and with respect to other changes in regulation, it's a little bit early to call those. The Overtime Rules change, at this point, don't see a lot of impact on the balance of the year. It could impact next year. And then on what exactly happens with ACA, that's a question to be answered at this point. What I would say is, if we were to see some sort of significant movement to repeal starting sometime in late spring, our anticipation of -- if that were to roll out over a, let's say, call it a 2- to 3-year period, is that we'd see about an impact of 1% on EPS per year. If it was more accelerated, it might be more. But we're still waiting -- that, by the way, is more of a worst-case scenario, 1% to 1.5% EPS. We think we have other options to replace that revenue. But at this point, we'd frame sort of the risk if the ACA got repealed in an orderly fashion. If it got replaced and repealed immediately, that would be a different conversation. We'll have to wait and see where we end up."

Of course, clients are looking for us to file in March now for them and I don't think you're going to see much movement, at least through that filing period. And I think it's going to be a longer thing, which as Efrain mentioned, we're looking at, depending on what happens, a number of products. My guess is clients are still going to have to do something, and they're going to need some support for that. So we feel pretty good that we will be able to adapt to that. Might not make up all the revenue, but it certainly has some opportunity there. From a time and attendance, it's been interesting that we've had very strong sales of our time and attendance solutions. And we've introduced a new one, that is Flex Essentials [ph]. That is a no-clock, all-web or mobile punch, much simpler to set up, and we've seen an acceleration there. So I think the whole Overtime Rule issue, even though it's now been delayed and may end up never being enacted, who knows, has driven a lot of interest in time and attendance. And so that's driven sales that I don't think somebody's going to necessarily get rid of that product. And in fact, it may keep kind of a heightened demand now.

The only other thing I would add to that is that because the PEO -- we report health care attachment as part of the revenues of the PEO. When we get better health care attachment in the quarter, then you have better PEO growth. That really doesn't have much of an impact on margins in this quarter. We did not have as significant health care attachments we had in the quarter before, but that bounces around every single quarter. So Q3, we'll see where we end up."

As Efrain said, the attachment of the health can swing from kind of quarter-to-quarter even month-to-month. But -- and again, I think it's going to be interesting to see kind of what comes out of it. Now you had a quarter where a lot of discussion about health care and you may have a number of clients deciding to kind of hold and wait and see what's going to happen. But we see good growth.

And I think, as Efrain said, last year was kind of a heightened second quarter with the Affordable Care Act sales. And this year, it's almost a little bit of the reverse. I think people are being a little bit careful to make any changes until they see what the rules come out -- how it changes. And they're probably concerned about their filing and making a change and not getting everything filed. So we saw a little bit -- probably unexpected -- a little bit slower there, and we expect though -- once we get past the filing date, so expect a good selling season here. But it may still continue to be a little bit slow through the third quarter until we get past the filing date. We'll have to see kind of how that shakes out. But we feel certainly good about the product, the competitiveness and going head-to-head with any of the competitors in the market."

Time and attendance rules, although it's a little bit separate, but less regulation. I think overall, it's a very optimistic attitude from the clients, but not necessarily turning that into action yet because they got to see it. So they're feeling good about the fact that it looks like there's going to be a better business environment. Consumer confidence is also up. NFIB was one of the biggest increases we've seen in over the 42-year average for the -- 1 of the 3 times I think in the last almost 10 years. So there's a lot of optimism, but I don't think, again, they're turning that into action, hiring and so forth, at least yet until they see kind of what the first few months of the new administration brings. That's what -- we're kind of getting great optimism, but the small business index, at least for November, our last one, would show still not a big uptick in hiring, kind of at the same growth rate it was last year for at least small business.

So that reprices immediately or very quickly, I shouldn't say -- should say. Let me just be careful. That's an overstatement. It doesn't reprice immediately.

Yes, the bonds that we would invest in going forward currently have yields that are significantly higher than the ones that are rolling off. So if I were to call it today, and I am not doing that, but if I were to call it today, and I assume no more Fed increases other than what we have gotten at this point, the portfolio would be about $8 million higher in value than it is today. I'd just caution anyone from taking that to the bank because we'll have much more granular information once we get through the next couple of quarters and see what the fate -- what the Fed actually does. And the reason why I say that is, we look at and we could give you a big forecast based on yield curves. I'm -- distrust that approach. I'd rather tell you what we think our portfolios will do based on what I know at the time I'm saying it. But you can do some math, and the numbers start to get pretty significant if the Fed does what it says it's going to do. And the final qualification I'd add to that is the steepness of the yield curve also impacts how we invest.

The benefit we are getting right now, and I -- the reason why I caution about, including any interest rate benefit in models yet, is that the securities that we invest in intermediate term municipals have gone up pretty significantly since the elections.

So that's been helpful to get in front of clients and offer them -- a great timing for us in the product suite that we have. So that drove a lot of interest and frankly, still is. I think it kind of geared up a lot of interest that whether the overtime rule is going to affect or not, I think it's going to be a plus for us. From -- when you start talking about overtime rules, that also drags in HR. So whether it was ASO or PEO, that brought a lot of interest in HR support. So companies that would have said, ""Hey, I'm going to continue to try to deal with the HR myself internally,"" now said, ""Jeez, I think with all these overtime rules, who is exempt, who isn't?"" A lot more discussion about moving people to exempt or not based on the overtime rules brought in some HR sales as well, both in the ASO and PEO platform. And then I think a little bit probably of a drag might have been the fact that, ""Okay, now the Affordable Care Act, as we've said, is up in the air, but what's going to happen? Maybe I don't rush to buy as much from an insurance or a PEO side? Do I need it or not?"" So I think those were kind of the major changes. I think right now, what we expect is less regulation based on the platforms of the Trump administration. But I think there's still going to be enough change that those things will still help us. And in fact, just the level of change makes people worry about -- can they keep up with everything? If the tax rates change, if the rules change on maybe when to file, if overtime is in or out, that all drives people to say, ""Okay, I can't keep up with that. I'm going to turn it over to an outsourcer like Paychex who has over 200 people who just track compliance and realize what has to happen and so forth.""

But remember that expenses in Q3 and in Q4, but Q3 particularly, increased because of the volume of operations activity that we have and also the volume of sales activity that we have. So no, in the back half of the year, you see, if -- our financials, the margin actually goes down and that's typical of our pattern."

At least what we've seen -- what we see is from -- our loss is 2 bankruptcies and out of business, and that ticked up slightly.

The other will be continue to be a mobile-first design, and we're seeing a good uptick in mobile usage, as I have mentioned before, not only the client, but from the employee standpoint. So we're spending a lot of time kind of adjusting our language in our display much more now. Pretty much 99% -- over 99% of the display is HTML5, so it's a much cleaner and easier to use for the client, much more flexible for the client and the employees on mobile use. But we've still got long ways to go on mobile adoption. So getting the client and our employees to download the app and use it, it's growing fast, but we still got a long ways to go. And I think that's going to be a big part of assisting in the value of our products and services. The full suite is there and we're constantly adding to it, like the new Flex Essentials, Flex Time Essentials, and you'll see a lot more paperless. So everything pretty much can be paperless today, right? Even PEO onboarding now is all paperless function. So I think you'll continue to see us add to the functionality. And even in time and attendance, we're adding new modules all the time. So a budgeting module, we just added where you'll be able to track your time to your budget and so forth.

Thank you and thank you for joining us on our discussion of Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results",1179,"All right. Thank you and thank you for joining us on our discussion of Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. You can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations web page. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month. 
On today's call, I will update you on the results of our business in the second quarter, and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our full year guidance. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
Our results for the second quarter reflected good progress. We continue to see positive results across our major product lines. And service revenue for the second quarter grew by 7% year-over-year. We achieved a new milestone this quarter as we attained 1 million client worksite employees served by our Paychex HR Services. Paychex HR Services is our comprehensive outsourcing services product line, and that includes our ASO, or administrative services organization, and our PEO, or professional employer organization as well. Our cloud-based HCM services, in particular, time and attendance, continued to show strong growth in the quarter. 
Tomorrow is the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance has been an excellent addition to the Paychex family. We're very pleased with the leadership and the team's contribution to our financial results and the future opportunities for growth we see in that business, particularly timely as the staffing business is picking up some expanded growth today. 
With the success of our HCM solutions, we have continued to invest in operations personnel as we've expanded our multiproduct service centers, including our time and attendance support and our ACA product compliance and service teams. Client retention remains at consistent high levels. We have also invested in our service and our sales organization over the last year, adding headcount across all sales teams. And we are well-positioned going into our third quarter. We will have a better idea of overall sales performance and the impact of the fiscal year next quarter after the end of our peak sales season. 
We continue to make it a priority to provide robust HCM solutions that meet the evolving needs of our client base. At the recent HR Technology Conference and Exposition in October, we showcased enhancements to Paychex Flex that address 2 of the biggest trends in the HR industry: mobile user experience and the HR analytics. Attendees at the conference were able to view a demo of Paychex Flex which included these enhancements. 
We also announced that we shifted to a mobile-first design of our HCM suite. This approach allows Paychex Flex users to have full functionality of all application components regardless of device or screen size. The growing trend for both HR leaders and employees is the use of a mobile device. Shifting to a mobile-first design demonstrates our commitment to putting the needs of our clients and their employees first so that they can accomplish their HR tasks where they want, when they want and on whatever device they want. 
We continue to receive positive recognition of our Flex platform. In November, we were honored to be recognized as a leader in the 2016 NelsonHall Payroll Outsourcing NEAT, a component of the firm's speed-to source initiative. NEAT stands for NelsonHall's Evaluation and Assessment Tool, and is a vendor evaluation report tool that can be utilized by managers to evaluate outsourcing vendors. 
This was the first time we had participated in this initiative, and we were placed in the Leader quadrant for 3 areas: technology and user experience, analytics and reporting, and HR cloud integration. The client feedback that goes into this ranking makes this honor even more important to us and reinforces our commitment to delivering the best and most robust solutions in the market today with our Paychex Flex platform. 
This has been a transition period in the U.S. with the presidential election and the move to the Trump administration. We have been asked a few times how we anticipate the new administration will impact the economy overall and, more specifically, the payroll and human capital management outsourcing industry. In this transition time, many business owners could be hesitant to make longer-term decisions. We see this as being more likely to impact the mid to large-sized businesses, rather than small businesses. President-elect Trump has indicated that he intends to lower taxes and create less regulation. This would be a positive for small businesses. It would lower the cost and allow them to invest and hire more. Paychex would benefit as our clients expand and add employees and potentially see value in our HCM services. 
While complex regulations tend to drive companies to an outsourcing solution, we believe any change in regulation is good for Paychex. We remain informed about what is happening in the regulatory environment and are well positioned to continue to educate our clients and assist them with their compliance needs through our technology and service support. 
Over the last year, the Affordable Care Act has been a tailwind for payroll outsourcing companies, including ourselves. Any rollback of Obamacare or Affordable Care Act or reduction in compliance and administration requirements will impact the HCM outsourcing industry. Given our target market of small to medium-sized businesses, a large portion of our client base is not -- has not impact -- been impacted by ACA. In November, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the Department of Labor's final Overtime Rule that would have become effective December 1. This rule would expand overtime for millions of workers. As a result of this injunction, employers did not have to be in compliance with the new rules as of December 1. The ruling is temporary but creates substantial uncertainty for businesses. The proposed rules created an enhanced awareness for the need for time and attendance solutions, particularly to those integrated within their -- with the clients' HCM product suite. This brought an increased demand for our products that we don't see diminishing with the delay in the rules. We will continue to monitor the status of these regulations and ensure our clients remain informed as to how any changes may affect them. 
Shifting the discussion from clients to shareholders. We continued with shareholder-friendly actions. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166 million. And we will continue to maintain an industry-leading dividend yield of over 3% with a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share. 
In summary, we have made solid progress and growth in our financial performance during the past quarter, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employees and management team. And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

As Marty indicated, second quarter financial resul",1523,"Good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. And as such, involve risk. Refer to the customary disclosures. 
As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the second quarter and the 6 months, provide greater detail on certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2017 outlook. 
Total service revenue grew 7% for the second quarter to $760 million and 8% for the 6 months to $1.5 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the 6 months to $11 million and $23 million, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. The growth was tempered by a slight decrease in the average investment balances by approximately 1% for both periods. This is really a timing issue that we call out in the press release. 
Expenses increased 8% for both the second quarter and 6 months, with Advance Partners contributing approximately 1.5% to this growth for both periods. Expense growth was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area. 
Selling expenses have shown modest growth, reflecting strong sales performance in the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin was approximately 40.3% for the second quarter and 40.7% year-to-date comparable with the prior year periods. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins while investing in our operations. 
Our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the second quarter and 34.1% for the 6 months, compared to 36% and 32.9% for the respective periods last year. As we discussed on our last quarterly call, we had several discrete items, tax items, in the first quarter of both years that have impacted the year-to-date effective income tax rates. In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based composition, which has resulted in discrete tax benefits now being recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. The impact with this in the second quarter was immaterial but had a larger impact in the first quarter. Last year, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produce. Because there have been ins and outs, refer to the press release and you'll see we provide a non-GAAP EBITDA comparison -- I should say, non-GAAP EPS comparison with and without these items. 
Net income increased 7% to $202 million for the second quarter and 5% to $420 million for the 6 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 5% to $1.16 per share for the 6 months. On a non-GAAP basis, as I mentioned just a second ago, adjusted net income increased 6% to $201 million for the second quarter and 7% to $405 million for the 6 months. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 8% to $1.12 per share for the 6 months. Note that these 2 non-GAAP measures exclude certain discrete tax items previously discussed. Refer to the table if you have any questions about that. 
Payroll service revenue increased 3% for the second quarter to $441 million and 4% to $892 million for the 6 months. Advance Partners contributed 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. We benefited from increases in client-based and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. 
Payroll client size impacted revenue as average client size trended modestly lower. We discussed that in the first quarter. We saw a continuation of that trend in the second quarter. 
While we continue to present payroll service revenue and HRS revenue, I want to emphasize one important point: With the evolving nature of our businesses to an HCM provider, we now offer more product bundles that are bundled with payroll. Revenue from these bundles is allocated among payroll and HRS. The payroll growth remains steady, but HRS growth reflects the sale of more services to clients and greater revenue per client. And I call out specifically that we had another strong quarter in time and attendance sales. 
HRS revenue increased 12% to $319 million for the second quarter, 14% to $642 million for the 6 months. This increase reflects continued growth across our client base and all HCM services, including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. 
Within Paychex HR Services, we've continued to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth and the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our ESR services as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers' comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds as well as an increase in the number of plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed a little bit less than 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for both the second quarter and the 6 months. 
Investments and income. Turning to our portfolio. Our goal is, as you know, to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles remain bank demand deposit accounts and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit-quality municipal bonds, some corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Long-term portfolio has -- now has an average yield of 1.7% and average duration of 3.3 years. 
Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for the second quarter and 6 months, up from 1.1% last year. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year as the impact from growth in client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities. We expect that in the second half of the year, that will change and we'll -- we expect client base -- client growth -- client funds growth, I should say, sorry, to grow about 1%. 
I'll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $725 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.2 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely, as you know, and may average $3.7 billion for both the quarter and the 6 months. 
Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized losses of $16 million as of November 30 compared with a net unrealized gain of $48 million as of May 31. Recently, interest rates for intermediate term investors -- investments, I should say, have rallied, resulting in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio. 
Total stockholder's equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, 2016, reflecting $331 million in dividends and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 40%. 
Cash flows from operations were $413 million for the first 6 months, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. This decrease was a result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and noncash adjustments. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We remind you that the outlook is based in our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. And what I mean by that is we do factor in the recent Fed rate raise, but we don't factor in any continuing raises beyond that. We'll update as we see those. We obviously expect that there will be some, but they're not baked into this guidance. 
Payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. We anticipate payroll revenue growth in the third quarter will be below the range of full year guidance. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we now expect that it will be approximately 2%. Remember that the third quarter is impacted by 1 less processing day. 
HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is anticipated to remain in the range of 7% to 8%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the upper single digits. The impact of the recent increase in short-term rates will be modest but would be more accretive as we enter into 2018. 
Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with the guidance previously provided. Effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis, net income growth is expected to be approximately 7%. We said that last quarter. Adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain discrete tax items, is anticipated to grow approximately 8%, consistent with the guidance that we gave in June. 
Turn it back to Marty."

That's an area of continued -- always get questions on. I know you talked about there being some lift from pricing. If it is still in that historical 2% to 4% range, I guess that would imply that on an organic basis, that volumes in core payroll were kind of flat to down. Are we thinking about that right? Is 2% to 4% still the right range that you're seeing on price?"

This year, it's probably closer to the lower end. We've been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our clie",399,"Yes, so let me talk about that. So yes, it is 2% to 4%. This year, it's probably closer to the lower end. We've been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our client base is up over last year, and we've said we'd be between 1% to 3%. Last year, we were at 2%. We're in that range. So what accounts for the difference? It is accounted for by the fact that our client -- average client size is a little bit smaller. So to put this in context, if you go back 10 years, go back to 2007, our average client size is 17. But some years, it's 17.1. Last year we ended at 16.73. And at this point, we are trending slightly down from that number. And so that the effect of that mix is basically taking payroll service revenue down. This happens from time to time. It happens more when 2 things are present: The first is that we start to see a flattening in checks per payroll, which is what we've been seeing over the last 3 to 4 quarters. Actually, this quarter, our checks per payroll went negative. So what that means is that -- and by the way, that's on a same-store basis, so I want to clarify that. What that means is that, particularly our clients in the under-50 space simply aren't adding a lot of employees at this stage. Will that continue? We'll see. It's been bouncing around quarter-to-quarter. And if you look at our index that we publish each month, you'll see that reflected in the numbers. But that's part a. And then part b is that as we sell clients that are a little bit lower than those that we lose, we have this drag effect. In most years, that basically is offset by some client checks per payroll growth. This is a year where we're not seeing that. So we're monitoring that and saw some of it in Q1, and we'll see if it continues into Q2. It can bounce around. I would just caution not to assume that that's exactly what you're going to see through the balance of the year. But we're assuming at this point some drag in checks per payroll as we go through the year."

We're not -- when you look at last year, second quarter, there was kind of a push because of the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the mid-market clients. And to get in and buy those services and therefore, it got you in the door a lot more for sales and that kind of ticked up the size of the average client because we sold a little bit more in the mid-market. So it's an interesting time with the election to see how much the Affordable Care Act last year versus this year had an impact. And because we sold those clients pretty much who needed it. Now the retention has been very strong on that product even with the uncertainty. But that was higher last year. It got you in the door a lot more in the mid-market because they were interested in not only the Affordable Care Act but how you integrated with the payroll services. And so that may have been an impact. And then as Efrain mentioned, on our Small Business Index, we've seen a flattening out of hiring in the small business sector, the under-50 employees sector, and for a couple of months now. And that could be around the election or not. So it's kind of an interesting quarter because of the election and the possible changes coming up as well."

So I'd say, let me just say broadly and then I'll come back to ACA and other regulatory changes. Marty, obviously, will have some thoughts on that. But our guidance contemplates all of those issues obviously. We just answered a question on payroll services, revenue growth. HRS has remained unchanged. So from that standpoint, we feel comfortable with where we are for the remainder of the year. And for the full year, we don't focus necessarily on quarters unless there's something unusual in the quarter that we want to call out like Q3, which has one less day. Feel comfortable about where we are in terms of margins and expenses. So that outlook that we're providing basically encompasses what we understand the environment to be. Don't anticipate it will change significantly. Now with respect to ACA and with respect to other changes in regulation, it's a little bit early to call those. The Overtime Rules change, at this point, don't see a lot of impact on the balance of the year. It could impact next year. And then on what exactly happens with ACA, that's a question to be answered at this point. What I would say is, if we were to see some sort of significant movement to repeal starting sometime in late spring, our anticipation of -- if that were to roll out over a, let's say, call it a 2- to 3-year period, is that we'd see about an impact of 1% on EPS per year. If it was more accelerated, it might be more. But we're still waiting -- that, by the way, is more of a worst-case scenario, 1% to 1.5% EPS. We think we have other options to replace that revenue. But at this point, we'd frame sort of the risk if the ACA got repealed in an orderly fashion. If it got replaced and repealed immediately, that would be a different conversation. We'll have to wait and see where we end up."

Of course, clients are looking for us to file in March now for them and I don't think you're going to see much movement, at least through that filing period. And I think it's going to be a longer thing, which as Efrain mentioned, we're looking at, depending on what happens, a number of products. My guess is clients are still going to have to do something, and they're going to need some support for that. So we feel pretty good that we will be able to adapt to that. Might not make up all the revenue, but it certainly has some opportunity there. From a time and attendance, it's been interesting that we've had very strong sales of our time and attendance solutions. And we've introduced a new one, that is Flex Essentials. That is a no-clock, all-web or mobile punch, much simpler to set up, and we've seen an acceleration there. So I think the whole Overtime Rule issue, even though it's now been delayed and may end up never being enacted, who knows, has driven a lot of interest in time and attendance. And so that's driven sales that I don't think somebody's going to necessarily get rid of that product. And in fact, it may keep kind of a heightened demand now.

The only other thing I would add to that is that because the PEO -- we report health care attachment as part of the revenues of the PEO. When we get better health care attachment in the quarter, then you have better PEO growth. That really doesn't have much of an impact on margins in this quarter. We did not have as significant health care attachments we had in the quarter before, but that bounces around every single quarter. So Q3, we'll see where we end up."

As Efrain said, the attachment of the health can swing from kind of quarter-to-quarter or even month-to-month. But -- and again, I think it's going to be interesting to see kind of what comes out of it. Now you had a quarter where a lot of discussion about health care and you may have a number of clients deciding to kind of hold and wait and see what's going to happen. But we see good growth. We've been doing well in both PEO and ASO, well-positioned to have both products. So if you want co-employment, you have it. If you don't, we have the insurance agency that's a top agency and plenty of plans to offer. So feel good about both products right now."

Time and attendance rules, although it's a little bit separate, but less regulation. I think overall, it's a very optimistic attitude from the clients, but not necessarily turning that into action yet because they got to see it. So they're feeling good about the fact that it looks like there's going to be a better business environment. Consumer confidence is also up. NFIB was one of the biggest increases we've seen in over the 42-year average for the -- 1 of the 3 times I think in the last almost 10 years. So there's a lot of optimism, but I don't think, again, they're turning that into action, hiring and so forth, at least yet until they see kind of what the first few months of the new administration brings. That's what -- we're kind of getting great optimism, but the small business index, at least for November, our last one, would show still not a big uptick in hiring, kind of at the same growth rate it was last year for at least small business.

So that reprices immediately or very quickly, I shouldn't say -- should say. Let me just be careful. That's an overstatement. It doesn't reprice immediately. It typically reprices in somewhere between 45 to 60 days. So the answer to the first question, portfolio composition is, yes, that's correct. And then the second is, yes, also. Yes, the bonds that we would invest in going forward currently have yields that are significantly higher than the ones that are rolling off. So if I were to call it today, and I am not doing that, but if I were to call it today, and I assume no more Fed increases other than what we have gotten at this point, the portfolio would be about $8 million higher in value than it is today. I'd just caution anyone from taking that to the bank because we'll have much more granular information once we get through the next couple of quarters and see what the fate -- what the Fed actually does. And the reason why I say that is, we look at and we could give you a big forecast based on yield curves. I'm -- distrust that approach. I'd rather tell you what we think our portfolios will do based on what I know at the time I'm saying it. But you can do some math, and the numbers start to get pretty significant if the Fed does what it says it's going to do. And the final qualification I'd add to that is the steepness of a yield curve also impacts how we invest.

So our disclosure is that a 25-basis-point rise impacts the portfolio immediately on an annualized basis to the tune of about $3.5 million, $3.7 million, I believe it is. But that doesn't end the conversation. Because then the question you have to ask yourself is what does it do to long-term rates? If, in the end, your reinvestment for long-term rates stays the same, it's done nothing. You've gotten a benefit on the short-term portion of the portfolio but very little else. The benefit we are getting right now, and I -- the reason why I caution about including any interest rate benefit in models yet, is that the securities that we invest in intermediate term municipals have gone up pretty significantly since the elections. So our reinvestment rate is higher than it is right now. So if all we got was a 3.5-basis-point -- I'm sorry, a 25-basis-point increase in the Fed funds rate, you could expect that we've got roughly what we say we get. But we're also getting a bit of a benefit on the long-term portion of the portfolio. And what I don't know now and I'll have a better sense is as the Fed keeps raising interest rates, what's happening to the shape of that yield curve as I go out over the maturities that we have to reinvest. So right now, if everything held, I'd be about, on an annualized basis, about $8 million higher. What it will end up being, I don't know until I get to the spring and I can digest the other Fed rate increases."

I think, first, and I think I'd say overtime -- the overtime rules that have now, of course, been postponed, at least temporarily, that drove certainly a lot more interest from clients in time and attendance solution. So that's been helpful to",393,"Yes, sure. I think, first, and I think I'd say overtime -- the overtime rules that have now, of course, been postponed, at least temporarily, that drove certainly a lot more interest from clients in time and attendance solution. So that's been helpful to get in front of clients and offer them great timing for us in the product suite that we have. So that drove a lot of interest and frankly, still is. I think it kind of geared up a lot of interest that whether the overtime rules go into effect or not, I think it's going to be a plus for us. From -- when you start talking about overtime rules, that also drags in HR. So whether it was ASO or PEO, that brought a lot of interest in HR support. So companies that would have said, ""Hey, I'm going to continue to try to deal with the HR myself internally,"" now said, ""Jeez, I think with all these overtime rules, who is exempt, who isn't?"" A lot more discussion about moving people to exempt or not based on the overtime rules brought in some HR sales as well, both in the ASO and PEO platform. And then I think a little bit probably of a drag might have been the fact that, ""Okay, now the Affordable Care Act, as we've said, is up in the air, but what's going to happen? Maybe I don't rush to buy as much from an insurance or a PEO side? Do I need it or not?"" So I think those were kind of the major changes. I think right now, what we expect is less regulation based on the platforms of the Trump administration. But I think there's still going to be enough change that those things will still help us. And in fact, just the level of change makes people worry about -- can they keep up with everything? If the tax rates change, if the rules change on maybe when to file, if overtime is in or out, that all drives people to say, ""Okay, I can't keep up with that. I'm going to turn it over to an outsourcer like Paychex who has over 200 people who just track compliance and realize what has to happen and so forth."" So I think those have been the pluses and minuses."

The other will be continue to be a mobile-first design, and we're seeing a good uptick in mobile usage, as I have mentioned before, not only the client, but from the employee standpoint. So we're spending a lot of time kind of adjusting our language in our display much more now. Pretty much 99% -- over 99% of the display is HTML5, so it's a much cleaner and easier use for the client, much more flexible for the client and the employees on mobile use. But we've still got a long ways to go on mobile adoption. So getting the client and our employees to download the app and use it, it's growing fast, but we still got a long ways to go. And I think that's going to be a big part of assisting in the value of our products and services. The full suite is there and we're constantly adding to it, like the new Flex Essentials, Flex Time Essentials, and you'll see a lot more paperless.

Thank you and thank you for joining us on our discussion of Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results",1179,"All right. Thank you and thank you for joining us on our discussion of Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. You can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations web page. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month. 
On today's call, I will update you on the results of our business in the second quarter, and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our full year guidance. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
Our results for the second quarter reflected good progress. We continue to see positive results across our major product lines. And service revenue for the second quarter grew by 7% year-over-year. We achieved a new milestone this quarter as we attained 1 million client worksite employees served by our Paychex HR Services. Paychex HR Services is our comprehensive outsourcing services product line, and that includes our ASO, or administrative services organization, and our PEO, or professional employer organization as well. Our cloud-based HCM services, in particular, time and attendance, continued to show strong growth in the quarter. 
Tomorrow is the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance has been an excellent addition to the Paychex family. We're very pleased with the leadership and the team's contribution to our financial results and the future opportunities for growth we see in that business, particularly timely as the staffing business is picking up some expanded growth today. 
With the success of our HCM solutions, we have continued to invest in operations personnel as we've expanded our multiproduct service centers, including our time and attendance support and our ACA product compliance and service teams. Client retention remains at consistent high levels. We have also invested in our service and our sales organization over the last year, adding headcount across all sales teams. And we are well-positioned going into our third quarter. We will have a better idea of overall sales performance and the impact of the fiscal year next quarter after the end of our peak sales season. 
We continue to make it a priority to provide robust HCM solutions that meet the evolving needs of our client base. At the recent HR Technology Conference and Exposition in October, we showcased enhancements to Paychex Flex that address 2 of the biggest trends in the HR industry: mobile user experience and the HR analytics. Attendees at the conference were able to view a demo of Paychex Flex which included these enhancements. 
We also announced that we shifted to a mobile-first design of our HCM suite. This approach allows Paychex Flex users to have full functionality of all application components regardless of device or screen size. The growing trend for both HR leaders and employees is the use of a mobile device. Shifting to a mobile-first design demonstrates our commitment to putting the needs of our clients and their employees first so that they can accomplish their HR tasks where they want, when they want and on whatever device they want. 
We continue to receive positive recognition of our Flex platform. In November, we were honored to be recognized as a leader in the 2016 NelsonHall Payroll Outsourcing NEAT, a component of the firm's speed-to source initiative. NEAT stands for NelsonHall's Evaluation and Assessment Tool, and is a vendor evaluation report tool that can be utilized by managers to evaluate outsourcing vendors. 
This was the first time we had participated in this initiative, and we were placed in the Leader quadrant for 3 areas: technology and user experience, analytics and reporting, and HR cloud integration. The client feedback that goes into this ranking makes this honor even more important to us and reinforces our commitment to delivering the best and most robust solutions in the market today with our Paychex Flex platform. 
This has been a transition period in the U.S. with the presidential election and the move to the Trump administration. We have been asked a few times how we anticipate the new administration will impact the economy overall and, more specifically, the payroll and human capital management outsourcing industry. In this transition time, many business owners could be hesitant to make longer-term decisions. We see this as being more likely to impact the mid to large-sized businesses, rather than small businesses. President-elect Trump has indicated that he intends to lower taxes and create less regulation. This would be a positive for small businesses. It would lower the cost and allow them to invest and hire more. Paychex would benefit as our clients expand and add employees and potentially see value in our HCM services. 
While complex regulations tend to drive companies to an outsourcing solution, we believe any change in regulation is good for Paychex. We remain informed about what is happening in the regulatory environment and are well positioned to continue to educate our clients and assist them with their compliance needs through our technology and service support. 
Over the last year, the Affordable Care Act has been a tailwind for payroll outsourcing companies, including ourselves. Any rollback of Obamacare or Affordable Care Act or reduction in compliance and administration requirements will impact the HCM outsourcing industry. Given our target market of small to medium-sized businesses, a large portion of our client base is not -- has not impact -- been impacted by ACA. In November, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the Department of Labor's final Overtime Rule that would have become effective December 1. This rule would expand overtime for millions of workers. As a result of this injunction, employers did not have to be in compliance with the new rules as of December 1. The ruling is temporary but creates substantial uncertainty for businesses. The proposed rules created an enhanced awareness for the need for time and attendance solutions, particularly to those integrated within their -- with the clients' HCM product suite. This brought an increased demand for our products that we don't see diminishing with the delay in the rules. We will continue to monitor the status of these regulations and ensure our clients remain informed as to how any changes may affect them. 
Shifting the discussion from clients to shareholders. We continued with shareholder-friendly actions. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166 million. And we will continue to maintain an industry-leading dividend yield of over 3% with a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share. 
In summary, we have made solid progress and growth in our financial performance during the past quarter, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employees and management team. And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

As Marty indicated, second quarter financial resul",1523,"Good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. And as such, involve risk. Refer to the customary disclosures. 
As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the second quarter and the 6 months, provide greater detail on certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2017 outlook. 
Total service revenue grew 7% for the second quarter to $760 million and 8% for the 6 months to $1.5 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the 6 months to $11 million and $23 million, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. The growth was tempered by a slight decrease in the average investment balances by approximately 1% for both periods. This is really a timing issue that we call out in the press release. 
Expenses increased 8% for both the second quarter and 6 months, with Advance Partners contributing approximately 1.5% to this growth for both periods. Expense growth was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area. 
Selling expenses have shown modest growth, reflecting strong sales performance in the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin was approximately 40.3% for the second quarter and 40.7% year-to-date comparable with the prior year periods. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins while investing in our operations. 
Our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the second quarter and 34.1% for the 6 months, compared to 36% and 32.9% for the respective periods last year. As we discussed on our last quarterly call, we had several discrete items, tax items, in the first quarter of both years that have impacted the year-to-date effective income tax rates. In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based composition, which has resulted in discrete tax benefits now being recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. The impact with this in the second quarter was immaterial but had a larger impact in the first quarter. Last year, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produce. Because there have been ins and outs, refer to the press release and you'll see we provide a non-GAAP EBITDA comparison -- I should say, non-GAAP EPS comparison with and without these items. 
Net income increased 7% to $202 million for the second quarter and 5% to $420 million for the 6 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 5% to $1.16 per share for the 6 months. On a non-GAAP basis, as I mentioned just a second ago, adjusted net income increased 6% to $201 million for the second quarter and 7% to $405 million for the 6 months. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 8% to $1.12 per share for the 6 months. Note that these 2 non-GAAP measures exclude certain discrete tax items previously discussed. Refer to the table if you have any questions about that. 
Payroll service revenue increased 3% for the second quarter to $441 million and 4% to $892 million for the 6 months. Advance Partners contributed 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. We benefited from increases in client-based and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. 
Payroll client size impacted revenue as average client size trended modestly lower. We discussed that in the first quarter. We saw a continuation of that trend in the second quarter. 
While we continue to present payroll service revenue and HRS revenue, I want to emphasize one important point: With the evolving nature of our businesses to an HCM provider, we now offer more product bundles that are bundled with payroll. Revenue from these bundles is allocated among payroll and HRS. The payroll growth remains steady, but HRS growth reflects the sale of more services to clients and greater revenue per client. And I call out specifically that we had another strong quarter in time and attendance sales. 
HRS revenue increased 12% to $319 million for the second quarter, 14% to $642 million for the 6 months. This increase reflects continued growth across our client base and all HCM services, including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. 
Within Paychex HR Services, we've continued to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth and the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our ESR services as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers' comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds as well as an increase in the number of plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed a little bit less than 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for both the second quarter and the 6 months. 
Investments and income. Turning to our portfolio. Our goal is, as you know, to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles remain bank demand deposit accounts and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit-quality municipal bonds, some corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Long-term portfolio has -- now has an average yield of 1.7% and average duration of 3.3 years. 
Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for the second quarter and 6 months, up from 1.1% last year. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year as the impact from growth in client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities. We expect that in the second half of the year, that will change and we'll -- we expect client base -- client growth -- client funds growth, I should say, sorry, to grow about 1%. 
I'll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $725 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.2 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely, as you know, and may average $3.7 billion for both the quarter and the 6 months. 
Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized losses of $16 million as of November 30 compared with a net unrealized gain of $48 million as of May 31. Recently, interest rates for intermediate term investors -- investments, I should say, have rallied, resulting in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio. 
Total stockholder's equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, 2016, reflecting $331 million in dividends and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 40%. 
Cash flows from operations were $413 million for the first 6 months, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. This decrease was a result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and noncash adjustments. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We remind you that the outlook is based in our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. And what I mean by that is we do factor in the recent Fed rate raise, but we don't factor in any continuing raises beyond that. We'll update as we see those. We obviously expect that there will be some, but they're not baked into this guidance. 
Payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. We anticipate payroll revenue growth in the third quarter will be below the range of full year guidance. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we now expect that it will be approximately 2%. Remember that the third quarter is impacted by 1 less processing day. 
HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is anticipated to remain in the range of 7% to 8%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the upper single digits. The impact of the recent increase in short-term rates will be modest but would be more accretive as we enter into 2018. 
Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with the guidance previously provided. Effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis, net income growth is expected to be approximately 7%. We said that last quarter. Adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain discrete tax items, is anticipated to grow approximately 8%, consistent with the guidance that we gave in June. 
Turn it back to Marty."

That's an area of continued -- always get questions on. I know you talked about there being some lift from pricing. If it is still in that historical 2% to 4% range, I guess that would imply that on an organic basis, that volumes in core payroll were kind of flat to down. Are we thinking about that right? Is 2% to 4% still the right range that you're seeing on price?"

We've been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our client base is up over last year, and we've said we'd be between 1% to 3%. Last year, we were at 2%. We're in that range. So what accounts for the difference? It is accounted for by the fact that our client -- average client size is a little bit smaller. So to put this in context, if you go back 10 years, go back to 2007, our average client size is 17. But some years, it's 17.1. Last year we ended at 16.73. And at this point, we are trending slightly down from that number. And so that the effect of that mix is basically taking payroll service revenue down. This happens from time to time. It happens more when 2 things are present: The first is that we start to see a flattening in checks per payroll, which is what we've been seeing over the last 3 to 4 quarters. Actually, this quarter, our checks per payroll went negative. So what that means is that -- and by the way, that's on a same-store basis, so I want to clarify that. What that means is that, particularly our clients in the under-50 space simply aren't adding a lot of employees at this stage. Will that continue? We'll see. It's been bouncing around quarter-to-quarter. And if you look at our index that we publish each month, you'll see that reflected in the numbers. But that's part a. And then part b is that as we sell clients that are a little bit lower than those that we lose, we have this drag effect. In most years, that basically is offset by some client checks per payroll growth. This is a year where we're not seeing that. So we're monitoring that and saw some of it in Q1, and we'll see if it continues into Q2. It can bounce around. I would just caution not to assume that that's exactly what you're going to see through the balance of the year. But we're assuming at this point some drag in checks per payroll as we go through the year."

We're not -- when you look at last year, second quarter, there was kind of a push because of the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the mid-market clients. And to get in and buy those services and therefore, it got you in the door a lot more for sales and that kind of ticked up the size of the average client because we sold a little bit more in the mid-market. So it's an interesting time with the election to see how much the Affordable Care Act last year versus this year had an impact. And because we sold those clients pretty much who needed it. Now the retention has been very strong on that product even with the uncertainty. But that was higher last year. It got you in the door a lot more in the mid-market because they were interested in not only the Affordable Care Act but how you integrated with the payroll services. And so that may have been an impact. And then as Efrain mentioned, on our Small Business Index, we've seen a flattening out of hiring in the small business sector, the under-50 employees sector, and for a couple of months now. And that could be around the election or not. So it's kind of an interesting quarter because of the election and the possible changes coming up as well."

What I would say is, if we were to see some sort of significant movement to repeal starting sometime in late spring, our anticipation of -- if that were to roll out over a, let's say, call it a 2- to 3-year period, is that we'd see about an impact of 1% on EPS per year. If it was more accelerated, it might be more. But we're still waiting -- that, by the way, is more of a worst-case scenario, 1% to 1.5% EPS. We think we have other options to replace that revenue. But at this point, we'd frame sort of the risk if the ACA got repealed in an orderly fashion. If it got replaced and repealed immediately, that would be a different conversation. We'll have to wait and see where we end up."

It's pretty complicated, as you know, and -- to change it. So -- and we're seeing very solid retention. Of course, clients are looking for us to file in March now for them and I don't think you're going to see much movement, at least through that filing period. And I think it's going to be a longer thing, which as Efrain mentioned, we're looking at, depending on what happens, a number of products. My guess is clients are still going to have to do something, and they're going to need some support for that. So we feel pretty good that we will be able to adapt to that. Might not make up all the revenue, but it certainly has some opportunity there. From a time and attendance, it's been interesting that we've had very strong sales of our time and attendance solutions. And we've introduced a new one, that is Flex Essentials. That is a no-clock, all-web or mobile punch, much simpler to set up, and we've seen an acceleration there. So I think the whole Overtime Rule issue, even though it's now been delayed and may end up never being enacted, who knows, has driven a lot of interest in time and attendance. And so that's driven sales that I don't think somebody's going to necessarily get rid of that product. And in fact, it may keep kind of a heightened demand now. So I think that's how we feel about it, as pretty good at this point and see what happens next."

The only other thing I would add to that is that because the PEO -- we report health care attachment as part of the revenues of the PEO. When we get better health care attachment in the quarter, then you have better PEO growth. That really doesn't have much of an impact on margins in this quarter. We did not have as significant health care attachments we had in the quarter before, but that bounces around every single quarter. So Q3, we'll see where we end up."

But -- and again, I think it's going to be interesting to see kind of what comes out of it. Now you had a quarter where a lot of discussion about health care and you may have a number of clients deciding to kind of hold and wait and see what's going to happen. But we see good growth.

So they're feeling good about the fact that it looks like there's going to be a better business environment. Consumer confidence is also up. NFIB was one of the biggest increases we've seen in over the 42-year average for the -- 1 of the 3 times I think in the last almost 10 years. So there's a lot of optimism, but I don't think, again, they're turning that into action, hiring and so forth, at least yet until they see kind of what the first few months of the new administration brings.

Look at the options that are out there now from a technology standpoint, punching in and out on a mobile phone, things that have not been available, generally, until the last year or so.

So that reprices immediately or very quickly, I shouldn't say -- should say. Let me just be careful. That's an overstatement. It doesn't reprice immediately.

Yes, the bonds that we would invest in going forward currently have yields that are significantly higher than the ones that are rolling off. So if I were to call it today, and I am not doing that, but if I were to call it today, and I assume no more Fed increases other than what we have gotten at this point, the portfolio would be about $8 million higher in value than it is today. I'd just caution anyone from taking that to the bank because we'll have much more granular information once we get through the next couple of quarters and see what the fate -- what the Fed actually does. And the reason why I say that is, we look at and we could give you a big forecast based on yield curves. I'm -- distrust that approach. I'd rather tell you what we think our portfolios will do based on what I know at the time I'm saying it. But you can do some math, and the numbers start to get pretty significant if the Fed does what it says it's going to do.

So our disclosure is that a 25-basis-point rise impacts the portfolio immediately on an annualized basis to the tune of about $3.5 million, $3.7 million, I believe it is. But that doesn't end the conversation. Because then the question you have to ask yourself is what does it do to long-term rates? If, in the end, your reinvestment for long-term rates stays the same, it's done nothing. You've gotten a benefit on the short-term portion of the portfolio but very little else. The benefit we are getting right now, and I -- the reason why I caution about including any interest rate benefit in models yet, is that the securities that we invest in intermediate term municipals have gone up pretty significantly since the elections. So our reinvestment rate is higher than it is right now. So if all we got was a 3.5-basis-point -- I'm sorry, a 25-basis-point increase in the Fed funds rate, you could expect that we've got roughly what we say we get. But we're also getting a bit of a benefit on the long-term portion of the portfolio. And what I don't know now and I'll have a better sense is as the Fed keeps raising interest rates, what's happening to the shape of that yield curve as I go out over the maturities that we have to reinvest. So right now, if everything held, I'd be about, on an annualized basis, about $8 million higher. What it will end up being, I don't know until I get to the spring and I can digest the other Fed rate increases."

I think, first, and I think I'd say overtime -- the overtime rules that have now, of course, been postponed, at least temporarily, that drove certainly a lot more interest from clients in time and attendance solution. So that's been helpful to get in front of clients and offer them great timing for us in the product suite that we have. So that drove a lot of interest and frankly, still is. I think it kind of geared up a lot of interest that whether the overtime rules go into effect or not, I think it's going to be a plus for us. From -- when you start talking about overtime rules, that also drags in HR. So whether it was ASO or PEO, that brought a lot of interest in HR support. So companies that would have said, ""Hey, I'm going to continue to try to deal with the HR myself internally,"" now said, ""Jeez, I think with all these overtime rules, who is exempt, who isn't?"" A lot more discussion about moving people to exempt or not based on the overtime rules brought in some HR sales as well, both in the ASO and PEO platform. And then I think a little bit probably of a drag might have been the fact that, ""Okay, now the Affordable Care Act, as we've said, is up in the air, but what's going to happen? Maybe I don't rush to buy as much from an insurance or a PEO side? Do I need it or not?"" So I think those were kind of the major changes. I think right now, what we expect is less regulation based on the platforms of the Trump administration. But I think there's still going to be enough change that those things will still help us. And in fact, just the level of change makes people worry about -- can they keep up with everything? If the tax rates change, if the rules change on maybe when to file, if overtime is in or out, that all drives people to say, ""Okay, I can't keep up with that. I'm going to turn it over to an outsourcer like Paychex who has over 200 people who just track compliance and realize what has to happen and so forth."" So I think those have been the pluses and minuses."

Thank you and thank you for joining us on our discussion of Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. You can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations web page. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month. 
On today's call, I will update you on the results of our business in the second quarter, and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our full year guidance. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
Our results for the second quarter reflected good progress. We continue to see positive results across our major product lines. And service revenue for the second quarter grew by 7% year-over-year. We achieved a new milestone this quarter as we attained 1 million client worksite employees served by our Paychex HR Services. Paychex HR Services is our comprehensive outsourcing services product line, and that includes our ASO, or administrative services organization, and our PEO, or professional employer organization as well. Our cloud-based HCM services, in particular, time and attendance, continued to show strong growth in the quarter. 
Tomorrow is the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance has been an excellent addition to the Paychex family. We're very pleased with the leadership and the team's contribution to our financial results and the future opportunities for growth we see in that business, particularly timely as the staffing business is picking up some expanded growth today. 
With the success of our HCM solutions, we have continued to invest in operations personnel as we've expanded our multiproduct service centers, including our time and attendance support and our ACA product compliance and service teams. Client retention remains at consistent high levels. We have also invested in our service and our sales organization over the last year, adding headcount across all sales teams. And we are well-positioned going into our third quarter. We will have a better idea of overall sales performance and the impact of the fiscal year next quarter after the end of our peak sales season. 
We continue to make it a priority to provide robust HCM solutions that meet the evolving needs of our client base. At the recent HR Technology Conference and Exposition in October, we showcased enhancements to Paychex Flex that address 2 of the biggest trends in the HR industry: mobile user experience and the HR analytics. Attendees at the conference were able to view a demo of Paychex Flex which included these enhancements. 
We also announced that we shifted to a mobile-first design of our HCM suite. This approach allows Paychex Flex users to have full functionality of all application components regardless of device or screen size. The growing trend for both HR leaders and employees is the use of a mobile device. Shifting to a mobile-first design demonstrates our commitment to putting the needs of our clients and their employees first so that they can accomplish their HR tasks where they want, when they want and on whatever device they want. 
We continue to receive positive recognition of our Flex platform. In November, we were honored to be recognized as a leader in the 2016 NelsonHall Payroll Outsourcing NEAT, a component of the firm's speed-to source initiative. NEAT stands for NelsonHall's Evaluation and Assessment Tool, and is a vendor evaluation report tool that can be utilized by managers to evaluate outsourcing vendors. 
This was the first time we had participated in this initiative, and we were placed in the Leader quadrant for 3 areas: technology and user experience, analytics and reporting, and HR cloud integration. The client feedback that goes into this ranking makes our center even more important to us and reinforces our commitment to delivering the best and most robust solutions in the market today with our Paychex Flex platform. 
This has been a transition period in the U.S. with the presidential election and the move to the Trump administration. We have been asked a few times how we anticipate the new administration will impact the economy overall and, more specifically, the payroll and human capital management outsourcing industry. In this transition time, many business owners could be hesitant to make longer-term decisions. We see this as being more likely to impact the mid to large-sized businesses, rather than small businesses. President-elect Trump has indicated that he intends to lower taxes and create less regulation. This would be a positive for small businesses. It would lower the cost and allow them to invest and hire more. Paychex would benefit as our clients expand and add employees and potentially see value in our HCM services. 
While complex regulations tend to drive companies to an outsourcing solution, we believe any change in regulation is good for Paychex. We remain informed about what is happening in the regulatory environment and are well positioned to continue to educate our clients and assist them with their compliance needs through our technology and service support. 
Over the last year, the Affordable Care Act has been a tailwind for payroll outsourcing companies, including ourselves. Any rollback of Obamacare or Affordable Care Act or reduction in compliance and administration requirements will impact the HCM outsourcing industry. Given our target market of small to medium-sized businesses, a large portion of our client base is not -- has not impact -- been impacted by ACA. In November, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the Department of Labor's final Overtime Rule that would have become effective December 1. This rule would expand overtime for millions of workers. As a result of this injunction, employers did not have to be in compliance with the new rules as of December 1. The ruling is temporary but creates substantial uncertainty for businesses. The proposed rules created an enhanced awareness for the need for time and attendance solutions, particularly to those integrated within their -- with the clients' HCM product suite. This brought an increased demand for our products that we don't see diminishing with the delay in the rules. We will continue to monitor the status of these regulations and ensure our clients remain informed as to how any changes may affect them. 
Shifting the discussion from clients to shareholders. We continued with shareholder-friendly actions. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166 million. And we will continue to maintain an industry-leading dividend yield of over 3% with a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share. 
In summary, we have made solid progress and growth in our financial performance during the past quarter, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employees and management team. And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?"

I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. And as such, involve risk. Refer to the customary disclosures. As Marty indicated, second quarter financial resul",1523,"Good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. And as such, involve risk. Refer to the customary disclosures. 
As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the second quarter and the 6 months, provide greater detail on certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2017 outlook. 
Total service revenue grew 7% for the second quarter to $760 million and 8% for the 6 months to $1.5 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the 6 months to $11 million and $23 million, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. The growth was tempered by a slight decrease in the average investment balances by approximately 1% for both periods. This is really a timing issue that we call out in the press release. 
Expenses increased 8% for both the second quarter and 6 months, with Advance Partners contributing approximately 1.5% to this growth for both periods. Expense growth was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area. 
Selling expenses have shown modest growth, reflecting strong sales performance in the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin was approximately 40.3% for the second quarter and 40.7% year-to-date comparable with the prior year periods. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins while investing in our operations. 
Our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the second quarter and 34.1% for the 6 months, compared to 36% and 32.9% for the respective periods last year. As we discussed on our last quarterly call, we had several discrete items, tax items, in the first quarter of both years that have impacted the year-to-date effective income tax rates. In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation, which has resulted in discrete tax benefits now being recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. The impact with this in the second quarter was immaterial but had a larger impact in the first quarter. Last year, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produce. Because there have been ins and outs, refer to the press release and you'll see we provide a non-GAAP EBITDA comparison -- I should say, non-GAAP EPS comparison with and without these items. 
Net income increased 7% to $202 million for the second quarter and 5% to $420 million for the 6 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 5% to $1.16 per share for the 6 months. On a non-GAAP basis, as I mentioned just a second ago, adjusted net income increased 6% to $201 million for the second quarter and 7% to $405 million for the 6 months. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 8% to $1.12 per share for the 6 months. Note that these 2 non-GAAP measures exclude certain discrete tax items previously discussed. Refer to the table if you have any questions about that. 
Payroll service revenue increased 3% for the second quarter to $441 million and 4% to $892 million for the 6 months. Advance Partners contributed 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. We benefited from increases in client-based and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. 
Payroll client size impacted revenue as average client size trended modestly lower. We discussed that in the first quarter. We saw a continuation of that trend in the second quarter. 
While we continue to present payroll service revenue and HRS revenue, I want to emphasize one important point: With the evolving nature of our businesses to an HCM provider, we now offer more product bundles that are bundled with payroll. Revenue from these bundles is allocated among payroll and HRS. The payroll growth remains steady, but HRS growth reflects the sale of more services to clients and greater revenue per client. And I call out specifically that we had another strong quarter in time and attendance sales. 
HRS revenue increased 12% to $319 million for the second quarter, 14% to $642 million for the 6 months. This increase reflects continued growth across our client base and all HCM services, including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. 
Within Paychex HR Services, we've continued to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth and the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our ESR services as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers' comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds as well as an increase in the number of plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed a little bit less than 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for both the second quarter and the 6 months. 
Investments and income. Turning to our portfolio. Our goal is, as you know, to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles remain bank demand deposit accounts and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit-quality municipal bonds, some corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Long-term portfolio has -- now has an average yield of 1.7% and average duration of 3.3 years. 
Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for the second quarter and 6 months, up from 1.1% last year. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year as the impact from growth in client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities. We expect that in the second half of the year, that will change and we'll -- we expect client base -- client growth -- client funds growth, I should say, sorry, to grow about 1%. 
I'll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $725 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.2 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely, as you know, and may average $3.7 billion for both the quarter and the 6 months. 
Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized losses of $16 million as of November 30 compared with a net unrealized gain of $48 million as of May 31. Recently, interest rates for intermediate term investors -- investments, I should say, have rallied, resulting in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio. 
Total stockholder's equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, 2016, reflecting $331 million in dividends and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 40%. 
Cash flows from operations were $413 million for the first 6 months, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. This decrease was a result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and noncash adjustments. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We remind you that the outlook is based in our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. And what I mean by that is we do factor in the recent Fed rate raise, but we don't factor in any continuing raises beyond that. We'll update as we see those. We obviously expect that there will be some, but they're not baked into this guidance. 
Payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. We anticipate payroll revenue growth in the third quarter will be below the range of full year guidance. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we now expect that it will be approximately 2%. Remember that the third quarter is impacted by 1 less processing day. 
HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is anticipated to remain in the range of 7% to 8%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the upper single digits. The impact of the recent increase in short-term rates will be modest but would be more accretive as we enter into 2018. 
Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with the guidance previously provided. Effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis, net income growth is expected to be approximately 7%. We said that last quarter. Adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain discrete tax items, is anticipated to grow approximately 8%, consistent with the guidance that we gave in June. 
Turn it back to Marty."

If it is still in that historical 2% to 4% range, I guess that would imply that on an organic basis, that volumes in core payroll were kind of flat to down. Are we thinking about that right?

So our clie",399,"Yes, so let me talk about that. So yes, it is 2% to 4%. This year, it's probably closer to the lower end. We've been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our client base is up over last year, and we've said we'd be between 1% to 3%. Last year, we were at 2%. We're in that range. So what accounts for the difference? It is accounted for by the fact that our client -- average client size is a little bit smaller. So to put this in context, if you go back 10 years, go back to 2007, our average client size is 17. But some years, it's 17.1. Last year we ended at 16.73. And at this point, we are trending slightly down from that number. And so that the effect of that mix is basically taking payroll service revenue down. This happens from time to time. It happens more when 2 things are present: The first is that we start to see a flattening in checks per payroll, which is what we've been seeing over the last 3 to 4 quarters. Actually, this quarter, our checks per payroll went negative. So what that means is that -- and by the way, that's on a same-store basis, so I want to clarify that. What that means is that, particularly our clients in the under-50 space simply aren't adding a lot of employees at this stage. Will that continue? We'll see. It's been bouncing around quarter-to-quarter. And if you look at our index that we publish each month, you'll see that reflected in the numbers. But that's part a. And then part b is that as we sell clients that are a little bit lower than those that we lose, we have this drag effect. In most years, that basically is offset by some client checks per payroll growth. This is a year where we're not seeing that. So we're monitoring that and saw some of it in Q1, and we'll see if it continues into Q2. It can bounce around. I would just caution not to assume that that's exactly what you're going to see through the balance of the year. But we're assuming at this point some drag in checks per payroll as we go through the year."

We're not -- when you look at last year, second quarter, there was kind of a push because of the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the mid-market clients. And to get in and buy those services and therefore, it got you in the door a lot more for sales and that kind of ticked up the size of the average client because we sold a little bit more in the mid-market. So it's an interesting time with the election to see how much the Affordable Care Act last year versus this year had an impact. And because we sold those clients pretty much who needed it. Now the retention has been very strong on that product even with the uncertainty. But that was higher last year. It got you in the door a lot more in the mid-market because they were interested in not only the Affordable Care Act but how you integrated with the payroll services. And so that may have been an impact. And then as Efrain mentioned, on our Small Business Index, we've seen a flattening out of hiring in the small business sector, the under-50 employees sector, and for a couple of months now.

So I'd say, let me just say broadly and then I'll come back to ACA and other regulatory changes. Marty, obviously, will have some thoughts on that. But our guidance contemplates all of those issues obviously. We just answered a question on payroll services, revenue growth. HRS has remained unchanged. So from that standpoint, we feel comfortable with where we are for the remainder of the year. And for the full year, we don't focus necessarily on quarters unless there's something unusual in the quarter that we want to call out like Q3, which has one less day. Feel comfortable about where we are in terms of margins and expenses. So that outlook that we're providing basically encompasses what we understand the environment to be. Don't anticipate it will change significantly. Now with respect to ACA and with respect to other changes in regulation, it's a little bit early to call those. The Overtime Rules change, at this point, don't see a lot of impact on the balance of the year. It could impact next year. And then on what exactly happens with ACA, that's a question to be answered at this point. What I would say is, if we were to see some sort of significant movement to repeal starting sometime in late spring, our anticipation of -- if that were to roll out over a, let's say, call it a 2- to 3-year period, is that we'd see about an impact of 1% on EPS per year. If it was more accelerated, it might be more. But we're still waiting -- that, by the way, is more of a worst-case scenario, 1% to 1.5% EPS. We think we have other options to replace that revenue. But at this point, we'd frame sort of the risk if the ACA got repealed in an orderly fashion. If it got replaced and repealed immediately, that would be a different conversation. We'll have to wait and see where we end up."

My guess is clients are still going to have to do something, and they're going to need some support for that. So we feel pretty good that we will be able to adapt to that. Might not make up all the revenue, but it certainly has some opportunity there. From a time and attendance, it's been interesting that we've had very strong sales of our time and attendance solutions. And we've introduced a new one, that is Flex Essentials. That is a no-clock, all-web or mobile punch, much simpler to set up, and we've seen an acceleration there. So I think the whole Overtime Rule issue, even though it's now been delayed and may end up never being enacted, who knows, has driven a lot of interest in time and attendance. And so that's driven sales that I don't think somebody's going to necessarily get rid of that product. And in fact, it may keep kind of a heightened demand now.

The only other thing I would add to that is that because the PEO -- we report health care attachment as part of the revenues of the PEO. When we get better health care attachment in the quarter, then you have better PEO growth. That really doesn't have much of an impact on margins in this quarter. We did not have as significant health care attachments we had in the quarter before, but that bounces around every single quarter. So Q3, we'll see where we end up."

So they're feeling good about the fact that it looks like there's going to be a better business environment. Consumer confidence is also up. NFIB was one of the biggest increases we've seen in over the 42-year average for the -- 1 of the 3 times I think in the last almost 10 years.

Yes, the bonds that we would invest in going forward currently have yields that are significantly higher than the ones that are rolling off.

I'd rather tell you what we think our portfolios will do based on what I know at the time I'm saying it.

But that doesn't end the conversation. Because then the question you have to ask yourself is what does it do to long-term rates? If, in the end, your reinvestment for long-term rates stays the same, it's done nothing. You've gotten a benefit on the short-term portion of the portfolio but very little else. The benefit we are getting right now, and I -- the reason why I caution about including any interest rate benefit in models yet, is that the securities that we invest in intermediate term municipals have gone up pretty significantly since the elections. So our reinvestment rate is higher than it is right now. So if all we got was a 3.5-basis-point -- I'm sorry, a 25-basis-point increase in the Fed funds rate, you could expect that we've got roughly what we say we get. But we're also getting a bit of a benefit on the long-term portion of the portfolio. And what I don't know now and I'll have a better sense is as the Fed keeps raising interest rates, what's happening to the shape of that yield curve as I go out over the maturities that we have to reinvest.

So that's been helpful to get in front of clients and offer them great timing for us in the product suite that we have. So that drove a lot of interest and frankly, still is. I think it kind of geared up a lot of interest that whether the overtime rules go into effect or not, I think it's going to be a plus for us. From -- when you start talking about overtime rules, that also drags in HR. So whether it was ASO or PEO, that brought a lot of interest in HR support. So companies that would have said, ""Hey, I'm going to continue to try to deal with the HR myself internally,"" now said, ""Jeez, I think with all these overtime rules, who is exempt, who isn't?"" A lot more discussion about moving people to exempt or not based on the overtime rules brought in some HR sales as well, both in the ASO and PEO platform. And then I think a little bit probably of a drag might have been the fact that, ""Okay, now the Affordable Care Act, as we've said, is up in the air, but what's going to happen? Maybe I don't rush to buy as much from an insurance or a PEO side? Do I need it or not?"" So I think those were kind of the major changes. I think right now, what we expect is less regulation based on the platforms of the Trump administration. But I think there's still going to be enough change that those things will still help us. And in fact, just the level of change makes people worry about -- can they keep up with everything? If the tax rates change, if the rules change on maybe when to file, if overtime is in or out, that all drives people to say, ""Okay, I can't keep up with that. I'm going to turn it over to an outsourcer like Paychex who has over 200 people who just track compliance and realize what has to happen and so forth."" So I think those have been the pluses and minuses."
