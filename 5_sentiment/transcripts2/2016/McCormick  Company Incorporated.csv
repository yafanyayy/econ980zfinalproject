Another leadership news effective January 1. Malcolm Swift was named President, Global Industrial Segment and McCormick International, adding responsibility for China to his role. Brendan Foley assumed responsibility for the strategic leadership of our Consumer Business for me and was named President, Global Consumer Segment and North America. In these roles reporting to me, Brendan and Malcolm will set the strategic and operational goal for our consumer and industrial businesses respectively as well as the performance of the segment leaders in each geographic regions against these goals.  In addition, Brendan will have geography responsibility for our North American market and Malcolm for our international markets. 
Let's move next to fourth quarter performance. Financial results for this quarter demonstrated the consumer demand for flavor is strong and on the rise, and that McCormick has the strategies and the team to drive growth. We have great performance across both segments, and we're particularly pleased with the progress in our U.S. consumer business. The actions we have underway in 2014 and 2015 have led to improved results and we have good momentum heading into 2016. 
For the total company, we reported 2% sales growth. In constant currency, we grew sales 8% with higher volume and product mix in our base business contributing half of this increase. We grew consumer segment sales 6% in constant currency, and about half of the increase from our base business and half from our acquisitions of Drogheria & Alimentari and Stubb's. 
In the Americas, the constant currency sales increase was 3%, with Stubb's adding about 1/3 of this growth. We're pleased with our results in this period and our further improvement in our U.S. business. 
In this market, year-on-year category growth for spices and seasoning remains robust at 5% in the quarter. At 4%, retail takeaway for the McCormick brand was close to the category increase. 
As seen on slide 7, we have achieved a sequential increase from 2% growth in the third quarter and 1% in the second quarter. 
We have a number of initiatives driving this performance. We launched our digital purity campaign this quarter with the message, ""Pure tastes better,"" to emphasize to consumers the quality of our products, and we continue to help consumers prepare flavorful, healthy meals at www.mccormick.com, which is now one of the top 50 most visited food and lifestyle sites. Across all of our U.S. websites, we attracted a record 32 million visitors in 2015, up 19% from 2014. 
Within the spice and seasoning categories, our premium Gourmet line, our 2015 relaunch of this line has been a real success. Since the rollout of the packaging innovation and new varieties, retail sales are applied for set. And armed with greater category analytics and insights, we had workshop discussions with our top customers for ways to optimize product assortment, pricing and promotion for the spice and seasoning category. Our customers that have already taken actions based on these discussions, we grew our category share 60 basis points on average during the fourth quarter. Some of these customers, category unit volume was up more than 5%. These are great results for our spices and seasoning business. Our investment in brand equity building, strong innovation and this customer interaction with more robust tool is the way forward for us. As we move into 2016, this work transitions from being a turnaround effort to our everyday approach in building value for our customers and for McCormick. 
As for our next largest U.S. category, recipe mixes, November 2015 capped off 26 consecutive months of share gains in this category. We are driving these gains with brand equity building and product innovation with gluten-free items, Skillet Sauces and slow cooker sauces. Through these efforts, our branded sales accounted for more than 100% of the category growth in both 2014 and 2015. 
Our consumer business team in Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, continues to post impressive results led by new distribution in Poland. France also contributed to this increase with higher advertising, including new product support. In 2015, we launched the distinctive line of origin specific to co-brand black pepper. That was just named new product of the year by the French Product Society. In constant currency, we grew sales in China 5% in the fourth quarter with some impact from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotions in the first quarter of 2016. For the fiscal year, we grew China consumer sales 12% in constant currency. With nearly 2 months complete, our China consumer business is off to a strong start. And for the fiscal year, we expect to achieve constant currency sales growth in the high single digit to the low double-digit range. We see opportunities for further growth of our consumer business in China, especially with the cross-selling of McCormick brand and WABC products. 
While we are certainly cautious given the current economic environment, keep in mind that our products are stable in Chinese cooking, and McCormick has a good penetration in traditional markets and other channel, with modern trade accounted for about 20% of consumer sales in this market. 
Turning to the industrial segment. Our sales growth was particularly strong in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period, up 11% in constant currency. This increase was broad based with double-digit growth in each of our 3 regions. While the addition of Brand Aromatics contributed to this increase, with exceptional growth in our base business with sales up 9%. Leading our industrial performance again this quarter with constant currency sales up 14% was our team in EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is for quick service restaurants through product expansion, distribution gains and their geographic expansion. 
In the Americas region, a double-digit constant currency sales increase included 7% added by our base business. In the U.S, our branded food-service business had a good quarter and sales to quick service restaurants showed some improvement from prior periods. It is nearly 1 year since we acquired Brand Aromatics and we're pleased with the early results from this business. Mexico also contributed to the increase in this region with higher sales of snack seasonings. In Australia, we grew sales of new industrial products of the ship from this region mainly to quick service restaurants in the region. In China, we have seen a turnaround from the year-ago period for industrial segments, are also monitoring the macroeconomic impact on this part of our business heading into 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a strong finish to the year with constant currency sales up at a double-digit rate, including some wins from limited time menu items to our quick service restaurant customers. Across both segments, we expected strong fourth quarter sales growth in the our teams around the world deliver. 
Fourth quarter profit results were generally in line with our outlook for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, we grew adjusted operating income 10%, and on a reported basis, operating income margin rose 70 basis points. The margin increase was led by the performance in our industrial segment, which reached adjusted operating income margin of 11% this quarter, up 350 basis points from the year-ago period. We're making great progress from our work to shift the portfolio to more value-added products, largely through innovation and from the addition of Brand Aromatics. Also driving margin improvement are our cost saving efforts and the benefits of greater scale in our operations with higher production volume. 
Consumer segment adjusted operating income margin declined slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014. We increased brand marketing for this segment 11% this period to build momentum heading into 2016. This rate of increase was well ahead of our 1% reported sales growth for this segment and more than accounted for the lower margin with a 90 basis point impact. This segment also benefited from our progress with cost savings. 
As you saw in this morning's press release, and as we guided, adjusted earnings per share was up just slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014 due, in part, to unfavorable currency rates and the benefiting in the year-ago period from favorable discrete tax items. Overall, we're pleased with these fourth quarter results and a strong finish to the year. 
I'd like to comment next on fiscal year 2014 in total, starting with our top line increase of 6% in constant currency. In our consumer segment, we achieved a turnaround in our base sales in the U.S. from strong performance in international market. Industrial sales ended the year up 7% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. In addition, we completed 3 great bolt-on acquisitions that contributed about 1% to higher sales. China became our #2 market with robust sales growth of 11% in constant currency. New product launched in the last 3 years comprised 8% of sales this year. As in past years, this contribution from new products supports our long-term sales growth algorithm, which is 1/3 of our top line growth coming from innovation. Health and wellness continues to drive our innovation agenda. In addition to developing winning flavors for our industrial customers, globally, approximately 40% of new products reached also had some type of wellness attribute. In mid-2015, the USDA first recommended spices and herbs as a way to reduce sodium in the diet to recommendations to school nutritionists and to adults over 65. And in early January, this recommendation made its way into the new 2015-2020, Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This is consistent with the university resource studies sponsored by the McCormick science institute and great news for McCormick. We delivered record cost savings of $98 million in 2015, up 42% from 2014. While this provided an important offset to higher material costs, we also increased our investment in brand marketing with a 6% increase. 
Digital marketing is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing. In 2015, we continued our shift of marketing spend in this direction, reaching approximately 40% of our advertising spend up from 10% in 2010. We've establish the leadership position in digital and e-commerce, and this is recently recognized by Amazon, which made McCormick Supplier of the Year for Grocery, and by L2 with a #5 ranking of McCormick brand in its Digital IQ index, #5 out of 114 U.S. food brands. 
While adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 was a 3% increase from $3.37 in 2014, we had an estimated 5% impact from unfavorable currency rates. We also overcame significant profit pressure this year from mid single digit material cost inflation and higher retirement expense. The profit performance for our industrial segment was particularly impressive. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was up 24%. Due to 8% higher sales, cost savings and a shift toward more value-added products, including our Brand Aromatics acquisition, adjusted operating income margin ended the year at 9.5%, up from 8.3% in 2014. 
Our joint ventures achieved great results led by another year of strong performance from McCormick de Mexico. Sales in local currency for this business rose 11% in 2015. In total, income for unconsolidated operations rose 25% and accounted for 9% for net income this year. Cash flow from operations was also a record, reaching $590 million, a significant increase from the prior high of $504 million in 2014 and driven mainly by working capital improvements. We had good balance in our uses of cash between investments in capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend. In November, McCormick's group of 30th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly dividend. 
Heading into 2016, we have strong momentum, effective growth initiatives and a lot of excitement. I'll share our plans and outlook, and Gordon will go into more in-depth in our financial guidance. We continue to see strong alignment between our business and today's consumer that are seeking bolder flavor, exploring ethnic cuisine, buying more fresh ingredients, focus on wellness and looking for convenience. Global category growth for our largest category, spices and seasonings, which accounts for about half of our consumer business sales, remains robust at 7% in 2015, and your monitor projects annual sales growth of 5% globally through 2020. As the largest player in this category and our major markets, McCormick is on the leading-edge of these trends with our Flavor Forecast, our product innovation and our actions to renovate our core business, such as the 2016 rollout of non-GMO labeling for 70% of our U.S. spices, seasonings and extract and our transition to 80% organic products within our Gourmet line. We expect another year of 4% to 6% constant currency sales growth with increases in our base business, incremental sales from new products and a carryover benefit from acquisitions completed in 2015. Our base business will be driven by the category growth of our consumer segment and increased demand for many of the products we flavor for our industrial customers, such as snacks and beverages. We continue to support the regional expansion of these customers as well. As an example, a new facility in Dubai will open later this year to establish a local sources of supply in the Middle East. For our consumer segment, we're planning a further increase in brand marketing, approximately $20 million in support of our business at EMEA, our purity message in the U.S. and globally our digital program. Our brand marketing will also build awareness and trials of new products. 
Early in 2015, we began the national U.S. rollout of the herb grinders we discussed on our October call. We're getting great retail acceptance. Other products introductions in the first half of the year include new Grill Mates item, including Seasoning Blends, marinade recipe mixes and then the new lines of liquid 30-minute marinade. 
Laying off of our Flavor Forecast, we're launching 4 new Gourmet healthy blends, such as citrus, chili, chia. In fact, in 2015, we have a total of 56 new products globally that tie in with the Flavor Forecast trends we've identified. 
And in addition to news rice mix varieties, we're launching convenient portable rice cups. In international markets, we're rolling out Thai chili sauce in our squeezable pouch in China. New recipe mix varieties across Europe, great new baking decorations for our [indiscernible] brand in France. And in Canada, consumers will be seeing herb grinders and liquid grilled sauces on retail shelves. We're equally encouraged by solid pipeline of innovation for our industrial business, much of it in support of large multinational customers. We're also making inroads to new product wins with some rapidly expanding restaurant chains. 
Going back to the factors affecting 2016 sales growth. I want to also comment on pricing. In 2015, pricing added about 1% to sales. Together with our cost savings, this help offset a mid-single-digit increase in material cost. In 2016, we project low single-digit material cost inflation and plan on pricing to be a primary offset at a 1% to 2% rate, with the rate varying by operating unit. For example, in our consumer business in Canada, we executed a high single digit -- high single digit percentage increase. In October, they will cover both material cost increases and an unfavorable currency impact. In the U.S. consumer business, we recently announced a 2016 price increase. We leveraged our category management tools with a more data-driven approach to buy item increases. Across this business, the average sales impact is a low single digit percentage increase, and we expect minimal volume impact. Across all of our operations around the world, we believe we have the right actions underway in 2016, innovation, brand building, pricing with the right tools and the right team to drive sales growth. Employees throughout McCormick are also working to improve productivity, our fuel for growth. We have targeted another year of significant cost savings in 2016 with the goal to achieve at least $95 million. Work is well underway to deliver this amount, which we expect will lead to higher gross profit margin and higher operating income margin for the year. However, we operate in what is still a challenging environment for many of our customers. Food retailers in our consumer business and for our industrial business, packaged foods and beverage companies as well as restaurants. Also, we expect some further profit pressure from currency, and as I indicated, material cost inflation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, at the bottom line, we project a 9% to 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share from $3.48 in 2015. Gordon will provide more details on our outlook.  But before I turn it over to him, let me summarize. Our 2015 results, including the improvements in our U.S. consumer business, demonstrates the alignment of our business with today's consumer and the effectiveness of our strategies. We're excited about our plans and potential for even greater growth in 2016 with new products, incremental marketing, distribution expansion opportunities and tools for better retail partnership. Our acquisition pipeline is strong, and we have aggressive cost savings programs underway and a culture of participation and high performance. McCormick's focus on growth, performance and people is driving success. It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon. Gordon?"

It's been an honor and a privilege",1869,"Thanks, Lawrence,, and good morning, everyone. I want to take a moment with McCormick's analysts and investors on the call to also recognize Alan for his strong leadership, his friendship and his accomplishments as CEO. It's been an honor and a privilege to be CFO during his tenure and to partner with Alan and the entire executive team steering our strategy and organization and delivering high performance. And Lawrence, I'm looking forward to working with you when you step into this role on February 1. And that's this Monday, in case you needed a reminder. 
Lawrence shared some initial remarks on our fourth quarter results, and we provided some financial details in this morning's press release and our accompanying slides. Given this background, I'll move through my remarks on the quarter quickly, make a few additional points and then finish with the details of our 2016 outlook. 
On a constant-currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was a step-up from what we have seen year-to-date with an 8% increase that included 3% added by acquisitions. We had a full impact this quarter from Brand Aromatics and Drogheria & Alimentari and from Stubb's, which was completed toward the end of the quarter. 
Slide 16 shows that the base business growth for both the consumer and industrial segments was driven mainly by volume. The result of our product innovation, increased brand marketing, expanded distribution and regional presidents and other business building work with our customers. 
In the consumer segment, we had 3% constant currency sales growth in the Americas with about 1/3 of the increase from Stubb's. Sales business sales growth in this region was led by higher U.S. sales of spices and seasonings, including Grill Mates and our brands as well as Gourmet items and Hispanic products. We had good retail sales through, as Lawrence described, and are encouraged with the trajectory of sales as we head into 2016. 
In EMEA, we continue to achieve strong sales performance, up 18% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A, which added 11% to sales growth, expanded distribution in Poland and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing. In constant currency, we grew consumer segment sales in China 5%, as Lawrence described, and Australia had a high single digit sales increase from new distribution and new products in that market. 
We indicated the last quarter that we were exiting some lower margin product lines in our Kohinoor portfolio in India. In total, the constant currency sales decline in Kohinoor's sales lowered our consumer business growth rate in the Asia Pacific region by 3 percentage points, more than accounting for the volume decline shown on Slide 19. 
For the consumer segment in total, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was down 2% from the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 1% from the year-ago period with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material cost and benefit expense. 
Turning to our industrial segment. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with unfavorable currency rates. And as Lawrence indicated, this business reached an 11% adjusted operating income margin as the result of our CCI program, scale from higher sales and shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Brand Aromatics. 
On Slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 4% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year-ago period was led by U.S. sales of branded food-service products as well as customized flavor solutions. Mexico also contributed to the increase with increase sales of seasonings largely for snack products. 
Our industrial business in EMEA capped off an impressive year with constant currency sales up 14% in the fourth quarter. We are trusted in value suppliers supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region. 
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region 11% in constant currency. In China, we are benefiting from further recovery in demand from quick service restaurants. And in Australia, our growth includes new product wins with these customers. Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment rose 52% from the fourth quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 62% with the factors I already mentioned as spelled-out on Slide 25. 
Across both segments, adjusted operating, which excludes special charges, rose 6%. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 10%. In the turnaround from the 3 previous quarters, gross profit margin was up year-on-year in the fourth quarter with a 30 basis point increase. As we move into the fourth quarter, we have the full benefit of our cost savings and pricing actions, along with the benefit of higher sales and higher throughput in our plans. These factors were offset, in part, by the significant sales increase this period by our industrial segment, which has a lower gross profit margin than our consumer segment. 
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense was down 40 basis points as a result of our cost savings activity and leverage with higher sales. This includes a 13% fourth quarter increase in brand marketing from the year-ago period. Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 29.9%, a bit above our 29% guidance and a significant increase from 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 when we had the benefit of discrete tax items. For the 2015 fiscal year, our tax rate was impacted by several favorable discrete items and ended the year at 26.5%. As we head into 2016, we anticipate a tax rate of approximately 28%. 
Despite an unfavorable currency impact for our joint venture in Mexico, income from unconsolidated operations rose slightly this quarter. However, underlying growth remain quite strong with sales from McCormick New Mexico up 10% in local currency. 
At the bottom line, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $1.18, up $0.02 from the year ago period, mainly due to higher adjusted operating income partly offset by the higher tax rate. This result included and unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income. 
Turning next to Slide 30. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. As Lawrence shared, our year-to-date cash flow from operations was a record $590 million compared to $504 million in the year-ago period mainly due to working capital improvements. In 2015, we returned $351 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our dividend payments were up 6%. Share repurchases were down from 2014 because of our acquisition activities. Our share repurchases in 2015 contributed to a 1.4% reduction in diluted shares and we have $567 million remaining on our current $600 million authorization. 
During to fourth quarter, we completed a previous $400 million share repurchase program authorized in April of 2013. In the absence of any acquisitions in 2016, we expect to lower our share count by approximately 2%. 
During the quarter, we were pleased to complete the issuance of $250 million of 10-year notes at a 3.25% rate in anticipation of long-term debt that was maturing. At year-end, our debt to adjusted EBITDA was slightly above our target range of 1.5 to 1.8, following the financing of our 3 acquisitions completed in 2015. 
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth. 
Building on Lawrence's remarks, I'll wrap up with our outlook for continued momentum in sales and profit growth in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate increases in sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that are at/or above our long-term objectives, excluding the impact of currency exchange rates. Our current projections are based on prevailing rates, and given the level of currency volatility in the market, we will be updating this outlook for you each quarter. We expect to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. This includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015 and higher pricing at 1% to 2%. Based on prevailing rates, we estimate an unfavorable impact from currency of about 4 percentage points, which will lower this range to 0% to 2% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency, our projected increase in adjusted operating income is 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2014. Currency is expected to lower this range by about 4 percentage points to 5% to 7%. We expect to drive this increase from higher sales in at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions. Our guidance also includes plans for an increase in brand marketing of at least $20 million. And our projection for low single-digit material cost inflation that we should more than offset with our pricing actions and cost reductions. Our guidance for adjusted earnings per share is $3.65 to $3.72. Excluding the estimated 4 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. This growth rate is in line with our long-term objective. 
Some of the other puts and takes behind this projected growth rate are the favorable impacts of higher operating income and further reduction of shares outstanding in the absence of acquisition activity. Expect the offset to include the unfavorable currency impact as well as a higher tax rate. Due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates and material cost inflation for our joint venture in Mexico, our 2016 income from unconsolidated operations is likely to be down slightly from 2015. 
For the first quarter of 2016, there are several factors that will have an unfavorable impact on our earnings per share. First, we anticipate an impact from currency in the first quarter that could be above the annual estimate since we will not have yet lapped the larger increases in 2015. Second, we have plans to kick off 2016 with enough spend in brand marketing to support our core business as well as new product launches. In addition, we expect a higher year-on-year tax rate. Recall that in the first quarter of 2015, the tax rate was 24.8% as a result of discrete tax items. As a result, EPS in the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be down slightly from $0.70 of adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2015. For the fiscal year 2016, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for share repurchases and the quarterly dividend increase from $0.40 to $0.43 approved by the board in November. We also have plans for increased level of capital expenditures in 2016 of $150 million to $160 million.

But as we have worked with the price elasticity tools and have been able to model the category more robustly, we've identified many areas where there are opportunities for us to adjust our pricing. The price increase that we plan in our U.S. business has really been worked through quite a granular level on an item-by-item basis. Some items are moving down as well as some items moving up, but the net increase will be in the 1% to 2% range. This has already been taken to our customers, so this out in the field right now. And we've gotten really no meaningful pushback on it at all. Our basket of commodities is different than the basket of commodities than most of our peer companies. And there's good cost justification for the increase that we're taking. It's really not around packaging. Packaging is actually kind of in a deflationary mode. It's more around some of our iconic raw material. As we believe that the cost structure is around those iconic raw materials, if anything, we're better positioned than our direct competitors on those items due to our global sourcing capability.

A great deal of the carnage that happened around us has been more on the modern freight of portion of the business. That part of our business is slow as well, but it only accounts for about 20% of our consumer business in China. Much more of our business, in particular, thanks to the acquisition that we did a couple of years ago, is more directed to the interior, to the smaller cities and through a more traditional trade outlets. So we have continued to experience quite robust growth of our consumer business in China. For the year, we were up, I think, 11% in China in 2015. It was a little bit slower in the fourth quarter, but some of that with some anticipation of the Chinese New Year promotions that were coming beginning in December, which, for us, is fiscal 2016. I don't want to comment too much on 2016, but our -- the opening of our year in China on the consumer side of our business has been really quite strong. And I focused my remarks on the consumer side because for us, China has really become predominantly a consumer business. Years ago, China was more of an industrial business for us, and that's how we get our foothold there. But with the continued growth of our consumer business and with the addition of the acquisition we did a couple of years ago, that business is now more than [indiscernible] -- it's about 2/3 consumer."

It's something that we continue to evaluate and we'll look forward to improving that even still. But there hasn't been a specific target or ceiling that we put out in that business."

This is the next step in a well-planned succession that we, together with our board, take a lot of pride in at McCormick.
I'm pleased to be transitioning from my role of CEO at this time. One of my conditions in stepping down was to have the company in great shape with strong financial performance and forward momentum. With our 2015 results and accomplishments and a bullish outlook for 2016, I am very excited about our prospects.
Our success is being driven by a clear strategy for growth, a great board and leadership team and more than 10,000 highly engaged McCormick employees. I want to recognize and thank our employees around the world for their dedication, efforts and achievements.
On a personal note, I've enjoyed my many interactions with investors and analysts during my time as CEO at conferences and one-on-one meetings and other events.

Cash flow from operations is now nearly $600 million, up from $225 million in 2007. The stock price has more than doubled, and our quarterly dividend is now $0.43 per share, up from $0.20 per share. This is an enviable track record. Congratulations, and we look forward to your continued participation as Executive Chairman.
Another leadership news, effective January 1, Malcolm Swift was named President, Global Industrial Segment and McCormick International, adding responsibility for China to his role. Brendan Foley assumed responsibility for the strategic leadership of our consumer business from me and was named President, Global Consumer Segment and North America. In these roles, reporting to me, Brendan and Malcolm will set the strategic and operational goals for our consumer and industrial businesses, respectively, as well as the zest performance of the segment leaders in each geographic region against these goals. In addition, Brendan will have geographic responsibility for our North American market and Malcolm for our international markets.
Let's move next to fourth quarter performance. Financial results for this quarter demonstrated that consumer demand for flavor is strong and on the rise and that McCormick has the strategies and the team to drive growth. We had great performance across both segments, and we're particularly pleased with the progress in our U.S. consumer business. The actions we have underway in 2014 and 2015 have led to improved results, and we have good momentum heading into 2016.
For the total company, we reported 2% sales growth. In constant currency, we grew sales 8%, with higher volume and product mix in our base business contributing half of this increase. We grew consumer segment sales 6% in constant currency, with about half of the increase from our base business and half from our acquisitions of Drogheria & Alimentari and Stubb's.
In the Americas, the constant-currency sales increase was 3%, with Stubb's adding about 1/3 of this growth. We were pleased with our results in this period and the further improvement in our U.S. business.
In this market, year-on-year category growth for spices and seasonings remains robust at 5% in the quarter. At 4%, retail takeaway for the McCormick brand was close to the category increase. As seen on Slide 7, we have achieved a sequential increase from 2% growth in the third quarter and 1% in the second quarter.
We had a number of initiatives driving this performance. We launched our digital purity campaign this quarter with the message, ""Pure tastes better,"" to emphasize to consumers the quality of our products, and we continue to help consumers prepare flavorful, healthy meals at www.mccormick.com, which is now one of the top 50 most visited food and lifestyle sites. Across all of our U.S. websites, we attracted a record 32 million visitors in 2015, up 19% from 2014.
Within the spice and seasoning categories, our premium Gourmet line, our 2015 relaunch of this line has been a real success. Since the rollout of the packaging innovation and new varieties, retail sales are applied for set. And armed with greater category analytics and insights, we had workshop discussions with our top customers of ways to optimize product assortment, pricing and promotion for the spice and seasoning category. For customers that have already taken action based on these discussions, we grew our category share 60 basis points on average during the fourth quarter. At some of these customers, category unit volume was up more than 5%. These are great results for our spices and seasoning business. Our investment in brand equity building, strong innovation and to this customer interaction with more robust tools is the way forward for us. As we move into 2016, this work transitions from being a turnaround effort to our everyday approach in building value for our customers and for McCormick.
As for our next largest U.S. category, recipe mixes, November 2015 capped off 26 consecutive months of share gains in this category. We are driving these gains with brand equity building and product innovation like gluten-free items, skillet sauces and slow cooker sauces. Through these efforts, our branded sales accounted for more than 100% of the category growth in both 2014 and 2015.
Our consumer business team in Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, continues to post impressive results led by new distribution in Poland. France also contributed to this increase with higher advertising, including new product support. In 2015, we launched the distinctive line of origin-specific Ducros brand black pepper that was just named new product of the year by the French Product Society.
In constant currency, we grew sales in China 5% in the fourth quarter with some impact from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotions in the first quarter of 2016. For the fiscal year, we grew China consumer sales 12% in constant currency. With nearly 2 months complete, our China consumer business is off to a strong start. And for the fiscal year, we expect to achieve constant-currency sales growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. We see opportunities for further growth of our consumer business in China, especially with the cross-selling of McCormick brand and WAPC brand products.
While we are certainly cautious given the current economic environment, keep in mind that our products are stable in Chinese cooking, and McCormick has a good penetration in traditional markets and other channels, with modern trade accounting for about 20% of consumer sales in this market.
Turning to the industrial segment. Our sales growth was particularly strong in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period, up 11% in constant currency. This increase was broad based with double-digit growth in each of our 3 regions. While the addition of Brand Aromatics contributed to this increase, we had exceptional growth in our base business with sales up 9%. 
Leading our industrial performance again this quarter, with constant currency sales up 14%, was our team in EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is with quick service restaurants through product expansion, distribution gains and their geographic expansion.
In the Americas region, a double-digit, constant-currency sales increase included 7% added by our base business. In the U.S., our branded food service business had a good quarter, and sales to quick service restaurants showed some improvement from prior periods. It's nearly 1 year since we acquired Brand Aromatics, and we're pleased with the early results from this business. Mexico also contributed to the increase in this region with higher sales of snack seasonings.
In Australia, we grew sales of new industrial products with the shift from this region mainly to quick service restaurants in the region. In China, we have seen a turnaround from the year-ago period for industrial segment but are also monitoring the macroeconomic impact on this part of our business heading into 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a strong finish to the year with constant-currency sales up at a double-digit rate, including some wins from limited time menu items to our quick service restaurant customers. Across both segments, we expected strong fourth quarter sales growth, and our teams around the world delivered.
Fourth quarter profit results were generally in line with our outlook for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, we grew adjusted operating income 10%, and on a reported basis, operating income margin rose 70 basis points. The margin increase was led by the performance in our industrial segment, which reached adjusted operating income margin of 11% this quarter, up 350 basis points from the year-ago period. We're making great progress from our work to shift the portfolio to more value-added products, largely through innovation and from the addition of Brand Aromatics. Also driving margin improvement are our cost savings efforts and the benefits of greater scale in our operations with higher production volume.
Consumer segment adjusted operating income margin declined slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014. We increased brand marketing for this segment 11% this period to build momentum heading into 2016. This rate of increase was well ahead of our 1% reported sales growth for this segment and more than accounted for the lower margin with a 90 basis point impact. This segment also benefited from our progress with cost savings.
As you saw in this morning's press release, and as we guided, adjusted earnings per share was up just slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014 due in part to unfavorable currency rates and the benefit in the year-ago period from favorable discrete tax items. Overall, we're pleased with these fourth quarter results and a strong finish to the year.
I'd like to comment next on fiscal year 2015 in total, starting with our top line increase of 6% in constant currency. In our consumer segment, we achieved a turnaround in our base sales in the U.S. from strong performance in international markets. Industrial sales ended the year up 7% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. In addition, we completed 3 great bolt-on acquisitions that contributed about 1% to higher sales. China became our #2 market with robust sales growth of 11% in constant currency. New products launched in the last 3 years comprised 8% of sales this year. As in past years, this contribution from new products supports our long-term sales growth algorithm, which is 1/3 of our top line growth coming from innovation. Health and wellness continues to drive our innovation agenda. In addition to developing winning flavors for our industrial customers, globally, approximately 40% of new product briefs also had some type of wellness attribute. In mid-2015, the USDA first recommended spices and herbs as a way to reduce sodium in the diet in recommendations to school nutritionists and to adults over 65. And in early January, this recommendation made its way into the new 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This is consistent with the university research studies sponsored by the McCormick Science Institute and great news for McCormick.
We delivered record cost savings of $98 million in 2015, up 42% from 2014. While this provided an important offset to higher material costs, we also increased our investment in brand marketing with a 6% increase.
Digital marketing is one of our highest-return investments in brand marketing. In 2015, we continued our shift of marketing spend in this direction, reaching approximately 40% of our advertising spend, up from 10% in 2010. We have established the leadership position in digital and e-commerce, and this was recently recognized by Amazon, which made McCormick Supplier of the Year for Grocery; and by L2, with a #5 ranking of McCormick brand in its Digital IQ index, #5 out of 114 U.S. food brands.
While adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 was a 3% increase from $3.37 in 2014, we had an estimated 5% impact from unfavorable currency rates. We also overcame significant profit pressure this year from mid-single-digit material cost inflation and higher retirement expense.
The profit performance for our industrial segment was particularly impressive. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was up 24% due to 8% higher sales, cost savings and a shift toward more value-added products, including our Brand Aromatics acquisition. Adjusted operating income margin ended the year at 9.5%, up from 8.3% in 2014.
Our joint ventures achieved great results led by another year of strong performance from McCormick de Mexico. Sales in local currency for this business rose 11% in 2015. In total, income from unconsolidated operations rose 25% and accounted for 9% of our net income this year. Cash flow from operations was also a record, reaching $590 million, a significant increase from the prior high of $504 million in 2014 and driven mainly by working capital improvements. We had good balance in our uses of cash between investments in capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend. In November, McCormick's board approved our 30th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly dividend.
Heading into 2016, we have strong momentum, effective growth initiatives and a lot of excitement. I'll share our plans and outlook, and Gordon will go into -- more in-depth in our financial guidance. We continue to see strong alignment between our business and today's consumers that are seeking bolder flavors, exploring ethnic cuisine, buying more fresh ingredients, focused on wellness and looking for convenience. Global category growth for our largest category, spices and seasonings, which accounts for about half of our consumer business sales, remains robust at 7% in 2015, and Euromonitor projects annual sales growth of 5% globally through 2020. As the largest player in this category and our major markets, McCormick is on the leading edge of these trends with our Flavor Forecast, our product innovation and our actions to renovate our core business such as the 2016 rollout of non-GMO labeling for 70% of our U.S. spices, seasonings and extracts, and our transition to 80% organic products within our Gourmet line. We expect another year of 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth with increases in our base business, incremental sales from new products and a carryover benefit from acquisitions completed in 2015. Our base business will be driven by the category growth of our consumer segment and increased demand for many of the products we flavor for our industrial customers such as snacks and beverages. We continue to support the regional expansion of these customers as well. As an example, a new facility in Dubai will open later this year to establish a local source of supply in the Middle East.
For our consumer segment, we're planning a further increase in brand marketing, approximately $20 million, in support of our business at EMEA, our purity message in the U.S. and globally, our digital programs. Our brand marketing will also build awareness and trials of new products.
Early in 2015, we began the national U.S. rollout of the herb grinders we discussed on our October call. We're getting great retail acceptance. Other product introductions in the first half of the year include new Grill Mates items, including seasoning blends, marinade recipe mixes and a new line of liquid 30-minute marinades.
Playing off of our Flavor Forecast, we're launching 4 new Gourmet healthy blends such as citrus, chili, chia. In fact, in 2015, we have a total of 56 new products globally that tie in with the Flavor Forecast trends that we have identified. And in addition to new Zatarain's seasoned rice mix variety, we're launching convenient portable rice cups.
In international markets, we're rolling out Thai chili sauce in our squeezable pouch in China; new recipe mix varieties across Europe; great new baking decorations for our Vahiné brand in France; and in Canada, consumers will be seeing herb grinders and liquid La Grill brand sauces on retail shelves.
We're equally encouraged by a solid pipeline of innovation for our industrial business, much of it in support of large multinational customers. We're also making inroads to new product wins with some rapidly expanding restaurant chains.
Going back to the factors affecting 2016 sales growth. I want to also comment on pricing. In 2015, pricing added about 1% to sales. Together with our cost savings, this helped offset a mid-single-digit increase in material costs. In 2016, we project low single-digit material cost inflation and plan on pricing to be a primary offset at a 1% to 2% rate, with the rate varying by operating unit. For example, in our consumer business in Canada, we executed a high single-digit price -- high single-digit percentage increase in October to recover both material cost increases and an unfavorable currency impact. In the U.S. consumer business, we recently announced a 2016 price increase. We leveraged our category management tools with a more data-driven approach to buy item increases. Across this business, average sales impact is a low single-digit percentage increase, and we expect minimal volume impact.
Across all of our operations around the world, we believe we have the right actions underway in 2016, innovation, brand building, pricing, with the right tools and the right team, to drive sales growth. Employees throughout McCormick are also working to improve productivity, our fuel for growth. We have targeted another year of significant cost savings in 2016 with the goal to achieve at least $95 million. Work is well underway to deliver this amount, which we expect to lead to higher gross profit margin and higher operating income margin for the year. However, we operate in what is a still challenging environment for many of our customers: food retailers in our consumer business; and for our industrial business, packaged food and beverage companies as well as restaurants. Also, we expect some further profit pressure from currency, and as I indicated, material cost inflation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, at the bottom line, we project a 9% to 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share from $3.48 in 2015. Gordon will provide more details on our outlook.
But before I turn it over to him, let me summarize. Our 2015 results, including the improvement in our U.S. consumer business, demonstrates the alignment of our business with today's consumer and the effectiveness of our strategies. We are excited about our plans and potential for even greater growth in 2016 with new products, incremental marketing, distribution expansion opportunities and tools for better retail partnership. Our acquisition pipeline is strong, and we have aggressive cost savings programs underway and a culture of participation and high performance. McCormick's focus on growth, performance and people is driving success.
It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon. Gordon?"

I want to take a moment with McCormick's analysts and investors on the call to also recognize Alan for his strong leadership, his friendship and his accomplishments as CEO. It's been an honor and a privilege to be CFO during his tenure and to partner with Alan and the entire executive team steering our strategy and organization and delivering high performance. And Lawrence, I'm looking forward to working with you when you step into this role on February 1. And that's this Monday, in case you needed a reminder.
Lawrence shared some initial remarks on our fourth quarter results, and we provided some financial details in this morning's press release and our accompanying slides. Given this background, I'll move through my remarks on the quarter quickly, make a few additional points and then finish with the details of our 2016 outlook.
On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was a step-up from what we have seen year-to-date with an 8% increase that included 3% added by acquisitions. We had a full impact this quarter from Brand Aromatics and Drogheria & Alimentari and from Stubb's, which was completed toward the end of the quarter.
Slide 16 shows that the base business growth for both the consumer and industrial segments was driven mainly by volume, the result of our product innovation, increased brand marketing, expanded distribution and regional presence and other business building work with our customers.
In the consumer segment, we had 3% constant currency sales growth in the Americas, with about 1/3 of the increase from Stubb's. Base business sales growth in this region was led by higher U.S. sales of spices and seasonings, including Grill Mates and our Lawry’s brand, as well as Gourmet items and Hispanic products. We had good retail sell-through, as Lawrence described, and are encouraged with the trajectory of sales as we head into 2016.
In EMEA, we continue to achieve strong sales performance, up 18% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A, which added 11% to sales growth, expanded distribution in Poland and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
In constant currency, we grew consumer segment sales in China 5%, as Lawrence described, and Australia had a high single-digit sales increase from new distribution and new products in that market.
We indicated last quarter that we were exiting some lower-margin product lines in our Kohinoor portfolio in India. In total, the constant-currency sales decline in Kohinoor's sales lowered our consumer business growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region by 3 percentage points, more than accounting for the volume decline shown on Slide 19.
For the consumer segment in total, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was down 2% from the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 1% from the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and benefit expense.
Turning to our industrial segment. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with unfavorable currency rates. And as Lawrence indicated, this business reached an 11% adjusted operating income margin as the result of our CCI program, scale from higher sales and shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Brand Aromatics.
On Slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 4% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year-ago period was led by U.S. sales of branded food service products as well as customized flavor solutions. Mexico also contributed to the increase with sales of seasonings largely for snack products.
Our industrial business in EMEA capped off an impressive year with constant-currency sales up 14% in the fourth quarter. We are a trusted and valued suppliers, supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia-Pacific region 11% in constant currency. In China, we are benefiting from further recovery in demand from quick service restaurants. And in Australia, our growth includes new product wins with these customers.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment rose 52% from the fourth quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 62% with the factors I already mentioned as spelled out on Slide 25.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 6%. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 10%. In the turnaround from the 3 previous quarters, gross profit margin was up year-on-year in the fourth quarter with a 30 basis point increase. As we move into the fourth quarter, we had the full benefit of our cost savings and pricing actions, along with the benefit of higher sales and higher throughput in our plans. These factors were offset in part by the significant sales increase this period by our industrial segment, which has a lower gross profit margin than our consumer segment.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense was down 40 basis points as a result of our cost savings activity and leverage with higher sales. This includes a 13% fourth quarter increase in brand marketing from the year-ago period.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 29.9%, a bit above our 29% guidance and a significant increase from 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 when we had the benefit of discrete tax items. For the 2015 fiscal year, our tax rate was impacted by several favorable discrete items and ended the year at 26.5%. As we head into 2016, we anticipate a tax rate of approximately 28%.
Despite an unfavorable currency impact for our joint venture in Mexico, income from unconsolidated operations rose slightly this quarter. However, underlying growth remained quite strong, with sales from McCormick de Mexico up 10% in local currency.
At the bottom line, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $1.18, up $0.02 from the year-ago period, mainly due to higher adjusted operating income, partly offset by the higher tax rate. This result included an unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
Turning next to Slide 30. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. As Lawrence shared, our year-to-date cash flow from operations was a record $590 million compared to $504 million in the year-ago period mainly due to working capital improvements. In 2015, we returned $351 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our dividend payments were up 6%. Share repurchases were down from 2014 because of our acquisition activity. Our share repurchases in 2015 contributed to a 1.4% reduction in diluted shares, and we have $567 million remaining on our current $600 million authorization.
During the fourth quarter, we completed a previous $400 million share repurchase program authorized in April of 2013. In the absence of any acquisitions in 2016, we expect to lower our share count by approximately 2%.
During the quarter, we were pleased to complete the issuance of $250 million of 10-year notes at a 3.25% rate in anticipation of long-term debt that was maturing. At year-end, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly above our target range of 1.5 to 1.8, following the financing of our 3 acquisitions completed in 2015.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.
Building on Lawrence's remarks, I'll wrap up with our outlook for continued momentum in sales and profit growth in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate increases in sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that are at/or above our long-term objectives, excluding the impact of currency exchange rates. Our current projections are based on prevailing rates, and given the level of currency volatility in the market, we will be updating this outlook for you each quarter.
We expect to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. This includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015 and higher pricing at 1% to 2%. Based on prevailing rates, we estimate an unfavorable impact from currency of about 4 percentage points, which will lower this range to 0 to 2% on a reported basis.
Excluding the impact of currency, our projected increase in adjusted operating income is 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range by about 4 percentage points to 5% to 7%. We expect to drive this increase from higher sales and at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions. Our guidance also includes plans for an increase in brand marketing of at least $20 million and our projection for low single-digit material cost inflation that we should more than offset with our pricing actions and cost reductions.
Our guidance for adjusted earnings per share is $3.65 to $3.72. Excluding the estimated 4 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. This growth rate is in line with our long-term objective.
Some of the other puts and takes behind this projected growth rate are the favorable impacts of higher operating income and further reduction of shares outstanding in the absence of acquisition activity. Expected offsets include the unfavorable currency impact as well as a higher tax rate. Due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates and material cost inflation for our joint venture in Mexico, our 2016 income from unconsolidated operations is likely to be down slightly from 2015.
For the first quarter of 2016, there are several factors that will have an unfavorable impact on our earnings per share. First, we anticipate an impact from currency in the first quarter that could be above the annual estimate since we will not have yet lapped the larger increases in 2015. Second, we have plans to kick off 2016 with enough spend in brand marketing to support our core business as well as new product launches. In addition, we expect a higher year-on-year tax rate. Recall that in the first quarter of 2015, the tax rate was 24.8% as the result of discrete tax items. As a result, EPS in the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be down slightly from $0.70 of adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2015.
For the fiscal year 2016, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for share repurchases and the quarterly dividend increase from $0.40 to $0.43 approved by the board in November. We also have plans for an increased level of capital expenditures in 2016 of $150 million to $160 million. This is up slightly from our normal run rate of 3% of sales and includes a larger manufacturing plant in Shanghai where yet we have outgrown our current facility.
That completes my remarks on our 2016 outlook. So let's open the line for questions."

We had some acquisition-related costs in the U.S. consumer side of things as related to Stubb's, so some of the profit realization was impacted by that. And in total, the gross margin improved.

But as we have worked with the price elasticity tools and have been able to model the category more robustly, we've identified many areas where there are opportunities for us to adjust our pricing. The price increase that we plan in our U.S. business has really been worked through at quite a granular level on an item-by-item basis. Some items are moving down as well as some items moving up, but the net increase will be in the 1% to 2% range. This has already been taken to our customers, so this is out in the field right now. And we've gotten really no meaningful pushback on it at all. Our basket of commodities is different than the basket of commodities than most of the -of our peer companies. And there's good cost justification for the increase that we're taking. It's really not around packaging. Packaging is actually kind of in a deflationary mode. It's more around some of our iconic raw materials. And we believe that the cost structure is around those iconic raw materials. If anything, we're better positioned than our direct competitors on those items due to our global sourcing capability. So our competitors would be dealing at same pressures as well."

A great deal of the carnage that happened around us has been more on the modern freight portion of the business. That part of our business is slow as well, but it only accounts for about 20% of our consumer business in China. Much more of our business, in particular, thanks to the acquisition that we did a couple of years ago, is more directed to the interior, to the smaller cities and through a more traditional trade outlets. So we have continued to experience quite robust growth of our consumer business in China. For the year, we were up, I think, 11% in China in 2015. It was a little bit slower in the fourth quarter, but some of that was some anticipation of the Chinese New Year promotions that were coming beginning in December, which, for us, is fiscal 2016. I don't want to comment too much on 2016, but our -- the opening of our year in China on the consumer side of our business has been really quite strong. And I focus my remarks on the consumer side because for us, China has really become predominantly a consumer business. Years ago, China was more of an industrial business for us, and that's how we got our foothold there. But with the continued growth of our consumer business and with the addition of the acquisition we did a couple of years ago, that business is now more than -- sorry, it's about 2/3 consumer.  I was just there with the China team last week and met with the management over there. Actually, Alan and I went over as part of our internal transition communication. And so it gives an opportunity to meet first hand with the China team. And they continue to be quite optimistic."

And I'm curious on how that margin sustainability or even growth from here works, whether it's something that's solely related to mix or if there is some production optimization in there as well. And I think what I'm really trying to get at here is when you think about the ingredients industry and the move by a lot of food and beverage companies towards natural, I think it can really help you guys from a volume standpoint as more and more people use spices and herbs, whether it's for coloring, flavoring, et cetera, but if you can move up the value chain, say, for maybe a bulk spice and herb towards an extract or something like that, maybe you can benefit on the price side and the margin side as well.

This is the next step in a well-planned succession that we, together with our board, take a lot of pride in at McCormick.
I'm pleased to be transitioning from my role of CEO at this time. One of my conditions in stepping down was to have the company in great shape with strong financial performance and forward momentum. With our 2015 results and accomplishments and a bullish outlook for 2016, I am very excited about our prospects.
Our success is being driven by a clear strategy for growth, a great board and leadership team and more than 10,000 highly engaged McCormick employees. I want to recognize and thank our employees around the world for their dedication, efforts and achievements.
On a personal note, I've enjoyed my many interactions with investors and analysts during my time as CEO at conferences and one-on-one meetings and other events. While the main focus of these discussions was your questions about McCormick, I've gotten just as much out of our time together receiving feedback and gaining industry insights that help to shape our strategy and message.

Cash flow from operations is now nearly $600 million, up from $225 million in 2007. The stock price has more than doubled, and our quarterly dividend is now $0.43 per share, up from $0.20 per share. This is an enviable track record. Congratulations, and we look forward to your continued participation as Executive Chairman.
In other leadership news, effective January 1, Malcolm Swift was named President, Global Industrial Segment and McCormick International, adding responsibility for China to his role. Brendan Foley assumed responsibility for the strategic leadership of our consumer business from me and was named President, Global Consumer Segment and North America. In these roles, reporting to me, Brendan and Malcolm will set the strategic and operational goals for our consumer and industrial businesses, respectively, as well as assess performance of the segment leaders in each geographic region against these goals. In addition, Brendan will have geographic responsibility for our North American market and Malcolm for our international markets.
Let's move next to fourth quarter performance. Financial results for this quarter demonstrated that consumer demand for flavor is strong and on the rise and that McCormick has the strategies and the team to drive growth. We had great performance across both segments, and we're particularly pleased with the progress in our U.S. consumer business. The actions we have underway in 2014 and 2015 have led to improved results, and we have good momentum heading into 2016.
For the total company, we reported 2% sales growth. In constant currency, we grew sales 8%, with higher volume and product mix in our base business contributing half of this increase. We grew consumer segment sales 6% in constant currency, with about half of the increase from our base business and half from our acquisitions of Drogheria & Alimentari and Stubb's.
In the Americas, the constant-currency sales increase was 3%, with Stubb's adding about 1/3 of this growth. We were pleased with our results in this period and the further improvement in our U.S. business.
In this market, year-on-year category growth for spices and seasonings remained robust at 5% in the quarter. At 4%, retail takeaway for the McCormick brand was close to the category increase. As seen on Slide 7, we have achieved a sequential increase from 2% growth in the third quarter and 1% in the second quarter.
We had a number of initiatives driving this performance. We launched our digital purity campaign this quarter with the message, ""Pure tastes better,"" to emphasize to consumers the quality of our products, and we continue to help consumers prepare flavorful, healthy meals at www.mccormick.com, which is now one of the top 50 most visited food and lifestyle sites. Across all of our U.S. websites, we attracted a record 32 million visitors in 2015, up 19% from 2014.
Within the spice and seasoning categories, our premium Gourmet line, our 2015 relaunch of this line has been a real success. Since the rollout of the packaging innovation and new varieties, retail sales are up 5%. And, armed with greater category analytics and insights, we had workshop discussions with our top customers of ways to optimize product assortment, pricing and promotion for the spice and seasoning category. For customers that have already taken action based on these discussions, we grew our category share 60 basis points on average during the fourth quarter. At some of these customers, category unit volume was up more than 5%. 
These are great results for our spices and seasoning business. Our investment in brand equity building, strong innovation and to this customer interaction with more robust tools is the way forward for us. As we move into 2016, this work transitions from being a turnaround effort to our everyday approach in building value for our customers and for McCormick.
As for our next largest U.S. category, recipe mixes, November 2015 capped off 26 consecutive months of share gains in this category. We are driving these gains with brand equity building and product innovation like gluten-free items, skillet sauces and slow cooker sauces. Through these efforts, our branded sales accounted for more than 100% of the category growth in both 2014 and 2015.
Our consumer business team in Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, continues to post impressive results led by new distribution in Poland. France also contributed to this increase with higher advertising, including new product support. In 2015, we launched the distinctive line of origin-specific Ducros brand black pepper that was just named new product of the year by the French Product Society.
In constant currency, we grew sales in China 5% in the fourth quarter with some impact from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotions in the first quarter of 2016. For the fiscal year, we grew China consumer sales 12% in constant currency. With nearly 2 months complete, our China consumer business is off to a strong start. And for the fiscal year, we expect to achieve constant-currency sales growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. We see opportunities for further growth of our consumer business in China, especially with the cross-selling of McCormick brand and WAPC brand products.
While we are certainly cautious given the current economic environment, keep in mind that our products are a staple in Chinese cooking, and McCormick has a good penetration in traditional markets and other channels, with modern trade accounting for about 20% of consumer sales in this market.
Turning to the industrial segment. Our sales growth was particularly strong in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period, up 11% in constant currency. This increase was broad based with double-digit growth in each of our 3 regions. While the addition of Brand Aromatics contributed to this increase, we had exceptional growth in our base business with sales up 9%. 
Leading our industrial performance again this quarter, with constant currency sales up 14%, was our team in EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is with quick service restaurants through product expansion, distribution gains and their geographic expansion.
In the Americas region, a double-digit, constant-currency sales increase included 7% added by our base business. In the U.S., our branded food service business had a good quarter, and sales to quick service restaurants showed some improvement from prior periods. It's nearly 1 year since we acquired Brand Aromatics, and we're pleased with the early results from this business. Mexico also contributed to the increase in this region with higher sales of snack seasonings.
In Australia, we grew sales of new industrial products that are shipped from this region mainly to quick service restaurants in the region. In China, we have seen a turnaround from the year-ago period for industrial segment but are also monitoring the macroeconomic impact on this part of our business heading into 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a strong finish to the year with constant-currency sales up at a double-digit rate, including some wins for limited time menu items to our quick service restaurant customers. 
Across both segments, we expected strong fourth quarter sales growth, and our teams around the world delivered.
Fourth quarter profit results were generally in line with our outlook for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, we grew adjusted operating income 10%, and on a reported basis, operating income margin rose 70 basis points. The margin increase was led by the performance in our industrial segment, which reached adjusted operating income margin of 11% this quarter, up 350 basis points from the year-ago period. We're making great progress from our work to shift the portfolio to more value-added products, largely through innovation and from the addition of Brand Aromatics. Also driving margin improvement are our cost savings efforts and the benefits of greater scale in our operations with higher production volume.
Consumer segment adjusted operating income margin declined slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014. We increased brand marketing for this segment 11% this period to build momentum heading into 2016. This rate of increase was well ahead of our 1% reported sales growth for this segment and more than accounted for the lower margin with a 90 basis point impact. This segment also benefited from our progress with cost savings.
As you saw in this morning's press release, and as we guided, adjusted earnings per share was up just slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014 due in part to unfavorable currency rates and the benefit in the year-ago period from favorable discrete tax items. Overall, we're pleased with these fourth quarter results and a strong finish to the year.
I'd like to comment next on fiscal year 2015 in total, starting with our top line increase of 6% in constant currency. 
In our consumer segment, we achieved a turnaround in our base sales in the U.S. from strong performance in international markets. Industrial sales ended the year up 7% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. In addition, we completed 3 great bolt-on acquisitions that contributed about 1% to higher sales. China became our #2 market with robust sales growth of 11% in constant currency. New products launched in the last 3 years comprised 8% of sales this year. As in past years, this contribution from new products supports our long-term sales growth algorithm, which has 1/3 of our top line growth coming from innovation. 
Health and wellness continues to drive our innovation agenda. In addition to developing winning flavors for our industrial customers, globally, approximately 40% of new product briefs also had some type of wellness attribute. In mid-2015, the USDA first recommended spices and herbs as a way to reduce sodium in the diet in recommendations to school nutritionists and to adults over 65. And in early January, this recommendation made its way into the new 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This is consistent with the university research studies sponsored by the McCormick Science Institute and great news for McCormick.
We delivered record cost savings of $98 million in 2015, up 42% from 2014. While this provided an important offset to higher material costs, we also increased our investment in brand marketing with a 6% increase.
Digital marketing is one of our highest-return investments in brand marketing. And in 2015, we continued our shift of marketing spend in this direction, reaching approximately 40% of our advertising spend, up from 10% in 2010. We have established the leadership position in digital and e-commerce, and this was recently recognized by Amazon, which named McCormick Supplier of the Year for Grocery; and by L2, with a #5 ranking of McCormick brand in its Digital IQ Index, #5 out of 114 U.S. food brands.
While adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 was a 3% increase from $3.37 in 2014, we had an estimated 5% impact from unfavorable currency rates. We also overcame significant profit pressure this year from mid-single-digit material cost inflation and higher retirement expense.
The profit performance for our industrial segment was particularly impressive. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was up 24% due to 8% higher sales, cost savings and a shift toward more value-added products, including our Brand Aromatics acquisition. Adjusted operating income margin ended the year at 9.5%, up from 8.3% in 2014.
Our joint ventures achieved great results led by another year of strong performance from McCormick de Mexico. Sales in local currency for this business rose 11% in 2015. In total, income from unconsolidated operations rose 25% and accounted for 9% of our net income this year. Cash flow from operations was also a record, reaching $590 million, a significant increase from the prior high of $504 million in 2014 and driven mainly by working capital improvements. We had good balance in our uses of cash between investments in capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend. In November, McCormick's board approved our 30th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly dividend.
Heading into 2016, we have strong momentum, effective growth initiatives and a lot of excitement. I'll share our plans and outlook, and Gordon will go into -- more in-depth in our financial guidance. We continue to see strong alignment between our business and today's consumers that are seeking bolder flavors, exploring ethnic cuisine, buying more fresh ingredients, focused on wellness and looking for convenience.
Global category growth for our largest category, spices and seasonings, which accounts for about half of our consumer business sales, remains robust at 7% in 2015, and Euromonitor projects annual sales growth of 5% globally through 2020. As the largest player in this category in our major markets, McCormick is on the leading edge of these trends with our Flavor Forecast, our product innovation and our actions to renovate our core business such as the 2016 rollout of non-GMO labeling for 70% of our U.S. spices, seasonings and extracts, and our transition to 80% organic products within our Gourmet line. We expect another year of 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth with increases in our base business, incremental sales from new products and a carryover benefit from acquisitions completed in 2015. 
Our base business will be driven by the category growth of our consumer segment and increased demand for many of the products we flavor for our industrial customers such as snacks and beverages. We continue to support the regional expansion of these customers as well. As an example, a new facility in Dubai will open later this year to establish a local source of supply in the Middle East.
For our consumer segment, we're planning a further increase in brand marketing, approximately $20 million, in support of our business at EMEA, our purity message in the U.S. and globally, our digital programs. Our brand marketing will also build awareness and trials of new products.
Early in 2016, we began the national U.S. rollout of the herb grinders we discussed on our October call. We're getting great retail acceptance. Other product introductions in the first half of the year include new Grill Mates items, including seasoning blends, marinade recipe mixes and a new line of liquid 30-minute marinades.
Playing off of our Flavor Forecast, we're launching 4 new Gourmet healthy blends such as citrus, chili, chia. In fact, in 2015, we have a total of 56 new products globally that tie in with the Flavor Forecast trends that we have identified. And in addition to new Zatarain's seasoned rice mix variety, we're launching convenient portable rice cups.
In international markets, we're rolling out Thai chili sauce in our squeezable pouch in China; new recipe mix varieties across Europe; great new baking decorations for our Vahiné brand in France; and in Canada, consumers will be seeing Herb Grinders and liquid La Grill brand sauces on retail shelves.
We're equally encouraged by a solid pipeline of innovation for our industrial business, much of it in support of large multinational customers. We're also making inroads to new product wins with some rapidly expanding restaurant chains.
Going back to the factors affecting 2016 sales growth. I want to also comment on pricing. In 2015, pricing added about 1% to sales. Together with our cost savings, this helped offset a mid-single-digit increase in material costs. In 2016, we project low single-digit material cost inflation and plan on pricing to be a primary offset at a 1% to 2% rate, with the rate varying by operating unit. For example, in our consumer business in Canada, we executed a high single-digit price -- high single-digit percentage increase in October to recover both material cost increases and an unfavorable currency impact. In the U.S. consumer business, we recently announced a 2016 price increase. We leveraged our category management tools with a more data-driven approach to buy item increases. Across this business, average sales impact is a low single-digit percentage increase, and we expect minimal volume impact.
Across all of our operations around the world, we believe we have the right actions underway in 2016: innovation, brand building, pricing, with the right tools and the right team, to drive sales growth. Employees throughout McCormick are also working to improve productivity, our fuel for growth. We have targeted another year of significant cost savings in 2016 with the goal to achieve at least $95 million. Work is well underway to deliver this amount, which we expect to lead to higher gross profit margin and higher operating income margin for the year. 
However, we operate in what is a still challenging environment for many of our customers: food retailers in our consumer business; and for our industrial business, packaged food and beverage companies as well as restaurants. Also, we expect some further profit pressure from currency, and as I indicated, material cost inflation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, at the bottom line, we project a 9% to 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share from $3.48 in 2015. Gordon will provide more details on our outlook.
But before I turn it over to him, let me summarize. Our 2015 results, including the improvement in our U.S. consumer business, demonstrates the alignment of our business with today's consumer and the effectiveness of our strategies. We are excited about our plans and potential for even greater growth in 2016 with new products, incremental marketing, distribution expansion opportunities and tools for better retail partnership. Our acquisition pipeline is strong, and we have aggressive cost savings programs underway and a culture of participation and high performance. McCormick's focus on growth, performance and people is driving success.
It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon. Gordon?"

I want to take a moment with McCormick's analysts and investors on the call to also recognize Alan for his strong leadership, his friendship and his accomplishments as CEO. It's been an honor and a privilege to be CFO during his tenure and to partner with Alan and the entire executive team steering our strategy and organization and delivering high performance. And Lawrence, I'm looking forward to working with you when you step into this role on February 1. And that's this Monday, in case you needed a reminder.
Lawrence shared some initial remarks on our fourth quarter results, and we provided some financial details in this morning's press release and our accompanying slides. Given this background, I'll move through my remarks on the quarter quickly, make a few additional points and then finish with the details of our 2016 outlook.
On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was a step up from what we have seen year-to-date with an 8% increase that included 3% added by acquisitions. We had a full impact this quarter from Brand Aromatics and Drogheria & Alimentari and from Stubb's, which was completed toward the end of the quarter.
Slide 16 shows that the base business growth for both the consumer and industrial segments was driven mainly by volume, the result of our product innovation, increased brand marketing, expanded distribution and regional presence and other business building work with our customers.
In the consumer segment, we had 3% constant currency sales growth in the Americas, with about 1/3 of the increase from Stubb's. Base business sales growth in this region was led by higher U.S. sales of spices and seasonings, including Grill Mates and our Lawry’s brand, as well as Gourmet items and Hispanic products. We had good retail sell-through, as Lawrence described, and are encouraged with the trajectory of sales as we head into 2016.
In EMEA, we continue to achieve strong sales performance, up 18% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A, which added 11% to sales growth, expanded distribution in Poland and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
In constant currency, we grew consumer segment sales in China 5%, as Lawrence described, and Australia had a high single-digit sales increase from new distribution and new products in that market.
We indicated last quarter that we were exiting some lower-margin product lines in our Kohinoor portfolio in India. In total, the constant-currency sales decline in Kohinoor's sales lowered our consumer business growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region by 3 percentage points, more than accounting for the volume decline shown on Slide 19.
For the consumer segment in total, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was down 2% from the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 1% from the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and benefit expense.
Turning to our industrial segment. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with unfavorable currency rates. And as Lawrence indicated, this business reached an 11% adjusted operating income margin as the result of our CCI program, scale from higher sales and shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Brand Aromatics.
On Slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 4% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year-ago period was led by U.S. sales of branded food service products as well as customized flavor solutions. Mexico also contributed to the increase with sales of seasonings largely for snack products.
Our industrial business in EMEA capped off an impressive year with constant-currency sales up 14% in the fourth quarter. We are a trusted and valued suppliers, supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia-Pacific region 11% in constant currency. In China, we are benefiting from further recovery in demand from quick service restaurants. And in Australia, our growth includes new product wins with these customers.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment rose 52% from the fourth quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 62% with the factors I already mentioned as spelled out on Slide 25.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 6%. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 10%. In the turnaround from the 3 previous quarters, gross profit margin was up year-on-year in the fourth quarter with a 30 basis point increase. As we move into the fourth quarter, we had the full benefit of our cost savings and pricing actions, along with the benefit of higher sales and higher throughput in our plans. These factors were offset in part by the significant sales increase this period by our industrial segment, which has a lower gross profit margin than our consumer segment.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense was down 40 basis points as a result of our cost savings activity and leverage with higher sales. This includes a 13% fourth quarter increase in brand marketing from the year-ago period.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 29.9%, a bit above our 29% guidance and a significant increase from 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 when we had the benefit of discrete tax items. For the 2015 fiscal year, our tax rate was impacted by several favorable discrete items and ended the year at 26.5%. As we head into 2016, we anticipate a tax rate of approximately 28%.
Despite an unfavorable currency impact for our joint venture in Mexico, income from unconsolidated operations rose slightly this quarter. However, underlying growth remained quite strong, with sales from McCormick de Mexico up 10% in local currency.
At the bottom line, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $1.18, up $0.02 from the year-ago period, mainly due to higher adjusted operating income, partly offset by the higher tax rate. This result included an unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
Turning next to Slide 30. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. As Lawrence shared, our year-to-date cash flow from operations was a record $590 million compared to $504 million in the year-ago period mainly due to working capital improvements. In 2015, we returned $351 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. While dividend payments were up 6%, share repurchases were down from 2014 because of our acquisition activity. Our share repurchases in 2015 contributed to a 1.4% reduction in diluted shares, and we have $567 million remaining on our current $600 million authorization.
During the fourth quarter, we completed a previous $400 million share repurchase program authorized in April of 2013. In the absence of any acquisitions in 2016, we expect to lower our share count by approximately 2%.
During the quarter, we were pleased to complete the issuance of $250 million of 10-year notes at a 3.25% rate in anticipation of long-term debt that was maturing. At year-end, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly above our target range of 1.5 to 1.8, following the financing of our 3 acquisitions completed in 2015.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.
Building on Lawrence's remarks, I'll wrap up with our outlook for continued momentum in sales and profit growth in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate increases in sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that are at or above our long-term objectives, excluding the impact of currency exchange rates. Our current projections are based on prevailing rates, and given the level of currency volatility in the market, we will be updating this outlook for you each quarter.
We expect to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. This includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015 and higher pricing at 1% to 2%. Based on prevailing rates, we estimate an unfavorable impact from currency of about 4 percentage points, which will lower this range to 0 to 2% on a reported basis.
Excluding the impact of currency, our projected increase in adjusted operating income is 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range by about 4 percentage points to 5% to 7%. We expect to drive this increase from higher sales and at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions. Our guidance also includes plans for an increase in brand marketing of at least $20 million and our projection for low single-digit material cost inflation that we should more than offset with our pricing actions and cost reductions.
Our guidance for adjusted earnings per share is $3.65 to $3.72. Excluding the estimated 4 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. This growth rate is in line with our long-term objective.
Some of the other puts and takes behind this projected growth rate are the favorable impacts of higher operating income and further reduction of shares outstanding in the absence of acquisition activity. Expected offsets include the unfavorable currency impact as well as a higher tax rate. Due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates and material cost inflation for our joint venture in Mexico, our 2016 income from unconsolidated operations is likely to be down slightly from 2015.
For the first quarter of 2016, there are several factors that will have an unfavorable impact on our earnings per share. First, we anticipate an impact from currency in the first quarter that could be above the annual estimate since we will not have yet lapped the larger increases in 2015. Second, we have plans to kick off 2016 with enough spend in brand marketing to support our core business as well as new product launches. In addition, we expect a higher year-on-year tax rate. Recall that in the first quarter of 2015, the tax rate was 24.8% as the result of discrete tax items. As a result, EPS in the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be down slightly from $0.70 of adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2015.
For the fiscal year 2016, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for share repurchases and the quarterly dividend increase from $0.40 to $0.43 approved by the board in November. We also have plans for an increased level of capital expenditures in 2016 of $150 million to $160 million. This is up slightly from our normal run rate of 3% of sales and includes a larger manufacturing plant in Shanghai where yet we have outgrown our current facility.
That completes my remarks on our 2016 outlook. So let's open the line for questions."

We had some acquisition-related costs in the U.S. consumer side of things as related to Stubb's, so some of the profit realization was impacted by that. And in total, the gross margin improved. We are continuing to spend up against our brand. You saw the increase in brand marketing of $9 million in the quarter. That's pretty substantial.

But as we have worked with the price elasticity tools and have been able to model the category more robustly, we've identified many areas where there are opportunities for us to adjust our pricing. The price increase that we plan in our U.S. business has really been worked through at quite a granular level on an item-by-item basis. Some items are moving down as well as some items moving up, but the net increase will be in the 1% to 2% range. This has already been taken to our customers, so this is out in the field right now. And we've gotten really no meaningful pushback on it at all. Our basket of commodities is different than the basket of commodities than most of the -- of our peer companies. And there's good cost justification for the increase that we're taking. It's really not around packaging. Packaging is actually kind of in a deflationary mode. It's more around some of our iconic raw materials. And we believe that the cost structure is around those iconic raw materials. If anything, we're better positioned than our direct competitors on those items due to our global sourcing capability. So our competitors would be feeling at same pressures as well."

A great deal of the carnage that happened around us has been more on the modern freight portion of the business. That part of our business is slow as well, but it only accounts for about 20% of our consumer business in China. Much more of our business, in particular, thanks to the acquisition that we did a couple of years ago, is more directed to the interior, to the smaller cities and through more traditional trades outlets. So we have continued to experience quite robust growth of our consumer business in China. For the year, we were up, I think, 11% in China in 2015. It was a little bit slower in the fourth quarter, but some of that was some anticipation of the Chinese New Year promotions that were coming beginning in December, which, for us, is fiscal 2016. I don't want to comment too much on 2016, but our -- the opening of our year in China on the consumer side of our business has been really quite strong. And I focused my remarks on the consumer side because for us, China has really become predominantly a consumer business. Years ago, China was more of an industrial business for us, and that's how we got our foothold there. But with the continued growth of our consumer business and with the addition of the acquisition we did a couple of years ago, that business is now more than -- sorry, it's about 2/3 consumer. I was just there with the China team last week and met with the management over there. Actually, Alan and I went over as part of our internal transition communication. And so it gives an opportunity to meet first hand with the China team. And they continue to be quite optimistic."

If you can somewhat close the gap on your margins relative to your consumer business, I think it can really be a positive for you guys going forward. And I'm curious on how that margin sustainability or even growth from here works, whether it's something that's solely related to mix or if there is some production optimization in there as well. And I think what I'm really trying to get at here is when you think about the ingredients industry and the move by a lot of food and beverage companies towards natural, I think it can really help you guys from a volume standpoint as more and more people use spices and herbs, whether it's for coloring, flavoring, et cetera, but if you can move up the value chain, say, for maybe a bulk spice and herb towards an extract or something like that, maybe you can benefit on the price side and the margin side as well. And so I wanted to ask a question about how the growth or sustainability in margin improvement within industrial goes going forward."

Some parts of your questions, it sounded like you're reading out of some of our internal strategy documents. Certainly, improving the product mix and moving towards flavors and the more value-added, technically differentiated product is part of the margin equation. And the overall trend in our industry towards more natural, less artificial is an important driver of volume for us because this is an area where we think that we've got particular expertise. I think, in our remarks, we indicated that about 40% of the briefs that we get from our customers include some wellness aspect. And this is an area that is an opportunity for us to leverage and is part of driving our margins higher. There are parts of our business that are higher margin than others, and the flavor end and the more technically differentiated end is certainly where the best opportunities are. Gordon, do you want to elaborate on that?"

This is the next step in a well-planned succession that we, together with our board, take a lot of pride in at McCormick.
I'm pleased to be transitioning from my role of CEO at this time. One of my conditions in stepping down was to have the company in great shape with strong financial performance and forward momentum. With our 2015 results and accomplishments and a bullish outlook for 2016, I am very excited about our prospects.

In other leadership news, effective January 1, Malcolm Swift was named President, Global Industrial Segment and McCormick International, adding responsibility for China to his role. Brendan Foley assumed responsibility for the strategic leadership of our consumer business from me and was named President, Global Consumer Segment and North America. In these roles, reporting to me, Brendan and Malcolm will set the strategic and operational goals for our consumer and industrial businesses, respectively, as well as assess performance of the segment leaders in each geographic region against these goals. In addition, Brendan will have geographic responsibility for our North American market and Malcolm for our international markets.
Let's move next to fourth quarter performance. Financial results for this quarter demonstrated that consumer demand for flavor is strong and on the rise and that McCormick has the strategies and the team to drive growth. We had great performance across both segments, and we're particularly pleased with the progress in our U.S. consumer business. The actions we have underway in 2014 and 2015 have led to improved results, and we have good momentum heading into 2016.
For the total company, we reported 2% sales growth. In constant currency, we grew sales 8%, with higher volume and product mix in our base business contributing half of this increase. We grew consumer segment sales 6% in constant currency, with about half of the increase from our base business and half from our acquisitions of Drogheria & Alimentari and Stubb's.
In the Americas, the constant-currency sales increase was 3%, with Stubb's adding about 1/3 of this growth. We were pleased with our results in this period and the further improvement in our U.S. business.
In this market, year-on-year category growth for spices and seasonings remained robust at 5% in the quarter. At 4%, retail takeaway for the McCormick brand was close to the category increase. As seen on Slide 7, we have achieved a sequential increase from 2% growth in the third quarter and 1% in the second quarter.
We had a number of initiatives driving this performance. We launched our digital purity campaign this quarter with the message, ""Pure tastes better,"" to emphasize to consumers the quality of our products, and we continue to help consumers prepare flavorful, healthy meals at www.mccormick.com, which is now one of the top 50 most visited food and lifestyle sites. Across all of our U.S. websites, we attracted a record 32 million visitors in 2015, up 19% from 2014.
Within the spice and seasoning categories, our premium Gourmet line, our 2015 relaunch of this line has been a real success. Since the rollout of the packaging innovation and new varieties, retail sales are up 5%. And, armed with greater category analytics and insights, we had workshop discussions with our top customers of ways to optimize product assortment, pricing and promotion for the spice and seasoning category. For customers that have already taken action based on these discussions, we grew our category share 60 basis points on average during the fourth quarter. At some of these customers, category unit volume was up more than 5%. 
These are great results for our spices and seasoning business. Our investment in brand equity building, strong innovation and to this customer interaction with more robust tools is the way forward for us. As we move into 2016, this work transitions from being a turnaround effort to our everyday approach in building value for our customers and for McCormick.
As for our next largest U.S. category, recipe mixes, November 2015 capped off 26 consecutive months of share gains in this category. We are driving these gains with brand equity building and product innovation like gluten-free items, skillet sauces and slow cooker sauces. Through these efforts, our branded sales accounted for more than 100% of the category growth in both 2014 and 2015.
Our consumer business team in Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, continues to post impressive results led by new distribution in Poland. France also contributed to this increase with higher advertising, including new product support. In 2015, we launched the distinctive line of origin-specific Ducros brand black pepper that was just named new product of the year by the French Product Society.
In constant currency, we grew sales in China 5% in the fourth quarter with some impact from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotions in the first quarter of 2016. For the fiscal year, we grew China consumer sales 12% in constant currency. With nearly 2 months complete, our China consumer business is off to a strong start. And for the fiscal year, we expect to achieve constant-currency sales growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. We see opportunities for further growth of our consumer business in China, especially with the cross-selling of McCormick brand and WAPC brand products.
While we are certainly cautious given the current economic environment, keep in mind that our products are a staple in Chinese cooking, and McCormick has a good penetration in traditional markets and other channels, with modern trade accounting for about 20% of consumer sales in this market.
Turning to the industrial segment. Our sales growth was particularly strong in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period, up 11% in constant currency. This increase was broad based with double-digit growth in each of our 3 regions. While the addition of Brand Aromatics contributed to this increase, we had exceptional growth in our base business with sales up 9%. 
Leading our industrial performance again this quarter, with constant currency sales up 14%, was our team in EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is with quick service restaurants through product expansion, distribution gains and their geographic expansion.
In the Americas region, a double-digit, constant-currency sales increase included 7% added by our base business. In the U.S., our branded food service business had a good quarter, and sales to quick service restaurants showed some improvement from prior periods. It's nearly 1 year since we acquired Brand Aromatics, and we're pleased with the early results from this business. Mexico also contributed to the increase in this region with higher sales of snack seasonings.
In Australia, we grew sales of new industrial products that are shipped from this region mainly to quick service restaurants in the region. In China, we have seen a turnaround from the year-ago period for industrial segment but are also monitoring the macroeconomic impact on this part of our business heading into 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a strong finish to the year with constant-currency sales up at a double-digit rate, including some wins for limited time menu items to our quick service restaurant customers. 
Across both segments, we expected strong fourth quarter sales growth, and our teams around the world delivered.
Fourth quarter profit results were generally in line with our outlook for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, we grew adjusted operating income 10%, and on a reported basis, operating income margin rose 70 basis points. The margin increase was led by the performance in our industrial segment, which reached adjusted operating income margin of 11% this quarter, up 350 basis points from the year-ago period. We're making great progress from our work to shift the portfolio to more value-added products, largely through innovation and from the addition of Brand Aromatics. Also driving margin improvement are our cost savings efforts and the benefits of greater scale in our operations with higher production volume.
Consumer segment adjusted operating income margin declined slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014. We increased brand marketing for this segment 11% this period to build momentum heading into 2016. This rate of increase was well ahead of our 1% reported sales growth for this segment and more than accounted for the lower margin with a 90 basis point impact. This segment also benefited from our progress with cost savings.
As you saw in this morning's press release, and as we guided, adjusted earnings per share was up just slightly from the fourth quarter of 2014 due in part to unfavorable currency rates and the benefit in the year-ago period from favorable discrete tax items. Overall, we're pleased with these fourth quarter results and a strong finish to the year.
I'd like to comment next on fiscal year 2015 in total, starting with our top line increase of 6% in constant currency. 
In our consumer segment, we achieved a turnaround in our base sales in the U.S. from strong performance in international markets. Industrial sales ended the year up 7% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. In addition, we completed 3 great bolt-on acquisitions that contributed about 1% to higher sales. China became our #2 market with robust sales growth of 11% in constant currency. New products launched in the last 3 years comprised 8% of sales this year. As in past years, this contribution from new products supports our long-term sales growth algorithm, which has 1/3 of our top line growth coming from innovation. 
Health and wellness continues to drive our innovation agenda. In addition to developing winning flavors for our industrial customers, globally, approximately 40% of new product briefs also had some type of wellness attribute. In mid-2015, the USDA first recommended spices and herbs as a way to reduce sodium in the diet in recommendations to school nutritionists and to adults over 65. And in early January, this recommendation made its way into the new 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This is consistent with the university research studies sponsored by the McCormick Science Institute and great news for McCormick.
We delivered record cost savings of $98 million in 2015, up 42% from 2014. While this provided an important offset to higher material costs, we also increased our investment in brand marketing with a 6% increase.
Digital marketing is one of our highest-return investments in brand marketing. And in 2015, we continued our shift of marketing spend in this direction, reaching approximately 40% of our advertising spend, up from 10% in 2010. We have established the leadership position in digital and e-commerce, and this was recently recognized by Amazon, which named McCormick Supplier of the Year for Grocery; and by L2, with a #5 ranking of McCormick brand in its Digital IQ Index, #5 out of 114 U.S. food brands.
While adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 was a 3% increase from $3.37 in 2014, we had an estimated 5% impact from unfavorable currency rates. We also overcame significant profit pressure this year from mid-single-digit material cost inflation and higher retirement expense.
The profit performance for our industrial segment was particularly impressive. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was up 24% due to 8% higher sales, cost savings and a shift toward more value-added products, including our Brand Aromatics acquisition. Adjusted operating income margin ended the year at 9.5%, up from 8.3% in 2014.
Our joint ventures achieved great results led by another year of strong performance from McCormick de Mexico. Sales in local currency for this business rose 11% in 2015. In total, income from unconsolidated operations rose 25% and accounted for 9% of our net income this year. Cash flow from operations was also a record, reaching $590 million, a significant increase from the prior high of $504 million in 2014 and driven mainly by working capital improvements. We had good balance in our uses of cash between investments in capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend. In November, McCormick's board approved our 30th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly dividend.
Heading into 2016, we have strong momentum, effective growth initiatives and a lot of excitement. I'll share our plans and outlook, and Gordon will go into -- more in-depth in our financial guidance. We continue to see strong alignment between our business and today's consumers that are seeking bolder flavors, exploring ethnic cuisine, buying more fresh ingredients, focused on wellness and looking for convenience.
Global category growth for our largest category, spices and seasonings, which accounts for about half of our consumer business sales, remains robust at 7% in 2015, and Euromonitor projects annual sales growth of 5% globally through 2020. As the largest player in this category in our major markets, McCormick is on the leading edge of these trends with our Flavor Forecast, our product innovation and our actions to renovate our core business such as the 2016 rollout of non-GMO labeling for 70% of our U.S. spices, seasonings and extracts, and our transition to 80% organic products within our Gourmet line. We expect another year of 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth with increases in our base business, incremental sales from new products and a carryover benefit from acquisitions completed in 2015. 
Our base business will be driven by the category growth of our consumer segment and increased demand for many of the products we flavor for our industrial customers such as snacks and beverages. We continue to support the regional expansion of these customers as well. As an example, a new facility in Dubai will open later this year to establish a local source of supply in the Middle East.
For our consumer segment, we're planning a further increase in brand marketing, approximately $20 million, in support of our business at EMEA, our purity message in the U.S. and globally, our digital programs. Our brand marketing will also build awareness and trials of new products.
Early in 2016, we began the national U.S. rollout of the herb grinders we discussed on our October call. We're getting great retail acceptance. Other product introductions in the first half of the year include new Grill Mates items, including seasoning blends, marinade recipe mixes and a new line of liquid 30-minute marinades.
Playing off of our Flavor Forecast, we're launching 4 new Gourmet healthy blends such as citrus, chili, chia. In fact, in 2015, we have a total of 56 new products globally that tie in with the Flavor Forecast trends that we have identified. And in addition to new Zatarain's seasoned rice mix variety, we're launching convenient portable rice cups.
In international markets, we're rolling out Thai chili sauce in our squeezable pouch in China; new recipe mix varieties across Europe; great new baking decorations for our Vahiné brand in France; and in Canada, consumers will be seeing Herb Grinders and liquid La Grill brand sauces on retail shelves.
We're equally encouraged by a solid pipeline of innovation for our industrial business, much of it in support of large multinational customers. We're also making inroads to new product wins with some rapidly expanding restaurant chains.
Going back to the factors affecting 2016 sales growth. I want to also comment on pricing. In 2015, pricing added about 1% to sales. Together with our cost savings, this helped offset a mid-single-digit increase in material costs. In 2016, we project low single-digit material cost inflation and plan on pricing to be a primary offset at a 1% to 2% rate, with the rate varying by operating unit. For example, in our consumer business in Canada, we executed a high single-digit price -- high single-digit percentage increase in October to recover both material cost increases and an unfavorable currency impact. In the U.S. consumer business, we recently announced a 2016 price increase. We leveraged our category management tools with a more data-driven approach to buy item increases. Across this business, average sales impact is a low single-digit percentage increase, and we expect minimal volume impact.
Across all of our operations around the world, we believe we have the right actions underway in 2016: innovation, brand building, pricing, with the right tools and the right team, to drive sales growth. Employees throughout McCormick are also working to improve productivity, our fuel for growth. We have targeted another year of significant cost savings in 2016 with the goal to achieve at least $95 million. Work is well underway to deliver this amount, which we expect to lead to higher gross profit margin and higher operating income margin for the year. 
However, we operate in what is a still challenging environment for many of our customers: food retailers in our consumer business; and for our industrial business, packaged food and beverage companies as well as restaurants. Also, we expect some further profit pressure from currency, and as I indicated, material cost inflation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, at the bottom line, we project a 9% to 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share from $3.48 in 2015. Gordon will provide more details on our outlook.
But before I turn it over to him, let me summarize. Our 2015 results, including the improvement in our U.S. consumer business, demonstrates the alignment of our business with today's consumer and the effectiveness of our strategies. We are excited about our plans and potential for even greater growth in 2016 with new products, incremental marketing, distribution expansion opportunities and tools for better retail partnership. Our acquisition pipeline is strong, and we have aggressive cost savings programs underway and a culture of participation and high performance. McCormick's focus on growth, performance and people is driving success.
It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon. Gordon?"

I want to take a moment with McCormick's analysts and investors on the call to also recognize Alan for his strong leadership, his friendship and his accomplishments as CEO. It's been an honor and a privilege to be CFO during his tenure and to partner with Alan and the entire executive team steering our strategy and organization and delivering high performance. And Lawrence, I'm looking forward to working with you when you step into this role on February 1. And that's this Monday, in case you needed a reminder.
Lawrence shared some initial remarks on our fourth quarter results, and we provided some financial details in this morning's press release and our accompanying slides. Given this background, I'll move through my remarks on the quarter quickly, make a few additional points and then finish with the details of our 2016 outlook.
On a constant currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was a step up from what we have seen year-to-date with an 8% increase that included 3% added by acquisitions. We had a full impact this quarter from Brand Aromatics and Drogheria & Alimentari and from Stubb's, which was completed toward the end of the quarter.
Slide 16 shows that the base business growth for both the consumer and industrial segments was driven mainly by volume, the result of our product innovation, increased brand marketing, expanded distribution and regional presence and other business building work with our customers.
In the consumer segment, we had 3% constant currency sales growth in the Americas, with about 1/3 of the increase from Stubb's. Base business sales growth in this region was led by higher U.S. sales of spices and seasonings, including Grill Mates and our Lawry’s brand, as well as Gourmet items and Hispanic products. We had good retail sell-through, as Lawrence described, and are encouraged with the trajectory of sales as we head into 2016.
In EMEA, we continue to achieve strong sales performance, up 18% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A, which added 11% to sales growth, expanded distribution in Poland and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
In constant currency, we grew consumer segment sales in China 5%, as Lawrence described, and Australia had a high single-digit sales increase from new distribution and new products in that market.
We indicated last quarter that we were exiting some lower-margin product lines in our Kohinoor portfolio in India. In total, the constant-currency sales decline in Kohinoor's sales lowered our consumer business growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region by 3 percentage points, more than accounting for the volume decline shown on Slide 19.
For the consumer segment in total, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was down 2% from the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 1% from the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and benefit expense.
Turning to our industrial segment. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with unfavorable currency rates. And as Lawrence indicated, this business reached an 11% adjusted operating income margin as the result of our CCI program, scale from higher sales and shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Brand Aromatics.
On Slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 4% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year-ago period was led by U.S. sales of branded food service products as well as customized flavor solutions. Mexico also contributed to the increase with sales of seasonings largely for snack products.
Our industrial business in EMEA capped off an impressive year with constant-currency sales up 14% in the fourth quarter. We are a trusted and valued suppliers, supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia-Pacific region 11% in constant currency. In China, we are benefiting from further recovery in demand from quick service restaurants. And in Australia, our growth includes new product wins with these customers.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment rose 52% from the fourth quarter of 2014. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 62% with the factors I already mentioned as spelled out on Slide 25.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 6%. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 10%. In the turnaround from the 3 previous quarters, gross profit margin was up year-on-year in the fourth quarter with a 30 basis point increase. As we move into the fourth quarter, we had the full benefit of our cost savings and pricing actions, along with the benefit of higher sales and higher throughput in our plans. These factors were offset in part by the significant sales increase this period by our industrial segment, which has a lower gross profit margin than our consumer segment.
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense was down 40 basis points as a result of our cost savings activity and leverage with higher sales. This includes a 13% fourth quarter increase in brand marketing from the year-ago period.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate this quarter was 29.9%, a bit above our 29% guidance and a significant increase from 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 when we had the benefit of discrete tax items. For the 2015 fiscal year, our tax rate was impacted by several favorable discrete items and ended the year at 26.5%. As we head into 2016, we anticipate a tax rate of approximately 28%.
Despite an unfavorable currency impact for our joint venture in Mexico, income from unconsolidated operations rose slightly this quarter. However, underlying growth remained quite strong, with sales from McCormick de Mexico up 10% in local currency.
At the bottom line, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $1.18, up $0.02 from the year-ago period, mainly due to higher adjusted operating income, partly offset by the higher tax rate. This result included an unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
Turning next to Slide 30. We've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. As Lawrence shared, our year-to-date cash flow from operations was a record $590 million compared to $504 million in the year-ago period mainly due to working capital improvements. In 2015, we returned $351 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. While dividend payments were up 6%, share repurchases were down from 2014 because of our acquisition activity. Our share repurchases in 2015 contributed to a 1.4% reduction in diluted shares, and we have $567 million remaining on our current $600 million authorization.
During the fourth quarter, we completed a previous $400 million share repurchase program authorized in April of 2013. In the absence of any acquisitions in 2016, we expect to lower our share count by approximately 2%.
During the quarter, we were pleased to complete the issuance of $250 million of 10-year notes at a 3.25% rate in anticipation of long-term debt that was maturing. At year-end, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly above our target range of 1.5 to 1.8, following the financing of our 3 acquisitions completed in 2015.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.
Building on Lawrence's remarks, I'll wrap up with our outlook for continued momentum in sales and profit growth in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate increases in sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that are at or above our long-term objectives, excluding the impact of currency exchange rates. Our current projections are based on prevailing rates, and given the level of currency volatility in the market, we will be updating this outlook for you each quarter.
We expect to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency. This includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015 and higher pricing at 1% to 2%. Based on prevailing rates, we estimate an unfavorable impact from currency of about 4 percentage points, which will lower this range to 0 to 2% on a reported basis.
Excluding the impact of currency, our projected increase in adjusted operating income is 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range by about 4 percentage points to 5% to 7%. We expect to drive this increase from higher sales and at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions. Our guidance also includes plans for an increase in brand marketing of at least $20 million and our projection for low single-digit material cost inflation that we should more than offset with our pricing actions and cost reductions.
Our guidance for adjusted earnings per share is $3.65 to $3.72. Excluding the estimated 4 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. This growth rate is in line with our long-term objective.
Some of the other puts and takes behind this projected growth rate are the favorable impacts of higher operating income and further reduction of shares outstanding in the absence of acquisition activity. Expected offsets include the unfavorable currency impact as well as a higher tax rate. Due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates and material cost inflation for our joint venture in Mexico, our 2016 income from unconsolidated operations is likely to be down slightly from 2015.
For the first quarter of 2016, there are several factors that will have an unfavorable impact on our earnings per share. First, we anticipate an impact from currency in the first quarter that could be above the annual estimate since we will not have yet lapped the larger increases in 2015. Second, we have plans to kick off 2016 with enough spend in brand marketing to support our core business as well as new product launches. In addition, we expect a higher year-on-year tax rate. Recall that in the first quarter of 2015, the tax rate was 24.8% as the result of discrete tax items. As a result, EPS in the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be down slightly from $0.70 of adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2015.
For the fiscal year 2016, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for share repurchases and the quarterly dividend increase from $0.40 to $0.43 approved by the board in November. We also have plans for an increased level of capital expenditures in 2016 of $150 million to $160 million. This is up slightly from our normal run rate of 3% of sales and includes a larger manufacturing plant in Shanghai where yet we have outgrown our current facility.
That completes my remarks on our 2016 outlook. So let's open the line for questions."

We had some acquisition-related costs in the U.S. consumer side of things as related to Stubb's, so some of the profit realization was impacted by that. And in total, the gross margin improved. We are continuing to spend up against our brand. You saw the increase in brand marketing of $9 million in the quarter. That's pretty substantial.

But as we have worked with the price elasticity tools and have been able to model the category more robustly, we've identified many areas where there are opportunities for us to adjust our pricing. The price increase that we plan in our U.S. business has really been worked through at quite a granular level on an item-by-item basis. Some items are moving down as well as some items moving up, but the net increase will be in the 1% to 2% range. This has already been taken to our customers, so this is out in the field right now. And we've gotten really no meaningful pushback on it at all. Our basket of commodities is different than the basket of commodities than most of the -- of our peer companies. And there's good cost justification for the increase that we're taking. It's really not around packaging. Packaging is actually kind of in a deflationary mode. It's more around some of our iconic raw materials. And we believe that the cost structure is around those iconic raw materials. If anything, we're better positioned than our direct competitors on those items due to our global sourcing capability. So our competitors would be feeling at same pressures as well."

A great deal of the carnage that happened around us has been more on the modern freight portion of the business. That part of our business is slow as well, but it only accounts for about 20% of our consumer business in China. Much more of our business, in particular, thanks to the acquisition that we did a couple of years ago, is more directed to the interior, to the smaller cities and through more traditional trades outlets. So we have continued to experience quite robust growth of our consumer business in China. For the year, we were up, I think, 11% in China in 2015. It was a little bit slower in the fourth quarter, but some of that was some anticipation of the Chinese New Year promotions that were coming beginning in December, which, for us, is fiscal 2016. I don't want to comment too much on 2016, but our -- the opening of our year in China on the consumer side of our business has been really quite strong. And I focused my remarks on the consumer side because for us, China has really become predominantly a consumer business. Years ago, China was more of an industrial business for us, and that's how we got our foothold there. But with the continued growth of our consumer business and with the addition of the acquisition we did a couple of years ago, that business is now more than -- sorry, it's about 2/3 consumer. I was just there with the China team last week and met with the management over there. Actually, Alan and I went over as part of our internal transition communication. And so it gives an opportunity to meet first hand with the China team. And they continue to be quite optimistic."

Really solid growth during the quarter, a really solid margin. And I wanted to ask a question surrounding either driving margins higher or sustaining some of the margin that you saw in Q4, just given the growth profile and potential of the top line there. If you can somewhat close the gap on your margins relative to your consumer business, I think it can really be a positive for you guys going forward. And I'm curious on how that margin sustainability or even growth from here works, whether it's something that's solely related to mix or if there is some production optimization in there as well. And I think what I'm really trying to get at here is when you think about the ingredients industry and the move by a lot of food and beverage companies towards natural, I think it can really help you guys from a volume standpoint as more and more people use spices and herbs, whether it's for coloring, flavoring, et cetera, but if you can move up the value chain, say, for maybe a bulk spice and herb towards an extract or something like that, maybe you can benefit on the price side and the margin side as well. And so I wanted to ask a question about how the growth or sustainability in margin improvement within industrial goes going forward."

McCormick's first quarter results were a great start to the year. We created momentum of the growth strategies throughout 2015 and are building on the strength in 2016. This strength was evidence in our topline growth. We grew a constant currency sales 6% for our consumer segment and 7% for our industrial segment, with increased base business, new products and acquisitions, our 3 drivers of long-term sales growth. We're improving gross profit margin and achieved a 70 basis point increase this period. This was a sequential increase from 30 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ahead of our expectations due in part to unfavorable product mix. 
A big driver of the year-to-year improvement is cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, and our organization and streamlining actions. Employees throughout the company are improving productivity and we have greater confidence in our goal to achieve at least $95 million of cost savings this year. Under Mike's leadership, efforts are underway toward delivering the 4-year $400 million cost reduction target that we announced in February.
We grew first quarter adjusted operating income 12% from the year-ago period on a constant-currency basis led by the higher sales and increased gross profit margin. We'd initially planned a year-on-year increase in brand marketing this period and shifted this timing to second quarter to better coincide with some our new product launches.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 was up 6% from $0.70 in the first quarter of 2015. This includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the underlying increase was quite strong. 
These first quarter results give us increased confidence on our ability to deliver our plans for constant currency growth of 4% to 6% for sales, 9% to 11% for adjusted operating income, and 9% to 11% for adjusted EPS. Each of these growth rates is at or above our long-term objectives.
I'd like to comment next on the recent news about our proposal to acquire Premier Foods. Premier Foods is just one idea in McCormick's robust acquisition pipeline, one that would be a great addition to our business. This acquisition would be consistent with our growth strategy, adding iconic brands that complement our product portfolio, increasing our current scale and presence in the U.K. market and creating potential to drive growth through innovation, marketing and expanded international distribution. We believe our offer is highly attractive for Premier Foods' shareholders and an opportunity to build value from McCormick shareholders. At this stage, given U.K. regulatory restrictions, we're limited in what we can say beyond our recent announcements. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, we will be disciplined about returns and value creation for McCormick shareholders. Now, let's turn to our business update.
Consumer demand for flavor is strong and on the rise. Across generations, flavor remains a #1 driver of food decision, especially among millennials. Slide 6 shows the information we shared at the Cagney Conference. We were pleased to see similar survey results shared by other food companies, many of them customers of our industrial segment.
While taste has remained a constant theme, the food industry is also seeing some significant changes in consumer eating habits, particularly in the U.S. For these trends, McCormick is well positioned to drive growth. There are changes in how we eat. Consumers increasingly want to eat healthy, and spices and herbs, the core of our business, are a healthy way to add flavor. We announced in January that the new 2015, 2020 dietary guidelines for Americans point to herbs and spices as a way to reduce sodium in the diet and we were pleased to see in February a new My Plate for older adults cosponsored by AARP, joined herbs and spices as 1 of 7 recommended food and beverage groups. We're changing what we eat. Fresh ingredients are on the rise. Consumers who are buying more fresh vegetables, seafood and meat are looking for both flavor and convenience. We're meeting this need with current products like Grill Mates, Recipe Mixes and Lawry's and our latest innovation, liquid sauces and herb grinders. 
Consumers are changing why they choose certain brands and product, demanding greater transparency. We're addressing this demand with our message that pure tastes better and consumer information about McCormick's high-quality sourcing and manufacturing standard. As a next step in the U.S., we're in the process of labeling over 70% of McCormick's brand spices, herbs and extracts as rest as non-GMO and transitioning 80% of our Gourmet line to organic this year.
We're even changing when we eat. [indiscernible] have surpassed breakfast and lunch and now rival dinner. Here's where are our industrial segment steps in. As a major supplier to packaged food companies, the largest being Pepsi Co, that are focused on and building this part of their product portfolio.
Our restaurant customers are also developing menu items to meet this demand. Clearly, McCormick is in a great with a portfolio leading brands and industrial flavor solutions that are aligned with today's consumer and developing the insights to adapt to tomorrow's consumer.
I want to turn next to some specific remarks about the growth strategies underway and performance for each of our 2 segments.
Let's start with the consumer segment and our U.S. business. Category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong. In the most recent quarter, retail sales of McCormick brand spices and seasonings continue to grow, reaching a 5% increase. Within this broader category, we grew our core McCormick brand spices and herbs at a category growth rate and we continue to see strong growth for our Gourmet products with retail sales up 6% since our 2015 relaunch. 
Across our entire U.S. product portfolio, we have increased advertising 20% in the last 2 years and are achieving investment returns on our brand marketing that are ahead of industry benchmarks.  Digital marketing has particularly high ROI. In the fourth quarter, we launched our purity campaign, which is getting traction. The video has now been viewed more than 33 million times at a cost of just $0.03 per view. Our video completion rate is 25%, exceeding the industry and our own historic average and is attracting traffic to our website with 43% of traffic coming from millennials. This campaign will continue in 2016. 
In the second quarter, we will also have incremental marketing to build awareness and trial of our new herb grinders. Following the busy holiday period and Super Bowl event, we have reached critical mass with shelf placement in retail and are now ready to launch our marketing support for this innovative and differentiated product.
The latest product launches that we're rolling out include our first line of organic Recipe Mixes, liquid Grill Mates marinades, Zatarain's microwaveable rice cups, Kitchen Basics organic stock, food colors with no artificial dyes and an extension of our Skillet Sauces to a line of oven baked variety. McCormick brand liquid sauces have really taken off with 4 percentage points of category share gains in the first quarter. 
Consumption results have also been excellent for Stubb's, which we have now owned for 6 months. Total Stubb's brand retail sales rose 14% in the latest quarter year-on-year with barbecue sauce sales up even higher at 18%.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we've been building our brand equity with increased marketing support. A double-digit increase in 2015 will be followed by additional support in 2016 for our grilling campaign, Vahine dessert items and core spices and seasoning. Our product introductions this year include Seasoning Blends to create authentic Spanish dishes in the U.K. and new recipe mix varieties in Poland. Premium grinders and bullet into Russia and dessert decorating items in France. 
As a further growth driver in our EMEA region, we continue to benefit from distribution gains in Poland and Russia, and that's an incremental benefit in the first half of this year from our May 2015 acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in Italy. 
We returned to double-digit sales growth in our China consumer business this quarter in constant currency. This followed a 5% constant currency increase in the fourth quarter when we had some impact from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotion. Our holiday promotions were very successful and we achieved double-digit growth in herbs and spices, condiments and our products.
We remain bullish about our prospects for consumer segment growth in this market and in 2016, expect to achieve constant currency sales growth in the high single digits to low double-digit range. 
In other parts of our Asia/Pacific region, our decision to discontinue lower margin product in India is impacting financial results in 2016 with an estimated reduction of about 0.5 percentage point until the company's sale. Excluding this impact, we had a solid first quarter sales performance for our Kohinoor business in India. Adjusted operating income for our consumer segment was up 7% in constant currency in the first quarter that in a stage for better profit growth this year than in 2015. Factors affecting this improved profit performance include higher sales, including better growth in our U.S. business, and lower material cost inflation.
Turning to the industrial segment. We had excellent sales and profit growth in 2015 and this is continued through the first quarter of 2016. Gordon will provide more details, but for the total segment, in constant currency, we grew sales 7% and adjusted operating income 27%. This margin improvement stems from our cost reduction, the scale advantage of higher volume and a more favorable mix, including the acquisition of Brand Aromatics in March 2015 as well as innovation of the more value-added flavors.
Leading our industrial performance again this quarter with another double-digit sales increase in constant currency was our team in the EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is with quick service restaurants through product innovation, distribution gains and their geographic expansion. This geographic expansion includes Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and construction of the new plants in Dubai that we have mentioned before is on schedule to be complete in mid-2016.
Our willingness to support and supply our customers locally is a good example of our strategy to excel at customer intimacy. And as part of the reason, we were most recently named Global Flavor Supplier of 3 top food and beverage company.
In the Americas region, it is almost 1 year since we acquired the Brand Aromatics business and we are pleased to report that it is exceeding our profit expectation and providing other benefits, such as helping to launch organic kitchen basic stocks for our consumer segment.
For the base business in this region, we are encouraged by our current innovation pipeline with customized flavors for food manufacturers, flavors for snack seasonings, beverages, soups and cereals. Sales of snack seasonings were a key driver of our top line growth in the first quarter, especially in Latin America.
In the food service industry, we are supporting recent new product and promotion activity by several current restaurant customers and through our branded food service business, expanding with some new restaurant chains.
Turning to the Asia/Pacific region. We continue to grow industrial sales for our operation in Australia with distribution gains to quick service restaurants in the region. In China, we're a bit cautious due to the effect of the macroeconomic situation as well as the impact of certain headwind space by quick service restaurants in recent years. On the positive side, these customers are continuing to invest in this market with innovation, new location and marketing. 
Let me summarize by restating that our first quarter financial results across both our consumer and industrial segments were a strong start to 2016, and we've increased confidence in our fiscal year outlook. Consumer demand for flavor is growing globally. At McCormick, we're well positioned to meet this demand with effective growth strategy and on-trend product portfolio, experienced business leaders and engaged employees. 
It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon."

Our adjusted",1513,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to discuss our first quarter results followed by comments on our current 2016 financial outlook.
We've started the year with strong sales growth and higher adjusted earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share result was ahead of our first quarter guidance due to a timing shift for brand marketing and discrete tax benefits.
Let's turn to our top line results as seen on Slide 16. On a constant-currency basis, we grew sales 7%. The incremental impact of the acquisitions completed in 2015 was 3%. We drove the other 4% with higher volume and product mix and to a lesser extent, from pricing actions that we took in response to higher material cost. Constant currency sales growth for each of our 2 segments was in a 6% to 7% range and driven by contributions from these same 3 factors, volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing.
On Slide 17, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 4% in constant currency with about 1/3 of the increase from Stubb's. Base business sales growth in this region was led by higher U.S. sales of core spices and herbs, Lawry's brand, Hispanic items and Simply Asia products. These increases were offset in part this period by lower sales of certain economy products in the U.S. Also, volumes and mix declines in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related in part to currency pressure.
In EMEA, we continue to achieve strong sales performance, up 14% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A, which added 10% to sales growth as well expanded distribution Poland and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 5% in constant currency. We grew constant currency sales in China 12% with a broad based increase across a number of product categories in both our McCormick brand and brands added with the acquisition of Asia-Pacific Condiments in 2013. Sales this period were unfavorably impacted by our decision to discontinue certain low-margin Kohinoor products in India, as Lawrence described. The reduced sales from our business in India lowered our growth rate in this region by 4 percentage points this quarter.
For the consumer segment in total, our first quarter adjusted operating income rose 3% to $94 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 7% from the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting higher material costs and employee benefit expense this period.
Turning to our industrial segment. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with the impact of unfavorable currency rates, and adjusted operating income margin rose to 9.2% from 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015, the result of our CCI program, scale from higher sales and a shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Brand Aromatics.
On Slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 3% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year-ago period was led by sales of snack seasonings with particularly strong growth in the Latin American market from our operation based in Mexico.
The excellent performance of our industrial business in EMEA continued into the first quarter with constant currency sales up 11%. As Lawrence described, we are benefiting from our strong customer relationships with leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers supporting their growth and geographic expansion in this region.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region 3% in constant currency. We drove higher sales to quick service restaurants in the region from our operations in both China and Australia.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 19% at $36 million. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 27% with the factors I already mentioned and as spelled out on Slide 25.
Our expectation for the fiscal year is to increase adjusted operating income for the industrial segment in line with our guidance for the total company. Clearly, the first quarter result came in ahead of this outlook and we expect further quarter-to-quarter fluctuation as a result of customer demand patterns and other factors.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges rose 7% in the first quarter from the year-ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 12%, which is just above our 2016 guidance range.
Gross profit margin was up year-on-year as well with a 70 basis point increase. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix, scale benefits from higher sales, and pricing actions taken to offset moderate cost inflation.
As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expense was comparable to the first quarter of 2015. During this period, we had a favorable impact from several factors that included our cost savings activity. This was offset by the impact of unfavorable factors that included increases in certain employee benefits expense and a $1 million increase in brand marketing.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 26.9% compared to 24.8% in the year-ago period. This first quarter 2016 tax rate was below our guidance for the year of approximately 28% due to discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect the full-year rate to approximate 28%. Note that excluding the impact of special charges, the tax rate for the first quarter 2016 and first quarter 2015 were more comparable.
As the result of unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations declined 15% to $8 million. This currency impact masked a underlying performance led by our joint venture in Mexico, which had a mid-single digit increase in both sales and net income excluding the impact of currency.
At the bottom line, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.74, up $0.04 from the year-ago period mainly due to higher adjusted operating income. This result included the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
On Slide 30, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $78 million compared to $96 million in the year-ago period. An increase in net income was offset mainly by the timing of payments for raw material purchases.
We returned $102 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $22 million for capital expenditures this period.  At the end of the first quarter, $522 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.
Let's move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged except for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Based on prevailing rates, we now estimate an impact to the growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share of 3%, down from our initial estimate of 4%.
At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency, which includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015 and higher pricing of 1% to 2%.  Including the impact of currency, the projected sales growth is 1% to 3%.
On a constant-currency basis, we continue to expect to increase adjusted operating income 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range to 6% to 8%. We plan to drive this increase with higher sales and at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions. With this fuel for growth, we plan to increase brand marketing at least $20 million.
Due to the lower impact from currency, our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share has increased by $0.03 to $3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range remains an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015.  In the second quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be slightly below $0.75 of adjusted earnings per share in the year-ago period. This is due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates, increased brand marketing and a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that we had a particularly low tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 at 16% on a GAAP basis and a bit higher on a non-GAAP basis but still below our outlook of approximately 28% for the fiscal year 2016.
As a final remark in our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016 with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.

What strike me as different here is that it's quite big, which is a from the bolt-on acquisitions you done in the past. It's based in the U.K., which frankly even though I'm from there, doesn't strike me as a particularly attractive market, and it's moving out of your core of spices and seasonings into more regular slower growth categories. So maybe if you could just comment on if not this, are these the kind of criteria that you're focused on? And then as a really, really short follow-up, a number of other companies have announced that they will be labeling products that are containing GMO in addition to what you're doing, which is labeling the products that are not containing GMO or GMO free, and the result of the labeling legislations kicking in in the middle of the year, how are you planning to deal with that?"

This is Lawrence here. And first of all, as we look at the Premier business, there is -- we're pretty limited in what we can say, but I can tell you that what is attractive to us about this business is that it is still predominantly a flavor business with some terrific, iconic flavor brand that are much loved in the U.K. I'm sure that you're very familiar with these brands yourself. Gordon, Mike and I have lived in the U.K. ourselves and know that brands like [indiscernible] these are fantastic brands that are much loved and by U.K. consumers and are widely consumed and we see this flavor business. Our flavor portfolio on the consumer side is not just herbs, spices and seasonings. We have sauces in many parts of the world. We're launching cooking sauces in North America. We have over the last 2 years. And so, we see the brands in the Premier portfolio as being very complementary to the flavor businesses that we  the flavor business that we have and are building globally. Now with the brands that are very close to India, we're looking at a whole company. And so, there are some brands that are not on their base core to our business, but I'd remind you that we have a strong dessert business on the continent with homemade dessert products through the Vahine brand and a fairly good part of our U.S. business is based on cooking and baking products anyway as well. So we feel pretty good about the fit. It is bigger than the bolt-on acquisitions that we have had done so many of, and I think we've been signaling really for several months now that we were going to look at some bigger opportunities in addition to the bolt-on opportunities. Now this would use a fair bit of our financial capacity, but it wouldn't take us out of the market to do the kind of strategically important bolt-ons that we might still -- we might have done otherwise. And as far as the U.K. market goes, one of the things that we are interested in as part of our acquisition program is adding scale where we already have a strong business presence. And certainly, the U.K. is a market where we have good presence with our Schwartz brand and have for many years a strong relationships with our customers there. It's also the home of our EMEA business. Our EMEA regional headquarters is in the U.K. and so, we have substantial infrastructure resources there to handle an asset like this. Your second question was about GMO labeling. We announced that we were going to label our products were non-GMO. We're taking credit for what we have to a great extent. The vast majority of our products or our herbs and spices products in particular our not genetically modified in any way and consumers are interested in transparency and that's what led to that initiative. And we're certainly well aware of the law, we don't have any kind of particular public stance that we want to take on that other that we're going to comply with the law. So where there are genetically modified materials in some of our products, we will either find a way to remove them or label them as it's appropriate in order to put us into compliance with that law."

There's really nothing dramatic here. It's just around the actual retail execution, predominantly on our herb grinders. As we work through the holiday season and the Super Bowl season, the on-shelf placement of those product was a little bit slower than we anticipated at the very beginning of the year. And so, we've shifted the spend out a bit further to coincide with the retail distribution. Not a particularly problem, just the timing of it.

I think because of that, even assuming an all stock deal, this is a deal, which could almost double the net debt of the group.

While it is significantly large, if you go back in our history and you look at, you back in 2000 and you look at Lawry's as 2008. On a percentage of our market cap and the size of the company, it's really not quite different from those sized transactions. So our intention, as we did in those 2 previous transactions, would be to lever up. Obviously, it will take our debt-to-EBITDA above where it is now, but it wouldn't be at a level that would be unlike where we were with Lawry's and at that time.

McCormick's first quarter results were a great start to the year. We created momentum of the growth strategies throughout 2015 and are building on the strength in 2016. 
This strength was evident in our top line growth. We grew constant-currency sales 6% for our consumer segment and 7% for our industrial segment, with increased base business, new products and acquisitions, our 3 drivers of long-term sales growth. We are improving gross profit margin and achieved a 70 basis point increase this period. This was a sequential increase from 30 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ahead of our expectations due in part to favorable product mix. 
A big driver of the year-to-year improvement is cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, and our organization and streamlining actions. Employees throughout the company are improving productivity, and we have greater confidence in our goal to achieve at least $95 million of cost savings this year. Under Mike's leadership, efforts are underway toward delivering the 4-year $400 million cost reduction target that we announced in February.
We grew first quarter adjusted operating income 12% from the year ago period on a constant currency basis, led by the higher sales and increased gross profit margin. We'd initially planned a year-on-year increase in brand marketing this period but shifted this timing to second quarter to better coincide with some of our new product launches.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 was up 6% from $0.70 in the first quarter of 2015. This includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and the underlying increase was quite strong. 
These first quarter results give us increased confidence in our ability to deliver our plans for constant-currency growth of 4% to 6% for sales, 9% to 11% for adjusted operating income and 9% to 11% for adjusted EPS. Each of these growth rates is at or above our long-term objectives.
I'd like to comment next on the recent news about our proposal to acquire Premier Foods. Premier Foods is just one idea in McCormick's robust acquisition pipeline, one that would be a great addition to our business. This acquisition would be consistent with our growth strategy, adding iconic brands that complement our product portfolio, increasing our current scale and presence in the U.K. market and creating potential to drive growth through innovation, marketing and expanded international distribution. We believe our offer is highly attractive for Premier Foods shareholders and an opportunity to build value for McCormick shareholders. 
At this stage, given U.K. regulatory restrictions, we're limited in what we can say beyond our recent announcements. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, we will be disciplined about returns and value creation for McCormick shareholders. 
Now let's turn to a business update. Consumer demand for flavor is strong and on the rise. Across generations, flavor remains the #1 driver of food decision, especially among millennials. Slide 6 shows the information we shared at the CAGNY conference, and we were pleased to see similar survey results shared by other food companies, many of them customers of our industrial segment. While taste has remained a constant theme, the food industry is also seeing some significant changes in consumer eating habits, particularly in the U.S. For these trends, McCormick is well positioned to drive growth. 
There are changes in how we eat. Consumers increasingly want to eat healthy, and spices and herbs, the core of our business, are a healthy way to add flavor. We announced in January that the new 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans point to herbs and spices as a way to reduce sodium in the diet. And we were pleased to see in February a new MyPlate for Older Adults cosponsored by AARP joined herbs and spices as 1 of 7 recommended food and beverage groups. 
We're changing what we eat. Fresh ingredients are on the rise. Consumers who are buying more fresh vegetables, seafood and meat are looking for both flavor and convenience. We're meeting this need with current products like Grill Mates, recipe mixes and Lawry's and our latest innovation, liquid sauces and herb grinders. 
Consumers are changing why they choose certain brands and product, demanding greater transparency. We're addressing this demand with our message that pure tastes better and consumer information about McCormick's high-quality sourcing and manufacturing standard. As a next step, in the U.S., we are in the process of labeling over 70% of McCormick brand spices, herbs and extracts as non-GMO and transitioning 80% of our Gourmet line to organic this year.
We're even changing when we eat. Snacking occasions have surpassed breakfast and lunch and now rival dinner. Here is where our industrial segment steps in. As a major supplier to packaged food companies, the largest being PepsiCo, that are focused on and building this part of their product portfolio.
Our restaurant customers are also developing menu items to meet this demand. Clearly, McCormick is in a great position with a portfolio of leading brands and industrial flavor solutions that are aligned with today's consumer and developing the insights to adapt to tomorrow's consumer.
I want to turn next to some specific remarks about the growth strategies underway and performance for each of our 2 segments.
Let's start with the consumer segment and our U.S. business. Category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong. In the most recent quarter, retail sales of McCormick brand spices and seasonings continued to grow, reaching a 5% increase. Within this broader category, we grew our core McCormick brand spices and herbs at the category growth rate, and we continue to see strong growth for our Gourmet products, with retail sales up 6% since our 2015 relaunch. 
Across our entire U.S. product portfolio, we have increased advertising 20% in the last 2 years and are achieving investment returns on our brand marketing that are ahead of industry benchmarks. 
Digital marketing has particularly high ROI. In the fourth quarter, we launched our purity campaign, which is gaining traction. The video has now been viewed more than 33 million times at a cost of just $0.03 per view. Our video completion rate is 25%, exceeding the industry and our own historic average. And it is attracting traffic to our website, with 43% of traffic coming from millennials. This campaign will continue in 2016. 
In the second quarter, we will also have incremental marketing to build awareness and trial of our new herb grinders. Following the busy holiday period and Super Bowl event, we have reached critical mass with shelf placement at retail and are now ready to launch our marketing support for this innovative and differentiated product.
The latest product launches that we're rolling out include our first line of organic recipe mixes, liquid Grill Mates marinades, Zatarain's microwaveable rice cups, Kitchen Basics organic stock, food colors with no artificial dyes and an extension of our Skillet Sauces to a line of oven-baked variety. McCormick brand liquid sauces have really taken off, with 4 percentage points of category share gain in the first quarter. 
Consumption results have also been excellent for Stubb's, which we have now owned for 6 months. Total Stubb's brand retail sales rose 14% in the latest quarter year-on-year, with barbecue sauce sales up even higher at 18%.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we've been building our brand equity with increased marketing support. A double-digit increase in 2015 will be followed by additional support in 2016 for our grilling campaign, Vahine dessert items and core spices and seasonings. Our product introductions this year include Seasoning Blends to create authentic Spanish dishes in the U.K. and new recipe mix varieties in Poland; premium grinders in France, Poland and Russia; and dessert decorating items in France. 
As a further growth driver in our EMEA region, we continue to benefit from distribution gains in Poland and Russia and have some incremental benefit in the first half of this year from our May 2015 acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in Italy. 
We returned to double-digit sales growth in our China consumer business this quarter in constant currency. This followed a 5% constant-currency increase in the fourth quarter when we had some impact from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotion. Our holiday promotions were very successful, and we achieved double-digit growth in herbs and spices, condiments and our bullion product.
We remain bullish about our prospects for consumer segment growth in this market and, in 2016, expect to achieve constant-currency sales growth in a high single-digit to low double-digit rate. 
In other parts of our Asia/Pacific region, our decision to discontinue lower-margin product in India is impacting financial results in 2016 with an estimated reduction of about 0.5 percentage point on total company sale. Excluding this impact, we had a solid first quarter sales performance for our Kohinoor business in India. 
Adjusted operating income for our consumer segment was up 7% in constant currency in the first quarter, setting the stage for better profit growth this year than in 2015. Factors affecting this improved profit performance include higher sales, including better growth in our U.S. business, and lower material cost inflation.
Turning to the industrial segment. We had excellent sales and profit growth in 2015, and this is continued through the first quarter of 2016. Gordon will provide more details, but for the total segment, in constant currency, we grew sales 7% and adjusted operating income 27%. This margin improvement stems from our cost reduction, the scale advantage of higher volume and a more favorable mix, including the acquisition of Brand Aromatics in March 2015 as well as innovation with more value-added flavors.
Leading our industrial performance again this quarter with another double-digit sales increase in constant currency was our team in the EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is with quick-service restaurants through product innovation, distribution gains and their geographic expansion. This geographic expansion includes Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and construction of the new plant in Dubai that we have mentioned before is on schedule to be complete in mid-2016.
Our willingness to support and supply our customers locally is a good example of our strategy to excel at customer intimacy. And as part of the reason, we were most recently named Global Flavor Supplier of 3 top food and beverage company.
In the Americas region, it is almost 1 year since we acquired the Brand Aromatics business, and we are pleased to report that it is exceeding our profit expectation and providing other benefits, such as helping to launch organic Kitchen Basics stocks for our consumer segment.
For the base business in this region, we are encouraged by our current innovation pipeline with customized flavors for food manufacturers, flavors for snack seasonings, beverages, soups and cereals. Sales of snack seasonings were a key driver of our top line growth in the first quarter, especially in Latin America.
In the food service industry, we're supporting recent new product and promotion activity by several current restaurant customers and, through our branded food service business, expanding with some new restaurant chains.
Turning to the Asia/Pacific region. We continue to grow industrial sales for our operation in Australia with distribution gains to quick-service restaurants in the region. In China, we're a bit cautious due to the effects of the macroeconomic situation as well as the impact of certain headwinds faced by quick-service restaurants in recent years. On the positive side, these customers are continuing to invest in this market with innovation, new location and marketing. 
Let me summarize by restating that our first quarter financial results across both our consumer and industrial segments were a strong start to 2016, and we've increased confidence in our fiscal year outlook. Consumer demand for flavor is growing globally. At McCormick, we're well positioned to meet this demand, with effective growth strategies and on-trend product portfolio, experienced business leaders and engaged employees. 
It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon."

I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, followed by comments on our current 2016 financial outlook.We've started the year with strong sales growth and higher adjusted earnings per share. Our adjusted",1520,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, followed by comments on our current 2016 financial outlook.
We've started the year with strong sales growth and higher adjusted earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share result was ahead of our first quarter guidance due to a timing shift for brand marketing and discrete tax benefits.
Let's turn to our top line results as seen on Slide 16. On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 7%. The incremental impact of the acquisitions completed in 2015 was 3%. We drove the other 4% with higher volume and product mix and, to a lesser extent, from pricing actions that we took in response to higher material cost. Constant-currency sales growth for each of our 2 segments was in a 6% to 7% range and driven by contributions from these same 3 factors: volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing.
On Slide 17, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 4% in constant currency, with about 1/3 of the increase from Stubb's. Base business sales growth in this region was led by higher U.S. sales of core spices and herbs, Lawry's brand, Hispanic items and Simply Asia products. These increases were offset in part this period by lower sales of certain economy products in the U.S. Also, volume and mix declined in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related in part to currency pressure.
In EMEA, we continue to achieve strong sales performance, up 14% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A, which added 10% to sales growth as well as expanded distribution in Poland and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 5% in constant currency. We grew constant-currency sales in China 12%, with a broad-based increase across a number of product categories in both our McCormick brand and brands added with the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments in 2013. Sales this period were unfavorably impacted by our decision to discontinue certain low-margin Kohinoor products in India, as Lawrence described. The reduced sales from our business in India lowered our growth rate in this region by 4 percentage points this quarter.
For the consumer segment in total, our first quarter adjusted operating income rose 3% to $94 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 7% from the year ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting higher material costs and employee benefit expense this period.
Turning to our industrial segment. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with the impact of unfavorable currency rates. And adjusted operating income margin rose to 9.2% from 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015, the result of our CCI program, scale from higher sales and a shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Brand Aromatics.
On Slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 3% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year ago period was led by sales of snack seasonings, with particularly strong growth in the Latin American market from our operation based in Mexico.
The excellent performance of our industrial business in EMEA continued into the first quarter, with constant-currency sales up 11%. As Lawrence described, we are benefiting from our strong customer relationships with leading quick-service restaurants and food manufacturers supporting their growth and geographic expansion in this region.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region 3% in constant currency. We drove higher sales to quick-service restaurants in the region from our operations in both China and Australia.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 19% at $36 million. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 27% with the factors I already mentioned and as spelled out on Slide 25.
Our expectation for the fiscal year is to increase adjusted operating income for the industrial segment in line with our guidance for the total company. Clearly, the first quarter result came in ahead of this outlook, and we expect further quarter-to-quarter fluctuation as a result of customer demand patterns and other factors.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 7% in the first quarter from the year ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 12%, which is just above our 2016 guidance range.
Gross profit margin was up year-on-year as well with a 70 basis point increase. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix, scale benefits from higher sales and pricing actions taken to offset moderate cost inflation.
As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expense was comparable to the first quarter of 2015. During this period, we had a favorable impact from several factors that included our cost savings activity. This was offset by the impact of unfavorable factors that included increases in certain employee benefits expense and a $1 million increase in brand marketing.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 26.9% compared to 24.8% in the year ago period. This first quarter 2016 tax rate was below our guidance for the year of approximately 28% due to discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect the full year rate to approximate 28%. Note that excluding the impact of special charges, the tax rate for the first quarter 2016 and first quarter 2015 were more comparable.
As the result of unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations declined 15% to $8 million. This currency impact masked a strong underlying performance led by our joint venture in Mexico, which had a mid-single-digit increase in both sales and net income, excluding the impact of currency.
At the bottom line, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.74, up $0.04 from the year ago period mainly due to higher adjusted operating income. This result included the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
On Slide 30, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $78 million compared to $96 million in the year ago period. An increase in net income was offset mainly by the timing of payments for raw material purchases.
We returned $102 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $22 million for capital expenditures this period. At the end of the first quarter, $522 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.
Let's move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged except for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Based on prevailing rates, we now estimate an impact to the growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share of 3%, down from our initial estimate of 4%.
At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency, which includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015 and higher pricing of 1% to 2%. Including the impact of currency, the projected sales growth is 1% to 3%.
On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect to increase adjusted operating income 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range to 6% to 8%. We plan to drive this increase with higher sales and at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions. With this fuel for growth, we plan to increase brand marketing at least $20 million.
Due to the lower impact from currency, our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share has increased by $0.03 to $3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range remains an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. 
In the second quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be slightly below $0.75 of adjusted earnings per share in the year ago period. This is due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates, increased brand marketing and a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that we had a particularly low tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 at 16% on a GAAP basis and a bit higher on a non-GAAP basis but still below our outlook of approximately 28% for the fiscal year 2016.
As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016, with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.
That completes my remarks. So let's now turn it over for your questions."

I know you can't comment on the Premier Foods bid specifically or not very much, but just philosophically, about your plans for acquisitions from here on out, you said that there other possible deals in the pipeline. What strikes me as different here is that it's quite big, which is a break from the bolt-on acquisitions you've done in the past. It's based in the U.K., which, frankly, even though I'm from there, doesn't strike me as a particularly attractive market, and it's moving out of your core set of spices and seasonings into more regular slower-growth categories. So maybe if you could just comment on, if not this, are these the kind of criteria that you're focused on? And then as a really, really short follow-up, a number of other companies have announced that they will be labeling products that are containing GMO in addition to what -- obviously what you're doing, which is labeling the products that are not containing GMO or GMO free. In advance of the Vermont labeling legislation kicking in, in the middle of the year, how are you planning to deal with that?"

And first of all, as we look at the Premier business, there is -- and we're pretty limited in what we can say, but I can tell you that the -- that what is attractive to us about this business is that it is still predominantly a flav",581,"This is Lawrence here. And first of all, as we look at the Premier business, there is -- and we're pretty limited in what we can say, but I can tell you that the -- that what is attractive to us about this business is that it is still predominantly a flavor business with some terrific, iconic flavor brands that are much loved in the U.K. I'm sure that you're very familiar with these brands yourself. Gordon, Mike and I have lived in the U.K. ourselves and know that brands like Bisto, OXO, Saxa, Sharwood's, these are fantastic brands that are much loved and -- by U.K. consumers and are widely consumed. And we see them as flavor businesses. Our flavor portfolio on the consumer side is not just herbs, spices and seasonings. We have sauces in many parts of the world. We're launching cooking sauces in North America. We have over the last few years. And so we see the brands in the Premier portfolio as being very complementary to the flavor businesses that we -- the flavor business that we have and are building globally. With the brands that are very close to India, we're looking at a whole company. And so there are some brands that are not on their base core to our business, but I'd remind you that we have a strong dessert business on the continent with homemade dessert products through the Vahine brand, and a fairly good part of our U.S. business is based on cooking and baking products anyway as well. So we feel pretty good about the fit. It is bigger than the bolt-on acquisitions that we have done so many of. And I think we've been signaling really for several months now that we were going to look at some bigger opportunities in addition to the bolt-on opportunities. This would use a fair bit of our financial capacity, but it wouldn't take us out of the market to do the kind of strategically important bolt-ons that we might still -- that we might have done otherwise. And as far as the U.K. market goes, one of the things that we are interested in as part of our acquisition program is adding scale where we already have a strong business presence. And certainly, the U.K. is a market where we have good presence with our Schwartz brand and have for many years and have strong relationships with our customers there. It's also the home of our EMEA business. Our EMEA regional headquarters is in the U.K., and so we have substantial infrastructure and resources there to -- that handle an asset like this. Your second question was about GMO labeling, and our -- we announced that we were going to label our products were non-GMO. We're taking credit for what we have to a great extent. The vast majority of our products or our herbs and spices products in particular are not genetically modified in any way, and consumers are interested in transparency, and that's what led to that initiative. And we're certainly well aware of the Vermont law. We don't have any kind of particular public stance that we want to take on that other than that we're going to comply with the law. So where there are genetically modified materials in some of our products, we will either find a way to remove them or label them as it's appropriate in order to put us into compliance with that law."

There's really nothing dramatic here. It's just around the actual retail execution predominantly on our herb grinders. As we work through the holiday season and the Super Bowl season, the on-shelf placement of those products was a little bit slower than we anticipated at the very beginning of the year. And so we've shifted the spend out a bit further to coincide with the retail distribution. Not a particular problem, that's just the timing of it. And so we still believe that we'll deliver on that brand marketing increase that we talked about in our initial guidance for the year. Gordon, do you want to elaborate on that?"

I'm obviously aware that there's a limit to what you can say there, but I think the very first thing that I'd be interested just to hear is the potential impact of this transaction on your credit rating. I mean, if we look at Premier Foods right now, I mean, in U.S. dollar terms a second, excluding the pension deficit, I may get about $930 million of net debt coupled with a pension deficit of GBP 416 million, just roughly $600 million, resulting in a total additional net debt of almost USD 1.5 billion. I think because of that, even assuming an all-stock deal, this is a deal which could almost double the net debt of the group. I think what I'd be interested to get your -- to get some kind of guidance on is firstly, whether or not you feel you can preserve your investment-grade credit rating if your net debt were to increase that materially, and secondly, whether or not it would make sense after acquiring Premier Foods, the Premier Foods legal entity to still issue its own bonds and to set out by the restricted group that currently contains all the assets that are referenceable into the McCormick bond restricted group in order to preserve the investment-grade ratings of those bonds?"

In terms of your first question, I'll just point to our historical track record around when we have done large acquisitions and the debt capacity that we have. We pride ourselves in our investment-grade rating, and our full intention is to maintain our investment-grade rating, and we believe we can achieve that through this transaction. While it is significantly large, if you go back in our history and you look at Ducros back in 2000 and you look at Lawry's as recently as 2008, on a percentage of our market cap and the size of the company, it's really not quite different from those size transaction. So our intention, as we did in those 2 previous transactions, would be to lever up. Obviously, it'll take our debt to EBITDA above where it is now, but it wouldn't be at a level that would be unlike where we were with Lawry's and Ducros at that time. And as we did in the past, we would curtail our share buyback program to pay down that debt and return to our investment-grade rating. So that is how we would finance this acquisition, and again, it would be very much in line with previous deals."

But I think currently, the credit market is quite concerned about a deal which, even on an all-stock basis, could quite easily more than double the net debt of the group.

I think the second question I wanted to ask was more about the EPS impact of the deal and the potential of this deal to be accretive maybe in the future. Whilst I suppose, given the material discrepancy in terms of your P/E ratio versus the Premier Foods P/E ratio, that could imply the deal to be quite accretive, I suppose some concerns that many of -- that your investors have right now is, firstly, the impact of the pension deficit. And I've got the Premier Foods legal entity a pension deficit of GBP 416 million, which, in U.S. dollar terms, gets me to a little bit under $600 million. Premier Foods' management team announced that even though in 2015, they had a partial holiday from making any addition deficit contribution, the total cash outflow due to servicing the pension debt, it will increase the GBP 14 million to GBP 16 million this year and will go up to almost GBP 60 million, that's 6-0 million, in 2016 and '17. I suppose, how concerned are you about the EPS impact of, one, a material payment the group will need to make moving forward to service a very large pension deficit; secondly, the impact of the U.K. minimum wage on the large fixed cost base of the group, given the fact that there are large numbers of U.K. employees, do you see that weighting [indiscernible]..."

McCormick's first quarter results were a great start to the year. We created momentum with our growth strategies throughout 2015 and are building on this strength in 2016. 
This strength was evident in our top line growth. We grew constant-currency sales 6% for our consumer segment and 7% for our industrial segment, with increased base business, new products and acquisitions, our 3 drivers of long-term sales growth. We are improving gross profit margin and achieved a 70 basis point increase this period. This was a sequential increase from 30 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ahead of our expectations due in part to favorable product mix. 
A big driver of the year-to-year improvement is cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, and our organization and streamlining actions. Employees throughout the company are improving productivity, and we have greater confidence in our goal to achieve at least $95 million of cost savings this year. Under Mike's leadership, efforts are underway toward delivering the 4-year $400 million cost reduction target that we announced in February.
We grew first quarter adjusted operating income 12% from the year ago period on a constant currency basis, led by the higher sales and increased gross profit margin. We'd initially planned a year-on-year increase in brand marketing this period but shifted this timing to second quarter to better coincide with some of our new product launches.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 was up 6% from $0.70 in the first quarter of 2015. This includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and the underlying increase was quite strong. 
These first quarter results give us increased confidence in our ability to deliver our plans for constant-currency growth of 4% to 6% for sales, 9% to 11% for adjusted operating income and 9% to 11% for adjusted EPS. Each of these growth rates is at or above our long-term objectives.
I'd like to comment next on the recent news about our proposal to acquire Premier Foods. Premier Foods is just one idea in McCormick's robust acquisition pipeline, one that would be a great addition to our business. This acquisition would be consistent with our growth strategy, adding iconic brands that complement our product portfolio, increasing our current scale and presence in the U.K. market and creating potential to drive growth through innovation, marketing and expanded international distribution. We believe our offer is highly attractive for Premier Foods shareholders and an opportunity to build value for McCormick shareholders. 
At this stage, given U.K. regulatory restrictions, we're limited in what we can say beyond our recent announcement. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, we will be disciplined about returns and value creation for McCormick shareholders. 
Now let's turn to a business update. Consumer demand for flavor is strong and on the rise. Across generations, flavor remains the #1 driver of food decision, especially among millennials. Slide 6 shows the information we shared at the CAGNY conference, and we were pleased to see similar survey results shared by other food companies, many of them customers of our industrial segment. While taste has remained a constant theme, the food industry is also seeing some significant changes in consumer eating habits, particularly in the U.S. For these trends, McCormick is well positioned to drive growth. 
There are changes in how we eat. Consumers increasingly want to eat healthy, and spices and herbs, the core of our business, are a healthy way to add flavor. We announced in January that the new 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans point to herbs and spices as a way to reduce sodium in the diet. And we were pleased to see in February a new MyPlate for Older Adults cosponsored by AARP showing herbs and spices as 1 of 7 recommended food and beverage groups. 
We're changing what we eat. Fresh ingredients are on the rise. Consumers who are buying more fresh vegetables, seafood and meat are looking for both flavor and convenience. We're meeting this need with current products like Grill Mates, recipe mixes and Lawry's and our latest innovation of liquid sauces and herb grinders. 
Consumers are changing why they choose certain brands and product, demanding greater transparency. We're addressing this demand with our message that pure tastes better and consumer information about McCormick's high-quality sourcing and manufacturing standard. As a next step, in the U.S., we are in the process of labeling over 70% of McCormick brand spices, herbs and extracts as non-GMO and transitioning 80% of our gourmet line to organic this year.
We're even changing when we eat. Snacking occasions have surpassed breakfast and lunch and now rival dinner. Here is where our industrial segment steps in. As a major supplier to packaged food companies, the largest being PepsiCo, that are focused on and building this part of their product portfolio.
Our restaurant customers are also developing menu items to meet this demand. Clearly, McCormick is in a great position with a portfolio of leading brands and industrial flavor solutions that are aligned with today's consumer and developing the insights to adapt to tomorrow's consumer.
I want to turn next to some specific remarks about the growth strategies underway and performance for each of our 2 segments.
Let's start with the consumer segment and our U.S. business. Category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong. In the most recent quarter, retail sales of McCormick brand spices and seasonings continued to grow, reaching a 5% increase. Within this broader category, we grew our core McCormick brand spices and herbs at the category growth rate, and we continue to see strong growth for our gourmet products, with retail sales up 6% since our 2015 relaunch. 
Across our entire U.S. product portfolio, we have increased advertising 20% in the last 2 years and are achieving investment returns on our brand marketing that are ahead of industry benchmarks. 
Digital marketing has particularly high ROI. In the fourth quarter, we launched our purity campaign, which is gaining traction. The video has now been viewed more than 33 million times at a cost of just $0.03 per view. Our video completion rate is 25%, exceeding the industry and our own historic average. And it is attracting traffic to our website, with 43% of traffic coming from millennials. This campaign will continue in 2016. 
In the second quarter, we will also have incremental marketing to build awareness and trial of our new herb grinders. Following the busy holiday period and Super Bowl event, we have reached critical mass with shelf placement at retail and are now ready to launch our marketing support for this innovative and differentiated product.
The latest product launches that we're rolling out include our first line of organic recipe mixes, liquid Grill Mates marinades, Zatarain's microwaveable rice cups, Kitchen Basics organic stock, food colors with no artificial dyes and an extension of our Skillet Sauces to a line of Oven Bake variety. McCormick brand liquid sauces have really taken off, with 4 percentage points of category share gain in the first quarter. 
Consumption results have also been excellent for Stubb's, which we have now owned for 6 months. Total Stubb's brand retail sales rose 14% in the latest quarter year-on-year, with barbecue sauce sales up even higher at 18%.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we've been building our brand equity with increased marketing support. A double-digit increase in 2015 will be followed by additional support in 2016 for our grilling campaign, Vahine dessert items and core spices and seasonings. Our product introductions this year include Seasoning Blends to create authentic Spanish dishes in the U.K. and new recipe mix varieties in Poland; premium grinders in France, Poland and Russia; and dessert decorating items in France. 
As a further growth driver in our EMEA region, we continue to benefit from distribution gains in Poland and Russia and have some incremental benefit in the first half of this year from our May 2015 acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in Italy. 
We returned to double-digit sales growth in our China consumer business this quarter in constant currency. This followed a 5% constant-currency increase in the fourth quarter when we had some impact from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotion. Our holiday promotions were very successful, and we achieved double-digit growth in herbs and spices, condiments and our bullion product.
We remain bullish about our prospects for consumer segment growth in this market and, in 2016, expect to achieve constant-currency sales growth in a high single-digit to low double-digit rate. 
In other parts of our Asia/Pacific region, our decision to discontinue lower-margin product in India is impacting financial results in 2016 with an estimated reduction of about 0.5 percentage point on total company sale. Excluding this impact, we had a solid first quarter sales performance for our Kohinoor business in India. 
Adjusted operating income for our consumer segment was up 7% in constant currency in the first quarter, setting the stage for better profit growth this year than in 2015. Factors affecting this improved profit performance include higher sales, including better growth in our U.S. business, and lower material cost inflation.
Turning to the industrial segment. We had excellent sales and profit growth in 2015, and this has continued through the first quarter of 2016. Gordon will provide more details, but for the total segment, in constant currency, we grew sales 7% and adjusted operating income 27%. This margin improvement stems from our cost reductions, the scale advantage of higher volume and a more favorable mix, including the acquisition of Brand Aromatics in March 2015 as well as innovation with more value-added flavors.
Leading our industrial performance again this quarter with another double-digit sales increase in constant currency was our team in the EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is with quick service restaurants through product innovation, distribution gains and their geographic expansion. This geographic expansion includes Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and construction of the new plant in Dubai that we have mentioned before is on schedule to be complete in mid-2016.
Our willingness to support and supply our customers locally is a good example of our strategy to excel at customer intimacy, and is part of the reason we were most recently named Global Flavor Supplier of 3 top food and beverage companies.
In the Americas region, it is almost 1 year since we acquired the Brand Aromatics business, and we are pleased to report that it is exceeding our profit expectation and providing other benefits, such as helping to launch organic Kitchen Basics stocks for our consumer segment.
For the base business in this region, we are encouraged by our current innovation pipeline with customized flavors for food manufacturers, flavors for snack seasonings, beverages, soups and cereals. Sales of snack seasonings were a key driver of our top line growth in the first quarter, especially in Latin America.
In the food service industry, we're supporting recent new product and promotion activity by several current restaurant customers and, through our branded food service business, expanding with some new restaurant chains.
Turning to the Asia/Pacific region. We continue to grow industrial sales for our operation in Australia with distribution gains to quick service restaurants in the region. In China, we're a bit cautious due to the effect of the macroeconomic situation as well as the impact of certain headwinds faced by quick service restaurants in recent years. On the positive side, these customers are continuing to invest in this market with innovation, new location and marketing. 
Let me summarize by restating that our first quarter financial results across both our consumer and industrial segments were a strong start to 2016, and we've increased confidence in our fiscal year outlook. Consumer demand for flavor is growing globally. At McCormick, we're well positioned to meet this demand, with effective growth strategies, an on-trend product portfolio, experienced business leaders and engaged employees. 
It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon."

Our adjusted",1522,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, followed by comments on our current 2016 financial outlook.
We've started the year with strong sales growth and higher adjusted earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share result was ahead of our first quarter guidance due to a timing shift for brand marketing and discrete tax benefits.
Let's turn to our top line results as seen on Slide 16. On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 7%. The incremental impact of the acquisitions completed in 2015 was 3%. We drove the other 4% with higher volume and product mix and, to a lesser extent, from pricing actions that we took in response to higher material cost. Constant-currency sales growth for each of our 2 segments was in a 6% to 7% range and driven by contributions from these same 3 factors: volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing.
On Slide 17, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 4% in constant currency, with about 1/3 of the increase from Stubb's. Base business sales growth in this region was led by higher U.S. sales of core spices and herbs, Lawry's brand, Hispanic items and Simply Asia products. These increases were offset in part this period by lower sales of certain economy products in the U.S. Also, volume and mix declined in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related in part to currency pressure.
In EMEA, we continued to achieve strong sales performance, up 14% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A, which added 10% to sales growth, as well as expanded distribution in Poland and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 5% in constant currency. We grew constant-currency sales in China 12%, with a broad-based increase across a number of product categories in both our McCormick brand and brands added with the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments in 2013. Sales this period were unfavorably impacted by our decision to discontinue certain low-margin Kohinoor products in India, as Lawrence described. The reduced sales from our business in India lowered our growth rate in this region by 4 percentage points this quarter.
For the consumer segment in total, our first quarter adjusted operating income rose 3% to $94 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 7% from the year ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting higher material costs and employee benefit expense this period.
Turning to our industrial segment. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with the impact of unfavorable currency rates. And adjusted operating income margin rose to 9.2% from 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015, the result of our CCI program, scale from higher sales and a shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Brand Aromatics.
On Slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 3% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year ago period was led by sales of snack seasonings, with particularly strong growth in the Latin American market from our operation based in Mexico.
The excellent performance of our industrial business in EMEA continued into the first quarter, with constant-currency sales up 11%. As Lawrence described, we are benefiting from our strong customer relationships with leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers supporting their growth and geographic expansion in this region.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region 3% in constant currency. We drove higher sales to quick service restaurants in the region from our operations in both China and Australia.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 19% at $36 million. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 27% with the factors I already mentioned and as spelled out on Slide 25.
Our expectation for the fiscal year is to increase adjusted operating income for the industrial segment in line with our guidance for the total company. Clearly, the first quarter result came in ahead of this outlook, and we expect further quarter-to-quarter fluctuation as a result of customer demand patterns and other factors.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 7% in the first quarter from the year ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 12%, which is just above our 2016 guidance range.
Gross profit margin was up year-on-year as well with a 70 basis point increase. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix, scale benefits from higher sales and pricing actions taken to offset moderate cost inflation.
As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expense was comparable to the first quarter of 2015. During this period, we had a favorable impact from several factors that included our cost savings activity. This was offset by the impact of unfavorable factors that included increases in certain employee benefits expense and a $1 million increase in brand marketing.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 26.9% compared to 24.8% in the year ago period. This first quarter 2016 tax rate was below our guidance for the year of approximately 28% due to discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect the full year rate to approximate 28%. Note that excluding the impact of special charges, the tax rate for the first quarter 2016 and first quarter 2015 were more comparable.
As the result of unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations declined 15% to $8 million. This currency impact masked a strong underlying performance led by our joint venture in Mexico, which had a mid-single-digit increase in both sales and net income, excluding the impact of currency.
At the bottom line, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.74, up $0.04 from the year ago period mainly due to higher adjusted operating income. This result included the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
On Slide 30, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $78 million compared to $96 million in the year ago period. An increase in net income was offset mainly by the timing of payments for raw material purchases.
We returned $102 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $22 million for capital expenditures this period. At the end of the first quarter, $522 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.
Let's move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged except for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Based on prevailing rates, we now estimate an impact to the growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share of 3%, down from our initial estimate of 4%.
At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency, which includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015 and higher pricing of 1% to 2%. Including the impact of currency, the projected sales growth is 1% to 3%.
On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect to increase adjusted operating income 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range to 6% to 8%. We plan to drive this increase with higher sales and at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions. With this fuel for growth, we plan to increase brand marketing at least $20 million.
Due to the lower impact from currency, our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share has increased by $0.03 to $3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range remains an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. 
In the second quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be slightly below $0.75 of adjusted earnings per share in the year ago period. This is due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates, increased brand marketing and a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that we had a particularly low tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 at 16% on a GAAP basis and a bit higher on a non-GAAP basis but still below our outlook of approximately 28% for the fiscal year 2016.
As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016, with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.
That completes my remarks. So let's now turn it over for your questions."

I know you can't comment on the Premier Foods bid, specifically, or not very much. But just philosophically, about your plans for acquisitions from here on out, you said that there other possible deals in the pipeline. What strikes me as different here is that it's quite big, which is a break from the bolt-on acquisitions you've done in the past. It's based in the U.K., which, frankly, even though I'm from there, doesn't strike me as a particularly attractive market, and it's moving out of your core sort of spices and seasonings into more regular slower-growth categories. So maybe if you could just comment on, if not this, are these the kind of criteria that you're focused on? And then as a really, really short follow-up, a number of other companies have announced that they will be labeling products that are containing GMO in addition to what -- obviously what you're doing, which is labeling the products that are not containing GMO or GMO free. In advance of the Vermont labeling legislation kicking in, in the middle of the year, how are you planning to deal with that?"
181176,328308828,956303,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 29, 2016",2016-03-29,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","This is Lawrence here.

And first of all, as we look at the Premier business, there is -- we're pretty limited in what we can say, but I can tell you that what is attractive to us about this business is that it is still predominantly a flavor business with some terrific, iconic flavor brands that are much loved in the U.K. I'm sure that you're very familiar with these brands yourself. Gordon and Mike and I have lived in the U.K. ourselves and know that brands like Bisto, OXO, Saxa, Sharwood's, these are fantastic brands that are much loved and -- by U.K. consumers and are widely consumed. And we see them as flavor businesses. Our flavor portfolio on the consumer side is not just herbs, spices and seasonings. We have sauces in many parts of the world. We're launching cooking sauces in North America. We have over the last few years. And so we see the brands in the Premier portfolio as being very complementary to the flavor businesses that we -- the flavor business that we have and are building globally. With the brands that are very close in we're looking at a whole company, and so there are some brands that are not, on their face, core to our business. But I'd remind you that we have a strong dessert business on the continent with homemade dessert products through the Vahine brand, and a fairly good part of our U.S. business is based on cooking and baking -- or baking products anyway as well. So we feel pretty good about the fit. It is bigger than the bolt-on acquisitions that we have done so many of. And I think we've been signaling, really, for several months now that we were going to look at some bigger opportunities in addition to the bolt-on opportunities. This would use a fair bit of our financial capacity, but it wouldn't take us out of the market to do the kind of strategically important bolt-ons that we might still -- that we might have done otherwise. And as far as the U.K. market goes, one of the things that we are interested in as part of our acquisition program is adding scale where we already have a strong business presence. And certainly, the U.K. is a market where we have good presence with our Schwartz brand and have for many years and have strong relationships with our customers there. It's also the home of our EMEA business. Our EMEA regional headquarters is in the U.K., and so we have substantial infrastructure and resources there to -- that handle an asset like this. Your second question was about GMO labeling, and our -- we announced that we were going to label our products were non-GMO. We're taking credit for what we have to a great extent. The vast majority of our products, our herbs and spices products in particular, are not genetically modified in any way. And consumers are interested in transparency, and that's what led to that initiative. And we're certainly well aware of the Vermont law. We don't have any kind of particular public stance that we want to take on that other than that we're going to comply with the law. So where there are genetically modified materials in some of our products, we will either find a way to remove them or label them as is appropriate in order to put us into compliance with that law."

There's really nothing dramatic here. It's just around the actual retail execution, predominantly on our herb grinders. As we worked through the holiday season and the Super Bowl season, the on-shelf placement of those products was a little bit slower than we anticipated at the very beginning of the year. And so we've shifted the spend out a bit further to coincide with the retail distribution. Not a particular problem, it's just the timing of it.

I'm obviously aware that there's a limit to what you can say there, but I think the very first thing that I'd be interested just to hear is the potential impact of this transaction on your credit rating. I mean, if we look at Premier Foods right now, I mean, in U.S. dollar terms for a second, excluding the pension deficit, I make it about $930 million of net debt coupled with a pension deficit of GBP 416 million, which is roughly $600 million, resulting in a total additional net debt of almost USD 1.5 billion. I think because of that, even assuming an all-stock deal, this is a deal which could almost double the net debt of the group. I think what I'd be interested to get your -- to get some kind of guidance on is, firstly, whether or not you feel you can preserve your investment-grade credit rating if your net debt were to increase that materially. And secondly, whether or not it would make sense after acquiring Premier Foods, the Premier Foods legal entity to still issue its own bonds and to sit outside the restricted group that currently contains all the assets that are referenceable into the McCormick bond restricted group in order to preserve the investment-grade ratings of those bonds?"

In terms of your first question, I'll just point to our historical track record around when we have done large acquisitions and the debt capacity that we have. We pride ourselves in our investment-grade rating, and our full intention is to maintain our investment-grade rating, and we believe we can achieve that through this transaction. While it is significantly large, if you go back in our history and you look at Ducros back in 2000 and you look at Lawry's as recently as 2008, on a percentage of our market cap and the size of the company, it's really not quite different from those size transaction. So our intention, as we did in those 2 previous transactions, would be to lever up. Obviously, it'll take our debt to EBITDA above where it is now, but it wouldn't be at a level that would be unlike where we were with Lawry's and Ducros at that time. And as we did in the past, we would curtail our share buyback program to pay down that debt and return to our investment-grade rating.

And I've got, at the Premier Foods legal entity, a pension deficit of GBP 416 million, which in U.S. dollar terms gets me to a little bit under $600 million. Premier Foods' management team announced that even though in 2015, they had a partial holiday from making any addition deficit contribution, the total cash outflow due to servicing the pension debt, will increase to GBP 14 million to GBP 16 million this year and will go up to almost GBP 60 million, that's 6-0 million, in 2016 and '17. I suppose, how concerned are you about the EPS impact of, one, a material payment the group will need to make moving forward to service its very large pension deficit; secondly, the impact of the U.K. minimum wage on the large fixed cost base of the group, given the fact that there are large numbers of U.K. employees due to see that wage increase..."

McCormick's first quarter results were a great start to the year. We created momentum with our growth strategies throughout 2015 and are building on this strength in 2016. 
This strength was evident in our top line growth. We grew constant-currency sales 6% for our consumer segment and 7% for our industrial segment, with increased base business, new products and acquisitions, our 3 drivers of long-term sales growth. We are improving gross profit margin and achieved a 70 basis point increase this period. This was a sequential increase from 30 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ahead of our expectations due in part to favorable product mix. 
A big driver of the year-to-year improvement is cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, and our organization and streamlining actions. Employees throughout the company are improving productivity, and we have greater confidence in our goal to achieve at least $95 million of cost savings this year. Under Mike's leadership, efforts are underway toward delivering the 4-year $400 million cost reduction target that we announced in February.
We grew first quarter adjusted operating income 12% from the year ago period on a constant currency basis, led by the higher sales and increased gross profit margin. We'd initially planned a year-on-year increase in brand marketing this period but shifted this timing to second quarter to better coincide with some of our new product launches.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 was up 6% from $0.70 in the first quarter of 2015. This includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and the underlying increase was quite strong. 
These first quarter results give us increased confidence in our ability to deliver our plans for constant-currency growth of 4% to 6% for sales, 9% to 11% for adjusted operating income and 9% to 11% for adjusted EPS. Each of these growth rates is at or above our long-term objectives.
I'd like to comment next on the recent news about our proposal to acquire Premier Foods. Premier Foods is just one idea in McCormick's robust acquisition pipeline, one that would be a great addition to our business. This acquisition would be consistent with our growth strategy, adding iconic brands that complement our product portfolio, increasing our current scale and presence in the U.K. market and creating potential to drive growth through innovation, marketing and expanded international distribution. We believe our offer is highly attractive for Premier Foods shareholders and an opportunity to build value for McCormick shareholders. 
At this stage, given U.K. regulatory restrictions, we're limited in what we can say beyond our recent announcement. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, we will be disciplined about returns and value creation for McCormick shareholders. 
Now let's turn to a business update. Consumer demand for flavor is strong and on the rise. Across generations, flavor remains the #1 driver of food decision, especially among millennials. Slide 6 shows the information we shared at the CAGNY conference, and we were pleased to see similar survey results shared by other food companies, many of them customers of our industrial segment. While taste has remained a constant theme, the food industry is also seeing some significant changes in consumer eating habits, particularly in the U.S. For these trends, McCormick is well positioned to drive growth. 
There are changes in how we eat. Consumers increasingly want to eat healthy, and spices and herbs, the core of our business, are a healthy way to add flavor. We announced in January that the new 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans point to herbs and spices as a way to reduce sodium in the diet. And we were pleased to see in February a new MyPlate for Older Adults cosponsored by AARP showing herbs and spices as 1 of 7 recommended food and beverage groups. 
We're changing what we eat. Fresh ingredients are on the rise. Consumers who are buying more fresh vegetables, seafood and meat are looking for both flavor and convenience. We're meeting this need with current products like Grill Mates, recipe mixes and Lawry's and our latest innovation of liquid sauces and herb grinders. 
Consumers are changing why they choose certain brands and product, demanding greater transparency. We're addressing this demand with our message that pure tastes better and consumer information about McCormick's high-quality sourcing and manufacturing standard. As a next step, in the U.S., we are in the process of labeling over 70% of McCormick brand spices, herbs and extracts as non-GMO and transitioning 80% of our gourmet line to organic this year.
We're even changing when we eat. Snacking occasions have surpassed breakfast and lunch and now rival dinner. Here is where our industrial segment steps in. As a major supplier to packaged food companies, the largest being PepsiCo, that are focused on and building this part of their product portfolio.
Our restaurant customers are also developing menu items to meet this demand. Clearly, McCormick is in a great position with a portfolio of leading brands and industrial flavor solutions that are aligned with today's consumer and developing the insights to adapt to tomorrow's consumer.
I want to turn next to some specific remarks about the growth strategies underway and performance for each of our 2 segments.
Let's start with the consumer segment and our U.S. business. Category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong. In the most recent quarter, retail sales of McCormick brand spices and seasonings continued to grow, reaching a 5% increase. Within this broader category, we grew our core McCormick brand spices and herbs at the category growth rate, and we continue to see strong growth for our gourmet products, with retail sales up 6% since our 2015 relaunch. 
Across our entire U.S. product portfolio, we have increased advertising 20% in the last 2 years and are achieving investment returns on our brand marketing that are ahead of industry benchmarks. 
Digital marketing has particularly high ROI. In the fourth quarter, we launched our purity campaign, which is gaining traction. The video has now been viewed more than 33 million times at a cost of just $0.03 per view. Our video completion rate is 25%, exceeding the industry and our own historic average. And it is attracting traffic to our website, with 43% of traffic coming from millennials. This campaign will continue in 2016. 
In the second quarter, we will also have incremental marketing to build awareness and trial of our new herb grinders. Following the busy holiday period and Super Bowl event, we have reached critical mass with shelf placement at retail and are now ready to launch our marketing support for this innovative and differentiated product.
The latest product launches that we're rolling out include our first line of organic recipe mixes, liquid Grill Mates marinades, Zatarain's microwaveable rice cups, Kitchen Basics organic stock, food colors with no artificial dyes and an extension of our Skillet Sauces to a line of Oven Bake variety. McCormick brand liquid sauces have really taken off, with 4 percentage points of category share gain in the first quarter. 
Consumption results have also been excellent for Stubb's, which we have now owned for 6 months. Total Stubb's brand retail sales rose 14% in the latest quarter year-on-year, with barbecue sauce sales up even higher at 18%.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we've been building our brand equity with increased marketing support. A double-digit increase in 2015 will be followed by additional support in 2016 for our grilling campaign, Vahine dessert items and core spices and seasonings. Our product introductions this year include Seasoning Blends to create authentic Spanish dishes in the U.K. and new recipe mix varieties in Poland; premium grinders in France, Poland and Russia; and dessert decorating items in France. 
As a further growth driver in our EMEA region, we continue to benefit from distribution gains in Poland and Russia and have some incremental benefit in the first half of this year from our May 2015 acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in Italy. 
We returned to double-digit sales growth in our China consumer business this quarter in constant currency. This followed a 5% constant-currency increase in the fourth quarter when we had some impact from distributors that held back on purchases in anticipation of Chinese New Year promotion. Our holiday promotions were very successful, and we achieved double-digit growth in herbs and spices, condiments and our bullion product.
We remain bullish about our prospects for consumer segment growth in this market and, in 2016, expect to achieve constant-currency sales growth in a high single-digit to low double-digit rate. 
In other parts of our Asia/Pacific region, our decision to discontinue lower-margin product in India is impacting financial results in 2016 with an estimated reduction of about 0.5 percentage point on total company sale. Excluding this impact, we had a solid first quarter sales performance for our Kohinoor business in India. 
Adjusted operating income for our consumer segment was up 7% in constant currency in the first quarter, setting the stage for better profit growth this year than in 2015. Factors affecting this improved profit performance include higher sales, including better growth in our U.S. business, and lower material cost inflation.
Turning to the industrial segment. We had excellent sales and profit growth in 2015, and this has continued through the first quarter of 2016. Gordon will provide more details, but for the total segment, in constant currency, we grew sales 7% and adjusted operating income 27%. This margin improvement stems from our cost reductions, the scale advantage of higher volume and a more favorable mix, including the acquisition of Brand Aromatics in March 2015 as well as innovation with more value-added flavors.
Leading our industrial performance again this quarter with another double-digit sales increase in constant currency was our team in the EMEA. In this region, the greatest growth is with quick service restaurants through product innovation, distribution gains and their geographic expansion. This geographic expansion includes Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and construction of the new plant in Dubai that we have mentioned before is on schedule to be complete in mid-2016.
Our willingness to support and supply our customers locally is a good example of our strategy to excel at customer intimacy, and is part of the reason we were most recently named Global Flavor Supplier of 3 top food and beverage companies.
In the Americas region, it is almost 1 year since we acquired the Brand Aromatics business, and we are pleased to report that it is exceeding our profit expectation and providing other benefits, such as helping to launch organic Kitchen Basics stocks for our consumer segment.
For the base business in this region, we are encouraged by our current innovation pipeline with customized flavors for food manufacturers, flavors for snack seasonings, beverages, soups and cereals. Sales of snack seasonings were a key driver of our top line growth in the first quarter, especially in Latin America.
In the food service industry, we're supporting recent new product and promotion activity by several current restaurant customers and, through our branded food service business, expanding with some new restaurant chains.
Turning to the Asia/Pacific region. We continue to grow industrial sales for our operation in Australia with distribution gains to quick service restaurants in the region. In China, we're a bit cautious due to the effect of the macroeconomic situation as well as the impact of certain headwinds faced by quick service restaurants in recent years. On the positive side, these customers are continuing to invest in this market with innovation, new location and marketing. 
Let me summarize by restating that our first quarter financial results across both our consumer and industrial segments were a strong start to 2016, and we've increased confidence in our fiscal year outlook. Consumer demand for flavor is growing globally. At McCormick, we're well positioned to meet this demand, with effective growth strategies, an on-trend product portfolio, experienced business leaders and engaged employees.

I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, followed by comments on our current 2016 financial outlook.We've started the year with strong sales growth and higher adjusted earnings per share. Our adjusted",1522,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, followed by comments on our current 2016 financial outlook.
We've started the year with strong sales growth and higher adjusted earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share result was ahead of our first quarter guidance due to a timing shift for brand marketing and discrete tax benefits.
Let's turn to our top line results as seen on Slide 16. On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 7%. The incremental impact of the acquisitions completed in 2015 was 3%. We drove the other 4% with higher volume and product mix and, to a lesser extent, from pricing actions that we took in response to higher material cost. Constant-currency sales growth for each of our 2 segments was in a 6% to 7% range and driven by contributions from these same 3 factors: volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing.
On Slide 17, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 4% in constant currency, with about 1/3 of the increase from Stubb's. Base business sales growth in this region was led by higher U.S. sales of core spices and herbs, Lawry's brand, Hispanic items and Simply Asia products. These increases were offset in part this period by lower sales of certain economy products in the U.S. Also, volume and mix declined in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related in part to currency pressure.
In EMEA, we continued to achieve strong sales performance, up 14% in constant currency. This increase was driven by D&A, which added 10% to sales growth, as well as expanded distribution in Poland and our performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 5% in constant currency. We grew constant-currency sales in China 12%, with a broad-based increase across a number of product categories in both our McCormick brand and brands added with the acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments in 2013. Sales this period were unfavorably impacted by our decision to discontinue certain low-margin Kohinoor products in India, as Lawrence described. The reduced sales from our business in India lowered our growth rate in this region by 4 percentage points this quarter.
For the consumer segment in total, our first quarter adjusted operating income rose 3% to $94 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 7% from the year ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting higher material costs and employee benefit expense this period.
Turning to our industrial segment. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit even with the impact of unfavorable currency rates. And adjusted operating income margin rose to 9.2% from 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015, the result of our CCI program, scale from higher sales and a shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Brand Aromatics.
On Slide 22, sales of Brand Aromatics contributed 3% to our growth in the Americas. Higher base business volume and product mix this quarter versus the year ago period was led by sales of snack seasonings, with particularly strong growth in the Latin American market from our operation based in Mexico.
The excellent performance of our industrial business in EMEA continued into the first quarter, with constant-currency sales up 11%. As Lawrence described, we are benefiting from our strong customer relationships with leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers supporting their growth and geographic expansion in this region.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region 3% in constant currency. We drove higher sales to quick service restaurants in the region from our operations in both China and Australia.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 19% at $36 million. In constant currency, the growth was even greater at 27% with the factors I already mentioned and as spelled out on Slide 25.
Our expectation for the fiscal year is to increase adjusted operating income for the industrial segment in line with our guidance for the total company. Clearly, the first quarter result came in ahead of this outlook, and we expect further quarter-to-quarter fluctuation as a result of customer demand patterns and other factors.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 7% in the first quarter from the year ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 12%, which is just above our 2016 guidance range.
Gross profit margin was up year-on-year as well with a 70 basis point increase. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix, scale benefits from higher sales and pricing actions taken to offset moderate cost inflation.
As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expense was comparable to the first quarter of 2015. During this period, we had a favorable impact from several factors that included our cost savings activity. This was offset by the impact of unfavorable factors that included increases in certain employee benefits expense and a $1 million increase in brand marketing.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 26.9% compared to 24.8% in the year ago period. This first quarter 2016 tax rate was below our guidance for the year of approximately 28% due to discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect the full year rate to approximate 28%. Note that excluding the impact of special charges, the tax rate for the first quarter 2016 and first quarter 2015 were more comparable.
As the result of unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations declined 15% to $8 million. This currency impact masked a strong underlying performance led by our joint venture in Mexico, which had a mid-single-digit increase in both sales and net income, excluding the impact of currency.
At the bottom line, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.74, up $0.04 from the year ago period mainly due to higher adjusted operating income. This result included the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
On Slide 30, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $78 million compared to $96 million in the year ago period. An increase in net income was offset mainly by the timing of payments for raw material purchases.
We returned $102 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $22 million for capital expenditures this period. At the end of the first quarter, $522 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to fund future investments to drive growth.
Let's move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged except for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Based on prevailing rates, we now estimate an impact to the growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share of 3%, down from our initial estimate of 4%.
At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 4% to 6% in constant currency, which includes a carryover benefit of 1% to 2% from acquisitions completed in 2015 and higher pricing of 1% to 2%. Including the impact of currency, the projected sales growth is 1% to 3%.
On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect to increase adjusted operating income 9% to 11% from adjusted operating income of $614 million in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range to 6% to 8%. We plan to drive this increase with higher sales and at least $95 million in cost savings, savings that include our CCI program and some carryover benefit from previously announced organization and streamlining actions. With this fuel for growth, we plan to increase brand marketing at least $20 million.
Due to the lower impact from currency, our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share has increased by $0.03 to $3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range remains an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. 
In the second quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be slightly below $0.75 of adjusted earnings per share in the year ago period. This is due to the unfavorable impact of currency rates, increased brand marketing and a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that we had a particularly low tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 at 16% on a GAAP basis and a bit higher on a non-GAAP basis but still below our outlook of approximately 28% for the fiscal year 2016.
As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016, with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.
That completes my remarks. So let's now turn it over for your questions."

I know you can't comment on the Premier Foods bid, specifically, or not very much. But just philosophically, about your plans for acquisitions from here on out, you said that there other possible deals in the pipeline. What strikes me as different here is that it's quite big, which is a break from the bolt-on acquisitions you've done in the past. It's based in the U.K., which, frankly, even though I'm from there, doesn't strike me as a particularly attractive market, and it's moving out of your core sort of spices and seasonings into more regular slower-growth categories. So maybe if you could just comment on, if not this, are these the kind of criteria that you're focused on? And then as a really, really short follow-up, a number of other companies have announced that they will be labeling products that are containing GMO in addition to what -- obviously what you're doing, which is labeling the products that are not containing GMO or GMO free. In advance of the Vermont labeling legislation kicking in, in the middle of the year, how are you planning to deal with that?"

And first of all, as we look at the Premier business, there is -- we're pretty limited in what we can say, but I can tell you that what is attractive to us about this business is that it is still predominantly a flavor business with",579,"This is Lawrence here. And first of all, as we look at the Premier business, there is -- we're pretty limited in what we can say, but I can tell you that what is attractive to us about this business is that it is still predominantly a flavor business with some terrific, iconic flavor brands that are much loved in the U.K. I'm sure that you're very familiar with these brands yourself. Gordon and Mike and I have lived in the U.K. ourselves and know that brands like Bisto, OXO, Saxa, Sharwood's, these are fantastic brands that are much loved and -- by U.K. consumers and are widely consumed. And we see them as flavor businesses. Our flavor portfolio on the consumer side is not just herbs, spices and seasonings. We have sauces in many parts of the world. We're launching cooking sauces in North America. We have over the last few years. And so we see the brands in the Premier portfolio as being very complementary to the flavor businesses that we -- the flavor business that we have and are building globally. With the brands that are very close in we're looking at a whole company, and so there are some brands that are not, on their face, core to our business. But I'd remind you that we have a strong dessert business on the continent with homemade dessert products through the Vahine brand, and a fairly good part of our U.S. business is based on cooking and baking -- or baking products anyway as well. So we feel pretty good about the fit. It is bigger than the bolt-on acquisitions that we have done so many of. And I think we've been signaling, really, for several months now that we were going to look at some bigger opportunities in addition to the bolt-on opportunities. This would use a fair bit of our financial capacity, but it wouldn't take us out of the market to do the kind of strategically important bolt-ons that we might still -- that we might have done otherwise. And as far as the U.K. market goes, one of the things that we are interested in as part of our acquisition program is adding scale where we already have a strong business presence. And certainly, the U.K. is a market where we have good presence with our Schwartz brand and have for many years and have strong relationships with our customers there. It's also the home of our EMEA business. Our EMEA regional headquarters is in the U.K., and so we have substantial infrastructure and resources there to -- that handle an asset like this. Your second question was about GMO labeling, and our -- we announced that we were going to label our products were non-GMO. We're taking credit for what we have to a great extent. The vast majority of our products, our herbs and spices products in particular, are not genetically modified in any way. And consumers are interested in transparency, and that's what led to that initiative. And we're certainly well aware of the Vermont law. We don't have any kind of particular public stance that we want to take on that other than that we're going to comply with the law. So where there are genetically modified materials in some of our products, we will either find a way to remove them or label them as is appropriate in order to put us into compliance with that law."

And I think in our prepared remarks, we indicated that we pushed that advertising into -- mostly into second quarter just related to the timing of the distribution build on the new products. There's really nothing dramatic here. It's just around the actual retail execution, predominantly on our herb grinders. As we worked through the holiday season and the Super Bowl season, the on-shelf placement of those products was a little bit slower than we anticipated at the very beginning of the year. And so we've shifted the spend out a bit further to coincide with the retail distribution. Not a particular problem, it's just the timing of it. And so we still believe that we'll deliver on that brand marketing increase that we talked about in our initial guidance for the year. Gordon, do you want to elaborate on that?"

Back to Lawrence's earlier comments, I've been with this company a long time, and I'd say that the level of sophistication around the price increase just SKU-ed it was the highest I've seen. So I have confidence in our team to go back, use their analytics to make whatever decision is necessary to deal with whatever cost issues may pop up. CCI, we will always lean on CCI. We've talked about that as part of our strategy over time. That's where we look first in any type of an environment, is to generate cost savings through our CCI.

I'm obviously aware that there's a limit to what you can say there, but I think the very first thing that I'd be interested just to hear is the potential impact of this transaction on your credit rating. I mean, if we look at Premier Foods right now, I mean, in U.S. dollar terms for a second, excluding the pension deficit, I make it about $930 million of net debt coupled with a pension deficit of GBP 416 million, which is roughly $600 million, resulting in a total additional net debt of almost USD 1.5 billion. I think because of that, even assuming an all-stock deal, this is a deal which could almost double the net debt of the group. I think what I'd be interested to get your -- to get some kind of guidance on is, firstly, whether or not you feel you can preserve your investment-grade credit rating if your net debt were to increase that materially. And secondly, whether or not it would make sense after acquiring Premier Foods, the Premier Foods legal entity to still issue its own bonds and to sit outside the restricted group that currently contains all the assets that are referenceable into the McCormick bond restricted group in order to preserve the investment-grade ratings of those bonds?"

In terms of your first question, I'll just point to our historical track record around when we have done large acquisitions and the debt capacity that we have. We pride ourselves in our investment-grade rating, and our full intention is to maintain our investment-grade rating, and we believe we can achieve that through this transaction. While it is significantly large, if you go back in our history and you look at Ducros back in 2000 and you look at Lawry's as recently as 2008, on a percentage of our market cap and the size of the company, it's really not quite different from those size transaction. So our intention, as we did in those 2 previous transactions, would be to lever up. Obviously, it'll take our debt to EBITDA above where it is now, but it wouldn't be at a level that would be unlike where we were with Lawry's and Ducros at that time. And as we did in the past, we would curtail our share buyback program to pay down that debt and return to our investment-grade rating. So that is how we would finance this acquisition, and again, it would be very much in line with previous deals."

I think the second question I wanted to ask was more about the EPS impact of the deal and the potential of this deal to be accretive maybe in the future. Whilst I suppose, given the material discrepancy in terms of your P/E ratio versus the Premier Foods P/E ratio, that could imply the deal to be quite accretive, I suppose some concerns that many of -- that your investors have right now is, firstly, the impact of the pension deficit. And I've got, at the Premier Foods legal entity, a pension deficit of GBP 416 million, which in U.S. dollar terms gets me to a little bit under $600 million. Premier Foods' management team announced that even though in 2015, they had a partial holiday from making any addition deficit contribution, the total cash outflow due to servicing the pension debt, will increase to GBP 14 million to GBP 16 million this year and will go up to almost GBP 60 million, that's 6-0 million, in 2016 and '17. I suppose, how concerned are you about the EPS impact of, one, a material payment the group will need to make moving forward to service its very large pension deficit; secondly, the impact of the U.K. minimum wage on the large fixed cost base of the group, given the fact that there are large numbers of U.K. employees due to see that wage increase..."

The degree to which it is accretive is something that we can't even speculate on. No deal has been agreed at this point.

Thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results continued the momentum we saw on the first quarter of 2016. We're driving this performance with our growth strategies and our people, but thanks to McC",2458,"Thank you, Joyce, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results continued the momentum we saw on the first quarter of 2016. We're driving this performance with our growth strategies and our people, but thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their effort and engagement for the first half financial results and business momentum. Together, we have greater confidence in our financial outlook for fiscal year 2016.
The strong results this quarter started at the top line. In constant currency, we grew sales 6% for the total company, and the increase in our consumer segment sales was particularly strong with an 8% increase. Contributing factors were 3 acquisitions completed in the last 12 months along with growth in our base business and new products, our 3 drivers of long-term sales growth.
Based on these results, we reaffirm our fiscal year outlook for a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency and that the recent acquisition of Gourmet Garden have greater confidence in the upper end of this range.
We saw sequential improvement in gross profit margin with a gain of 130 basis points following the 70 basis point increase in the first quarter. This improvement was led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement, CCI, and we had a benefit this period from favorable business mix including strong sales in our core U.S. consumer business. As a result, we're now tracking toward the higher end of our fiscal year projection for gross profit margin improvement.
Back in February, we set a goal to achieve $400 million of cost savings over the next 4 years. At about 2% of sales, this is an ambitious target but one that is backed by increased resources under Mike Smith's leadership. Importantly, we're taking a deliberate approach so that we do not disrupt the great progress underway with our top line growth strategies. Through the first half of 2016, we're off to a great start with this work and are increasing our fiscal year 2016 projection to a range of $100 million to $110 million. This is our fuel for growth as demonstrated by our second quarter investment in brand marketing, which we increased 16% or $10 million from the year-ago period. As a further investment, we funded $5 million of increased incremental spending in the second quarter in support of our acquisition activity, a key element of our growth strategy.
Even with incremental spending to drive growth, we increased constant currency adjusted operating income 7% led by the higher sales and gross profit margin. Year-to-date, this puts us at a 9% constant currency increase, which is within our fiscal year 9% to 11% objective.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 was comparable to the year-ago period. We had strong increase in adjusted operating income although this was offset by a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter includes the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
For the fiscal year 2016, we reaffirm our outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $3.68 at $3.75 and have more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range based on our financial performance through the first half and our projections for the next few quarters.
On Slide 5, we've summarized our fiscal year 2016 guidance in constant currency, which is at or above our long-term outlook. And as remarks, Gordon will provide some additional insight into the quarter and into our outlook.
I'd like to turn next to some business update with a focus this morning on the steady improvement on our U.S. consumer business, our great new product lineup for the second half, highlights of other parts of our business and comments on our acquisition activity and outlook.
For U.S. consumer business, category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong, reaching an 8% year-on-year increase in the latest quarter. 2/3 of this increase was higher volume and believe -- we believe this is being driven by new product launches, such as our herb grinders, brand marketing support and the recent dietary guideline news. A lot of the growth is in those herbs and spices that are pantry staples.
During this same period, retail sales of McCormick brand spices and seasonings grow 7% year-on-year. As a graph on Slide 6 shows, this continues our trajectory of sequential increase and compares to a 5% increase in the first quarter consumption data.
Across all of our spice and seasoning brands, not only McCormick but niche brands like Lawry's, Old Bay [ph] our share performance continue to improve. We were down just 10 basis points so almost even in this latest period. When Gourmet Garden is included, our share is up 20 basis points, again, a sequential improvement from the first quarter. Information on Slide 6 is based on retail dollar sales for spices and seasonings.
As noted on Slide 7, on a unit basis, second quarter retail sales grew 6% for the category and 7% for McCormick brand spices and seasonings. There are 3 key messages here. First, we gained category share on a unit basis. Second, the McCormick brand is helping drive the unit category increase. And third, this is evidence that certain retailers are implementing our recommendations to lower retail price points on the McCormick brand.
As for the rest of recipe mix category, retail dollar sales of our McCormick brand recipe mixes were up 3% and we gained 10 basis points of category share. We're driving this great performance by our actions to win at retail, build our brand equity, accelerate innovation.
Win at retail, we've been increasing our investment in category management tools, resources and capabilities. We're pleased with our progress and continue to build our capabilities. We're getting great feedback from our customers. They've commented that McCormick has really stepped up its game and is having a more thorough conversation on the category. Part of our category management work is focused on retail price points. At retail customers who have partnered with us on pricing recommendations, the year-to-date dollar share from McCormick brand spices and seasonings is up 120 basis points versus a 70 basis point decrease with the remaining U.S. food retailers. The good news is that this increase in share for our McCormick brand is typically a profitable mood for both us and our customers.
As I indicated, we had a significant increase in brand marketing this quarter, and about half of the increase was in the U.S. This included marketing support for our pure taste better campaign, a lot of herb grinders, Hispanic advertising and digital marketing for Grill Mates as we headed into the Memorial Day and peak grilling season.
We're also getting good traction with our product innovation and in January, showed you our plans for the first half of 2016. Let's take a look ahead at the second half lineup for our U.S. consumer business.
We're poised to launch a number of new products for consumers in this market, as seen on Slide 8. These include flavored black pepper, 5 different tastes for McCormick's iconic black pepper, from mild and smoky to tangy and hot; organic recipe mixes for convenient flavorful weeknight dinners; organic kitchen basics stocks and a new bone broth to add protein to your diet. Within our gourmet line, we're launching signature Asian flavors inspired by our flavor forecast that include Japanese 7 spice and Korean style red pepper and pairings of helpful ingredients like chia, flax and matcha with spices and herbs, and line of Lawry's brand to deliver authentic Mexican and Latino taste. We're also relaunching our entire produce partners line with new packaging. These products, like great guacamole and salsa seasoning, are merchandised right in the high-traffic produce department.
We also have an exciting lineup for our outside of the U.S. In the Americas region, Canada is targeting millennial consumers with limited edition recipe mixes and flavors like buffalo wing and Peruvian roast chicken, and extending their line of Produce Partner blends. Our team in Central America is introducing a line of 5 new cooking sauces. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our goal is to leave the development and growth of the barbecue category, and our latest product introduction is a line of the burger seasoning mixes in the U.K. Across a number of countries in this region, we're getting distribution for our herb grinders and have a new television ad ready to drive consumer awareness. And in France, we're continuing a steady stream of innovation for our Vahiné dessert brand with new decorating items and new packaging features.
Moving to our Asia/Pacific region, we're extending our recipe mixes in China. These products help consumers create hot and spicy dishes and experience flavors from around the world like lemon curry roasted chicken wings and Brazilian barbecue seasoning. Part of our Wuhan Asia/Pacific condiment economy business in China, we're introducing cooking line and vinegar. And then in Australia, our iconic Airplane brand had a commanding lead in gelatin and we've been stretching the branch to other dessert categories. Our latest plans are to launch Airplane liquid shake mixes.
While we do not get too specific with our industrial product involvement, McCormick is well positioned for innovation with our certification as global supplier for an increasing number of our large customers. Our range of flavor solutions for these customers is one of the broadest in the industry as evidenced by recent product development work for snack chip seasonings, cracker seasoning, beverage flavors, ice cream toppings, sandwich sauces and burger seasonings.
Let's turn next to our performance and outlook for some other parts of our business and we'll start with China.
China's our second largest market after the U.S. We've been in this market for more than 25 years, made a very successful acquisition in 2013 and are excited about our prospects for growth. For our consumer business, we grew constant currency sales through the first half by 8% with new products, expanded distribution and brand marketing. There's been some fluctuation in sales growth by quarter due to shifts in timing related to promotional activity as well as the timing of shipments related to a successful implantation of SAP in our central China operation. Our consumer business in this market remains solid and we continue to expect good growth in 2016 and beyond.
For our industrial segment, year-to-date constant currency sales in China were up 8% with higher volume and product mix. We anticipate some sales pressure in the second half and a large customer will be diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies.
Based on our current pace of growth and latest outlook across both our consumer and industrial businesses in China, we expect our success in this market to continue with fiscal year 2016 constant currency sales growing at a mid to high single digit range.
As for the industrial business in the Americas, we're delivering strong sales of branded food service products along with new product wins for snack seasonings, beverage flavors and burger seasonings. In the innovation front, we're in a great position as we see accelerated moves by our customers toward no process flavors and non-GMO ingredients. We're making inroads with some additional restaurant chains. And Brand Aromatics, acquired just over a year ago, is ahead of plan in both sales and profit. Together, these successes are driving not only top line growth but higher profit margins with a more favorable mix.
In EMEA, or industrial sales slowed this quarter as we lapse some of the new distribution wins that drove a portion of our sales growth in 2015, but we're still encouraged by our innovation pipeline and the geographic expansion of our customers in this region. We also had weak sales for joint venture in South Africa that we plan to exit by year-end.
Our consumer business sales in EMEA benefited from a roughly 50% increase in brand marketing in the second quarter. Excluding acquisitions and on a constant-currency basis, we grew volume and product mix 3% versus the year ago quarter, which strength-ed our largest market in France, and a double-digit increase in both Poland and Russia that was driven in part by expanded distribution.
The last update I wanted to provide was on our acquisition activity and outlook. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce our purchase of Botanical Food Company in Australia, which manufactures and sells the Gourmet Garden brand. Gourmet Garden is a global market leader in on trend chilled, convenient packaged herbs, exporting products for our manufacturing location in Australia to 15 other countries, with the largest being the U.S. Annual sales are more than $50 million and the purchase price for this high-growth business was a 12 times multiple of EBITDA. We anticipate continued double-digit sales growth for these products that offer consumers a convenient flavor alternatives to fresh herbs. Importantly, these closer to fresh products are shelved with produce and allow us to participate in this highly traffic perimeter department.
Going forward, we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These include assets were flavor and health intersect to extend our current footprint with healthy flavors and great brands.  Value-added higher-margin industrial assets, acquisitions that build scale, where we currently have a presence and develop in emerging markets, and in size, both large assets as well as smaller bolt-on opportunities.
Our pursuit of Premier Foods earlier this year demonstrates our interest in larger businesses that fit with our growth strategy, and I hope that our ultimate decision not to make a firm offer also showed investors that McCormick remains financially disciplined in its use of cash.
To summarize my remarks, we're well-positioned as a global leader in flavor and are driving strong momentum with our growth strategy. We achieved great results through the first half and have increased confidence in delivering the higher end for our 2016 financial outlook.
Now, before I turn it over to Gordon, we announced yesterday Gordon's decision to retire at the end of this year. Gordon has been an exceptional leader at McCormick. During his 28 years with the company, he's built a world-class finance team that under his leadership, has helped deliver exceptional returns for our shareholders. His strategic leadership focused on value creation have an instrumental in driving our successful acquisition agenda, expanding our shared services around the world and managing our cost and cash, including the establishment of our CCI program. Gordon is the embodiment of McCormick values and teamwork and will truly be missed by me and employees throughout the organization. Gordon, congratulations on your successful career, all of your achievements and your upcoming retirement."

So congratulations to you, Mike.
Now let's get back to our latest financial results. As Lawrence indicated, we are pleased with our second quarter results and have good momentum heading into the second quarter of 2016. I'll provide some additional remarks and insights on our second quarter results followed by the details of our current 2016 financial outlook.
On a constant-currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing taken in response to higher material cost each contributed to the increase, as seen on Slide 14. The growth this quarter was led by our consumer segment.
On Slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 6% in constant currency with about half of the increase from acquisitions, both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was led by strong performance in our U.S. sales of McCormick brand spices and herbs, recipe mixes, our Lawry's brand and Simply Asia products. These were offset in part by a lower rate of growth in our sales of private label and economy brands. Also, volume and mix declined in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related in part to currency pressure.
In EMEA, we had another quarter of robust sales, up 20% in constant currency. This increase was driven by our year ago acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari, which added 14 percentage points to the sales growth. We also expanded distribution of our products in Poland and Russia and delivered a strong performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region were up just slightly in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 3 percentage points of growth. In China, as Lawrence noted, sales growth moderated in the second quarter due to the timing of customer purchases related to promotions and the successful implementation of SAP in our Wuhan facility. Year-to-date, we have grown consumer sales in China at a high single digit rate on a constant-currency basis, and we expect to return to a higher growth rate in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Lowering our second quarter sales in this region was a decline in India resulting from our decision to discontinue certain low-margin products. This action in India lowered our second quarter sales growth rate in the region by 6 percentage points.
For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 7% to $86 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 8% from the year-ago period with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting an $8 million increase in brand marketing, a $5 million increase in acquisition-related expenses and higher material cost.
Turning to our industrial segment in Slide 19, we had solid results this quarter in both sales and profit although this was a moderation from the first quarter, which included an incremental impact from Brand Aromatics. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 2% in constant currency. We increased U.S. sales of branded food service products and gained some new distribution with restaurant customers. In both the U.S. and Mexico, sales volume and product mix for snack seasonings were strong although pricing was down due in part to lower cost for dairy ingredients.
In Canada, we pass-through higher material cost to our customers with higher pricing, but this was offset by some volume weakness for industrial products in that market.
While we have had a long run of excellent performance from our industrial business in EMEA, this quarter, we lapped some of the new distribution gains in 2015. As a result, the sales growth rate moderated to a slight increase in constant currency.  Also affecting individual sales in this region was sales weakness in a small consolidated joint venture based in South Africa that we plan to exit by year-end.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region 9% in constant currency. The main driver was higher sales to quick service restaurants in the region mainly from our operation in China. As Lawrence indicated, we expect industrial sales pressure in the second half of 2016 in this market.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segments ended the quarter up 1% at $43 million. In constant currency, the growth was 5%, driven by higher sales and our cost savings offset in part by higher material costs and a $2 million increase in brand marketing to drive our branded food service business.
Adjusted operating income margin for this segment in the second quarter reached 10.1%.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 5% in the second quarter from the year-ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 7%. This is below our 9% to 11% goal for the fiscal year but includes the higher brand marketing and acquisition-related costs. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 9%, as Lawrence indicated.
We increased gross profit margin 130 basis points year-on-year to 40.7% in the second quarter of 2016. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset a moderate level of cost inflation.
Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 110 basis points from the second quarter of 2015. The increases in brand marketing and acquisition cost as a percentage of net sales were 140 basis points, more than accounting for the 110 basis point increase.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 23.1% compared to a very low 15.9% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. The second quarter 2016 tax rate of 23.1% was one of the reasons why the second quarter adjusted earnings per share came in ahead of the guidance we shared with you back in March. Given this result and absent additional discrete tax items for the remainder of the year, we are now estimating a fiscal year 2016 tax rate in the range of 27% to 28%.
Despite unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations rose 4% to $8 million. Our largest joint venture, McCormick to Mexico, is performing well with sales in constant currency up 7% year-to-date although profit for this business was unfavorably impacted by higher material cost, especially the currency impact on soybean oil purchases. For the fiscal year, we expect income from unconsolidated operations to be down about 10%.
At the bottom line, second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.75. This was comparable to the year-ago period with the impact of higher adjusted operating income offset by the higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
On Slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first half of 2016, cash flow from operations was $213 million compared to $186 million in the year-ago period mainly due to the increase in net income.
We returned $210 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $55 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the second quarter, $469 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization.
Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow and we are well positioned to continue funding investments to drive our growth strategy.
Let's move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged. In fact, we have greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our sales growth and earnings per share ranges. At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% in constant currency with higher pricing adding 1% to 2% of the increase. And with the addition of Gourmet Garden, we now expect acquisitions to add 2% to 3%. We expect this latest acquisition and our year-to-date performance to place us at the higher end of our 4% to 6% constant currency sales growth rates.
We continue to expect a 9% to 11% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income from $614 million of adjusted operating income in 2015.  Currency is expected to lower this range by 3 percentage points. We plan to drive our growth with higher sales and our stepped-up cost savings target of $100 million to $110 million. With this fuel for growth, we expect to increase brand marketing approximately $20 million, consistent with our initial plans.
Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share remains $3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015.
With our year-to-date results and outlook for the second half, we have more confidence in achieving the higher end of this range.
Regarding last week's referendum outcome on Brexit, the immediate impact to our business will be currency rates. Early this week, we reevaluated our guidance and determined that a 3% impact from currency is our best estimate at this point in time. Any longer-term impact on our business will depend in part on the outcome of tariff, trade ambulatory negotiations. As a point of reference, our sales in the U.K. were 8% of total company sales in fiscal 2015.
As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016 with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.
That completes my remarks. So let's turn now to your questions."

First of all, I'll just start by saying we're very pleased with the results in our U.S. consumer business. We're quite pleased with the shipments. We're even more pleased with the continued improvement in the information and this continued sequential improvement in our performance versus the category. I know that there's been a lot of questions about from the U.S. and others who are listening on the call about exactly when our share will turn positive and we keep saying that we're going to get there, and I believe that this is evidence that that's true. As we noted on the call, our sales increase for the U.S. consumer business includes more than just the McCormick brand. In our business, we also have economy brands and private label, and the growth of the economy brands and private label were both lower than our sales of -- growth in our sales of branded products. And so, that is a contributing factor to the difference versus -- in our shipments versus the offtake data for our brand. That's a mix shift that has also help lift our profit margin, obviously. The second thing is that we're going through some major transitions on a couple of our product lines within herbs and spices. And in some cases, we have limited shipments to keep from having inventory of old packaging on the shelf as we go through that transition. That particularly affected the transition of our gourmet business to organic. The timing of Memorial Day also may have pushed some of our barbecue and grilling product sales into Q3. Memorial Day is a week later. On the calendar, it's on the 30th this year. It was almost the last possible day that it could be. And so, we believe that that probably influenced the start of grilling. We know that's the case with a couple of particular customers. But that wasn't a surprise to us. We know what the calendar looked like and so that was already reflected in our thinking about both Q2 and about Q3. And then finally, in Canada, the Americas number that we reported and just for the U.S. and that includes Canada and a small Latin American operation. In Canada, we took a lot of pricing in this time period, due to the -- in part, to recover the transaction cost of currency. And this has had an impact on the volume growth on the market. Gordon, Mike, do you want to comment on this any further?"

Just wondering if that's something you have on the radar screen and whether you consider that. And then, as a follow-up question, coming back to the U.S. consumer business, it seems as though the regular spices and herbs are doing very, very well, very aligned with cooking from scratch, definitely on a roll. It seems as though the seasoning mixes, the recipe mixes are a bit slower. Do you have a view as to why that might be? You made a loss of the GMO-free statures of a lot of the regular herbs last quarter. People worried about some of the additives in those recipe mixes, and that something you can address? Thank you and I'll pass it on."

First of all, on the conversion to -- of our gourmet to organic, that is continuing on pace. We set a goal of having 80% organic by the end of the year. We still expect to achieve that. I will say that the conversion of organic has been more challenging for us than perhaps we anticipated. The supply chain and the kind of quality controls that we insist on in terms of product supply has been harder for us to develop. It's just a less mature supply chain out there. And we've gotten such a lift from the conversion to organic that the volume has been higher than we initially anticipated, which has slowed the transition just because that just much more pressure on an immature supply chain. For the non-GMO conversion, that really was more about us calling out what we already do. And so, that one has gone quite a pace and actually have it's characterize that one is running ahead of a little bit ahead of pace, a little bit ahead of the pace that we had anticipated. We are not really looking at either one of these as opportunities to take more pricing. Both of these moves were done to give greater transparency to the consumer, to continue to differentiate McCormick versus competition, to frankly take credit for all that we do in terms of quality and purity of product, much in line with the communication we're giving to consumers at our purity advertising campaign. We also did this in part to take away some of the reason for being for other competitive brands, and some of the smaller brands in the store have gotten in because they've made claims like this and we wanted to take away the reason for being for those smaller brands as well as we thought to rebuild our share position.

I think also, our brands and our product -- really our category is in line with what consumers want to eat today. And as consumers cook at home more and are more ambitious about the things that they cook, our brand is a big beneficiary of that. I think that we have a bit of a natural tailwind from two sources. One is the new dietary guidelines news that came out this year. That has really encouraged consumers to make greater use of herbs and spices. That's a positive for our category, but as the leader in the category, we're a very big beneficiary of that. And then, the second thing is that we actually do better with millennials than we do with boomers.

This has been an ongoing program that we've been talking about on calls and at conferences for the last 2 years really as we've evolved our analytic capabilities and understanding of price elasticity and worked with retailers in modeling the category in a way that really optimizes the profitability of the category for them. And as it generally works out, what optimizes the category for the retailer tends to be good news for the McCormick brand as well. So we've been adding tools that allow us to give greater and greater precision and give fact and database guidance to retailers on pricing decisions for the category as a whole and assortment decisions for the category as a whole. Those recommendations include, in many cases, lowering the price point on McCormick brand products. Sometimes that includes our recommendations about changes in the price points for their private label, for economy brands and for other brands in the category where they may have some irrational pricing that's happening in the store or where they may have pricing that they don't even know about because there may be a rack of spices in another department of the store that the spice category buyer doesn't have visibility to, and category profitability is the leaking out through that backdoor. So we've made those kinds of recommendation. And those retailers who have accepted those recommendations have tended to outperform the category and we've outperformed -- and we've definitely gained share in the cases where those retailers have taken our recommendations. I think in our remarks, though, we may have -- I don't know if we included it in our remarks, but with retailers who have taken our recommendations, I think, in the first quarter, we reported that we've gained about 60 basis points of share. We can now track that to 120 basis points of share gain in those retailers who have accepted our recommendations, and that set is becoming a bigger and bigger set of retailers. One of the ways that bleeds through in the syndicated data is that our unit share growth has been stronger than the category where our dollar share of growth is tracking slightly behind of the category. That's really reflecting that shifting of the retail price points."

Thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results continued the momentum we saw on the first quarter of 2016. We're driving this performance with our growth strategies and our people. But thanks to McC",2456,"Thank you, Joyce, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results continued the momentum we saw on the first quarter of 2016. We're driving this performance with our growth strategies and our people. But thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their effort and engagement, for the first half financial results and business momentum together, we have greater confidence in our financial outlook for fiscal year 2016.
The strong results this quarter started at the top line. In constant currency, we grew sales 6% for the total company, and the increase in our consumer segment sales was particularly strong with an 8% increase. Contributing factors were 3 acquisitions completed in the last 12 months, along with growth in our base business and new products, our 3 drivers of long-term sales growth.
Based on these results, we reaffirm our fiscal year outlook for 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency and, with the recent acquisition of Gourmet Garden, have greater confidence in the upper end of this range.
We saw sequential improvement in gross profit margin with a gain of 130 basis points, following the 70 basis point increase in the first quarter. This improvement was led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI; and we had a benefit this period from favorable business mix, including strong sales in our core U.S. consumer business. As a result, we're now tracking toward the higher end of our fiscal year projection for gross profit margin improvement.
Back in February, we set a goal to achieve $400 million of cost savings over the next 4 years. At about 2% of sales, this is an ambitious target, but one that is backed by increased resources under Mike Smith's leadership. Importantly, we're taking a deliberate approach so that we do not disrupt the great progress underway with our top line growth strategies.
Through the first half of 2016, we're off to a great start with this work and are increasing our fiscal year 2016 projection to a range of $100 million to $110 million. This is our fuel for growth as demonstrated by our second quarter investment in brand marketing, which we increased 16% or $10 million from the year-ago period. As a further investment, we funded $5 million of increased incremental spending in the second quarter in support of our acquisition activity, a key element of our growth strategy.
Even with the incremental spending to drive growth, we increased constant-currency adjusted operating income 7%, led by the higher sales and gross profit margin. Year-to-date, this puts us at a 9% constant-currency increase, which is within our fiscal year 9% to 11% objective.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 was comparable to the year-ago period. We had a strong increase in adjusted operating income, although this was offset by a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter includes the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
For the fiscal year 2016, we reaffirm our outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $3.68 to $3.75 and have more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range based on our financial performance through the first half and our projections for the next few quarters.
On Slide 5, we've summarized our fiscal year 2016 guidance in constant currency, which is at or above our long-term outlook. In his remarks, Gordon will provide some additional insight into the quarter and into our outlook.
I'd like to turn next to some business updates, with a focus this morning on the steady improvement on our U.S. consumer business, our great new product lineup for the second half, highlights of other parts of our business and comments on our acquisition activity and outlook.
For our U.S. consumer business, category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong, reaching an 8% year-on-year increase in the latest quarter. 2/3 of this increase was higher volume and believe -- and we believe this is being driven by new product launches such as our herb grinders, brand marketing support and the recent dietary guideline news. A lot of the growth is in those herbs and spices that are pantry staples.
During this same period, retail sales of McCormick brand spices and seasonings rose 7% year-on-year. As the graph on Slide 6 shows, this continues our trajectory of sequential increase and compares to a 5% increase in the first quarter consumption data.
Across all of our spice and seasoning brands, not only McCormick but niche brands like Lawry's, OLD BAY and El Guapo, our share performance continued to improve. We were down just 10 basis points, so almost even in this latest period. When Gourmet Garden is included, our share is up 20 basis points, again, a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The information on Slide 6 is based on retail dollar sales for spices and seasonings.
As noted on Slide 7, on a unit basis, second quarter retail sales grew 6% for the category and 7% for McCormick brand spices and seasonings. There are 3 key messages here: first, we gained category share on a unit basis; second, the McCormick brand is helping drive the unit category increase; and third, this is evidence that certain retailers are implementing our recommendations to lower retail price points on the McCormick brand.
As for the recipe mix category, retail dollar sales of our McCormick brand recipe mixes were up 3%, and we gained 10 basis points of category share. We're driving this great performance by our actions to win at retail, build our brand equity and accelerate innovation.
To win at retail, we've been increasing our investment in category management tools, resources and capabilities. We're pleased with our progress and continue to build our capabilities. We're getting great feedback from our customers. They've commented that McCormick has really stepped up its game and is having a more thorough conversation on the category. Part of our category management work is focused on retail price points. At retail customers who have partnered with us on pricing recommendations, the year-to-date dollar share from McCormick brand spices and seasonings is up 120 basis points versus a 70 basis point decrease with the remaining U.S. food retailers. The good news is that this increase in share for McCormick brand is typically a profitable mood for both us and our customers.
As I indicated, we had a significant increase in brand marketing this quarter, and about half of the increase was in the U.S. This included marketing support for our pure tastes better campaign, the launch of our herb grinders, Hispanic advertising and digital marketing for Grill Mates as we headed into Memorial Day and peak grilling season.
We're also getting good traction with our product innovation and, in January, showed you our plans for the first half of 2016. Let's take a look ahead at the second half lineup for our U.S. consumer business.
We're poised to launch a number of new products for consumers in this market, as seen on Slide 8. These include flavored black pepper, 5 different tastes for McCormick's iconic black pepper, from mild and smoky to tangy and hot; organic recipe mixes for convenient flavorful weeknight dinners; organic Kitchen Basics stocks and a new bone broth to add protein to your diet. Within our gourmet line, we're launching signature Asian flavors inspired by our flavor forecast that include Japanese 7 spice and Korean style red pepper and pairings of helpful ingredients like chia, flax and matcha with spices and herbs, and a line of Lawry's brand Casero blends to deliver authentic Mexican and Latino taste. We're also relaunching our entire produce partners line with new packaging. These products, like grape guacamole and salsa seasoning, are merchandised right in the high-traffic produce department.
We also have an exciting lineup for markets outside of the U.S. In the Americas region, Canada is targeting millennial consumers with limited-edition recipe mixes and flavors like Sriracha buffalo wing and Peruvian roast chicken, and extending their line of produce partner blends. Our team in Central America is introducing a line of 5 new cooking sauces. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our goal is to lead the development and growth of the barbecue category, and our latest product introduction is a line of burger seasoning mixes in the U.K. Across a number of countries in this region, we're gaining distribution for our herb grinders and have a new television ad ready to drive consumer awareness. And in France, we're continuing a steady stream of innovation for our Vahiné dessert brand with new decorating items and new packaging features.
Moving to our Asia/Pacific region, we're extending our recipe mixes in China. These products help consumers create hot and spicy Schezwan dishes and experience flavors from around the world, like lemon curry roasted chicken wings and Brazilian barbecue seasoning. Part of our Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiment business in China, we're introducing cooking wine and vinegar. And in Australia, our iconic Aeroplane brand had a commanding lead in gelatin, and we've been stretching the brand to other dessert categories. Our latest plans are to launch Aeroplane liquid shake mixes.
While we do not get too specific with our industrial product development, McCormick is well positioned for innovation with our certification as global supplier for an increasing number of our large customers. Our range of flavor solutions for these customers is one of the broadest in the industry, as evidenced by recent product development work for snack chip seasonings, cracker seasonings, beverage flavors, ice cream toppings, sandwich sauces and burger seasonings.
Let's turn next to our performance and outlook for some other parts of our business, and we'll start with China.  China is our second largest market after the U.S. We've been in this market for more than 25 years, made a very successful acquisition in 2013 and are excited about our prospects for growth. For our consumer business, we grew constant-currency sales through the first half by 8% with new products, expanded distribution and brand marketing. There's been some fluctuation in sales growth by quarter due to shifts in timing related to promotional activity as well as the timing of shipments related to a successful implementation of SAP in our Central China operation. Our consumer business in this market remains solid, and we continue to expect good growth in 2016 and beyond.
For our industrial segment, year-to-date constant-currency sales in China were up 8%, with higher volume and product mix. We anticipate some sales pressure in the second half as a large customer will be diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies. Based on our current pace of growth and latest outlook across both our consumer and industrial businesses in China, we expect our success in this market to continue, with fiscal year 2016 constant-currency sales growing at a mid- to high single-digit rate.
As for the industrial business in the Americas, we're delivering strong sales of branded food service products along with new product wins for snack seasonings, beverage flavors and burger seasonings. On the innovation front, we're in a great position as we see accelerated moves by our customers toward no-process flavors and non-GMO ingredients. We're making inroads with some additional restaurant chains. And Brand Aromatics, acquired just over a year ago, is ahead of plan in both sales and profit. Together, these successes are driving not only top line growth, but higher profit margins with a more favorable mix.
In EMEA, or industrial sales slowed this quarter as we lapped some of the new distribution wins that drove a portion of our sales growth in 2015, but we're still encouraged by our innovation pipeline and the geographic expansion of our customers in this region. We also had weak sales for a joint venture in South Africa that we plan to exit by year-end.
Our consumer business sales in EMEA benefited from a roughly 50% increase in brand marketing in the second quarter. Excluding acquisitions and on a constant-currency basis, we grew volume and product mix 3% versus the year-ago quarter with strength in our largest market, France, and a double-digit increase in both Poland and Russia that was driven in part by expanded distribution.
The last update I wanted to provide was on our acquisition activity and outlook. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce our purchase of Botanical Food Company in Australia, which manufactures and sells the Gourmet Garden brand. Gourmet Garden is a global market leader in on-trend chilled convenient packaged herbs, exporting products through our manufacturing location in Australia to 15 other countries, with the largest being the U.S. Annual sales are more than $50 million, and the purchase price for this high-growth business was at 12x multiple to EBITDA. We anticipate continued double-digit sales growth for these products that offer consumers a convenient flavor alternative to fresh herbs. Importantly, these closer-to-fresh products are shelved with produce and allow us to participate in this highly traffic perimeter department.
Going forward, we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These include assets where flavor and health intersect to extend our current footprint with healthy flavors and great brands; value-added, higher-margin industrial assets; acquisitions that build scale where we currently have a presence in developed and emerging markets; and in size, both large assets as well as smaller bolt-on opportunities.
Our pursuit of Premier Foods earlier this year demonstrates our interest in larger businesses that fit with our growth strategy. And I hope that our ultimate decision not to make a firm offer also showed investors that McCormick remains financially disciplined in its use of cash.
To summarize my remarks, we're well-positioned as a global leader in flavor and are driving strong momentum with our growth strategies. We achieved great results through the first half and have increased confidence in delivering the higher end for our 2016 financial outlook.
Now before I turn it over to Gordon, we announced yesterday Gordon's decision to retire at the end of this year. Gordon has been an exceptional leader at McCormick. During his 28 years with the company, he's built a world-class finance team that, under his leadership, has helped deliver exceptional returns for our shareholders. His strategic leadership and focus on value creation have been instrumental in driving our successful acquisition agenda, expanding our shared services around the world and managing our cost and cash, including the establishment of our CCI program. Gordon is the embodiment of McCormick values and teamwork and will truly be missed by me and employees throughout the organization. Gordon, congratulations on your successful career, all of your achievements and your upcoming retirement."

So congratulations to you, Mike.
Now let's get back to our latest financial results. As Lawrence indicated, we are pleased with our second quarter results and have good momentum heading into the second half of 2016. I'll provide some additional remarks and insights on our second quarter results, followed by the details of our current 2016 financial outlook.
On a constant-currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing, taken in response to higher material cost, each contributed to the increase, as seen on Slide 14. The growth this quarter was led by our consumer segment.
On Slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 6% in constant currency, with about half of the increase from acquisitions of both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was led by a strong performance in our U.S. sales of McCormick brand spices and herbs, recipe mixes, our Lawry's brand and Simply Asia products. These were offset, in part, by a lower rate of growth in our sales of private label and economy brands. Also, volume and mix declined in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related, in part, to currency pressure.
In EMEA, we had another quarter of robust sales, up 20% in constant currency. This increase was driven by our year-ago acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari, which added 14 percentage points to the sales growth. We also expanded distribution of our products in Poland and Russia, and delivered a strong performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region were up just slightly in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 3 percentage points of growth. In China, as Lawrence noted, sales growth moderated in the second quarter due to the timing of customer purchases related to promotions and the successful implementation of SAP in our Wuhan facility. Year-to-date, we have grown consumer sales in China at a high single-digit rate on a constant-currency basis, and we expect to return to a higher growth rate in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Lowering our second quarter sales in this region was a decline in India resulting from our decision to discontinue certain low-margin products. This action in India lowered our second quarter sales growth rate in the region by 6 percentage points.
For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 7% to $86 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 8% from the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting an $8 million increase in brand marketing, a $5 million increase in acquisition-related expenses and higher material costs.
Turning to our industrial segment in Slide 19. We had solid results this quarter in both sales and profit, although this was a moderation from the first quarter, which included an incremental impact from Brand Aromatics. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 2% in constant currency. We increased U.S. sales of branded food service products and gained some new distribution with restaurant customers. In both the U.S. and Mexico, sales volume and product mix for snack seasonings were strong, although pricing was down due in part to lower cost for dairy ingredients.
In Canada, we passed through higher material cost to our customers with higher pricing, but this was offset by some volume weakness for industrial products in that market.  While we have had a long run of excellent performance from our industrial business in EMEA, this quarter, we lapped some of the new distribution gains in 2015. As a result, the sales growth rate moderated to a slight increase in constant currency. Also affecting industrial sales in this region was sales weakness in a small consolidated joint venture based in South Africa that we plan to exit by year-end.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region 9% in constant currency. The main driver was higher sales to quick-service restaurants in the region, mainly from our operation in China. As Lawrence indicated, we expect industrial sales pressure in the second half of 2016 in this market.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 1% at $43 million. In constant currency, the growth was 5%, driven by higher sales and our cost savings, offset in part by higher material costs and a $2 million increase in brand marketing to drive our branded food service business. Adjusted operating income margin for this segment in the second quarter reached 10.1%.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 5% in the second quarter from the year-ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 7%. This is below our 9% to 11% goal for the fiscal year, but includes the higher brand marketing and acquisition-related costs. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 9%, as Lawrence indicated.
We increased gross profit margin 130 basis points year-on-year to 40.7% in the second quarter of 2016. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset a moderate level of cost inflation.
Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 110 basis points from the second quarter of 2015. The increases in brand marketing and acquisition cost as a percentage of net sales were 140 basis points, more than accounting for the 110 basis point increase.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 23.1% compared to a very low 15.9% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. The second quarter 2016 tax rate of 23.1% was one of the reasons why the second quarter adjusted earnings per share came in ahead of the guidance we shared with you back in March. Given this result and absent additional discrete tax items for the remainder of the year, we are now estimating a fiscal year 2016 tax rate in the range of 27% to 28%.
Despite unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations rose 4% to $8 million. Our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, is performing well, with sales in constant currency up 7% year-to-date, although profit for this business was unfavorably impacted by higher material cost, especially the currency impact on soybean oil purchases. For the fiscal year, we expect income from unconsolidated operations to be down about 10%.
At the bottom line, second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.75. This was comparable to the year-ago period, with the impact of higher adjusted operating income offset by the higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
On Slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first half of 2016, cash flow from operations was $213 million compared to $186 million in the year-ago period, mainly due to the increase in net income. We returned $210 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $55 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the second quarter, $469 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to continue funding investments to drive our growth strategy.
Let's move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged. In fact, we have greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our sales growth and earnings per share ranges. At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% in constant currency, with higher pricing adding 1% to 2% of the increase. And with the addition of Gourmet Garden, we now expect acquisitions to add 2% to 3%. We expect this latest acquisition in our year-to-date performance to place us at the higher end of our 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth range.
We continue to expect a 9% to 11% constant-currency increase in adjusted operating income from $614 million of adjusted operating income in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range by 3 percentage points. We plan to drive our growth with higher sales and our stepped-up cost savings target of $100 million to $110 million. With this fuel for growth, we expect to increase brand marketing approximately $20 million, consistent with our initial plans.
Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share remains $3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. With our year-to-date results and outlook for the second half, we have more confidence in achieving the higher end of this range.
Regarding last week's referendum outcome on Brexit, the immediate impact to our business will be currency rates. Early this week, we reevaluated our guidance and determined that a 3% impact from currency is our best estimate at this point in time. Any longer-term impact on our business will depend in part on the outcome of tariff, trade and regulatory negotiations. As a point of reference, our sales in the U.K. were 8% of total company sales in fiscal year 2015.
As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016, with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.
That completes my remarks. So let's turn now to your questions."

First of all, I'll just start by saying we're very pleased with the results in our U.S. consumer business. We're quite pleased with the shipments. We're even more pleased with the continued improvement in the offtake information and this continued sequential improvement in our performance versus the category. I know that there's been a lot of questions, both from you and from others who are listening on the call, about exactly when our share will turn positive, and we keep saying that we're going to get there, and I believe that this is evidence that that's true. As we noted on the call, our sales increase for the U.S. consumer business includes more than just the McCormick brand. In our business, we also have economy brands and private label. And the growth of economy brands and private label were both lower than our sales of -- growth in our sales of branded products. And so that is a contributing factor to the difference versus -- in our shipments versus the offtake data for our brand. That's a mix shift that has also helped lift our profit margin, obviously. The second thing is that we're going through some major transitions on a couple of our product lines within herbs and spices. And in some cases, we have limited shipments to keep from having inventory of old packaging on the shelf as we go through that transition. That particularly affected the transition of our gourmet business to organic. The timing of Memorial Day also may have pushed some of our barbecue and grilling product sales into Q3. Memorial Day is a week later on the calendar. It's on the 30th this year, almost the last possible day that it could be. And so we believe that, that probably influenced the start of grilling. We know that's the case with a couple of particular customers, but it wasn't a surprise to us. We knew what the calendar looked like, and so that was already reflected in our thinking about both Q2 and about Q3. And then finally, in Canada, the Americas number that we reported, and just for U.S., and it includes Canada and a small Latin American operation, in Canada, we took a lot of pricing in this time period due to the, in part, to recover the transaction cost of currency. And this has had an impact on the volume growth on that market. Gordon, Mike, do you want to comment on this any further?"

We're not particularly calling out economy and private label, but we have talked about certain control brands that major retailers have that they put emphasis, promotional emphasis, on in the past. We are lapping that. That was a year ago. A major retailer took a very strong promotional stance on a very low-priced economy brand -- control brand that we manufacture for them and that has really run it's course. And I think that's what's coming through in the -- and maybe some softer shipments on economy and private label. I will say this is -- that, that change in mix is quite positive for us."

First of all, on margin goals, I just wanted to ask or make the observation that a number of other companies in this space has gone beyond just laying out, this is the $400 million of cost we're planning to get at, as you have actually gone on to set explicit operating margin goals over the next 2 or 3 years. Just wondering if that's something you have on the radar screen and whether you'd consider that. And then, as a follow-up question, coming back to the U.S. consumer business, it seems as though the regular spices and herbs are doing very, very well, very aligned with cooking from scratch, definitely on a roll. It seems as though the seasoning mixes, the recipe mixes, are a bit slower. Do you have a view as to why that might be? You made a loss of the GMO-free statures of a lot of the regular herbs last quarter. Are people worried about some of the additives in those recipe mixes? And is that something you can address? And I'll pass it on."

I'll be -- I'm glad to give an update on that and probably we should have built that into our prepared remarks. First of all, on the conversion to -- or of our gourmet to organic, that is continuing on pace. We set a goal of having 80% organic by the end of the year. We still expect to achieve that. I will say that the conversion of organic has been more challenging for us than perhaps we anticipated. The supply chain and the kind of quality controls that we insist on in terms of product supply has been harder for us to develop. It's just a less mature supply chain out there. And we've gotten such a lift from the conversion to organic that the volume has been higher than we initially anticipated, which has slowed the transition just because there's just that much more pressure on an immature supply chain. For the non-GMO conversion, that really was more about us calling out what we already do. And so that one has gone quite a pace and actually have characterized that one as running ahead of -- a little bit ahead of pace -- little bit ahead of the pace that we had anticipated. We're not really looking at either one of these as opportunities to take more pricing. Both of these moves were done to give greater transparency to the consumer, to continue to differentiate McCormick versus competition, to frankly take credit for all that we do in terms of quality and purity of product, much in line with the communication we're giving to consumers in our purity advertising campaign. We also did this in part to take away some of the reason for being for other competitive brands. And some of the smaller brands in the store have gotten in because they've made claims like this and we wanted to take away the reason for being for those smaller brands as well as we thought to rebuild our share position.

It's just they have a hard time generating repeat among all customers, at least versus where we were 5 years ago.

I think also our brands and our product are -- really our category is in line with the way consumers want to eat today. And as consumers cook at home more and are more ambitious about the things that they cook, our brand is a big beneficiary of that. I think that we have a bit of a natural tailwind from 2 sources. One is the new dietary guidelines news that came out this year that has really encouraged consumers to make greater use of herbs and spices. It's a positive for our category, but as the leader in the category, we're a very big beneficiary of that. And then, the second thing is that we actually do better with millennials than we do with boomers. And so as millennials come to be a bigger part of the shopper universe, that is actually a natural tailwind for us, which is different than some of our food company peers."

It's a higher percentage in the U.S. and so we believe that we fit right in. It's a bit of a sweet spot for us. I mean, part of the unique selling proposition that we take to our industrial customers is that we're not a chemical company. We're a food company. We approach their problems from a food and culinary perspective and that's where we start. We offer unique technical solutions that are very competitive. We have an increasing portfolio ourselves of proprietary technologies to solve their problems and this, we believe, is an important part of our long-term growth story."

We had a great innovation program that's brought new news to the category as well.

Obviously, to that incremental marketing spend is -- about half of it was in the first part of the year. That's impacting smaller quarters. As you go into the bigger quarters in the back half of the year, it doesn't have as much of an impact because just by virtue of the size of the quarters that are starting to come, it will not have as much of a negative impact on the growth rate because it's the same absolute dollars we're talking about.

This has been an ongoing program that we've been talking about on calls and in conferences for the last 2 years really as we've evolved our analytic capabilities and understanding of price elasticity and worked with retailers on modeling the category in a way that really optimizes the profitability of the category for them. And as it generally works out, what optimizes the category for the retailer tends to be good news for the McCormick brand as well. So we've been adding tools that allow us to give greater and greater precision and give fact and database guidance to retailers on pricing decisions for the category as a whole and assortment decisions for the category as a whole. Those recommendations include, in many cases, lowering the price points on McCormick brand products. Sometimes that includes our recommendations about changes in the price points for their private label, for economy brands and for other brands in the category where they may have some irrational pricing that's happening in the store or where they may have pricing that they don't even know about because there may be a rack of spices in another department of the store that the spice category buyer doesn't even have visibility to and category profitability is the leaking out through that backdoor. So we've made those kind of recommendations. And those retailers who have accepted those recommendations have tended to outperform the category, and we've outperformed -- and we've definitely gained share in the cases where those retailers have taken our recommendations. I think in our remarks, though, we may have -- I don't know if we included it in our remarks, but with retailers who have taken our recommendations, I think, in the first quarter, we reported that we've gained about 60 basis points of share. We can now track that to 120 basis points of share gain in those retailers who have accepted our recommendations, and that set is becoming a bigger and bigger set of retailers. One of the ways that bleeds through in the syndicated data is that our unit share growth has been stronger than the category where our dollar share of growth is tracking slightly behind the category. That's really reflecting that shifting in the retail price points."

181176,364861314,1003756,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Joyce, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results continued the momentum we saw in the first quarter of 2016. We're driving this performance with our growth strategies and our people. But thanks to McC",2460,"Thank you, Joyce, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results continued the momentum we saw in the first quarter of 2016. We're driving this performance with our growth strategies and our people. But thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their effort and engagement. With our first half financial results and business momentum together, we have greater confidence in our financial outlook for fiscal year 2016.
The strong results this quarter started at the top line. In constant currency, we grew sales 6% for the total company, and the increase in our consumer segment sales was particularly strong with an 8% increase. Contributing factors were 3 acquisitions completed in the last 12 months, along with growth in our base business and new products, our 3 drivers of long-term sales growth.
Based on these results, we reaffirm our fiscal year outlook for a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency and, with the recent acquisition of Gourmet Garden, have greater confidence in the upper end of this range.
We saw sequential improvement in gross profit margin with a gain of 130 basis points, following a 70 basis point increase in the first quarter. This improvement was led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI; and we had a benefit this period from favorable business mix, including strong sales in our core U.S. consumer business. As a result, we're now tracking toward the higher end of our fiscal year projection for gross profit margin improvement.
Back in February, we set a goal to achieve $400 million of cost savings over the next 4 years. At about 2% of sales, this is an ambitious target, but one that is backed by increased resources under Mike Smith's leadership. Importantly, we're taking a deliberate approach so that we do not disrupt the great progress underway with our top line growth strategies.
Through the first half of 2016, we're off to a great start with this work and are increasing our fiscal year 2016 projection to a range of $100 million to $110 million. This is our fuel for growth as demonstrated by our second quarter investment in brand marketing, which we increased 16% or $10 million from the year-ago period. As a further investment, we funded $5 million of increased incremental spending in the second quarter in support of our acquisition activity, a key element of our growth strategy.
Even with the incremental spending to drive growth, we increased constant-currency adjusted operating income 7%, led by the higher sales and gross profit margin. Year-to-date, this puts us at a 9% constant-currency increase, which is within our fiscal year 9% to 11% objective.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 was comparable to the year-ago period. We had a strong increase in adjusted operating income, although this was offset by a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter includes the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
For the fiscal year 2016, we reaffirm our outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $3.68 to $3.75 and have more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range based on our financial performance through the first half and our projections for the next few quarters.
On Slide 5, we've summarized our fiscal year 2016 guidance in constant currency, which is at or above our long-term outlook. In his remarks, Gordon will provide some additional insight into the quarter and into our outlook.
I'd like to turn next to some business updates, with a focus this morning on the steady improvement in our U.S. consumer business, our great new product lineup for the second half, highlights of other parts of our business and comments on our acquisition activity and outlook.
For our U.S. consumer business, category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong, reaching an 8% year-on-year increase in the latest quarter. 2/3 of this increase was higher volume and believe -- and we believe this is being driven by new product launches such as our herb grinders, brand marketing support and the recent dietary guideline news. A lot of the growth is in those herbs and spices that are pantry staples.
During this same period, retail sales of McCormick brand spices and seasonings rose 7% year-on-year. As the graph on Slide 6 shows, this continues our trajectory of sequential increase and compares to a 5% increase in the first quarter consumption data.
Across all of our spice and seasoning brands, not only McCormick but niche brands like Lawry's, OLD BAY and El Guapo, our share performance continued to improve. We were down just 10 basis points, so almost even in this latest period. When Gourmet Garden is included, our share is up 20 basis points, again, a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The information on Slide 6 is based on retail dollar sales for spices and seasonings.
As noted on Slide 7, on a unit basis, second quarter retail sales grew 6% for the category and 7% for McCormick brand spices and seasonings. There are 3 key messages here: first, we gained category share on a unit basis; second, the McCormick brand is helping drive the unit category increase; and third, this is evidence that certain retailers are implementing our recommendations to lower retail price points on the McCormick brand.
As for the recipe mix category, retail dollar sales of our McCormick brand recipe mixes were up 3%, and we gained 10 basis points of category share. We're driving this great performance by our actions to win at retail, build our brand equity and accelerate innovation.
To win at retail, we've been increasing our investment in category management tools, resources and capabilities. We're pleased with our progress and continue to build our capabilities. We're getting great feedback from our customers. They've commented that McCormick has really stepped up its game and is having a more thorough conversation on the category. Part of our category management work has focused on retail price points. At retail, customers who have partnered with us on pricing recommendations, the year-to-date dollar share from McCormick brand spices and seasonings is up 120 basis points versus a 70 basis point decrease with the remaining U.S. food retailers. The good news is that this increase in share for McCormick brand is typically a profitable mood [ph] for both us and our customers.
As I indicated, we had a significant increase in brand marketing this quarter and about half of the increase was in the U.S. This included marketing support for our Pure Tastes Better campaign, the launch of our herb grinders, Hispanic advertising and digital marketing for Grill Mates as we headed into Memorial Day and peak grilling season.
We're also getting good traction with our product innovation and, in January, showed you our plans for the first half of 2016. Let's take a look ahead at the second half lineup for our U.S. consumer business.
We're poised to launch a number of new products for consumers in this market, as seen on Slide 8. These include flavored black pepper, 5 different tastes for McCormick's iconic black pepper, from mild and smoky to tangy and hot; organic recipe mixes for convenient flavorful weeknight dinners; organic Kitchen Basics stocks and a new bone broth to add protein to your diet. Within our gourmet line, we're launching signature Asian flavors inspired by our Flavor Forecast that include Japanese 7 spice and Korean style red pepper and pairings of healthful ingredients like chia, flax and matcha with spices and herbs, and a line of Lawry's brand Casero blends to deliver authentic Mexican and Latino taste. We're also relaunching our entire produce partners line with new packaging. These products, like great guacamole and salsa seasoning, are merchandised right in the high-traffic produce department.
We also have an exciting lineup for markets outside of the U.S. In the Americas region, Canada is targeting millennial consumers with limited-edition recipe mixes in flavors like Sriracha buffalo wing and Peruvian roast chicken, and extending their line of produce partner blends. Our team in Central America is introducing a line of 5 new cooking sauces. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our goal is to lead the development and growth of the barbecue category, and our latest product introduction is a line of burger seasoning mixes in the U.K. Across a number of countries in this region, we're gaining distribution for our herb grinders and have a new television ad ready to drive consumer awareness. And in France, we're continuing a steady stream of innovation for our Vahiné dessert brand with new decorating items and new packaging features.
Moving to our Asia/Pacific region, we're extending our recipe mixes in China. These products help consumers create hot and spicy Schezwan dishes and experience flavors from around the world, like lemon curry roasted chicken wings and Brazilian barbecue seasoning. Part of our Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiment business in China, we're introducing cooking wine and vinegar. And in Australia, our iconic Aeroplane brand has a commanding lead in gelatin, and we've been stretching the brand to other dessert categories. Our latest plans are to launch Aeroplane liquid shake mixes.
While we do not get too specific with our industrial product development, McCormick is well positioned for innovation with our certification as a global supplier for an increasing number of our large customers. Our range of flavor solutions for these customers is one of the broadest in the industry, as evidenced by recent product development work for snack chip seasonings, cracker seasonings, beverage flavors, ice cream toppings, sandwich sauces and burger seasonings.
Let's turn next to our performance and outlook for some other parts of our business, and we'll start with China.  China is our second largest market after the U.S. We've been in this market for more than 25 years. We had a very successful acquisition in 2013 and are excited about our prospects for growth. For our consumer business, we grew constant-currency sales through the first half by 8% with new products, expanded distribution and brand marketing. There's been some fluctuation in sales growth by quarter due to shifts in timing related to promotional activity as well as the timing of shipments related to a successful implementation of SAP in our Central China operation. Our consumer business in this market remains solid, and we continue to expect good growth in 2016 and beyond.
For our industrial segment, year-to-date constant-currency sales in China were up 8%, with higher volume and product mix. We anticipate some sales pressure in the second half as a large customer will be diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies. Based on our current pace of growth and latest outlook across both our consumer and industrial businesses in China, we expect our success in this market to continue, with fiscal year 2016 constant-currency sales growing at a mid- to high single-digit rate.
As for the industrial business in the Americas, we're delivering strong sales of branded food service products along with new product wins for snack seasonings, beverage flavors and burger seasonings. On the innovation front, we're in a great position as we see accelerated moves by our customers toward no-processed flavors and non-GMO ingredients. We're making inroads with some additional restaurant chains. And Brand Aromatics, acquired just over a year ago, is ahead of plan in both sales and profit. Together, these successes are driving not only top line growth, but higher profit margins with a more favorable mix.
In EMEA, our industrial sales slowed this quarter as we lapped some of the new distribution wins that drove a portion of our sales growth in 2015, but we're still encouraged by our innovation pipeline and the geographic expansion of our customers in this region. We also had weak sales for a joint venture in South Africa that we plan to exit by year-end.
Our consumer business sales in EMEA benefited from a roughly 50% increase in brand marketing in the second quarter. Excluding acquisitions and on a constant-currency basis, we grew volume and product mix 3% versus the year-ago quarter with strength in our largest market, France, and a double-digit increase in both Poland and Russia that was driven in part by expanded distribution.
The last update I wanted to provide was on our acquisition activity and outlook. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce our purchase of Botanical Food Company in Australia, which manufactures and sells the Gourmet Garden brand. Gourmet Garden is a global market leader in on-trend chilled convenient packaged herbs, exporting products from our manufacturing location in Australia to 15 other countries, with the largest being the U.S. Annual sales are more than $50 million, and the purchase price for this high-growth business was a 12x multiple of EBITDA. We anticipate continued double-digit sales growth for these products that offer consumers a convenient flavor alternative to fresh herbs. Importantly, these closer-to-fresh products are shelved with produce and allow us to participate in this highly trafficked perimeter department.
Going forward, we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These include assets where flavor and health intersect to extend our current footprint with healthy flavors and great brands; value-added, higher-margin industrial assets; acquisitions that build scale where we currently have a presence in developed and emerging markets; and in size, both large assets as well as smaller bolt-on opportunities.
Our pursuit of Premier Foods earlier this year demonstrates our interest in larger businesses that fit with our growth strategy. And I hope that our ultimate decision not to make a firm offer also showed investors that McCormick remains financially disciplined in its use of cash.
To summarize my remarks, we're well-positioned as a global leader in flavor and are driving strong momentum with our growth strategies. We achieved great results through the first half and have increased confidence in delivering the higher end of our 2016 financial outlook.
Now before I turn it over to Gordon, we announced yesterday Gordon's decision to retire at the end of this year. Gordon has been an exceptional leader at McCormick. During his 28 years with the company, he's built a world-class finance team that, under his leadership, has helped deliver exceptional returns for our shareholders. His strategic leadership and focus on value creation have been instrumental in driving our successful acquisition agenda, expanding our shared services around the world and managing our costs and cash, including the establishment of our CCI program. Gordon is the embodiment of McCormick values and teamwork and will truly be missed by me and employees throughout the organization. Gordon, congratulations on your successful career, all of your achievements and your upcoming retirement."

So congratulations to you, Mike.
Now let's get back to our latest financial results. As Lawrence indicated, we are pleased with our second quarter results and have good momentum heading into the second half of 2016. I'll provide some additional remarks and insights on our second quarter results, followed by the details of our current 2016 financial outlook.
On a constant-currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing, taken in response to higher material costs, each contributed to the increase, as seen on Slide 14. The growth this quarter was led by our consumer segment.
On Slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 6% in constant currency, with about half of the increase from acquisitions of both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was led by a strong performance in our U.S. sales of McCormick brand spices and herbs, recipe mixes, our Lawry's brand and Simply Asia products. These were offset, in part, by a lower rate of growth in our sales of private label and economy brands. Also, volume and mix declined in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related, in part, to currency pressure.
In EMEA, we had another quarter of robust sales, up 20% in constant currency. This increase was driven by our year-ago acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari, which added 14 percentage points to the sales growth. We also expanded distribution of our products in Poland and Russia, and delivered a strong performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region were up just slightly in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 3 percentage points of growth. In China, as Lawrence noted, sales growth moderated in the second quarter due to the timing of customer purchases related to promotions and the successful implementation of SAP in our Wuhan facility. Year-to-date, we have grown consumer sales in China at a high single-digit rate on a constant-currency basis, and we expect to return to a higher growth rate in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Lowering our second quarter sales in this region was a decline in India resulting from our decision to discontinue certain low-margin products. This action in India lowered our second quarter sales growth rate in the region by 6 percentage points.
For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 7% to $86 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 8% from the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting an $8 million increase in brand marketing, a $5 million increase in acquisition-related expenses and higher material costs.
Turning to our industrial segment in Slide 19. We had solid results this quarter in both sales and profit, although this was a moderation from the first quarter, which included an incremental impact from Brand Aromatics. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 2% in constant currency. We increased U.S. sales of branded food service products and gained some new distribution with restaurant customers. In both the U.S. and Mexico, sales volume and product mix for snack seasonings were strong, although pricing was down due in part to lower costs for dairy ingredients.
In Canada, we passed through higher material costs to our customers with higher pricing, but this was offset by some volume weakness for industrial products in that market.  While we have had a long run of excellent performance from our industrial business in EMEA, this quarter, we lapped some of the new distribution gained in 2015. As a result, the sales growth rate moderated to a slight increase in constant currency. Also affecting industrial sales in this region was sales weakness in a small consolidated joint venture based in South Africa that we plan to exit by year-end.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region 9% in constant currency. The main driver was higher sales to quick-service restaurants in the region, mainly from our operation in China. As Lawrence indicated, we expect industrial sales pressure in the second half of 2016 in this market.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 1% at $43 million. In constant currency, the growth was 5%, driven by higher sales and our cost savings, offset in part by higher material costs and a $2 million increase in brand marketing to drive our branded food service business. Adjusted operating income margin for this segment in the second quarter reached 10.1%.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 5% in the second quarter from the year-ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 7%. This is below our 9% to 11% goal for the fiscal year, but includes the higher brand marketing and acquisition-related costs. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 9%, as Lawrence indicated.
We increased gross profit margin 130 basis points year-on-year to 40.7% in the second quarter of 2016. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset a moderate level of cost inflation.
Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 110 basis points from the second quarter of 2015. The increases in brand marketing and acquisition cost as a percentage of net sales were 140 basis points, more than accounting for the 110 basis point increase.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 23.1% compared to a very low 15.9% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. The second quarter 2016 tax rate of 23.1% was one of the reasons why the second quarter adjusted earnings per share came in ahead of the guidance we shared with you back in March. Given this result and absent additional discrete tax items for the remainder of the year, we are now estimating a fiscal year 2016 tax rate in the range of 27% to 28%.
Despite unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations rose 4% to $8 million. Our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, is performing well, with sales in constant currency up 7% year-to-date, although profit for this business was unfavorably impacted by higher material costs, especially the currency impact on soybean oil purchases. For the fiscal year, we expect income from unconsolidated operations to be down about 10%.
At the bottom line, second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.75. This was comparable to the year-ago period, with the impact of higher adjusted operating income offset by the higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
On Slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first half of 2016, cash flow from operations was $213 million compared to $186 million in the year-ago period, mainly due to the increase in net income. We returned $210 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $55 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the second quarter, $469 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to continue funding investments to drive our growth strategy.
Let's move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged. In fact, we have greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our sales growth and earnings per share ranges. At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% in constant currency, with higher pricing adding 1% to 2% of the increase. And with the addition of Gourmet Garden, we now expect acquisitions to add 2% to 3%. We expect this latest acquisition and our year-to-date performance to place us at the higher end of our 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth range.
We continue to expect a 9% to 11% constant-currency increase in adjusted operating income from $614 million of adjusted operating income in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range by 3 percentage points. We plan to drive our growth with higher sales and our stepped-up cost savings target of $100 million to $110 million. With this fuel for growth, we expect to increase brand marketing approximately $20 million, consistent with our initial plans.
Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share remains $3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. With our year-to-date results and outlook for the second half, we have more confidence in achieving the higher end of this range.
Regarding last week's referendum outcome on Brexit, the immediate impact to our business will be currency rates. Early this week, we reevaluated our guidance and determined that a 3% impact from currency is our best estimate at this point in time. Any longer-term impact on our business will depend in part on the outcome of tariff, trade and regulatory negotiations. As a point of reference, our sales in the U.K. were 8% of total company sales in fiscal year 2015.
As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016, with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.
That completes my remarks. So let's turn now to your questions."

First of all, I'll just start by saying we're very pleased with the results in our U.S. consumer business. We're quite pleased with the shipments. We're even more pleased with the continued improvement in the offtake information and this continued sequential improvement in our performance versus the category. I know that there's been a lot of questions, both from you and from others who are listening on the call, about exactly when our share will turn positive, and we keep saying that we're going to get there, and I believe that this is evidence that that's true. As we noted on the call, our sales increase for the U.S. consumer business includes more than just the McCormick brand. In our business, we also have economy brands and private label. And the growth of economy brands and private label were both lower than our sales of -- growth in our sales of branded products. And so that is a contributing factor to the difference versus -- in our shipments versus the offtake data for our brand. That's a mix shift that has also helped lift our profit margin, obviously. The second thing is that we're going through some major transitions on a couple of our product lines within herbs and spices. And in some cases, we have limited shipments to keep from having inventory of old packaging on the shelf as we go through that transition. That particularly affected the transition of our gourmet business to organic. The timing of Memorial Day also may have pushed some of our barbecue and grilling product sales into Q3. Memorial Day is a week later on the calendar. It's on the 30th this year. It's almost on the last possible day that it could be. And so we believe that, that probably influenced the start of grilling. We know that's the case with a couple of particular customers, but it wasn't a surprise to us. We knew what the calendar looked like and so that was already reflected in our thinking about both Q2 and about Q3. And then finally, in Canada, the Americas number that we reported, and just for U.S., and it includes Canada and a small Latin American operation. In Canada, we took a lot of pricing in this time period due to the, in part, to recover the transaction costs of currency. And this has had an impact on the volume growth in that market. Gordon, Mike, do you want to comment on this any further?"

You made a loss of the GMO-free status of a lot of the regular herbs last quarter. Are people worried about some of the additives in those recipe mixes? And is that something you can address?"

We're launching our organic recipe mixes this quarter. We think that those are going to be a significant increment to our business. We've shown that recipe mixes are quite responsive to innovation. A big part of the improvement that we've had in this business has been the launch of recipe mixes such as the non-GMO -- sorry, not the non-GMO, the gluten-free recipe mixes, and we've got a great incremental response to that, and we expect the same for the organic recipe mixes."

I'll be -- I'm glad to give an update on that and probably we should have built that into our prepared remarks. First of all, on the conversion to -- or of our gourmet to organic, that is continuing on pace. We set a goal of having 80% organic by the end of the year. We still expect to achieve that. I will say that the conversion of organic has been more challenging for us than perhaps we anticipated. The supply chain and the kind of quality controls that we insist on in terms of product supply has been harder for us to develop. It's just a less mature supply chain out there. And we've gotten such a lift from the conversion to organic that the volume has been higher than we initially anticipated, which has slowed the transition just because there's just that much more pressure on an immature supply chain. For the non-GMO conversion, that really was more about us calling out what we already do. And so that one has gone quite a pace and actually I would characterize that one as running ahead of -- a little bit ahead of pace -- little bit ahead of the pace that we had anticipated. We're not really looking at either one of these as opportunities to take more pricing. Both of these moves were done to give greater transparency to the consumer, to continue to differentiate McCormick versus competition, to frankly take credit for all that we do in terms of quality and purity of product, much in line with the communication we're giving to consumers in our purity advertising campaign. We also did this in part to take away some of the reason for being for other competitive brands. And some of the smaller brands in the store have gotten in because they've made claims like this and we wanted to take away the reason for being for those smaller brands as well as we thought to rebuild our share position.

It's just they have a hard time generating repeat among old customers, at least versus where we were 5 years ago.

I think also our brands and our product are -- really our category is in line with the way consumers want to eat today. And as consumers cook at home more and are more ambitious about the things that they cook, our brand is a big beneficiary of that. I think that we have a bit of a natural tailwind from 2 sources. One is the new dietary guidelines news that came out this year that has really encouraged consumers to make greater use of herbs and spices. It's a positive for our category, but as the leader in the category, we're a big beneficiary of that. And then, the second thing is that we actually do better with millennials than we do with boomers.

I would point to, just from a math perspective, the tax rate was the biggest headwind in the first part of the year and we have pretty much gone through that. So the back half of the year, the tax rates will be more comparable to the prior year. So the strength that you see on that operating income line growth is what will be driving a lot of it. Obviously, too, that incremental marketing spend is -- about half of it was in the first part of the year. That's impacting smaller quarters. As you go into the bigger quarters in the back half of the year, it doesn't have as much of an impact because, just by virtue of the size of the quarters that are starting to come, it will not have as much of a negative impact on the growth rate because it's the same absolute dollars we're talking about. So I'd just point to strength of the business, CCI, tax comparison and the relative size of A&P as it relates to the size of the quarters in the back half of the year."

This has been an ongoing program that we've been talking about on calls and in conferences for the last 2 years really as we've evolved our analytic capabilities and understanding of price elasticity and have worked with retailers on modeling the category in a way that really optimizes the profitability of the category for them. And as it generally works out, what optimizes the category for the retailer tends to be good news for the McCormick brand as well. So we've been adding tools that allow us to give greater and greater precision and give fact and database guidance to retailers on pricing decisions for the category as a whole and assortment decisions for the category as a whole. Those recommendations include, in many cases, lowering the price points on McCormick brand products. Sometimes it includes our recommendations about changes in the price points for their private label, for economy brands and for other brands in the category where they may have some irrational pricing that's happening in the store or where they may have pricing that they don't even know about because there may be a rack of spices in another department of the store that the spice category buyer doesn't even have visibility to and category profitability is leaking out through that backdoor. So we've made those kind of recommendations. And those retailers who have accepted those recommendations have tended to outperform the category, and we've outperformed -- and we've definitely gained share in the cases where those retailers have taken our recommendations. I think in our remarks, though, we may have -- I don't know if we included it in our remarks, but with retailers who have taken our recommendations, I think, in the first quarter, we reported that we've gained about 60 basis points of share. We can now track that to 120 basis points of share gain in those retailers who have accepted our recommendations, and that set is becoming a bigger and bigger set of retailers. One of the ways that bleeds through in the syndicated data is that our unit share growth has been stronger than the category where our dollar share growth is tracking slightly behind the category. That's really reflecting that shifting in the retail price points."

181176,364861314,1003868,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Joyce, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results continued the momentum we saw in the first quarter of 2016. We're driving this performance with our growth strategies and our people. But thanks to McC",2460,"Thank you, Joyce, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. McCormick's second quarter results continued the momentum we saw in the first quarter of 2016. We're driving this performance with our growth strategies and our people. But thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their effort and engagement. With our first half financial results and business momentum together, we have greater confidence in our financial outlook for fiscal year 2016.
The strong results this quarter started at the top line. In constant currency, we grew sales 6% for the total company, and the increase in our consumer segment sales was particularly strong with an 8% increase. Contributing factors were 3 acquisitions completed in the last 12 months, along with growth in our base business and new products, our 3 drivers of long-term sales growth.
Based on these results, we reaffirm our fiscal year outlook for a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency and, with the recent acquisition of Gourmet Garden, have greater confidence in the upper end of this range.
We saw sequential improvement in gross profit margin with a gain of 130 basis points, following a 70 basis point increase in the first quarter. This improvement was led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI; and we had a benefit this period from favorable business mix, including strong sales in our core U.S. consumer business. As a result, we're now tracking toward the higher end of our fiscal year projection for gross profit margin improvement.
Back in February, we set a goal to achieve $400 million of cost savings over the next 4 years. At about 2% of sales, this is an ambitious target, but one that is backed by increased resources under Mike Smith's leadership. Importantly, we're taking a deliberate approach so that we do not disrupt the great progress underway with our top line growth strategies.
Through the first half of 2016, we're off to a great start with this work and are increasing our fiscal year 2016 projection to a range of $100 million to $110 million. This is our fuel for growth as demonstrated by our second quarter investment in brand marketing, which we increased 16% or $10 million from the year-ago period. As a further investment, we funded $5 million of increased incremental spending in the second quarter in support of our acquisition activity, a key element of our growth strategy.
Even with the incremental spending to drive growth, we increased constant-currency adjusted operating income 7%, led by the higher sales and gross profit margin. Year-to-date, this puts us at a 9% constant-currency increase, which is within our fiscal year 9% to 11% objective.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 was comparable to the year-ago period. We had a strong increase in adjusted operating income, although this was offset by a higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter includes the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
For the fiscal year 2016, we reaffirm our outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $3.68 to $3.75 and have more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range based on our financial performance through the first half and our projections for the next few quarters.
On Slide 5, we've summarized our fiscal year 2016 guidance in constant currency, which is at or above our long-term outlook. In his remarks, Gordon will provide some additional insight into the quarter and into our outlook.
I'd like to turn next to some business updates, with a focus this morning on the steady improvement in our U.S. consumer business, our great new product lineup for the second half, highlights of other parts of our business and comments on our acquisition activity and outlook.
For our U.S. consumer business, category growth for spices and seasonings continues to be strong, reaching an 8% year-on-year increase in the latest quarter. 2/3 of this increase was higher volume and believe -- and we believe this is being driven by new product launches such as our herb grinders, brand marketing support and the recent dietary guideline news. A lot of the growth is in those herbs and spices that are pantry staples.
During this same period, retail sales of McCormick brand spices and seasonings rose 7% year-on-year. As the graph on Slide 6 shows, this continues our trajectory of sequential increase and compares to a 5% increase in the first quarter consumption data.
Across all of our spice and seasoning brands, not only McCormick but niche brands like Lawry's, OLD BAY and El Guapo, our share performance continued to improve. We were down just 10 basis points, so almost even in this latest period. When Gourmet Garden is included, our share is up 20 basis points, again, a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The information on Slide 6 is based on retail dollar sales for spices and seasonings.
As noted on Slide 7, on a unit basis, second quarter retail sales grew 6% for the category and 7% for McCormick brand spices and seasonings. There are 3 key messages here: first, we gained category share on a unit basis; second, the McCormick brand is helping drive the unit category increase; and third, this is evidence that certain retailers are implementing our recommendations to lower retail price points on the McCormick brand.
As for the recipe mix category, retail dollar sales of our McCormick brand recipe mixes were up 3%, and we gained 10 basis points of category share. We're driving this great performance by our actions to win at retail, build our brand equity and accelerate innovation.
To win at retail, we've been increasing our investment in category management tools, resources and capabilities. We're pleased with our progress and continue to build our capabilities. We're getting great feedback from our customers. They've commented that McCormick has really stepped up its game and is having a more thorough conversation on the category. Part of our category management work has focused on retail price points. At retail, customers who have partnered with us on pricing recommendations, the year-to-date dollar share from McCormick brand spices and seasonings is up 120 basis points versus a 70 basis point decrease with the remaining U.S. food retailers. The good news is that this increase in share for McCormick brand is typically a profitable mood [ph] for both us and our customers.
As I indicated, we had a significant increase in brand marketing this quarter and about half of the increase was in the U.S. This included marketing support for our Pure Tastes Better campaign, the launch of our herb grinders, Hispanic advertising and digital marketing for Grill Mates as we headed into Memorial Day and peak grilling season.
We're also getting good traction with our product innovation and, in January, showed you our plans for the first half of 2016. Let's take a look ahead at the second half lineup for our U.S. consumer business.
We're poised to launch a number of new products for consumers in this market, as seen on Slide 8. These include flavored black pepper, 5 different tastes for McCormick's iconic black pepper, from mild and smoky to tangy and hot; organic recipe mixes for convenient flavorful weeknight dinners; organic Kitchen Basics stocks and a new bone broth to add protein to your diet. Within our gourmet line, we're launching signature Asian flavors inspired by our Flavor Forecast that include Japanese 7 spice and Korean style red pepper and pairings of healthful ingredients like chia, flax and matcha with spices and herbs, and a line of Lawry's brand Casero blends to deliver authentic Mexican and Latino taste. We're also relaunching our entire produce partners line with new packaging. These products, like great guacamole and salsa seasoning, are merchandised right in the high-traffic produce department.
We also have an exciting lineup for markets outside of the U.S. In the Americas region, Canada is targeting millennial consumers with limited-edition recipe mixes in flavors like Sriracha buffalo wing and Peruvian roast chicken, and extending their line of produce partner blends. Our team in Central America is introducing a line of 5 new cooking sauces. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our goal is to lead the development and growth of the barbecue category, and our latest product introduction is a line of burger seasoning mixes in the U.K. Across a number of countries in this region, we're gaining distribution for our herb grinders and have a new television ad ready to drive consumer awareness. And in France, we're continuing a steady stream of innovation for our Vahiné dessert brand with new decorating items and new packaging features.
Moving to our Asia/Pacific region, we're extending our recipe mixes in China. These products help consumers create hot and spicy Schezwan dishes and experience flavors from around the world, like lemon curry roasted chicken wings and Brazilian barbecue seasoning. Part of our Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiment business in China, we're introducing cooking wine and vinegar. And in Australia, our iconic Aeroplane brand has a commanding lead in gelatin, and we've been stretching the brand to other dessert categories. Our latest plans are to launch Aeroplane liquid shake mixes.
While we do not get too specific with our industrial product development, McCormick is well positioned for innovation with our certification as a global supplier for an increasing number of our large customers. Our range of flavor solutions for these customers is one of the broadest in the industry, as evidenced by recent product development work for snack chip seasonings, cracker seasonings, beverage flavors, ice cream toppings, sandwich sauces and burger seasonings.
Let's turn next to our performance and outlook for some other parts of our business, and we'll start with China.  China is our second largest market after the U.S. We've been in this market for more than 25 years. We had a very successful acquisition in 2013 and are excited about our prospects for growth. For our consumer business, we grew constant-currency sales through the first half by 8% with new products, expanded distribution and brand marketing. There's been some fluctuation in sales growth by quarter due to shifts in timing related to promotional activity as well as the timing of shipments related to a successful implementation of SAP in our Central China operation. Our consumer business in this market remains solid, and we continue to expect good growth in 2016 and beyond.
For our industrial segment, year-to-date constant-currency sales in China were up 8%, with higher volume and product mix. We anticipate some sales pressure in the second half as a large customer will be diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies. Based on our current pace of growth and latest outlook across both our consumer and industrial businesses in China, we expect our success in this market to continue, with fiscal year 2016 constant-currency sales growing at a mid- to high single-digit rate.
As for the industrial business in the Americas, we're delivering strong sales of branded food service products along with new product wins for snack seasonings, beverage flavors and burger seasonings. On the innovation front, we're in a great position as we see accelerated moves by our customers toward no-processed flavors and non-GMO ingredients. We're making inroads with some additional restaurant chains. And Brand Aromatics, acquired just over a year ago, is ahead of plan in both sales and profit. Together, these successes are driving not only top line growth, but higher profit margins with a more favorable mix.
In EMEA, our industrial sales slowed this quarter as we lapped some of the new distribution wins that drove a portion of our sales growth in 2015, but we're still encouraged by our innovation pipeline and the geographic expansion of our customers in this region. We also had weak sales for a joint venture in South Africa that we plan to exit by year-end.
Our consumer business sales in EMEA benefited from a roughly 50% increase in brand marketing in the second quarter. Excluding acquisitions and on a constant-currency basis, we grew volume and product mix 3% versus the year-ago quarter with strength in our largest market, France, and a double-digit increase in both Poland and Russia that was driven in part by expanded distribution.
The last update I wanted to provide was on our acquisition activity and outlook. During the second quarter, we were pleased to announce our purchase of Botanical Food Company in Australia, which manufactures and sells the Gourmet Garden brand. Gourmet Garden is a global market leader in on-trend chilled convenient packaged herbs, exporting products from our manufacturing location in Australia to 15 other countries, with the largest being the U.S. Annual sales are more than $50 million, and the purchase price for this high-growth business was a 12x multiple of EBITDA. We anticipate continued double-digit sales growth for these products that offer consumers a convenient flavor alternative to fresh herbs. Importantly, these closer-to-fresh products are shelved with produce and allow us to participate in this highly trafficked perimeter department.
Going forward, we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These include assets where flavor and health intersect to extend our current footprint with healthy flavors and great brands; value-added, higher-margin industrial assets; acquisitions that build scale where we currently have a presence in developed and emerging markets; and in size, both large assets as well as smaller bolt-on opportunities.
Our pursuit of Premier Foods earlier this year demonstrates our interest in larger businesses that fit with our growth strategy. And I hope that our ultimate decision not to make a firm offer also showed investors that McCormick remains financially disciplined in its use of cash.
To summarize my remarks, we're well-positioned as a global leader in flavor and are driving strong momentum with our growth strategies. We achieved great results through the first half and have increased confidence in delivering the higher end of our 2016 financial outlook.
Now before I turn it over to Gordon, we announced yesterday Gordon's decision to retire at the end of this year. Gordon has been an exceptional leader at McCormick. During his 28 years with the company, he's built a world-class finance team that, under his leadership, has helped deliver exceptional returns for our shareholders. His strategic leadership and focus on value creation have been instrumental in driving our successful acquisition agenda, expanding our shared services around the world and managing our costs and cash, including the establishment of our CCI program. Gordon is the embodiment of McCormick values and teamwork and will truly be missed by me and employees throughout the organization. Gordon, congratulations on your successful career, all of your achievements and your upcoming retirement."

I've had the privilege of working with him for many years and have watched him -- his career progress and witnessed his strong financial leadership and ability to drive results. So congratulations to you, Mike.
Now let's get back to our latest financial results. As Lawrence indicated, we are pleased with our second quarter results and have good momentum heading into the second half of 2016. I'll provide some additional remarks and insights on our second quarter results, followed by the details of our current 2016 financial outlook.
On a constant-currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing, taken in response to higher material costs, each contributed to the increase, as seen on Slide 14. The growth this quarter was led by our consumer segment.
On Slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 6% in constant currency, with about half of the increase from acquisitions of both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was led by a strong performance in our U.S. sales of McCormick brand spices and herbs, recipe mixes, our Lawry's brand and Simply Asia products. These were offset, in part, by a lower rate of growth in our sales of private label and economy brands. Also, volume and mix declined in Canada as consumers adjust to some significant price increases related, in part, to currency pressure.
In EMEA, we had another quarter of robust sales, up 20% in constant currency. This increase was driven by our year-ago acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari, which added 14 percentage points to the sales growth. We also expanded distribution of our products in Poland and Russia, and delivered a strong performance in France with new products and brand marketing.
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region were up just slightly in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 3 percentage points of growth. In China, as Lawrence noted, sales growth moderated in the second quarter due to the timing of customer purchases related to promotions and the successful implementation of SAP in our Wuhan facility. Year-to-date, we have grown consumer sales in China at a high single-digit rate on a constant-currency basis, and we expect to return to a higher growth rate in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Lowering our second quarter sales in this region was a decline in India resulting from our decision to discontinue certain low-margin products. This action in India lowered our second quarter sales growth rate in the region by 6 percentage points.
For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 7% to $86 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 8% from the year-ago period, with the impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting an $8 million increase in brand marketing, a $5 million increase in acquisition-related expenses and higher material costs.
Turning to our industrial segment in Slide 19. We had solid results this quarter in both sales and profit, although this was a moderation from the first quarter, which included an incremental impact from Brand Aromatics. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 2% in constant currency. We increased U.S. sales of branded food service products and gained some new distribution with restaurant customers. In both the U.S. and Mexico, sales volume and product mix for snack seasonings were strong, although pricing was down due in part to lower costs for dairy ingredients.
In Canada, we passed through higher material costs to our customers with higher pricing, but this was offset by some volume weakness for industrial products in that market.  While we have had a long run of excellent performance from our industrial business in EMEA, this quarter, we lapped some of the new distribution gained in 2015. As a result, the sales growth rate moderated to a slight increase in constant currency. Also affecting industrial sales in this region was sales weakness in a small consolidated joint venture based in South Africa that we plan to exit by year-end.
We grew industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region 9% in constant currency. The main driver was higher sales to quick-service restaurants in the region, mainly from our operation in China. As Lawrence indicated, we expect industrial sales pressure in the second half of 2016 in this market.
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 1% at $43 million. In constant currency, the growth was 5%, driven by higher sales and our cost savings, offset in part by higher material costs and a $2 million increase in brand marketing to drive our branded food service business. Adjusted operating income margin for this segment in the second quarter reached 10.1%.
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, rose 5% in the second quarter from the year-ago period. If we also exclude the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 7%. This is below our 9% to 11% goal for the fiscal year, but includes the higher brand marketing and acquisition-related costs. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 9%, as Lawrence indicated.
We increased gross profit margin 130 basis points year-on-year to 40.7% in the second quarter of 2016. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and organization and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset a moderate level of cost inflation.
Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 110 basis points from the second quarter of 2015. The increases in brand marketing and acquisition cost as a percentage of net sales were 140 basis points, more than accounting for the 110 basis point increase.
Below the operating income line, the tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 23.1% compared to a very low 15.9% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. The second quarter 2016 tax rate of 23.1% was one of the reasons why the second quarter adjusted earnings per share came in ahead of the guidance we shared with you back in March. Given this result and absent additional discrete tax items for the remainder of the year, we are now estimating a fiscal year 2016 tax rate in the range of 27% to 28%.
Despite unfavorable currency, income from unconsolidated operations rose 4% to $8 million. Our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, is performing well, with sales in constant currency up 7% year-to-date, although profit for this business was unfavorably impacted by higher material costs, especially the currency impact on soybean oil purchases. For the fiscal year, we expect income from unconsolidated operations to be down about 10%.
At the bottom line, second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $0.75. This was comparable to the year-ago period, with the impact of higher adjusted operating income offset by the higher tax rate. Keep in mind that this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income.
On Slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first half of 2016, cash flow from operations was $213 million compared to $186 million in the year-ago period, mainly due to the increase in net income. We returned $210 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $55 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the second quarter, $469 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains sound. We are generating strong cash flow, and we are well positioned to continue funding investments to drive our growth strategy.
Let's move now to our current financial outlook for 2016. Our strong outlook for the year is unchanged. In fact, we have greater confidence in achieving the upper end of our sales growth and earnings per share ranges. At the top line, we reaffirm our plan to grow sales 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% in constant currency, with higher pricing adding 1% to 2% of the increase. And with the addition of Gourmet Garden, we now expect acquisitions to add 2% to 3%. We expect this latest acquisition and our year-to-date performance to place us at the higher end of our 4% to 6% constant-currency sales growth range.
We continue to expect a 9% to 11% constant-currency increase in adjusted operating income from $614 million of adjusted operating income in 2015. Currency is expected to lower this range by 3 percentage points. We plan to drive our growth with higher sales and our stepped-up cost savings target of $100 million to $110 million. With this fuel for growth, we expect to increase brand marketing approximately $20 million, consistent with our initial plans.
Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share remains $3.68 to $3.75. Excluding the estimated 3 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 9% to 11% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. With our year-to-date results and outlook for the second half, we have more confidence in achieving the higher end of this range.
Regarding last week's referendum outcome on Brexit, the immediate impact to our business will be currency rates. Early this week, we reevaluated our guidance and determined that a 3% impact from currency is our best estimate at this point in time. Any longer-term impact on our business will depend in part on the outcome of tariff, trade and regulatory negotiations. As a point of reference, our sales in the U.K. were 8% of total company sales in fiscal year 2015.
As a final remark on our outlook, we are on track for another year of strong cash flow for fiscal year 2016, with higher adjusted net income and actions underway to improve our working capital.
That completes my remarks. So let's turn now to your questions."

First of all, I'll just start by saying we're very pleased with the results in our U.S. consumer business. We're quite pleased with the shipments. We're even more pleased with the continued improvement in the offtake information and this continued sequential improvement in our performance versus the category. I know that there's been a lot of questions, both from you and from others who are listening on the call, about exactly when our share will turn positive, and we keep saying that we're going to get there, and I believe that this is evidence that that's true. As we noted on the call, our sales increase for the U.S. consumer business includes more than just the McCormick brand. In our business, we also have economy brands and private label. And the growth of economy brands and private label were both lower than our sales of -- growth in our sales of branded products. And so that is a contributing factor to the difference versus -- in our shipments versus the offtake data for our brand. That's a mix shift that has also helped lift our profit margin, obviously. The second thing is that we're going through some major transitions on a couple of our product lines within herbs and spices. And in some cases, we have limited shipments to keep from having inventory of old packaging on the shelf as we go through that transition. That particularly affected the transition of our gourmet business to organic. The timing of Memorial Day also may have pushed some of our barbecue and grilling product sales into Q3. Memorial Day is a week later on the calendar. It's on the 30th this year. It's almost on the last possible day that it could be. And so we believe that, that probably influenced the start of grilling. We know that's the case with a couple of particular customers, but it wasn't a surprise to us. We knew what the calendar looked like and so that was already reflected in our thinking about both Q2 and about Q3. And then finally, in Canada, the Americas number that we reported, and just for U.S., and it includes Canada and a small Latin American operation. In Canada, we took a lot of pricing in this time period due to the, in part, to recover the transaction costs of currency. And this has had an impact on the volume growth in that market. Gordon, Mike, do you want to comment on this any further?"

Just wondering if that's something you have on the radar screen and whether you'd consider that. And then, as a follow-up question, coming back to the U.S. consumer business, it seems as though the regular spices and herbs are doing very, very well, very aligned with cooking from scratch, definitely on a roll. It seems as though the seasoning mixes, the recipe mixes, are a bit slower. Do you have a view as to why that might be? You made a loss of the GMO-free status of a lot of the regular herbs last quarter. Are people worried about some of the additives in those recipe mixes? And is that something you can address?"

I'll be -- I'm glad to give an update on that and probably we should have built that into our prepared remarks. First of all, on the conversion to -- or of our gourmet to organic, that is continuing on pace. We set a goal of having 80% organic by the end of the year. We still expect to achieve that. I will say that the conversion of organic has been more challenging for us than perhaps we anticipated. The supply chain and the kind of quality controls that we insist on in terms of product supply has been harder for us to develop. It's just a less mature supply chain out there. And we've gotten such a lift from the conversion to organic that the volume has been higher than we initially anticipated, which has slowed the transition just because there's just that much more pressure on an immature supply chain. For the non-GMO conversion, that really was more about us calling out what we already do. And so that one has gone quite a pace and actually I would characterize that one as running ahead of -- a little bit ahead of pace -- little bit ahead of the pace that we had anticipated. We're not really looking at either one of these as opportunities to take more pricing. Both of these moves were done to give greater transparency to the consumer, to continue to differentiate McCormick versus competition, to frankly take credit for all that we do in terms of quality and purity of product, much in line with the communication we're giving to consumers in our purity advertising campaign. We also did this in part to take away some of the reason for being for other competitive brands. And some of the smaller brands in the store have gotten in because they've made claims like this and we wanted to take away the reason for being for those smaller brands as well as we thought to rebuild our share position. Gordon and Mike, do you want to comment on this any?"

And it's funny, it seems like food companies of all shapes and sizes are working harder to get -- they're actually having success, they're telling the truth about that, doing a great job getting new customers. It's just they have a hard time generating repeat among old customers, at least versus where we were 5 years ago. It seems like your business, at least in North America, may be a little bit different and able to hang on to loyal customers maybe a little bit better and maybe explain some of the better results.

And so we're -- I'm not sure that we're seeing the same kind of erosion of loyalty that perhaps some of the other food companies might be talking about. I think also our brands and our product are -- really our category is in line with the way consumers want to eat today. And as consumers cook at home more and are more ambitious about the things that they cook, our brand is a big beneficiary of that. I think that we have a bit of a natural tailwind from 2 sources. One is the new dietary guidelines news that came out this year that has really encouraged consumers to make greater use of herbs and spices. It's a positive for our category, but as the leader in the category, we're a big beneficiary of that. And then, the second thing is that we actually do better with millennials than we do with boomers. And so as millennials come to be a bigger part of the shopper universe, that is actually a natural tailwind for us, which is different than some of our food company peers."

This has been an ongoing program that we've been talking about on calls and in conferences for the last 2 years really as we've evolved our analytic capabilities and understanding of price elasticity and have worked with retailers on modeling the category in a way that really optimizes the profitability of the category for them. And as it generally works out, what optimizes the category for the retailer tends to be good news for the McCormick brand as well. So we've been adding tools that allow us to give greater and greater precision and give fact and database guidance to retailers on pricing decisions for the category as a whole and assortment decisions for the category as a whole. Those recommendations include, in many cases, lowering the price points on McCormick brand products. Sometimes it includes our recommendations about changes in the price points for their private label, for economy brands and for other brands in the category where they may have some irrational pricing that's happening in the store or where they may have pricing that they don't even know about because there may be a rack of spices in another department of the store that the spice category buyer doesn't even have visibility to and category profitability is leaking out through that backdoor. So we've made those kind of recommendations. And those retailers who have accepted those recommendations have tended to outperform the category, and we've outperformed -- and we've definitely gained share in the cases where those retailers have taken our recommendations. I think in our remarks, though, we may have -- I don't know if we included it in our remarks, but with retailers who have taken our recommendations, I think, in the first quarter, we reported that we've gained about 60 basis points of share. We can now track that to 120 basis points of share gain in those retailers who have accepted our recommendations, and that set is becoming a bigger and bigger set of retailers. One of the ways that bleeds through in the syndicated data is that our unit share growth has been stronger than the category where our dollar share growth is tracking slightly behind the category. That's really reflecting that shifting in the retail price points."

McCormick's third quarter results continued the strong performance we delivered on the first half of 2016 with adjusted earnings per share of $1.03. In constant currency, we grew sales 6% with increases in both segments in each of our 3 regions and grew adjusted operating income 15%. These results demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy designed to drive both top line sales and significant productivity improvements. This balanced approach is being managed by McCormick leaders and employees around the world, and I thank them for their effort and engagement. 
For the year-to-date financial results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter, we're well positioned to deliver record results in 2016. Taking a look at the third quarter, we were pleased with the performance of both our consumer and industrial segments. On a constant currency basis, we grew consumer segment sales 7% and increased adjusted operating income 12%. As those who follow McCormick know, we're driving sales with increases in our base business, new products and acquisitions. All 3 of these drivers contributed to consumer segment sales increase this quarter. 
Our base business growth was particularly strong in the Americas region and led by sales of core McCormick and Lawry's brands spices and seasonings. Also, our sales of recipe mixes, including wet recipe mixes have picked up in the U.S. and we gained category share this quarter. 
China was another major driver of the consumer segment sales increase this quarter with double-digit growth in constant currency and category share gains for both herbs and spices and recipe mixes. 
As for innovation, we shared with you at our June earnings call that agree great lineup products we are launching in the second half of our fiscal year. These include the rollout of Herb Grinders in additional markets, organic recipe mixes and Kitchen Basics bone broth in the U.S., which is a simple way to add flavor and 10 grams of protein per serving. 
Internationally, among the new products we're introducing we're introducing, our new World Cuisine [ph] recipe mixes across Europe and innovative dessert items in France and Australia. 
On the acquisition front, we had an incremental benefit this quarter from both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. While it is less than 6 months since we acquired Gourmet Garden, I'm pleased to report that we're already gaining new distribution for these products in the U.S. and our first retail placement in Canada. 
While constant currency sales rose 7% for the consumer segment, the increase was even higher for adjusted operating income at 12% in constant currency. Led by our comprehensive of continuous improvement program, CCI, we're making great progress in lowering costs throughout our business and improving margins for both our consumer and industrial segments. We are well on our way toward reaching our goal of $100 million to $110 million cost reductions for 2016. We also had more positive mix this period. This included sales in North America with the strength of our branded business outpacing our sales of economy products and in the Asia/Pacific region where we benefited from our year-ago actions to improve our product mix and margins. 
Turning to our industrial segment on Slide 6, we grew sales 4% and increased adjusted operating income 23% in constant currency. We had solid sales results in each of our 3 regions and Mike will go through some of those specific drivers. 
Our growth strategy to excel in customer intimacy and consumer insights is really paying off for the industrial segment. This is evident in our third quarter growth and share gains of our branded food service sales in the U.S. and other markets and we are meeting consumer demand for organic flavors, non-GMO product and a whole range of on-trend flavors. In this regard, the addition of Brand Aromatics in 2015 has been a real success, expanding our capabilities and leading to new business. Increasingly, our industrial customers are also seeking innovative solutions for healthier food, including snacking, which is also driving higher sales. 
The third quarter profit growth for our industrial segment was particularly high this quarter with adjusted operating income of 23% in constant currency and we increased adjusted operating income margin more than 100 basis points. CCI was a significant driver of this increase and business mix was also a key contributor. 
Our customers are seeking unique flavors that tend to be more complex, value added and higher-margin. We're unlocking some new opportunities, most recently with flavors for savory side dishes and dessert baking mixes with our FlavorCell technology, encapsulated flavors that offer protection and controlled release in a wide variety of processing environments. 
These segment results with the excellent growth in adjusted operating income helped us achieve adjusted earnings per share of $1.03, an $0.18 increase from $0.85 in the third quarter of 2015. The higher operating income added $0.11 of the increase and the other main factor were the lower tax rate, as Mike will describe more fully. 
With one quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we've increased our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79 from our previous guidance at the upper end of $3.68 to $3.75. This new range is based on our strong third quarter results, partially offset by several headwinds for earnings per share as we move into the fourth quarter. 
The first headwind is a greater impact from unfavorable currency particularly for our joint venture in Mexico. Second, a reduction in our initial 2016 plants for share repurchases due to acquisition activities throughout the year for both completed and uncompleted deal. As many of you know, it's our practice to curtail share repurchases in conjunction with acquisition activity to achieve our target debt leverage. And third, the rising costs for certain raw materials, particularly vanilla and garlic. When we provide the material cost inflation outlook for 2017 in our January earnings call, it like likely to be above 2016's low single-digit rate. As we've done in the past, we expect to manage this increase through pricing actions and cost savings. While we've already begun to take pricing actions, we anticipate some near-term slowdown in our rate of margin improvement. Part of his remarks, Mike will be providing more comments on our outlook. 
Next, let's take a closer look at our growth in our U.S. consumer business beginning on Slide 8. As I indicated, our third quarter sales growth for McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings in the U.S. was particularly strong. Leading this increase were McCormick spices and herbs. Our conversion to non-GMO labeling has gone extremely well and we activated marketing for new Herb Grinders. We, at McCormick, are proud to share that our Herb Grinders are recently awarded innovation of the year by GMA, the Grocery Manufacturers Association. 
We're continuing to increase our digital marketing to drive sales. Our plans are to take digital marketing to nearly 2/3 of our total U.S. advertising this year, up from 46% in 2015. 
Traffic to our McCormick.com site is up 15% versus last year as millennials and others generation seek recipes, how-to videos and other content. Just lastly, we learned that L2 Research ranked our McCormick brand of the U.S. #5 out of 126 food brands in its annual Digital IQ ranking. For a third year in a row, we've achieved the #5 spot, which places at L2's ""Genius Level"". The L2 ranking is based on the following criteria: Brand site effectiveness and e-tailer investments, digital marketing, social media based on reach, search and engagement; and mobile, encompassing experience, search, advertising and apps. 
In 2016, we're getting more value out of each marketing dollar. In the U.S. we're on track to reduce our nonworking media by 20% in 2016 versus 2015 and increase our market working media by 12%. Across all markets, we're shifting our marketing towards more high ROI digital marketing. As a result of these actions and including the currency impact, we've lowered our planned increase in brand marketing for 2016 from an increase of $20 million to an increase of $15 million. This is a 6% increase from a brand marketing spend in 2015, and well ahead of our projected 3% year-on-year sales increase on a reported basis.
Also behind the strong sales performance this quarter was our great grilling season. We grew Grill Mates sales 6% with incremental support and the introduction of new single-use marinates, an innovation of that is exceeding our expectations at market. 
Sales of our Lawry's brand seasoned salt and other products were up with some strong brand marketing activity. And as worked through resets of our gourmet line through new organic versions, rose at double-digit rates.
For those of you know who watch the retail consumption data, our reported sales growth might seem at odds with the latest data, which has shown a sequential increase in category share decline for McCormick versus the last quarter. A large part of the share decline of this quarter related to the significant retail shelf disruption from the conversion of our gourmet product line. We remarked on this as part of our outlook at our June earnings call. As the old gourmet products rotate off the shelf and are replaced by new organic varieties, there've been a number of out-of-stock situations and shelf label changes. As customers work to replenish their selves, our shipments of gourmet items were strong toward the end of the third quarter and we expect this to bleed [ph] through stronger in retail consumption data for the fourth quarter.
For those customers who have completed the resets to organic gourmet, we're seeing significant sales lift and we expect most of our customers to have these conversions complete before the holiday period begins later this fall. In addition, with this move to organic, we've been able to increase our distribution of gourmet items with 4 of our top 10 retailers.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we're excited about this year's holiday period in the U.S. We are reminding consumers to flavor these important meals with the pure flavors of the holiday. During high consumption periods, we're driving brand loyalty through television, digital and in-store communications and featuring some of our latest core product innovation such as roasted ground cinnamon and ginger bread spice. 
As part of our fourth quarter communication plan, we're reactivating our highly successful purity campaign. This campaign has been particularly effective with millennial consumers. We measured a 2 percentage point increase millennial household penetration for McCormick spices and seasonings when we introduced our Purity message. In addition, the Purity TV and digital messaging lifted millennials purchase intent for McCormick brand by 15 percentage points. This is driving a strong retail sales response with a 9% increase in our spices and seasonings during a 7-week on-air period. 
Across all of our markets, and both of our segments, our leaders and employees throughout McCormick are driving toward a solid finish and great fiscal year results. McCormick is uniquely positioned as a global leader in flavor, a category that is on-trend with today's consumer and healthy eating. We're driving strong momentum with our strategies to grow sales, balanced with our CCI program and other efforts to build fuel for growth and higher margins. 
I'd like to thank you for your attention and it's not my pleasure to turn over to Mike. Mike?"

As Lawrence indicated, our third quarter results continued the strong performance we achieved in the first half. I'll provide some added perspective on the financial results and then discuss the details of our latest 2016 financial outlook. 
On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing, taken in response to higher material costs, each contributed to the increase as seen on Slide 12. Both our consumer and industrial segments delivered solid top line growth, with increases in each of our 3 regions. 
On Slide 13, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 8% in constant currency with 3 percentage points of the increase from acquisitions, both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was in the U.S. and led by McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings, veterans brand items and Kitchen Basics products. 
These sales increases were offset in part by a slight decline in our sales of private label and economy brands. 
EMEA consumer segment sales rose 1% in constant currency. We've continued to drive sales growth in Poland and Russia that includes the benefit of new distribution. And we delivered another strong sales quarter, along with category share gains in France with new products and brand marketing. These gains were offset in part by weakness in the U.K. where a number of food companies have been challenged by a difficult retail environment. 
We grew consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region 11% in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 7 percentage points of this growth. In China, we returned to a strong sales increase this quarter, following some moderation in the second quarter that related to a successful SAP implementation in our Wuhan facility. Third quarter sales in China were mainly driven by promotional activity and pricing. Year-to-date, our consumer sales in China are up 9% on constant currency basis. 
A decline in India lowered our third quarter sales in this region by 6 percentage points due to a decision a year ago to discontinue certain low-margin products. 
For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 11% to $127 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 12% from a year-ago period. The impact of sales growth and the cost-savings more than offset higher material costs and our investments in growth, including higher brand marketing. 
Turning to our industrial segment in Slide 17, we had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 4% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven by sales of branded food service products in the U.S. where we've gained share with a leading customer. Also, in the U.S., we've been winning business with several new restaurant customers, although demand from some of the quick service restaurants remains weak. And in Latin America, we're growing sales of snack seasonings and other products supplied from our operation in Mexico. 
In Canada, we took pricing to pass-through higher material costs that include the impact of currency but this was offset by weaker volume for industrial products in that market. 
We grew industrial sales in EMEA 5% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2015. We had solid sales growth of branded food service products and customized flavored solutions. 
Industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region were up 3% in constant currency. We had strong growth from our operations in Australia and Southeast Asia, driven in part by new product wins and promotional activity by our quick service restaurant customers. 
In China, as we indicated last quarter, a large customer is diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 14% at $45 million. In constant currency, the growth was 23%, driven by higher sales, our cost savings and more favorable business mix, offset in part by higher material cost and increases in brand marketing.
For those of you to follow as closely know that the industrial segment tends to have some quarter-to-quarter profit volatility, largely due to customer ability, including new product launches, limited-time offers and other promotions. Following an exceptionally strong third quarter, we are projecting adjusted operating income growth for this segment to slow in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, we expect both an increase in adjusted operating income and improve margins versus 2015. 
Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges rose 12% in the third quarter from a year-ago period. And excluding the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 15%. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 11%. 
We increased gross profit margin 180 basis points year-on-year to 41.6% in the third quarter. This improvement was a result of cost savings from our CCI and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset higher costs. Given the rise in certain materials as Lawrence described, we still expect to increase gross margin in the fourth quarter but the increase is likely to be below 100 basis points. 
Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2015, mainly due to the increase in brand marketing. 
The tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 22.3%, below both the prior year rate and our previous guidance for the second half, mainly due to discrete tax items. At this time, we expected tax rate of 28% to 29% in the fourth quarter and a fiscal year 2016 tax rate to 25% to 26%.
The income from unconsolidated operations was down this quarter by $2 million. As a reminder, income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter 2015 had a $2 million favorable impact from special charges due to the minority interest in our payment joint venture in India. Currency also had an unfavorable impact on year-ago comparison. However, we had good underlying performance. Our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, has grown year-to-date sales at a high single-digit rate in local currency. We anticipated greater impact from unfavorable currency and have increased our expected decline in income from unconsolidated operations to about 15% from approximately 10%. 
At the bottom line, third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $1.03. This was an $0.18 increase from a year-ago period as a result of higher adjusted operating income, a favorable tax rate and lower shares outstanding. As a reminder, this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income. 
On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, cash flow from operations was $322 million, up slightly from the year-ago period. The impact of higher net income was offset in part by pension contribution, timing of tax payments and an increase in trade receivables this period. For the third quarter, our cash and conversion cycle was down from the year-ago period and we are putting programs in place, such as extended payment terms with our suppliers to achieve further reductions. 
We still expect capital expenditures of $150 million to $160 million. Much of this is in support of our growth with major construction in both Shanghai and Dubai. In August, we approved future capital investments in Southeast Asia to support our growth with the new manufacturing facility in Thailand and a new and advanced technical innovation center in Singapore. 
We're also returning a portion of cash to our shareholders and through the 3 quarters, used $343 million for dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the third quarter, $391 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Note that we now expect to reduce shares outstanding by 1% from fiscal year 2015. This is below our initial projection of 2% and is due to the curtailment of our repurchases related to acquisition activity in 2016. 
In summary, 2016 is expected to be another year of strong cash flow, providing the funds for continued investment and acquisitions and other growth strategies. Our debt leverage is low, and we are well positioned to finance these investment. 
Let's move now to our financial guidance. We continue to expect strong growth for fiscal year 2016 and have updated several projections based on our third quarter results and latest outlook for the fourth quarter. At the top line, we expect to grow sales approximately 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% in constant currency. This is at the upper end of our previous range and implies a fourth quarter increase of approximately 6% on a constant currency basis. We expect to grow adjusted operating income approximately 7% from $614 million in 2015. In constant currency, our estimated rate of growth is 10%, which is at the midpoint of the previous range. 
Our guidance for cost savings remains $100 million to $110 million, and our current estimate for increased brand marketing is around $15 million, reflecting the spending efficiencies that Lawrence noted. As also discussed, we're increasing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS with the upper end of $3.68 to $3.75. This increase reflects the favorable third quarter results, partially offset by the effective currency on our income from unconsolidated operations, a lower reduction in shares outstanding and the rise of vanilla and garlic. Excluding the estimated 4 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 12% to 13% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. 
Based on this fiscal year 2016 range, we're projecting adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of $1.24 to $1.28. This is an increase of 5% to 8% from adjusted EPS of $1.18 in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
To summarize, our projected fiscal year 2016 constant currency growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are at or above our long-term objectives for the business. We look forward to reporting our final results to you in January.

We've had to deal with a long and sustained increase in the cost of one of our iconic raw materials, in particular, that being pepper. We did this year experienced low single-digit inflation so I wouldn't say that there was deflation in our cost. CCI doesn't just go to the cost of the raw material inputs but looks at every line of the P&L. A portion of that CCI was in our fixed cost structure and SG&A and so on. We do see a higher rate of inflation for next year, but we're really not ready to give guidance on 2017 just yet. We are seeing cost increases that are quite well publicized in a couple of key raw materials, vanilla and garlic. But we also anticipate that we are going to be able to take pricing actions that will  -- are between pricing actions and CCI we'll be able to mitigate those costs.

A big part of that JV income is from a joint venture in Mexico. We've seen a substantial softening in the peso, they're having great result. The translations of those great results by back into U.S. dollars is less than we had anticipated when we had our second -- when we had our last call.

We've been approached by customers of competitors who are experiencing defaults and are having difficulty getting vanilla at any price. The raw material and the shortage of that raw material is going to dictate the higher price across the whole market and we're confident that we won't be moving along. The other thing, too, is this category management tools we've invested in over to cut years, shown we took the pricing action earlier in the U.S., our volume rate of share gain and volume that was positive, so we grew volume while taking a price increase.

And then in Q3, there's some disruption of the shelf and really just a refilling of the shelves. And so, no, I don't expect the slowdown. Actually, we're encouraged by the strength of our holiday program in the U.S. business as we look to into the holiday season. We're actually pretty optimistic that we're going to have both strong shipments and strong consumption. We're back on air with the purity campaign, we've got a tremendous lift from that campaign when we ran that earlier this year. So our holiday advertising will include Purity. When we ran that purity campaign, we not only got an immediate lift from it but also increased our penetration with minimally also, which builds the franchise for the long term.

And that all -- that's [indiscernible] into the company, so some of this -- what happened then is old [indiscernible] for me. But subsequently, there was quite a big market decline and many of those sources dried up due to market pricing. We are, ourselves, working actively to develop the growth of vanilla in a number of regions of the world and including a pilot operation that we have to grow our own. But those are efforts that will take a little bit of time to bring on stream. And right now, 85% of the world's vanilla comes from medical NASCAR and that's where they shortages. A lot of the changes, not so much around supply, but around demand consumers want to move to a more natural flavors, there's a shift in market demand away from artificial vanilla and Ventolin [ph] to being able to label the product straight up vanilla or vanilla beans. So we do have an effort underway to develop those alternate sources. Again, I'll just emphasize that we believe that nobody has an advantage to position right now in the market versus us.

McCormick's third quarter results continued the strong performance we delivered on the first half of 2016 with adjusted earnings per share of $1.03. In constant currency, we grew sales 6% with increases in both segments in each of our 3 regions and grew adjusted operating income 15%. These results demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy designed to drive both top line sales and significant productivity improvements. This balanced approach is being managed by McCormick leaders and employees around the world, and I thank them for their effort and engagement. 
For the year-to-date financial results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter, we're well positioned to deliver record results in 2016. Taking a look at the third quarter, we were pleased with the performance of both our consumer and industrial segments. On a constant currency basis, we grew consumer segment sales 7% and increased adjusted operating income 12%. As those who follow McCormick know, we're driving sales with increases in our base business, new products and acquisitions. All 3 of these drivers contributed to consumer segment sales increase this quarter. 
Our base business growth was particularly strong in the Americas region and led by sales of core McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings. Also, our sales of recipe mixes, including wet recipe mixes, have picked up in the U.S., and we gained category share this quarter. 
China was another major driver of the consumer segment sales increase this quarter with double-digit growth in constant currency and category share gains for both herbs and spices and recipe mixes. 
As for innovation, we shared with you at our June earnings call the great lineup of new products we're launching in the second half of our fiscal year. These include the rollout of herb grinders in additional markets; organic recipe mixes; and Kitchen Basics Bone Broth in the U.S., which is a simple way to add flavor and 10 grams of protein per serving. Internationally, among the new products we're introducing are new world cuisine recipe mixes across Europe and innovative dessert items in France and Australia. 
On the acquisition front, we had an incremental benefit this quarter from both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. While it is less than 6 months since we acquired Gourmet Garden, I'm pleased to report that we're already gaining new distribution for these products in the U.S. and our first retail placement in Canada. 
While constant currency sales rose 7% for the consumer segment, the increase was even higher for adjusted operating income at 12% in constant currency. Led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement Program, CCI, we're making great progress in lowering costs throughout our business and improving margins for both our consumer and industrial segments. We are well on our way towards reaching our goal of $100 million to $110 million cost reductions for 2016. We also had more positive mix this period. This included sales in North America with the strength of our branded business outpacing our sales of economy products and in the Asia/Pacific region, where we benefited from our year-ago actions to improve our product mix and margins. 
Turning to our industrial segment on Slide 6. We grew sales 4% and increased adjusted operating income 23% in constant currency. We had solid sales results in each of our 3 regions, and Mike will go through some of the specific drivers. 
Our growth strategy to excel in customer intimacy and consumer insights is really paying off for the industrial segment. This is evident in our third quarter growth and share gains of our branded food service sales in the U.S. and other markets, and we're meeting consumer demand for organic flavors, non-GMO products and a whole range of on-trend flavors. In this regard, the addition of Brand Aromatics in 2015 has been a real success, expanding our capability and leading to new business. Increasingly, our industrial customers are also seeking innovative solutions for healthier food, including snacking, which is also driving higher sales. 
The third quarter profit growth for our industrial segment was particularly high this quarter with adjusted operating income of 23% in constant currency, and we increased adjusted operating income margin more than 100 basis points. CCI was a significant driver of this increase, and business mix was also a key contributor. 
Our customers are seeking unique flavors that tend to be more complex, value added and higher-margin. We're unlocking some new opportunities, most recently with flavors for savory side dishes and dessert baking mixes with our FlavorCell technology, encapsulated flavors that offer protection and controlled release in a wide variety of processing environments. 
These segment results, with the excellent growth in adjusted operating income, helped us achieve adjusted earnings per share of $1.03, an $0.18 increase from $0.85 in the third quarter of 2015. The higher operating income added $0.11 of the increase, and the other main factor was the lower tax rate, as Mike will describe more fully. 
With one quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we've increased our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79 from our previous guidance at the upper end of $3.68 to $3.75. This new range is based on our strong third quarter results, partially offset by several headwinds for earnings per share as we move into the fourth quarter. 
The first headwind is a greater impact from unfavorable currency, particularly for our joint venture in Mexico. Second, a reduction in our initial 2016 plans for share repurchases due to acquisition activity throughout the year for both completed and uncompleted deal. As many of you know, it's our practice to curtail share repurchases in conjunction with acquisition activity to achieve our target debt leverage. And third, the rising cost for certain raw materials, particularly vanilla and garlic. When we provide our material cost inflation outlook for 2017 in our January earnings call, it is likely to be above 2016's low single-digit rate. As we've done in the past, we expect to manage this increase through pricing actions and cost savings. While we've already begun to take pricing actions, we anticipate some near-term slowdown in our rate of margin improvement. Part of his remarks, Mike will be providing more comments on our outlook. 
Next, let's take a closer look at our growth in our U.S. consumer business, beginning on Slide 8. As I indicated, our third quarter sales growth for McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings in the U.S. was particularly strong. Leading this increase were core McCormick brand spices and herbs. Our conversion to non-GMO labeling has gone extremely well, and we activated marketing for new herb grinders. We, at McCormick, are proud to share that our herb grinders are recently awarded innovation of the year by GMA, the Grocery Manufacturers Association. We're continuing to increase our digital marketing to drive sales. Our plans are to take digital marketing to nearly 2/3 of our total U.S. advertising this year, up from 46% in 2015. 
Traffic to our mccormick.com site is up 15% versus last year as millennials and other generations seek recipes, how-to videos and other content. Just last week, we learned that L2 Research ranked our McCormick brand in the U.S. #5 out of 126 food brands in its annual Digital IQ ranking. For the third year in a row, we've achieved the #5 spot, which places us at L2's ""genius level."" The L2 ranking is based on the following criteria: brand site effectiveness and e-tailer investments; digital marketing, social media based on reach, search and engagement; and mobile, encompassing experience, search, advertising and apps. 
In 2016, we're getting more value out of each marketing dollar. In the U.S., we're on track to reduce our nonworking media by 20% in 2016 versus 2015 and increase our working media by 12%. Across all markets, we're shifting our marketing towards more high ROI digital marketing. 
As a result of these actions and including the currency impact, we've lowered our planned increase in brand marketing for 2016 from an increase of $20 million to an increase of $15 million. This is a 6% increase from our brand marketing spend in 2015 and well ahead of our projected 3% year-on-year sales increase on a reported basis.
Also behind the strong sales performance this quarter was our great grilling season. We grew Grill Mates sales 6% with incremental marking support and the introduction of new single-use marinades, an innovation that is exceeding our expectations at market. 
Sales of our Lawry's brand seasoned salt and other products were up with some strong brand marketing activity. And as we worked through resets of our gourmet line to the new organic versions, sales this period rose at a double-digit rate.
For those of you who watch the retail consumption data, our reported sales growth might seem at odds with the latest data, which has shown a sequential increase in category share decline for McCormick versus the last quarter. A large part of the share decline this quarter related to the significant retail shelf disruption from the conversion of our gourmet product line. We remarked on this as part of our outlook at our June earnings call. As the old gourmet products rotate off the shelf and are replaced by new organic varieties, there've been a number of out-of-stock situations and shelf label changes. As customers work to replenish their selves, our shipments of gourmet items were strong toward the end of the third quarter, and we expect this to read through in stronger retail consumption data for the fourth quarter. For those customers who have completed the resets to organic gourmet, we're seeing significant sales lift, and we expect most of our customers to have these conversions complete before the holiday period begins later this fall. In addition, with this move to organic, we've been able to increase our distribution of gourmet items with 4 of our top 10 retailers.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we're excited about this year's holiday period in the U.S. We're reminding consumers to flavor these important meals with the pure flavors of the holiday. During this high consumption period, we're driving brand loyalty through television, digital and in-store communications and featuring some of our latest core product innovation, such as roasted ground cinnamon and ginger bread spice. 
As part of our fourth quarter communication plan, we're reactivating our highly successful purity campaign. This campaign has been particularly effective with millennial consumers. We measured a 2 percentage point increase in millennial household penetration for McCormick spices and seasonings when we introduced our purity message. In addition, the purity TV and digital messaging lifted millennials' purchase intent for McCormick brand by 15 percentage points. This is driving a strong retail sales response with a 9% increase in our spices and seasonings during a 7-week on-air period. 
Across all of our markets and both of our segments, our leaders and employees throughout McCormick are driving toward a solid finish and great fiscal year results. McCormick is uniquely positioned as a global leader in flavor, a category that is on-trend with today's consumer and healthy eating. We're driving strong momentum with our strategies to grow sales, balanced with our CCI program and other efforts to build fuel for growth and higher margins. 
I'd like to thank you for your attention, and it's now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Mike?"

As Lawrence indicated, our third quarter results continued the strong performance we achieved in the first half. I'll provide some added perspective on the financial results and then discuss the details of our latest 2016 financial outlook. 
On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing, taken in response to higher material costs, each contributed to the increase, as seen on Slide 12. Both our consumer and industrial segments delivered solid top line growth, with increases in each of our 3 regions. 
On Slide 13, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 8% in constant currency, with 3 percentage points of the increase from acquisitions, both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was in the U.S. and led by McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings, Zatarain's brand items and Kitchen Basics products. 
These sales increases were offset in part by a slight decline in our sales of private label and economy brands. 
EMEA consumer segment sales rose 1% in constant currency. We've continued to drive sales growth in Poland and Russia that includes the benefit of new distribution. And we delivered another strong sales quarter, along with category share gains in France with new products and brand marketing. These gains were offset in part by weakness in the U.K., where a number of food companies have been challenged by a difficult retail environment. 
We grew consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region 11% in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 7 percentage points of this growth. In China, we returned to a strong sales increase this quarter following some moderation in the second quarter that related to a successful SAP implementation in our Wuhan facility. Third quarter sales in China were mainly driven by promotional activity and pricing. Year-to-date, our consumer sales in China are up 9% on a constant currency basis. A decline in India lowered our third quarter sales in this region by 6 percentage points due to a decision a year ago to discontinue certain low-margin products. 
For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 11% to $127 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 12% from the year-ago period. The impact of sales growth and the cost-savings more than offset higher material costs and our investments in growth, including higher brand marketing. 
Turning to our industrial segment in Slide 17. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 4% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven by sales of branded food service products in the U.S., where we've gained share with a leading customer. Also in the U.S., we've been winning business with several new restaurant customers, although demand from some of the quick service restaurants remains weak. And in Latin America, we're growing sales of snack seasonings and other products supplied from our operation in Mexico. 
In Canada, we took pricing to pass through higher material costs that include the impact of currency, but this was offset by weaker volume for industrial products in that market. 
We grew industrial sales in EMEA 5% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2015. We had solid sales growth of branded food service products and customized flavor solutions. 
Industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region were up 3% in constant currency. We had strong growth from our operations in Australia and Southeast Asia, driven in part by new product wins and promotional activity by our quick service restaurant customers. In China, as we indicated last quarter, a large customer is diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 14% at $45 million. In constant currency, the growth was 23%, driven by higher sales, our cost savings and more favorable business mix offset in part by higher material costs and increases in brand marketing.
Those of you who follow us closely know that the industrial segment tends to have some quarter-to-quarter profit volatility, largely due to customer activity, including new product launches, limited-time offers and other promotions. Following an exceptionally strong third quarter, we are projecting adjusted operating income growth for this segment to slow in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, we expect both an increase in adjusted operating income and improved margins versus 2015. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, with -- which excludes special charges, rose 12% in the third quarter from the year-ago period. And excluding the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 15%. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 11%. 
We increased gross profit margin 180 basis points year-on-year to 41.6% in the third quarter. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset higher costs. Given the rise in certain materials, as Lawrence described, we still expect to increase gross margin in the fourth quarter, but the increase is likely to be below 100 basis points. 
Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2015, mainly due to the increase in brand marketing. 
The tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 22.3%, below both the prior year rate and our previous guidance for the second half, mainly due to discrete tax items. At this time, we expect a tax rate of 28% to 29% in the fourth quarter and a fiscal year 2016 tax rate of 25% to 26%.
Income from unconsolidated operations was down this quarter by $2 million. As a reminder, income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter of 2015 had a $2 million favorable impact from special charges due to the minority interest in our Kohinoor joint venture in India. Currency also had an unfavorable impact on the year-ago comparison. However, we had good underlying performance. Our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, has grown year-to-date sales at a high single-digit rate in local currency. We anticipate a greater impact from unfavorable currency and have increased our expected decline in income from unconsolidated operations to about 15% from approximately 10%. 
At the bottom line, third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $1.03. This was an $0.18 increase from the year-ago period as a result of higher adjusted operating income, a favorable tax rate and lower shares outstanding. As a reminder, this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income. 
On Slide 26, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, cash flow from operations was $322 million, up slightly from the year-ago period. The impact of higher net income was offset in part by a pension contribution, timing of tax payments and an increase in trade receivables this period. For the third quarter, our cash and conversion cycle was down from the year-ago period, and we are putting programs in place such as extended payment terms with our suppliers to achieve further reductions. 
We still expect capital expenditures of $150 million to $160 million. Much of this is in support of our growth, with major construction in both Shanghai and Dubai. In August, we approved future capital investments in Southeast Asia to support our growth with a new manufacturing facility in Thailand and a new and advanced technical innovation center in Singapore. 
We're also returning a portion of cash to our shareholders and through the first 3 quarters, used $343 million for dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the third quarter, $391 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Note that we now expect to reduce shares outstanding by 1% from fiscal year 2015. This is below our initial projection of 2% and is due to the curtailment of our repurchases related to acquisition activity in 2016. 
In summary, 2016 is expected to be another year of strong cash flow, providing the funds for continued investment and acquisitions and other growth strategies. Our debt leverage is low, and we are well positioned to finance these investments. 
Let's move now to our financial guidance. We continue to expect strong growth for fiscal year 2016 and have updated several projections based on our third quarter results and latest outlook for the fourth quarter. At the top line, we expect to grow sales approximately 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% in constant currency. This is at the upper end of our previous range and implies a fourth quarter increase of approximately 6% on a constant currency basis. We expect to grow adjusted operating income approximately 7% from $614 million in 2015. In constant currency, our estimated rate of growth is 10%, which is at the midpoint of the previous range. 
Our guidance for cost savings remains, $100 million to $110 million, and our current estimate for increased brand marketing is around $15 million, reflecting the spending efficiencies that Lawrence noted. As also discussed, we're increasing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS was the upper end of $3.68 to $3.75. This increase reflects the favorable third quarter results, partially offset by the effective currency on our income from unconsolidated operations, a lower reduction in shares outstanding and the rise in vanilla and garlic. Excluding the estimated 4 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 12% to 13% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. 
Based on this fiscal year 2016 range, we're projecting adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of $1.24 to $1.28. This is an increase of 5% to 8% from adjusted EPS of $1.18 in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
To summarize, our projected fiscal year 2016 constant currency growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are at or above our long-term objectives for the business. We look forward to reporting our final results to you in January. 
That completes my remarks. I'm going to turn it back over to Lawrence."

We've had to deal with a long and sustained increase in the cost of one of our iconic raw materials, in particular, that being pepper. We did, this year, experienced low single-digit inflation, so I wouldn't say that there was deflation in our costs. CCI doesn't just go to the cost of the raw material inputs but it looks at every line of the P&L. So a portion of that CCI was in our fixed cost structure and SG&A and so on. We do see a higher rate of inflation for next year, but we're really not ready to give guidance on 2017 just yet. We are seeing cost increases that are quite well publicized in a couple of key raw materials, vanilla and garlic. But we also anticipate that we're going to be able to take pricing actions that will -- between pricing action and CCI, we'll be able to mitigate those costs. What we're really talking about in the fourth quarter is that some of the pricing actions that we took were against raw material cost increases that occurred in the market but where we may have had some strategic positions. And so as the cost of those materials as they flow through begin to catch up with the price increases, the margin improvement that we've been experiencing will begin to narrow.

We're pretty pleased with our progress overall and that the gourmet was the one thing. I should add that it really wasn't a surprise. When we had our call back in the -- last call back in June, we were in the middle of it. We knew what was happening, and we said on the call that this was going to happen. There'd be some disruption at the shelf. I'm pretty encouraged that we'll have the work -- I'm pretty optimistic that we'll have completely worked through it by the time the real holiday season starts. The shipments that we experienced on gourmet don't really line up with the consumption. They were very strong at the end of the quarter as our customers were restocking their shelves. So I'm pretty encouraged about that. But again, if I could just -- going back to your original question, the scanner data, it's really a story about gourmet."

I expect that we will grow into it. But this customer had a problem with a supplier that put them in a bad business position, and they've made a strategic decision that they're not going to be sole-sourced on anything. And in the products that we supply, we were very close to the exclusive supplier. So as they -- as that customer diversifies its supplier base, it does have an impact on us as well due to their strategy."

And that all -- that's right around the time I came to the company, so some of this -- what happened then is old lore for me. But subsequently, there was quite a big market decline, and many of those sources dried up due to market pricing. We are, ourselves, working actively to develop the growth of vanilla in a number of regions of the world, including a pilot operation that we have to grow our own. But those are efforts that will take a little bit of time to bring onstream. And right now, 85% of the world's vanilla comes from Madagascar, and that's where the shortage is. A lot of the changes, not so much around supply, but around demand, as consumers want to move to more natural flavors, there's a shift in market demand away from artificial vanilla and vanillin to being able to label the product straight up vanilla or vanilla beans. So there -- we do have an effort underway to develop those alternate sources. Again, I'll just emphasize that we believe that nobody has an advantaged position right now in the market versus us. And we know just from the customer inquiries that we're getting that, in fact, we probably have an advantaged position versus a number of our competitors."

McCormick's third quarter results continued the strong performance we delivered in the first half of 2016 with adjusted earnings per share of $1.03. In constant currency, we grew sales 6% with increases in both segments and each of our 3 regions, and grew adjusted operating income 15%. These results demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy designed to drive both top line sales and significant productivity improvements. This balanced approach is being managed by McCormick leaders and employees around the world, and I thank them for their effort and engagement. 
For the year-to-date financial results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter, we're well positioned to deliver record results in 2016. Taking a look at the third quarter, we were pleased with the performance of both our consumer and industrial segments. On a constant currency basis, we grew consumer segment sales 7% and increased adjusted operating income 12%. As those who follow McCormick know, we're driving sales with increases in our base business, new products and acquisitions. All 3 of these drivers contributed to consumer segment sales increase this quarter. 
Our base business growth was particularly strong in the Americas region and led by sales of core McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings. Also, our sales of recipe mixes, including wet recipe mixes, have picked up in the U.S., and we gained category share this quarter. 
China was another major driver of the consumer segment sales increase this quarter with double-digit growth in constant currency and category share gains for both herbs and spices and recipe mixes. 
As for innovation, we shared with you at our June earnings call the great lineup of new products we're launching in the second half of our fiscal year. These include the rollout of herb grinders in additional markets; organic recipe mixes; and Kitchen Basics Bone Broth in the U.S., which is a simple way to add flavor and 10 grams of protein per serving. Internationally, among the new products we're introducing are new world cuisine recipe mixes across Europe and innovative dessert items in France and Australia. 
On the acquisition front, we had an incremental benefit this quarter from both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. While it is less than 6 months since we acquired Gourmet Garden, I'm pleased to report that we're already gaining new distribution for these products in the U.S. and our first retail placement in Canada. 
While constant currency sales rose 7% for the consumer segment, the increase was even higher for adjusted operating income at 12% in constant currency. Led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement Program, CCI, we're making great progress in lowering costs throughout our business and improving margins for both our consumer and industrial segments. We are well on our way towards reaching our goal of $100 million to $110 million cost reductions for 2016. We also had more positive mix this period. This included sales in North America, with the strength of our branded business outpacing our sales of economy products; and in the Asia/Pacific region, where we benefited from our year-ago actions to improve our product mix and margins. 
Turning to our industrial segment on Slide 6. We grew sales 4% and increased adjusted operating income 23% in constant currency. We had solid sales results in each of our 3 regions, and Mike will go through some of the specific drivers. 
Our growth strategy to excel in customer intimacy and consumer insights is really paying off for the industrial segment. This is evident in our third quarter growth and share gains of our branded food service sales in the U.S. and other markets, and we're meeting growing consumer demand for organic flavors, non-GMO products and a whole range of on-trend flavors. In this regard, the addition of Brand Aromatics in 2015 has been a real success, expanding our capability and leading to new business. Increasingly, our industrial customers are also seeking innovative solutions for healthier food, including snacking, which is also driving higher sales. 
The third quarter profit growth for our industrial segment was particularly high this quarter with adjusted operating income up 23% in constant currency, and we increased adjusted operating income margin more than 100 basis points. CCI was a significant driver of this increase, and business mix was also a key contributor. 
Our customers are seeking unique flavors that tend to be more complex, value added and higher-margin. We're unlocking some new opportunities, most recently with flavors for savory side dishes and dessert baking mixes with our FlavorCell technology, encapsulated flavors that offer protection and controlled release in a wide variety of processing environments. 
These segment results, with the excellent growth in adjusted operating income, helped us achieve adjusted earnings per share of $1.03, an $0.18 increase from $0.85 in the third quarter of 2015. The higher operating income added $0.11 of the increase, and the other main factor was the lower tax rate, as Mike will describe more fully. 
With one quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we've increased our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79 from our previous guidance at the upper end of $3.68 to $3.75. This new range is based on our strong third quarter results, partially offset by several headwinds for earnings per share as we move into the fourth quarter. 
The first headwind is a greater impact from unfavorable currency, particularly for our joint venture in Mexico. Second, a reduction in our initial 2016 plans for share repurchases due to acquisition activity throughout the year for both completed and uncompleted deals. As many of you know, it's our practice to curtail share repurchases in conjunction with acquisition activity to achieve our target debt leverage. And third, the rising cost for certain raw materials, particularly vanilla and garlic. When we provide our material cost inflation outlook for 2017 in our January earnings call, it is likely to be above 2016's low single-digit rate. As we've done in the past, we expect to manage this increase through pricing actions and cost savings. While we've already begun to take pricing actions, we anticipate some near-term slowdown in our rate of margin improvement. As part of his remarks, Mike will be providing more comments on our outlook. 
Next, let's take a closer look at our growth in our U.S. consumer business, beginning on Slide 8. As I indicated, our third quarter sales growth for McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings in the U.S. was particularly strong. Leading this increase were core McCormick brand spices and herbs. Our conversion to non-GMO labeling has gone extremely well, and we activated marketing for new herb grinders. We, at McCormick, are proud to share that our herb grinders were recently awarded innovation of the year by GMA, the Grocery Manufacturers Association. We're continuing to increase our digital marketing to drive sales. Our plans are to take digital marketing to nearly 2/3 of our total U.S. advertising this year, up from 46% in 2015. 
Traffic to our mccormick.com site is up 15% versus last year as millennials and other generations seek recipes, how-to videos and other content. Just last week, we learned that L2 Research ranked our McCormick brand in the U.S. #5 out of 126 food brands in its annual Digital IQ ranking. For the third year in a row, we've achieved the #5 spot, which places us at L2's ""genius level."" The L2 ranking is based on the following criteria: brand site effectiveness and e-tailer investments; digital marketing; social media based on reach, search and engagement; and mobile, encompassing experience, search, advertising and apps. 
In 2016, we're getting more value out of each marketing dollar. In the U.S., we're on track to reduce our nonworking media by 20% in 2016 versus 2015 and increase our working media by 12%. Across all markets, we're shifting our marketing towards more high ROI digital marketing. 
As a result of these actions and including the currency impact, we've lowered our planned increase in brand marketing for 2016 from an increase of $20 million to an increase of $15 million. This is a 6% increase from our brand marketing spend in 2015 and well ahead of our projected 3% year-on-year sales increase on a reported basis.
Also behind the strong sales performance this quarter was our great grilling season. We grew Grill Mates sales 6% with incremental marking support and the introduction of new single-use marinades, an innovation that is exceeding our expectations at market. 
Sales of our Lawry's brand seasoned salt and other products were up with some strong brand marketing activity. And as we worked through resets of our gourmet line to the new organic versions, sales this period rose at a double-digit rate.
For those of you who watch the retail consumption data, our reported sales growth might seem at odds with the latest data, which has shown a sequential increase in category share decline for McCormick versus the last quarter. A large part of the share decline this quarter related to the significant retail shelf disruption from the conversion of our gourmet product line. We remarked on this as part of our outlook at our June earnings call. As the old gourmet products rotate off the shelf and are replaced by new organic varieties, there've been a number of out-of-stock situations and shelf label changes. As customers work to replenish their shelves, our shipments of gourmet items were strong toward the end of the third quarter, and we expect this to read through in stronger retail consumption data for the fourth quarter. For those customers who have completed the resets to organic gourmet, we're seeing significant sales lift, and we expect most of our customers to have these conversions complete before the holiday period begins later this fall. In addition, with this move to organic, we've been able to increase our distribution of gourmet items with 4 of our top 10 retailers.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we're excited about this year's holiday period in the U.S. We're reminding consumers to flavor these important meals with the pure flavors of the holiday. During this high consumption period, we're driving brand loyalty through television, digital and in-store communications and featuring some of our latest core product innovations, such as roasted ground cinnamon and gingerbread spice. 
As part of our fourth quarter communication plan, we're reactivating our highly successful purity campaign. This campaign has been particularly effective with millennial consumers. We measured a 2 percentage point increase in millennial household penetration for McCormick spices and seasonings when we introduced our purity message. In addition, the purity TV and digital messaging lifted millennials' purchase intent for McCormick brand by 15 percentage points. This is driving a strong retail sales response with a 9% increase in our spices and seasonings during a 7-week on-air period. 
Across all of our markets and both of our segments, our leaders and employees throughout McCormick are driving toward a solid finish and great fiscal year results. McCormick is uniquely positioned as a global leader in flavor, a category that is on-trend with today's consumer and healthy eating. We're driving strong momentum with our strategies to grow sales, balanced with our CCI program and other efforts to build fuel for growth and higher margins. 
I'd like to thank you for your attention, and it's now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Mike?"

As Lawrence indicated, our third quarter results continued the strong performance we achieved in the first half. I'll provide some added perspective on the financial results and then discuss the details of our latest 2016 financial outlook. 
On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing, taken in response to higher material costs, each contributed to the increase, as seen on Slide 12. Both our consumer and industrial segments delivered solid top line growth, with increases in each of our 3 regions. 
On Slide 13, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 8% in constant currency, with 3 percentage points of the increase from acquisitions, both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was in the U.S. and led by McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings, Zatarain's brand items and Kitchen Basics products. 
These sales increases were offset in part by a slight decline in our sales of private label and economy brands. 
EMEA consumer segment sales rose 1% in constant currency. We've continued to drive sales growth in Poland and Russia that includes the benefit of new distribution. And we delivered another strong sales quarter, along with category share gains in France with new products and brand marketing. These gains were offset in part by weakness in the U.K., where a number of food companies have been challenged by a difficult retail environment. 
We grew consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region 11% in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 7 percentage points of this growth. In China, we returned to a strong sales increase this quarter following some moderation in the second quarter that related to a successful SAP implementation in our Wuhan facility. Third quarter sales in China were mainly driven by promotional activity and pricing. Year-to-date, our consumer sales in China are up 9% on a constant currency basis. A decline in India lowered our third quarter sales in this region by 6 percentage points due to a decision a year ago to discontinue certain low-margin products. 
For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 11% to $127 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 12% from the year-ago period. The impact of sales growth and the cost-savings more than offset higher material costs and our investments in growth, including higher brand marketing. 
Turning to our industrial segment and Slide 17. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 4% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven by sales of branded food service products in the U.S., where we've gained share with a leading customer. Also in the U.S., we've been winning business with several new restaurant customers, although demand from some of the quick service restaurants remains weak. And in Latin America, we're growing sales of snack seasonings and other products supplied from our operation in Mexico. 
In Canada, we took pricing to pass through higher material costs that include the impact of currency, but this was offset by weaker volume for industrial products in that market. 
We grew industrial sales in EMEA 5% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2015. We had solid sales growth of branded food service products and customized flavor solutions. 
Industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region were up 3% in constant currency. We had strong growth from our operations in Australia and Southeast Asia, driven in part by new product wins and promotional activity by our quick service restaurant customers. In China, as we indicated last quarter, a large customer is diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 14% at $45 million. In constant currency, the growth was 23%, driven by higher sales, our cost savings and more favorable business mix, offset in part by higher material costs and increases in brand marketing.
Those of you who follow us closely know that the industrial segment tends to have some quarter-to-quarter profit volatility, largely due to customer activity, including new product launches, limited-time offers and other promotions. Following an exceptionally strong third quarter, we are projecting adjusted operating income growth for this segment to slow in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, we expect both an increase in adjusted operating income and improved margins versus 2015. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, with -- which excludes special charges, rose 12% in the third quarter from the year-ago period. And excluding the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 15%. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 11%. 
We increased gross profit margin 180 basis points year-on-year to 41.6% in the third quarter. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset higher costs. Given the rise in certain materials, as Lawrence described, we still expect to increase gross margin in the fourth quarter, but the increase is likely to be below 100 basis points. 
Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2015, mainly due to the increase in brand marketing. 
The tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 22.3%, below both the prior year rate and our previous guidance for the second half, mainly due to discrete tax items. At this time, we expect a tax rate of 28% to 29% in the fourth quarter and a fiscal year 2016 tax rate of 25% to 26%.
Income from unconsolidated operations was down this quarter by $2 million. As a reminder, income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter of 2015 had a $2 million favorable impact from special charges due to the minority interest in our Kohinoor joint venture in India. Currency also had an unfavorable impact on the year-ago comparison. However, we had good underlying performance. Our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, has grown year-to-date sales at a high single-digit rate in local currency. We anticipate a greater impact from unfavorable currency and have increased our expected decline in income from unconsolidated operations to about 15% from approximately 10%. 
At the bottom line, third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $1.03. This was an $0.18 increase from the year-ago period as a result of higher adjusted operating income, a favorable tax rate and lower shares outstanding. As a reminder, this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income. 
On Slide 26, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, cash flow from operations was $322 million, up slightly from the year-ago period. The impact of higher net income was offset in part by a pension contribution, timing of tax payments and an increase in trade receivables this period. For the third quarter, our cash conversion cycle was down from the year-ago period, and we are putting programs in place such as extended payment terms with our suppliers to achieve further reductions. 
We still expect capital expenditures of $150 million to $160 million. Much of this is in support of our growth, with major construction in both Shanghai and Dubai. In August, we approved future capital investments in Southeast Asia to support our growth with a new manufacturing facility in Thailand and a new and advanced technical innovation center in Singapore. 
We're also returning a portion of cash to our shareholders and through the first 3 quarters, used $343 million for dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the third quarter, $391 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Note that we now expect to reduce shares outstanding by 1% from fiscal year 2015. This is below our initial projection of 2% and is due to the curtailment of our repurchases related to acquisition activity in 2016. 
In summary, 2016 is expected to be another year of strong cash flow, providing the funds for continued investment and acquisitions and other growth strategies. Our debt leverage is low, and we are well positioned to finance these investments. 
Let's move now to our financial guidance. We continue to expect strong growth for fiscal year 2016 and have updated several projections based on our third quarter results and latest outlook for the fourth quarter. At the top line, we expect to grow sales approximately 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% in constant currency. This is at the upper end of our previous range and implies a fourth quarter increase of approximately 6% on a constant currency basis. We expect to grow adjusted operating income approximately 7% from $614 million in 2015. In constant currency, our estimated rate of growth is 10%, which is at the midpoint of the previous range. 
Our guidance for cost savings remains $100 million to $110 million, and our current estimate for increased brand marketing is around $15 million, reflecting the spending efficiencies that Lawrence noted. As also discussed, we're increasing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS was the upper end of $3.68 to $3.75. This increase reflects the favorable third quarter results, partially offset by the effect of currency on our income from unconsolidated operations, a lower reduction in shares outstanding and the rise in vanilla and garlic. Excluding the estimated 4 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 12% to 13% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. 
Based on this fiscal year 2016 range, we're projecting adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of $1.24 to $1.28. This is an increase of 5% to 8% from adjusted EPS of $1.18 in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
To summarize, our projected fiscal year 2016 constant currency growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are at or above our long-term objectives for the business. We look forward to reporting our final results to you in January. 
That completes my remarks. I'm going to turn it back over to Lawrence."

I'm not so sure that I can speak to a change in the trend for the whole center of the store.

But it sounds like in your script, you're telling us that going forward, it's not going to be as good.

We've had to deal with a long and sustained increase in the cost of one of our iconic raw materials, in particular, that being pepper. We did, this year, experience low single-digit inflation, so I wouldn't say that there was deflation in our costs. CCI doesn't just go to the cost of the raw material inputs but looks at every line of the P&L. So a portion of that CCI was in our fixed cost structure and SG&A and so on. We do see a higher rate of inflation for next year, but we're really not ready to give guidance on 2017 just yet. We are seeing cost increases that are quite well publicized in a couple of key raw materials, vanilla and garlic. But we also anticipate that we're going to be able to take pricing actions that will -- between pricing action and CCI, we'll be able to mitigate those costs. What we're really talking about in the fourth quarter is that some of the pricing actions that we took were against raw material cost increases that occurred in the market but where we may have had some strategic positions. And so as the cost of those materials, as they flow through, begin to catch up with the price increases, the margin improvement that we've been experiencing will begin to narrow.

The larger-impact items is that we are expecting more FX impact, particularly on our -- on our JV income. That's below the operating profit line. It's comes through on the unconsolidated line. A big part of that JV income is from a joint venture in Mexico. We've seen a substantial softening in the peso. And just so -- while they're having great results, the translation of those great results back into U.S. dollars is less than we had anticipated when we had our second quarter -- when we had our last call. The other major factor is just the lower rate of share repurchase. As you know, we curtail our share repurchases when we have an acquisition. Between the, actually, completed acquisition activity and for activity around deals that we did not complete, there was a curtailment of share repurchase, and we end up -- it looks like our share repurchases are going to be closer to 1% than 2%.

And that all -- that's right around the time I came to the company, so some of this -- what happened then is old lore for me. But subsequently, there was quite a big market decline, and many of those sources dried up due to market pricing. We are, ourselves, working actively to develop the growth of vanilla in a number of regions of the world, including a pilot operation that we have to grow our own. But those are efforts that will take a little bit of time to bring onstream. And right now, 85% of the world's vanilla comes from Madagascar, and that's where the shortage is. A lot of the changes, not so much around supply, but around demand, as consumers want to move to more natural flavors, there's a shift in market demand away from artificial vanilla and vanillin to being able to label the product straight up vanilla or vanilla beans. So there -- we do have an effort underway to develop those alternate sources. Again, I'll just emphasize that we believe that nobody has an advantaged position right now in the market versus us.

McCormick's third quarter results continued the strong performance we delivered in the first half of 2016 with adjusted earnings per share of $1.03. In constant currency, we grew sales 6% with increases in both segments and each of our 3 regions, and grew adjusted operating income 15%. These results demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy designed to drive both top line sales and significant productivity improvements. This balanced approach is being managed by McCormick leaders and employees around the world, and I thank them for their effort and engagement. 
For the year-to-date financial results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter, we're well positioned to deliver record results in 2016. Taking a look at the third quarter, we were pleased with the performance of both our consumer and industrial segments. On a constant currency basis, we grew consumer segment sales 7% and increased adjusted operating income 12%. As those who follow McCormick know, we're driving sales with increases in our base business, new products and acquisitions. All 3 of these drivers contributed to consumer segment sales increase this quarter. 
Our base business growth was particularly strong in the Americas region and led by sales of core McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings. Also, our sales of recipe mixes, including wet recipe mixes, have picked up in the U.S., and we gained category share this quarter. 
China was another major driver of the consumer segment sales increase this quarter with double-digit growth in constant currency and category share gains for both herbs and spices and recipe mixes. 
As for innovation, we shared with you at our June earnings call the great lineup of new products we're launching in the second half of our fiscal year. These include the rollout of herb grinders in additional markets; organic recipe mixes; and Kitchen Basics Bone Broth in the U.S., which is a simple way to add flavor and 10 grams of protein per serving. Internationally, among the new products we're introducing are new world cuisine recipe mixes across Europe and innovative dessert items in France and Australia. 
On the acquisition front, we had an incremental benefit this quarter from both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. While it is less than 6 months since we acquired Gourmet Garden, I'm pleased to report that we're already gaining new distribution for these products in the U.S. and our first retail placement in Canada. 
While constant currency sales rose 7% for the consumer segment, the increase was even higher for adjusted operating income at 12% in constant currency. Led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement Program, CCI, we're making great progress in lowering costs throughout our business and improving margins for both our consumer and industrial segments. We are well on our way towards reaching our goal of $100 million to $110 million cost reductions for 2016. We also had more positive mix this period. This included sales in North America, with the strength of our branded business outpacing our sales of economy products; and in the Asia/Pacific region, where we benefited from our year-ago actions to improve our product mix and margins. 
Turning to our industrial segment on Slide 6. We grew sales 4% and increased adjusted operating income 23% in constant currency. We had solid sales results in each of our 3 regions, and Mike will go through some of the specific drivers. 
Our growth strategy to excel in customer intimacy and consumer insights is really paying off for the industrial segment. This is evident in our third quarter growth and share gains of our branded food service sales in the U.S. and other markets, and we're meeting growing consumer demand for organic flavors, non-GMO products and a whole range of on-trend flavors. In this regard, the addition of Brand Aromatics in 2015 has been a real success, expanding our capability and leading to new business. Increasingly, our industrial customers are also seeking innovative solutions for healthier food, including snacking, which is also driving higher sales. 
The third quarter profit growth for our industrial segment was particularly high this quarter with adjusted operating income up 23% in constant currency, and we increased adjusted operating income margin more than 100 basis points. CCI was a significant driver of this increase, and business mix was also a key contributor. 
Our customers are seeking unique flavors that tend to be more complex, value added and higher-margin. We're unlocking some new opportunities, most recently with flavors for savory side dishes and dessert baking mixes with our FlavorCell technology, encapsulated flavors that offer protection and controlled release in a wide variety of processing environments. 
These segment results, with the excellent growth in adjusted operating income, helped us achieve adjusted earnings per share of $1.03, an $0.18 increase from $0.85 in the third quarter of 2015. The higher operating income added $0.11 of the increase, and the other main factor was the lower tax rate, as Mike will describe more fully. 
With one quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we've increased our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79 from our previous guidance at the upper end of $3.68 to $3.75. This new range is based on our strong third quarter results, partially offset by several headwinds for earnings per share as we move into the fourth quarter. 
The first headwind is a greater impact from unfavorable currency, particularly for our joint venture in Mexico. Second, a reduction in our initial 2016 plans for share repurchases due to acquisition activity throughout the year for both completed and uncompleted deals. As many of you know, it's our practice to curtail share repurchases in conjunction with acquisition activity to achieve our target debt leverage. And third, the rising cost for certain raw materials, particularly vanilla and garlic. When we provide our material cost inflation outlook for 2017 in our January earnings call, it is likely to be above 2016's low single-digit rate. As we've done in the past, we expect to manage this increase through pricing actions and cost savings. While we've already begun to take pricing actions, we anticipate some near-term slowdown in our rate of margin improvement. As part of his remarks, Mike will be providing more comments on our outlook. 
Next, let's take a closer look at our growth in our U.S. consumer business, beginning on Slide 8. As I indicated, our third quarter sales growth for McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings in the U.S. was particularly strong. Leading this increase were core McCormick brand spices and herbs. Our conversion to non-GMO labeling has gone extremely well, and we activated marketing for new herb grinders. We, at McCormick, are proud to share that our herb grinders were recently awarded innovation of the year by GMA, the Grocery Manufacturers Association. We're continuing to increase our digital marketing to drive sales. Our plans are to take digital marketing to nearly 2/3 of our total U.S. advertising this year, up from 46% in 2015. 
Traffic to our mccormick.com site is up 15% versus last year as millennials and other generations seek recipes, how-to videos and other content. Just last week, we learned that L2 Research ranked our McCormick brand in the U.S. #5 out of 126 food brands in its annual Digital IQ ranking. For the third year in a row, we've achieved the #5 spot, which places us at L2's ""genius level."" The L2 ranking is based on the following criteria: brand site effectiveness and e-tailer investments; digital marketing; social media based on reach, search and engagement; and mobile, encompassing experience, search, advertising and apps. 
In 2016, we're getting more value out of each marketing dollar. In the U.S., we're on track to reduce our nonworking media by 20% in 2016 versus 2015 and increase our working media by 12%. Across all markets, we're shifting our marketing towards more high ROI digital marketing. 
As a result of these actions and including the currency impact, we've lowered our planned increase in brand marketing for 2016 from an increase of $20 million to an increase of $15 million. This is a 6% increase from our brand marketing spend in 2015 and well ahead of our projected 3% year-on-year sales increase on a reported basis.
Also behind the strong sales performance this quarter was our great grilling season. We grew Grill Mates sales 6% with incremental marking support and the introduction of new single-use marinades, an innovation that is exceeding our expectations at market. 
Sales of our Lawry's brand seasoned salt and other products were up with some strong brand marketing activity. And as we worked through resets of our gourmet line to the new organic versions, sales this period rose at a double-digit rate.
For those of you who watch the retail consumption data, our reported sales growth might seem at odds with the latest data, which has shown a sequential increase in category share decline for McCormick versus the last quarter. A large part of the share decline this quarter related to the significant retail shelf disruption from the conversion of our gourmet product line. We remarked on this as part of our outlook at our June earnings call. As the old gourmet products rotate off the shelf and are replaced by new organic varieties, there've been a number of out-of-stock situations and shelf label changes. As customers work to replenish their shelves, our shipments of gourmet items were strong toward the end of the third quarter, and we expect this to read through in stronger retail consumption data for the fourth quarter. For those customers who have completed the resets to organic gourmet, we're seeing significant sales lift, and we expect most of our customers to have these conversions complete before the holiday period begins later this fall. In addition, with this move to organic, we've been able to increase our distribution of gourmet items with 4 of our top 10 retailers.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we're excited about this year's holiday period in the U.S. We're reminding consumers to flavor these important meals with the pure flavors of the holiday. During this high consumption period, we're driving brand loyalty through television, digital and in-store communications and featuring some of our latest core product innovations, such as roasted ground cinnamon and gingerbread spice. 
As part of our fourth quarter communication plan, we're reactivating our highly successful purity campaign. This campaign has been particularly effective with millennial consumers. We measured a 2 percentage point increase in millennial household penetration for McCormick spices and seasonings when we introduced our purity message. In addition, the purity TV and digital messaging lifted millennials' purchase intent for McCormick brand by 15 percentage points. This is driving a strong retail sales response with a 9% increase in our spices and seasonings during a 7-week on-air period. 
Across all of our markets and both of our segments, our leaders and employees throughout McCormick are driving toward a solid finish and great fiscal year results. McCormick is uniquely positioned as a global leader in flavor, a category that is on-trend with today's consumer and healthy eating. We're driving strong momentum with our strategies to grow sales, balanced with our CCI program and other efforts to build fuel for growth and higher margins. 
I'd like to thank you for your attention, and it's now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Mike?"

As Lawrence indicated, our third quarter results continued the strong performance we achieved in the first half. I'll provide some added perspective on the financial results and then discuss the details of our latest 2016 financial outlook. 
On a constant currency basis, we grew sales 6%. Acquisitions, higher volume and product mix and pricing, taken in response to higher material costs, each contributed to the increase, as seen on Slide 12. Both our consumer and industrial segments delivered solid top line growth, with increases in each of our 3 regions. 
On Slide 13, consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 8% in constant currency, with 3 percentage points of the increase from acquisitions, both Stubb's and Gourmet Garden. The balance of sales growth this period was in the U.S. and led by McCormick and Lawry's brand spices and seasonings, Zatarain's brand items and Kitchen Basics products. 
These sales increases were offset in part by a slight decline in our sales of private label and economy brands. 
EMEA consumer segment sales rose 1% in constant currency. We've continued to drive sales growth in Poland and Russia that includes the benefit of new distribution. And we delivered another strong sales quarter, along with category share gains in France with new products and brand marketing. These gains were offset in part by weakness in the U.K., where a number of food companies have been challenged by a difficult retail environment. 
We grew consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region 11% in constant currency. Sales from Gourmet Garden added 7 percentage points of this growth. In China, we returned to a strong sales increase this quarter following some moderation in the second quarter that related to a successful SAP implementation in our Wuhan facility. Third quarter sales in China were mainly driven by promotional activity and pricing. Year-to-date, our consumer sales in China are up 9% on a constant currency basis. A decline in India lowered our third quarter sales in this region by 6 percentage points due to a decision a year ago to discontinue certain low-margin products. 
For the consumer segment in total, we grew adjusted operating income 11% to $127 million. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 12% from the year-ago period. The impact of sales growth and the cost-savings more than offset higher material costs and our investments in growth, including higher brand marketing. 
Turning to our industrial segment and Slide 17. We had excellent results this quarter in both sales and profit. We grew industrial sales in the Americas 4% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven by sales of branded food service products in the U.S., where we've gained share with a leading customer. Also in the U.S., we've been winning business with several new restaurant customers, although demand from some of the quick service restaurants remains weak. And in Latin America, we're growing sales of snack seasonings and other products supplied from our operation in Mexico. 
In Canada, we took pricing to pass through higher material costs that include the impact of currency, but this was offset by weaker volume for industrial products in that market. 
We grew industrial sales in EMEA 5% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2015. We had solid sales growth of branded food service products and customized flavor solutions. 
Industrial segment sales in the Asia/Pacific region were up 3% in constant currency. We had strong growth from our operations in Australia and Southeast Asia, driven in part by new product wins and promotional activity by our quick service restaurant customers. In China, as we indicated last quarter, a large customer is diversifying their supply chain by adding a second supplier for some core items that McCormick supplies. 
Adjusted operating income for the industrial segment ended the quarter up 14% at $45 million. In constant currency, the growth was 23%, driven by higher sales, our cost savings and more favorable business mix, offset in part by higher material costs and increases in brand marketing.
Those of you who follow us closely know that the industrial segment tends to have some quarter-to-quarter profit volatility, largely due to customer activity, including new product launches, limited-time offers and other promotions. Following an exceptionally strong third quarter, we are projecting adjusted operating income growth for this segment to slow in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, we expect both an increase in adjusted operating income and improved margins versus 2015. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, with -- which excludes special charges, rose 12% in the third quarter from the year-ago period. And excluding the impact of unfavorable currency, we grew adjusted operating income by 15%. Year-to-date, the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency is 11%. 
We increased gross profit margin 180 basis points year-on-year to 41.6% in the third quarter. This improvement was the result of cost savings from our CCI and streamlining actions, favorable mix and pricing actions taken to offset higher costs. Given the rise in certain materials, as Lawrence described, we still expect to increase gross margin in the fourth quarter, but the increase is likely to be below 100 basis points. 
Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was up year-on-year by 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2015, mainly due to the increase in brand marketing. 
The tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 22.3%, below both the prior year rate and our previous guidance for the second half, mainly due to discrete tax items. At this time, we expect a tax rate of 28% to 29% in the fourth quarter and a fiscal year 2016 tax rate of 25% to 26%.
Income from unconsolidated operations was down this quarter by $2 million. As a reminder, income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter of 2015 had a $2 million favorable impact from special charges due to the minority interest in our Kohinoor joint venture in India. Currency also had an unfavorable impact on the year-ago comparison. However, we had good underlying performance. Our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, has grown year-to-date sales at a high single-digit rate in local currency. We anticipate a greater impact from unfavorable currency and have increased our expected decline in income from unconsolidated operations to about 15% from approximately 10%. 
At the bottom line, third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share was $1.03. This was an $0.18 increase from the year-ago period as a result of higher adjusted operating income, a favorable tax rate and lower shares outstanding. As a reminder, this year-to-year comparison includes the unfavorable impact from currency on both consolidated and unconsolidated income. 
On Slide 26, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, cash flow from operations was $322 million, up slightly from the year-ago period. The impact of higher net income was offset in part by a pension contribution, timing of tax payments and an increase in trade receivables this period. For the third quarter, our cash conversion cycle was down from the year-ago period, and we are putting programs in place such as extended payment terms with our suppliers to achieve further reductions. 
We still expect capital expenditures of $150 million to $160 million. Much of this is in support of our growth, with major construction in both Shanghai and Dubai. In August, we approved future capital investments in Southeast Asia to support our growth with a new manufacturing facility in Thailand and a new and advanced technical innovation center in Singapore. 
We're also returning a portion of cash to our shareholders and through the first 3 quarters, used $343 million for dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the third quarter, $391 million remained on the current $600 million share repurchase authorization. Note that we now expect to reduce shares outstanding by 1% from fiscal year 2015. This is below our initial projection of 2% and is due to the curtailment of our repurchases related to acquisition activity in 2016. 
In summary, 2016 is expected to be another year of strong cash flow, providing the funds for continued investment and acquisitions and other growth strategies. Our debt leverage is low, and we are well positioned to finance these investments. 
Let's move now to our financial guidance. We continue to expect strong growth for fiscal year 2016 and have updated several projections based on our third quarter results and latest outlook for the fourth quarter. At the top line, we expect to grow sales approximately 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% in constant currency. This is at the upper end of our previous range and implies a fourth quarter increase of approximately 6% on a constant currency basis. We expect to grow adjusted operating income approximately 7% from $614 million in 2015. In constant currency, our estimated rate of growth is 10%, which is at the midpoint of the previous range. 
Our guidance for cost savings remains $100 million to $110 million, and our current estimate for increased brand marketing is around $15 million, reflecting the spending efficiencies that Lawrence noted. As also discussed, we're increasing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $3.75 to $3.79. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS was the upper end of $3.68 to $3.75. This increase reflects the favorable third quarter results, partially offset by the effect of currency on our income from unconsolidated operations, a lower reduction in shares outstanding and the rise in vanilla and garlic. Excluding the estimated 4 percentage point impact of unfavorable currency rates, this range is an increase of 12% to 13% from adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 in 2015. 
Based on this fiscal year 2016 range, we're projecting adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of $1.24 to $1.28. This is an increase of 5% to 8% from adjusted EPS of $1.18 in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
To summarize, our projected fiscal year 2016 constant currency growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are at or above our long-term objectives for the business. We look forward to reporting our final results to you in January. 
That completes my remarks. I'm going to turn it back over to Lawrence."

We've had to deal with a long and sustained increase in the cost of one of our iconic raw materials, in particular, that being pepper. We did, this year, experience low single-digit inflation, so I wouldn't say that there was deflation in our costs. CCI doesn't just go to the cost of the raw material inputs but looks at every line of the P&L. So a portion of that CCI was in our fixed cost structure and SG&A and so on. We do see a higher rate of inflation for next year, but we're really not ready to give guidance on 2017 just yet. We are seeing cost increases that are quite well publicized in a couple of key raw materials, vanilla and garlic. But we also anticipate that we're going to be able to take pricing actions that will -- between pricing action and CCI, we'll be able to mitigate those costs. What we're really talking about in the fourth quarter is that some of the pricing actions that we took were against raw material cost increases that occurred in the market but where we may have had some strategic positions. And so as the cost of those materials, as they flow through, begin to catch up with the price increases, the margin improvement that we've been experiencing will begin to narrow.

The larger-impact items is that we are expecting more FX impact, particularly on our -- on our JV income. That's below the operating profit line. It's comes through on the unconsolidated line. A big part of that JV income is from a joint venture in Mexico. We've seen a substantial softening in the peso. And just so -- while they're having great results, the translation of those great results back into U.S. dollars is less than we had anticipated when we had our second quarter -- when we had our last call.

I also got to say that we are a bit conservative when we look at guidance as we get to the fourth quarter because it's our largest quarter. October and November are our highest shipping months. One big order from one customer or one odd shipping day in the last week of the year can swing the number a bit.

But those are efforts that will take a little bit of time to bring onstream. And right now, 85% of the world's vanilla comes from Madagascar, and that's where the shortage is. A lot of the changes, not so much around supply, but around demand, as consumers want to move to more natural flavors, there's a shift in market demand away from artificial vanilla and vanillin to being able to label the product straight up vanilla or vanilla beans. So there -- we do have an effort underway to develop those alternate sources. Again, I'll just emphasize that we believe that nobody has an advantaged position right now in the market versus us.
