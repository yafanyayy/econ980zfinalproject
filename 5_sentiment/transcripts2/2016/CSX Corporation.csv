Yesterday, CSX reported fourth quarter net earnings of $466 million or $0.48 per share, down 2% from the same period in 2014. Revenue declined 13% in the quarter as strong pricing was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery, a 6% volume decline and the continued transition in the company's business mix. Expenses also decreased 13% primarily the result of lower fuel prices, lower volume-related costs and efficiency gains. As a result, operating income decreased 12% to $791 million while the operating ratio improved 20 basis points to 71.6%. In addition, CSX remains an industry leader in safety, and service measures continued to progress well as we enter 2016. In fact, Chicago operations have now been fluid for nearly 12 straight months.
Now turning to the next slide. I'll discuss full year performance. Over the past 5 years, CSX has transformed this business to continue delivering solid results despite the global energy transition. As you can see on the left side of the chart, during that period, CSX coal revenue alone declined from $3.7 billion to $2.3 billion, a cumulative reduction of $1.4 billion. CSX has overcome that loss by significantly diversifying its market mix, improving service and investing in long-term growth opportunities. As a result, in 2015, coal represented only 19% of CSX's revenue, down for more than 30% in 2011.
During that same period, shareholder returns, including dividends and repurchases, have continued to reward the owners of our company, reflecting the steady growth in earnings per share, which reached $2 in 2015. Our 2015 performance was achieved despite the challenges in the energy market, low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar that impacted many of our markets. Revenue of $11.8 billion reflected growth in intermodal, automotive and minerals that partially offset the continued declines in coal. Improving service, aligning resources and cost against the lower demand environment and driving efficiency gains of more than $180 million helped generate operating income of nearly $3.6 billion and our first sub 70 full year operating ratio at 69.7%. Those results reflect the employees' relentless focus on safety and delivering services supports strong pricing and ever increasing operational efficiency as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices. We will continue to leverage our core strategy, superior network reach and diverse market mix to create long-term value for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the quarterly results and future outlook in more detail. Frank?"

As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 13% or $411 million versus the prior year. This was driven mainly by a $198 million decline in fuel surcharge recoveries and about $175 million from the impact of lower volume. At the same time, core pricing gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix. Volume decreased 6% from last year with coal driving the majority of the decline. Low natural gas prices, coupled with the impact of significant flooding in South Carolina, impacted domestic coal volumes while low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar challenged export coal in many of our merchandise markets. We continue to see strong core pricing, which, for the fourth quarter, was up 4.1% overall and 4.5% excluding coal.
On the revenue, increased $19 million from last year, driven primarily by unfavorable adjustments to revenue reserves in the prior year period. Expenses decreased 13% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $117 million in lower fuel prices, $107 million in lower volume-related costs and $59 million in efficiency gains. In order to further drive efficiency, we closed 2 facilities in our coal network and completed a new union labor agreement in the fourth quarter. As a result of these actions, we incurred a $48 million or $0.03 EPS impact in the quarter. These short-term restructuring costs will drive future benefits as we gain greater workforce flexibility and continue to adjust the lower demand in our coal markets. Operating income was $791 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% versus the prior year. 
Looking below the line. Interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates. As we highlighted on our last earnings call, a property sale closed in the fourth quarter for a gain of $80 million or a $0.05 benefit to earnings per share. This gain is associated with a nonoperating property that was booked below the line in other income. And finally, income taxes were $275 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $466 million, down 5% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 2% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect volumes to decline in the first quarter. We expect the challenging freight environment to continue as headwinds associated with coal, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow consistent with light vehicle production and especially in comparison to a year ago when the auto network experienced weather and service-related congestion. Minerals will benefit from continued highway and nonresidential construction activity and new business. Intermodal is neutral as continued secular domestic growth and our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversion are essentially offset by customer losses in international. Agricultural products is unfavorable due to low corn prices coupled with weakness in export grain and import sourcing in ethanol, driven by a strong U.S. dollar.
While core chemicals is expected to again be flat, the overall chemicals market is expected to be down as energy markets continue to reset to an environment marked by low crude oil prices and challenging spreads. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices and an inventory overhang due to mild weather. For 2016, we expect domestic coal volume to be around 19 million tons per quarter. Export coal will continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. Our full year outlook for export coal volume is around 20 million tons with some downside sensitivity. Metals is unfavorable as the strong U.S. dollar and high levels of imports continue to negatively impact steel production levels. Overall, despite a slow growing economy, the freight environment continues to have pronounced challenges with low commodity prices, low natural gas and a strong U.S. dollar. 
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses. Overall, we expect first quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment as well as continued productivity and volume-related cost savings. 
Looking at labor and fringe, we expect the first quarter average headcount to be down approximately 2% on a sequential basis, driven primarily by the structural changes in our coal network that we announced in the fourth quarter. This reflects about a 10% reduction from the prior year. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million per quarter throughout 2016 in line with the levels seen here in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by efficiency gains and volume-related savings in line with the trends we have seen in the second half of 2015. In addition, the first quarter reflects a shift in our northern Ohio coal operations. Here, we took action early in the fourth quarter to consolidate freight from the facility in [indiscernible] to see [indiscernible] Toledo which further streamlines our coal operations. 
Fuel expense in the first quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon reflecting the current pricing environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the first quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rates in the first quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year with higher freight car rates to offset by improved car cycle times.
Now let me talk about our capital investment plan for this year. In 2016, CSX's total capital investment will decline over $100 million from the 2015 level to $2.4 billion, which includes $300 million for PTC. Similar to 2015, we expect 2016 core capital investment to be higher than our long-term guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue due to our locomotive purchase commitment. This investment in new locomotives expands our ability to run longer trains and we will continue storing older locomotives to maximize the efficiency of the fleet. 
Moving to our capital allocation for 2016, you can see that over half the investment will be used to maintain infrastructure to help ensure a safe and fluid network. The majority of our 2016 equipment investment is focused on upgrading our locomotive fleet, which had delivery of 200 new locomotives in 2015 and expect to receive another 100 new locomotives in 2016, which will complete our existing locomotive purchase commitment. In addition, we will continue to focus on strategic investments that support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives. Here, we are prioritizing these investments in our intermodal business, infrastructure projects that support network fluidity and technology initiatives to enable productivity. 
Finally, looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we had invested $1.5 billion through the end of 2015, and we plan to invest an additional $300 million in 2016. CSX is committed to meeting the new legislative time line for PTC. As we look at the path to achieving this goal, and with PTC now extending over a longer period of time, we now believe the total cost of PTC implementation will be about $2.2 billion.
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall, CSX delivered solid financial performance in 2015 despite significant market challenges. Full year EPS increased 4% from the prior year, while our operating ratio improved 180 basis points to 69.7%. Revenue in 2015 was lower than we initially expected with volume declining 2% for the full year, but our continued focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. Looking ahead, we expect the coal headwinds to continue in 2016. As I mentioned earlier, domestic coal volume in 2016 is expected to be around 19 million tons per quarter. Our full year export coal volume is expected to be around 20 million tons, again with some downside to the export estimate. In addition for, the full year, we will be operating in a more challenging freight environment that we saw in 2015. Natural gas and broad commodity prices are expected to remain at low levels and the strength in the U.S. dollar is expected to persist during the year.
Furthermore, in 2015, we'll be cycling a couple of large items that benefited our 2015 results. Namely, we received about $100 million in liquidated damages and $180 million property gain in 2015, which are not expected to recur in 2016. As a result, we currently believe that 2016 earnings per share will be down from last year. 
Looking at our expectations of for 2016, we will continue to rightsize resources with lower demand and put some structural cost opportunities across our network. In addition, we expect to deliver productivity savings of around $200 million in 2016, which builds on $184 million of productivity that we achieved in 2015. Overall, we remain intensely focused this year on delivering a service product that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations, achieving strong pricing to support reinvestment in the business and driving efficiencies across our entire cost structure. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

CSX has continued to deliver solid results for its shareholders despite the transformational decline in the energy environment and the challenging market conditions. The efforts of our dedicated employees, combined with the diversified business mix and the premier network and [indiscernible], have helped us overcome the significant losses in coal. As Frank mentioned, 2016 will be a more challenging year. Volume in the first quarter and for the full year will decline as growth in some markets continues to be offset by the significant impact of continued coal declines, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar. 
We are taking necessary actions to manage our business in that environment including banking structural and networkwide changes to match resources and cost of business demand, driving further efficiency gains and remaining focused on strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service. In response to the further challenges expected in 2016, we've also decreased the capital budget by more than $100 million. We expect to invest $2.4 billion this year as we remain competitive to preserving safety, service and efficiency for customers and communities alike while positioning CSX for the future. 
As we look to the future, this company will continue to transition its business toward long-term profitable growth opportunities into the merchandise and intermodal markets. In that regard, we remain focused on achieving a mid-60s operating ratio longer term as we execute our core strategy of meeting or exceeding customer needs to support strong pricing for the value of our rail service and continuously improving operational efficiency. With those efforts, we are confident that CSX will continue to be a preferred service provider for customers who face a growing population, a more integrated global economy and the need for more reliable, more sustainable supply chains. 
Now we will be glad to take your questions."

And as a result of that, we felt this isn't a time we went back and revisit what we could do to optimize our bottom line, and this is one market where we actually don't have fuel surcharge in.

And so we're essentially saying we will continue that run rate and we expect some destocking to occur over the year but how much really will dependent on the weather since we now are dispatch [indiscernible]. We're essentially [indiscernible]. So we're very much weather-dependent. If you have favorable weather conditions from a [indiscernible] perspective or utility perspective, then you can see a significant destocking. If you have continued this sort of weather pattern we saw in the fourth quarter, where heating degree days were actually off by about 25% to 30% off normal, then that will be much more challenging. But hopefully, we'll -- we won't see that and we will see some destocking occur within the guidance that we provided."

In terms of the Q1 EPS, obviously, based on the cycling of the $100 million in liquidated damages in a different demand environment of the first quarter of '15 versus the first quarter of '16 especially in coal, that's going to impact us and then the demand environment that we talked about. But again, you're going to have to look at the improved service and the rightsizing and the efficiencies and the pricing performance and that will ultimately help us give some guidance in terms of how far quarter 1 of '16 will be down versus reported '15."

So to the extent those are obviously in the coal fields, that is an impact to productivity in 2016 around both facilities, reduction in facilities and headcount reduction. So that's basically the way I see 2016 looking with productivity. As far as continued rationalization, in the coalfields, as I said, we're going to look at that, not just in the coalfields but broadly, whether it's facility related and or line segment. The line segment take a little bit longer to work through. They involve customers, they involve other constituencies. So as we make those determinations and make those decisions, we'll be very public with that information. But that's more longer term."

I wanted to zero in on the change in coal guidance for next year. If I look at kind of what's changed, I think you were talking around kind of a 21 million ton domestic run rate going down to 19 million, so that's about an 8 million ton change. But it really looks like almost half of that drop was on the coking coal and domestic met site. So 2 questions. Number one, when I look at domestic, how much of that change is your view on utility versus your view on kind of other domestic coal? And when I look at the exports, you did about 31 million this year. The guidance is for 20 million. Can I look at end markets and can we think about it that way in terms of where has the incremental demand ebbed for your export coal geographically?"

If you go back to the third quarter guidance that we did at the call, we essentially said 21 million tons per quarter of domestic, which was 15 of domestic -- of utility and 6 of steel industrial. And what we said then about our export was about 6 million tons a quarter for 24 in total. So we're essentially seeing the deterioration in all of those 2 markets by about 1 million tons a quarter and it's really a reflection of the fact that natural gas prices and the very mild fourth quarter on the utility side has been within our expectations. On the steel and industrial side is the reflection of the fact that when we look at the steel industry right now, you're having a utilization of about 60% versus 75% a year ago and we saw it deteriorate throughout the fourth quarter. And the export market is also just a reflection of the fact that underlying commodity indexes are telling us that the market has gotten softer and as global oversupply continues. So in terms of where the export market is going, we did about 60-40 split-year between meth and thermal. We're probably a little bit higher next year would be my guess at this point in terms probably 1/3, 2/3, 2/3 in favor of meth. And traditionally, over half of our business goes to Europe, but I would say that split that probably going to continue terms of end market as well. And so I think it's just proportional between the markets, and I think you're going to see relatively proportional cut in terms of the end markets as well."

Yesterday, CSX reported fourth quarter net earnings of $466 million or $0.48 per share, down 2% from the same period in 2014. Revenue declined 13% in the quarter. A strong pricing was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery, a 6% volume decline and the continued transition in the company's business mix. Expenses also decreased 13%, primarily the result of lower fuel prices, lower volume-related costs and efficiency gains. As a result, operating income decreased 12% to $791 million while the operating ratio improved 20 basis points to 71.6%. In addition, CSX remains an industry leader in safety, and service measures continued to progress well as we enter 2016. In fact, Chicago operations have now been fluid for nearly 12 straight months.
Now turning to the next slide. I'll discuss full year performance. Over the past 5 years, CSX has transformed this business to continue delivering solid results despite the global energy transition. As you can see on the left side of the chart, during that period, CSX coal revenue alone declined from $3.7 billion to $2.3 billion, a cumulative reduction of $1.4 billion. CSX has overcome that loss by significantly diversifying its market mix, improving service and investing in long-term growth opportunities. As a result, in 2015, coal represented only 19% of CSX's revenue, down for more than 30% in 2011.
During that same period, shareholder returns, including dividends and repurchases, have continued to reward the owners of our company, reflecting the steady growth in earnings per share, which reached $2 in 2015. Our 2015 performance was achieved despite the challenges in the energy market, low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar that impacted many of our markets. Revenue of $11.8 billion reflected growth in intermodal, automotive and minerals that partially offset the continued declines in improving service, aligning resources and cost against the lower demand environment and driving efficiency gains of more than $180 million helped to generate operating income of nearly $3.6 billion and our first sub-70 full year operating ratio at 69.7%. Those results reflect the employees' relentless focus on safety and delivering services supports strong pricing and ever increasing operational efficiency as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices. We will continue to leverage our core strategy, superior network reach and diverse market mix to create long-term value for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the quarterly results and future outlook in more detail. Frank?"

Let me begin by providing some more detail on our fourth quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 13% or $411 million versus the prior year.

As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 13% or $411 million versus the prior year. This was driven mainly by a $198 million decline in fuel surcharge recoveries and about $175 million from the impact of lower volume. At the same time, core pricing gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix. Volume decreased 6% from last year with coal driving the majority of the decline. Low natural gas prices, coupled with the impact of significant flooding in South Carolina, impacted domestic coal volumes while low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar challenged export coal in many of our merchandise markets. We continue to see strong core pricing, which, for the fourth quarter, was up 4.1% overall and 4.5% excluding coal.
Other revenue, increased $19 million from last year, driven primarily by unfavorable adjustments to revenue reserves in the prior year period. Expenses decreased 13% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $117 million in lower fuel prices, $107 million in lower volume-related costs and $59 million in efficiency gains. In order to further drive efficiency, we closed 2 facilities in our coal network and completed a new union labor agreement in the fourth quarter. As a result of these actions, we incurred a $48 million or $0.03 EPS impact in the quarter. These short-term restructuring costs will drive future benefits as we gain greater workforce flexibility and continue to adjust to lower demand in our coal markets. Operating income was $791 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% versus the prior year.
Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates. As we highlighted on our last earnings call, a property sale closed in the fourth quarter for a gain of $80 million or a $0.05 benefit to earnings per share. This gain was associated with a nonoperating property and was booked below the line in other income. And finally, income taxes were $275 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $466 million, down 5% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 2% versus last year.
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect volumes to decline in the first quarter. We expect a challenging freight environment to continue as the headwinds associated with coal, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow consistent with light vehicle production and especially in comparison to a year ago when the auto network experienced weather and service-related congestion. Minerals will benefit from continued highway and nonresidential construction activity and new business. Intermodal is neutral as continued secular domestic growth and our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversion are essentially offset by customer losses in international. Agricultural products is unfavorable due to low corn prices coupled with weakness in export grain and import sourcing in ethanol, driven by a strong U.S. dollar.
While core chemicals is expected to again be flat, the overall chemicals market is expected to be down as energy markets continue to reset to an environment marked by low crude oil prices and challenging spreads. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices and an inventory overhang due to mild weather. For 2016, we expect domestic coal volume to be around 19 million tons per quarter. Export coal will continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. Our full year outlook for export coal volume is around 20 million tons with some downside sensitivity. Metals is unfavorable as the strong U.S. dollar and high levels of imports continue to negatively impact steel production levels. Overall, despite a slow growing economy, the freight environment continues to have pronounced challenges with low commodity prices, low natural gas and a strong U.S. dollar.
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses. Overall, we expect first quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment as well as continued productivity and volume-related cost savings.
Looking at labor and fringe, we expect the first quarter average headcount to be down approximately 2% on a sequential basis, driven primarily by the structural changes in our coal network that we announced in the fourth quarter. This reflects about a 10% reduction from the prior year. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million per quarter throughout 2016 in line with the levels seen here in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by efficiency gains and volume-related savings in line with the trends we have seen in the second half of 2015. In addition, the first quarter reflect a shift in our northern Ohio coal operations. Here, we took action early in the fourth quarter to consolidate freight from a facility in Ashtabula to CSX's Toledo Docks, which further streamlines our coal operations.
Fuel expense in the first quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the first quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other [indiscernible] in the first quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year with higher freight car rates offset by improved car cycle times.
Now let me talk about our capital investment plan for this year. In 2016, CSX's total capital investment will decline over $100 million from the 2015 level to $2.4 billion, which includes $300 million for PTC. Similar to 2015, we expect 2016 core capital investment to be higher than our long-term guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue due to our locomotive purchase commitment. This investment in new locomotives expands our ability to run longer trains and we will continue storing older locomotives to maximize the efficiency of the fleet.
Looking at our capital allocation for 2016, you can see that over half the investment will be used to maintain infrastructure to help ensure a safe and fluid network. The majority of our 2016 equipment investment is focused on upgrading our locomotive fleet, which had delivery of 200 new locomotives in 2015 and expect to receive another 100 new locomotives in 2016, which will complete our existing locomotive purchase commitment. In addition, we will continue to focus on strategic investments that support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives. Here, we are prioritizing these investments in our intermodal business, infrastructure projects that support network fluidity and technology initiatives to enable productivity.
Finally, looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we had invested $1.5 billion through the end of 2015, and we plan to invest an additional $300 million in 2016. CSX is committed to meeting the new legislative time line for PTC. As we look at the path to achieving this goal, and with PTC now extending over a longer period of time, we now believe the total cost of PTC implementation will be about $2.2 billion.
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall, CSX delivered solid financial performance in 2015 despite significant market challenges. Full year EPS increased 4% from the prior year, while our operating ratio improved 180 basis points to 69.7%. Revenue in 2015 was lower than we initially expected with volume declining 2% for the full year, but our continued focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. Looking ahead, we expect the coal headwinds to continue in 2016. As I mentioned earlier, domestic coal volume in 2016 is expected to be around 19 million tons per quarter. While full year export coal volume is expected to be around 20 million tons, again with some downside to the export estimate. In addition, for the full year, we will be operating in a more challenging freight environment than we saw in 2015. Natural gas and broader commodity prices are expected to remain at low levels and the strength in the U.S. dollar is expected to persist during the year.
Furthermore, in 2016, we'll be recycling a couple of large items that benefited our 2015 results. Namely, we received about $100 million in liquidated damages had an $80 million property gain in 2015, which are not expected to recur in 2016. As a result, we currently believe that 2016 earnings per share will be down from last year.
Looking at our expectations for 2016, we will continue to rightsize resources with lower demand and pursue structural cost opportunities across our network. In addition, we expect to deliver productivity savings of around $200 million in 2016, which builds on the $184 million of productivity that we achieved in 2015. Overall, we remain intensely focused this year on delivering a service product that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations, achieving strong pricing to support reinvestment in the business and driving efficiencies across our entire cost structure.
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

CSX has continued to deliver solid results for its shareholders despite the transformational decline in the energy environment and the challenging market conditions. The efforts of our dedicated employees, combined with the diversified business mix and the premier network in the east, have helped us overcome the significant losses in coal. As Frank mentioned, 2016 will be a more challenging year. Volume in the first quarter and for the full year will decline as growth in some markets continues to be offset by the significant impact of continued coal declines, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar.
We are taking necessary actions to manage our business in that environment including banking structural and networkwide changes to match resources and cost for business demand, driving further efficiency gains and remaining focused on strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service. In response to the further challenges expected in 2016, we've also decreased the capital budget by more than $100 million. We expect to invest $2.4 billion this year as we remain competitive to preserving safety, service and efficiency for customers and communities alike while positioning CSX for the future.
As we look to the future, this company will continue to transition its business toward long-term profitable growth opportunities in the merchandise and intermodal markets. In that regard, we remain focused on achieving a mid-60s operating ratio longer term as we execute our core strategy of meeting or exceeding customer needs to support strong pricing for the value of our rail service and continuously improving operational efficiency. With those efforts, we are confident that CSX will continue to be a preferred service provider for customers who face a growing population, a more integrated global economy and the need for more reliable, more sustainable supply chains.
Now we will be glad to take your questions."

We do have some excess locomotives. We've seen the export market deteriorate. And as a result of that, we felt this was a time where we went back and revisit what we could do to optimize our bottom line. And this is one market where we actually don't have fuel surcharge in. And as a result, the fuel price have declined throughout the year. We did feel that there was still an opportunity to do a little bit more there and still make money on it. So what you're seeing on the pricing side, in the all-in, is really a reflection of what do we in export coal market. The core pricing actually sequentially improved quarter-over-quarter."

So as we think about that 19 million of domestic coal, it really breaks down into 2 components. One is the utility coal, which is about 14 million tons and steel industry about 5 million tons to make up that 19 million, we did about 13 6 [ph] here in the fourth quarter. And so we're essentially saying we will continue that run rate and we expect some destocking to occur over the year, but how much really will be dependent on the weather since we now are dispatch last, we're essentially peakers [ph]. So we're very much weather-dependent. If you have favorable weather conditions from a railroad perspective or utility perspective, then you can see a significant destocking. If you have continued this sort of weather pattern we saw in the fourth quarter, where heating degree days were actually off by about 25% to 30% off normal, then that will be much more challenging. But hopefully, we'll -- we won't see that and we will see some destocking occur within the guidance that we provided."

The line segment take a little bit longer to work through. They involve customers, they involve their constituencies. So as we make those determinations and make those decisions, we'll be very public with that information. But that's more longer term."

But since then, as we have adjusted export rates significantly down, our utility book of business has a higher margin than the export business. If you look at the overall portfolio of coal versus the rest of the business, I would say that it's still clearly more profitable because of the fact that it's such an efficient way for us to move the cargo. Heavy tonnage, just the unit train back and forth, it's very, very efficient for us to operate that way. And so it's still at the high end of our business."

I wanted to zero in on the change in coal guidance for next year. If I look at kind of what's changed, I think you were talking around kind of a 21 million ton domestic run rate going down to 19 million, so that's about an 8 million ton change. But it really looks like almost half of that drop was on the coking coal and domestic met side. So 2 questions. Number one, when I look at domestic, how much of that change is your view on utility versus your view on kind of other domestic coal? And when I look at the exports, you did about 31 million this year. The guidance is for 20 million. Can I look at end markets, and can we think about it that way in terms of where has the incremental demand ebbed for your export coal geographically?"

If you go back to the third quarter guidance that we did at the call, we essentially said 21 million tons per quarter of domestic, which was 15 million of domestic -- of utility and 6 million of steel and industrial. And what we said then about our export was about 6 million tons a quarter for 24 million in total. So we've essentially seen a deterioration in all of those 3 markets by about 1 million tons a quarter, and it's really a reflection of the fact that natural gas prices and the very mild fourth quarter on the utility side has dampened our expectations. On the steel and industrial side, it's the reflection of the fact that when we look at the steel industry right now, you're having utilization of about 60% versus 75% a year ago, and we saw it deteriorate throughout the fourth quarter. And on the export market, it's also just a reflection of the fact that underlying commodity indexes are telling us that the market has gotten softer as global oversupply continues. So in terms of where the export market is going, we did about 60-40 split here between meth and thermal. They'll probably a little bit higher next year, would be my guess at this point in terms of probably 1/3-2/3, 2/3 in favor of meth. And traditionally, over half of our business goes to Europe, but I would say that split is probably going to continue in terms of the end market as well. And so I think it's just proportional between the markets, and I think you're going to see relatively proportional cut in terms of the end markets as well."

Yesterday, CSX reported fourth quarter net earnings of $466 million or $0.48 per share, down 2% from the same period in 2014. Revenue declined 13% in the quarter, as strong pricing was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery, a 6% volume decline and the continued transition in the company's business mix. Expenses also decreased 13%, primarily the result of lower fuel prices, lower volume-related costs and efficiency gains. As a result, operating income decreased 12% to $791 million while the operating ratio improved 20 basis points to 71.6%. In addition, CSX remains an industry leader in safety, and service measures continued to progress well as we enter 2016. In fact, Chicago operations have now been fluid for nearly 12 straight months.
Now turning to the next slide. I'll discuss full year performance. Over the past 5 years, CSX has transformed its business to continue delivering solid results despite the global energy transition. As you can see on the left side of the chart, during that period, CSX coal revenue alone declined from $3.7 billion to $2.3 billion, a cumulative reduction of $1.4 billion. CSX has overcome that loss by significantly diversifying its market mix, improving service and investing in long-term growth opportunities. As a result, in 2015, coal represented only 19% of CSX's revenue, down from more than 30% in 2011.
During that same period, shareholder returns, including dividends and repurchases, have continued to reward the owners of our company, reflecting the steady growth in earnings per share, which reached $2 in 2015. Our 2015 performance was achieved despite the challenges in the energy market, low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar that impacted many of our markets. Revenue of $11.8 billion reflected growth in intermodal, automotive and minerals that partially offset the continued declines in coal. Improving service, aligning resources and cost against the lower demand environment and driving efficiency gains of more than $180 million helped to generate operating income of nearly $3.6 billion and our first sub-70% full year operating ratio at 69.7%. Those results reflect the employees' relentless focus on safety and delivering service that supports strong pricing and ever increasing operational efficiency as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices. We will continue to leverage our core strategy, superior network reach and diverse market mix to create long-term value for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the quarterly results and future outlook in more detail. Frank?"

Let me begin by providing some more detail on our fourth quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 13% or $411 million versus the prior year. This was driven mainly by a $198 million decline in",1561,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing some more detail on our fourth quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 13% or $411 million versus the prior year. This was driven mainly by a $198 million decline in fuel surcharge recoveries and about $175 million from the impact of lower volume. At the same time, core pricing gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix. Volume decreased 6% from last year, with coal driving the majority of the decline. Low natural gas prices, coupled with the impact of significant flooding in South Carolina, impacted domestic coal volumes, while low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar challenged export coal in many of our merchandise markets. We continue to see strong core pricing, which, for the fourth quarter, was up 4.1% overall and 4.5% excluding coal.
Other revenue increased $19 million from last year, driven primarily by unfavorable adjustments to revenue reserves in the prior-year period. Expenses decreased 13% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $117 million in lower fuel prices, $107 million in lower volume-related costs and $59 million in efficiency gains. In order to further drive efficiency, we closed 2 facilities in our coal network and completed a new union labor agreement in the fourth quarter. As a result of these actions, we incurred a $48 million or $0.03 EPS impact in the quarter. These short-term restructuring costs will drive future benefits as we gain greater workforce flexibility and continue to adjust to lower demand in our coal market. Operating income was $791 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% versus the prior year.
Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates. As we highlighted on our last earnings call, a property sale closed in the fourth quarter for a gain of $80 million or a $0.05 benefit to earnings per share. This gain was associated with a nonoperating property and was booked below the line in other income. And finally, income taxes were $275 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $466 million, down 5% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 2% versus last year.
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect volumes to decline in the first quarter. We expect a challenging freight environment to continue as the headwinds associated with coal, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow consistent with light vehicle production, and especially in comparison to a year ago when the auto network experienced weather and service-related congestion. Minerals will benefit from continued highway and nonresidential construction activity and new business. Intermodal is neutral as continued secular domestic growth and our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversion are essentially offset by customer losses in international. Agricultural products is unfavorable due to low corn prices coupled with weakness in export grain and import sourcing in ethanol, driven by a strong U.S. dollar.
While core chemicals is expected to again be flat, the overall chemicals market is expected to be down as energy markets continue to reset to an environment marked by low crude oil prices and challenging spreads. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices and an inventory overhang due to mild weather. For 2016, we expect domestic coal volume to be around 19 million tons per quarter. Export coal will continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. Our full year outlook for export coal volume is around 20 million tons, with some downside sensitivity. Metals is unfavorable as the strong U.S. dollar and high levels of imports continue to negatively impact steel production levels. Overall, despite a slow growing economy, the freight environment continues to have pronounced challenges with low commodity prices, low natural gas and a strong U.S. dollar.
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses. Overall, we expect first quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment as well as continued productivity and volume-related cost savings.
Looking at labor and fringe, we expect the first quarter average headcount to be down approximately 2% on a sequential basis, driven primarily by the structural changes in our coal network that we announced in the fourth quarter. This reflects about a 10% reduction from the prior year. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million per quarter throughout 2016, in line with the levels seen here in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by efficiency gains and volume-related savings, in line with the trends we have seen in the second half of 2015. In addition, the first quarter reflect a shift in our Northern Ohio coal operations. Here, we took action early in the fourth quarter to consolidate freight from a facility in Ashtabula to CSX's Toledo Docks, which further streamlines our coal operations.
Fuel expense in the first quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the first quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the first quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year, with higher freight car rates offset by improved car cycle times.
Now let me talk about our capital investment plan for this year. In 2016, CSX's total capital investment will decline over $100 million from the 2015 level to $2.4 billion, which includes $300 million for PTC. Similar to 2015, we expect 2016 core capital investment to be higher than our long-term guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue due to our locomotive purchase commitment. This investment in new locomotives expands our ability to run longer trains, and we will continue storing older locomotives to maximize the efficiency of the fleet.
Looking at our capital allocation for 2016, you can see that over half the investment will be used to maintain infrastructure to help ensure a safe and fluid network. The majority of our 2016 equipment investment is focused on upgrading our locomotive fleet, which had delivery of 200 new locomotives in 2015 and expect to receive another 100 new locomotives in 2016, which will complete our existing locomotive purchase commitment. In addition, we will continue to focus on strategic investments that support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives. Here, we are prioritizing these investments in our intermodal business, infrastructure projects that support network fluidity and technology initiatives to enable productivity.
Finally, looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we had invested $1.5 billion through the end of 2015, and we plan to invest an additional $300 million in 2016. CSX is committed to meeting the new legislative time line for PTC. As we look at the path to achieving this goal, and with PTC now extending over a longer period of time, we now believe the total cost of PTC implementation will be about $2.2 billion.
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall, CSX delivered solid financial performance in 2015 despite significant market challenges. Full year EPS increased 4% from the prior year, while our operating ratio improved 180 basis points to 69.7%. Revenue in 2015 was lower than we initially expected with volume declining 2% for the full year, but our continued focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. Looking ahead, we expect the coal headwinds to continue in 2016. As I mentioned earlier, domestic coal volume in 2016 is expected to be around 19 million tons per quarter, while full year export coal volume is expected to be around 20 million tons, again with some downside to the export estimate. In addition, for the full year, we will be operating in a more challenging freight environment than we saw in 2015. Natural gas and broader commodity prices are expected to remain at low levels, and the strength in the U.S. dollar is expected to persist during the year.
Furthermore, in 2016, we'll be cycling a couple of large items that benefited our 2015 results. Namely, we received about $100 million in liquidated damages and had an $80 million property gain in 2015, which are not expected to recur in 2016. As a result, we currently believe that 2016 earnings per share will be down from last year.
Looking at our expectations for 2016, we will continue to rightsize resources with lower demand and pursue structural cost opportunities across our network. In addition, we expect to deliver productivity savings of around $200 million in 2016, which builds on the $184 million of productivity that we achieved in 2015. Overall, we remain intensely focused this year on delivering a service product that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations, achieving strong pricing to support reinvestment in the business and driving efficiencies across our entire cost structure.
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

CSX has continued to deliver solid results for its shareholders despite the transformational decline in the energy environment and the challenging market conditions. The efforts of our dedicated employees, combined with the diversified business mix and the premier network in the east, have helped us overcome the significant losses in coal. As Frank mentioned, 2016 will be a more challenging year. Volume in the first quarter and for the full year will decline as growth in some markets continues to be offset by the significant impact of continued coal declines, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar.
We are taking necessary actions to manage our business in that environment, including making structural and network-wide changes to match resources and cost with business demand, driving further efficiency gains and remaining focused on strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service. In response to the further challenges expected in 2016, we've also decreased the capital budget by more than $100 million. We expect to invest $2.4 billion this year as we remain competitive [ph] to preserving safety, service and efficiency for customers and communities alike, while positioning CSX for the future.
As we look to the future, this company will continue to transition its business toward long-term profitable growth opportunities in the merchandise and intermodal markets. In that regard, we remain focused on achieving a mid-60s operating ratio longer term as we execute our core strategy of meeting or exceeding customer needs to support strong pricing for the value of our rail service and continuously improving operational efficiency. With those efforts, we are confident that CSX will continue to be a preferred service provider for customers who face a growing population, a more integrated global economy and the need for more reliable, more sustainable supply chains.
Now we will be glad to take your questions."

And as a result of that, we felt this was a time where we went back and revisited what we could do to optimize our bottom line. And this is one market where we actually don't have fuel surcharge in. And as a result, the fuel price have declined throughout the year. We did feel that there was still an opportunity to do a little bit more there and still make money on it. So what you're seeing on the pricing side in the all-in is really a reflection of what we're doing in the export coal market. The core pricing actually sequentially improved quarter-over-quarter."

So as we think about that 19 million of domestic coal, it really breaks down into 2 components. One is the utility coal, which is about 14 million tons, and steel and industrial about 5 million tons to make up that 19 million. We did about 13.6 million here in the fourth quarter. And so we're essentially saying we will continue that run rate. And we expect some destocking to occur over the year, but how much really will be dependent on the weather since we now are dispatched last. We're essentially peakers [ph], so we're very much weather dependent. If you have favorable weather conditions from a railroad perspective or utility perspective, then you can see a more significant destocking. If you have continued this sort of weather pattern we saw in the fourth quarter, where heating degree days were actually off by about 25% to 30% off normal, then that will be much more challenging.

So to the extent those are obviously in the coal fields, that is an impact to productivity in 2016 around both facilities, reduction in facilities and headcount reductions. So that's basically the way I see 2016 looking with productivity. As far as continued rationalization in the coalfields, as I said, we're going to look at that, not just in the coalfields but broadly, whether it's facility related and/or line segment. The line segments take a little bit longer to work through. They involve customers, they involve their constituencies. So as we make those determinations and make those decisions, we'll be very public with that information. But that's more longer term."

But since then, as we have adjusted export rates significantly down, our utility book of business has a higher margin than the export business. If you look at the overall portfolio of coal versus the rest of the business, I would say that it's still clearly more profitable because of the fact that it's such an efficient way for us to move the cargo. Heavy tonnage, just the unit train back and forth, it's very, very efficient for us to operate that way. And so it's still at the high end of our business."

I wanted to zero in on the change in coal guidance for next year. If I look at kind of what's changed, I think you were talking around kind of a 21 million ton domestic run rate going down to 19 million, so that's about an 8-million-ton change. But it really looks like almost half of that drop was on the coking coal and domestic met side. So 2 questions. Number one, when I look at domestic, how much of that change is your view on utility versus your view on kind of other domestic coal? And when I look at the exports, you did about 31 million this year. The guidance is for 20 million. Can I look at end markets, and can we think about it that way in terms of where has the incremental demand ebbed for your export coal geographically?"

If you go back to the third quarter guidance that we did at the call, we essentially said 21 million tons per quarter of domestic, which was 15 million of domestic -- of utility and 6 million of steel and industrial. And what we said then about our export was about 6 million tons a quarter for 24 million in total. So we've essentially seen a deterioration in all of those 3 markets by about 1 million tons a quarter, and it's really a reflection of the fact that natural gas prices and the very mild fourth quarter on the utility side has dampened our expectations. On the steel and industrial side, it's the reflection of the fact that when we look at the steel industry right now, you're having utilization of about 60% versus 75% a year ago, and we saw it deteriorate throughout the fourth quarter. And on the export market, it's also just a reflection of the fact that underlying commodity indexes are telling us that the market has gotten softer as global oversupply continues. So in terms of where the export market is going, we did about 60-40 split here between meth and thermal. They'll probably a little bit higher next year, would be my guess at this point in terms of probably 1/3-2/3, 2/3 in favor of meth. And traditionally, over half of our business goes to Europe, but I would say that split is probably going to continue in terms of the end market as well. And so I think it's just proportional between the markets, and I think you're going to see relatively proportional cut in terms of the end markets as well."

Yesterday, CSX reported fourth quarter net earnings of $466 million or $0.48 per share, down 2% from the same period in 2014. Revenue declined 13% in the quarter, as strong pricing was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery, a 6% volume decline and the continued transition in the company's business mix. Expenses also decreased 13%, primarily the result of lower fuel prices, lower volume-related costs and efficiency gains. As a result, operating income decreased 12% to $791 million while the operating ratio improved 20 basis points to 71.6%. In addition, CSX remains an industry leader in safety, and service measures continued to progress well as we enter 2016. In fact, Chicago operations have now been fluid for nearly 12 straight months.
Now turning to the next slide. I'll discuss full year performance. Over the past 5 years, CSX has transformed its business to continue delivering solid results despite the global energy transition. As you can see on the left side of the chart, during that period, CSX coal revenue alone declined from $3.7 billion to $2.3 billion, a cumulative reduction of $1.4 billion. CSX has overcome that loss by significantly diversifying its market mix, improving service and investing in long-term growth opportunities. As a result, in 2015, coal represented only 19% of CSX's revenue, down from more than 30% in 2011.
During that same period, shareholder returns, including dividends and repurchases, have continued to reward the owners of our company, reflecting the steady growth in earnings per share, which reached $2 in 2015. Our 2015 performance was achieved despite the challenges in the energy market, low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar that impacted many of our markets. Revenue of $11.8 billion reflected growth in intermodal, automotive and minerals that partially offset the continued declines in coal. Improving service, aligning resources and cost against the lower demand environment and driving efficiency gains of more than $180 million helped to generate operating income of nearly $3.6 billion and our first sub-70% full year operating ratio at 69.7%. Those results reflect the employees' relentless focus on safety and delivering service that supports strong pricing and ever increasing operational efficiency as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices. We will continue to leverage our core strategy, superior network reach and diverse market mix to create long-term value for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the quarterly results and future outlook in more detail. Frank?"

Let me begin by providing some more detail on our fourth quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 13% or $411 million versus the prior year.

As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 13% or $411 million versus the prior year. This was driven mainly by a $198 million decline in fuel surcharge recoveries and about $175 million from the impact of lower volume. At the same time, core pricing gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix. Volume decreased 6% from last year, with coal driving the majority of the decline. Low natural gas prices, coupled with the impact of significant flooding in South Carolina, impacted domestic coal volumes, while low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar challenged export coal in many of our merchandise markets. We continue to see strong core pricing, which, for the fourth quarter, was up 4.1% overall and 4.5% excluding coal.
Other revenue increased $19 million from last year, driven primarily by unfavorable adjustments to revenue reserves in the prior year period. Expenses decreased 13% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $117 million in lower fuel prices, $107 million in lower volume-related costs and $59 million in efficiency gains. In order to further drive efficiency, we closed 2 facilities in our coal network and completed a new union labor agreement in the fourth quarter. As a result of these actions, we incurred a $48 million or $0.03 EPS impact in the quarter. These short-term restructuring costs will drive future benefits as we gain greater workforce flexibility and continue to adjust to lower demand in our coal market. Operating income was $791 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% versus the prior year.
Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates. As we highlighted on our last earnings call, a property sale closed in the fourth quarter for a gain of $80 million or a $0.05 benefit to earnings per share. This gain was associated with a nonoperating property and was booked below the line in other income. And finally, income taxes were $275 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $466 million, down 5% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 2% versus last year.
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect volumes to decline in the first quarter. We expect a challenging freight environment to continue as the headwinds associated with coal, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow consistent with light vehicle production, and especially in comparison to a year ago when the auto network experienced weather and service-related congestion. Minerals will benefit from continued highway and nonresidential construction activity and new business. Intermodal is neutral as continued secular domestic growth and our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversion are essentially offset by customer losses in international. Agricultural products is unfavorable due to low corn prices coupled with weakness in export grain and import sourcing in ethanol, driven by a strong U.S. dollar.
While core chemicals is expected to again be flat, the overall chemicals market is expected to be down as energy markets continue to reset to an environment marked by low crude oil prices and challenging spreads. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices and an inventory overhang due to mild weather. For 2016, we expect domestic coal volume to be around 19 million tons per quarter. Export coal will continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. Our full year outlook for export coal volume is around 20 million tons, with some downside sensitivity. Metals is unfavorable as the strong U.S. dollar and high levels of imports continue to negatively impact steel production levels. Overall, despite a slow growing economy, the freight environment continues to have pronounced challenges with low commodity prices, low natural gas and a strong U.S. dollar.
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses. Overall, we expect first quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment as well as continued productivity and volume-related cost savings.
Looking at labor and fringe, we expect the first quarter average headcount to be down approximately 2% on a sequential basis, driven primarily by the structural changes in our coal network that we announced in the fourth quarter. This reflects about a 10% reduction from the prior year. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million per quarter throughout 2016, in line with the levels seen here in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by efficiency gains and volume-related savings, in line with the trends we have seen in the second half of 2015. In addition, the first quarter reflect a shift in our Northern Ohio coal operations. Here, we took action early in the fourth quarter to consolidate freight from a facility in Ashtabula to CSX's Toledo Docks, which further streamlines our coal operations.
Fuel expense in the first quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the first quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the first quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year, with higher freight car rates offset by improved car cycle times.
Now let me talk about our capital investment plan for this year. In 2016, CSX's total capital investment will decline over $100 million from the 2015 level to $2.4 billion, which includes $300 million for PTC. Similar to 2015, we expect 2016 core capital investment to be higher than our long-term guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue due to our locomotive purchase commitment. This investment in new locomotives expands our ability to run longer trains, and we will continue storing older locomotives to maximize the efficiency of the fleet.
Looking at our capital allocation for 2016, you can see that over half the investment will be used to maintain infrastructure to help ensure a safe and fluid network. The majority of our 2016 equipment investment is focused on upgrading our locomotive fleet, which had delivery of 200 new locomotives in 2015 and expect to receive another 100 new locomotives in 2016, which will complete our existing locomotive purchase commitment. In addition, we will continue to focus on strategic investments that support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives. Here, we are prioritizing these investments in our intermodal business, infrastructure projects that support network fluidity and technology initiatives to enable productivity.
Finally, looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we had invested $1.5 billion through the end of 2015, and we plan to invest an additional $300 million in 2016. CSX is committed to meeting the new legislative time line for PTC. As we look at the path to achieving this goal, and with PTC now extending over a longer period of time, we now believe the total cost of PTC implementation will be about $2.2 billion.
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall, CSX delivered solid financial performance in 2015 despite significant market challenges. Full year EPS increased 4% from the prior year, while our operating ratio improved 180 basis points to 69.7%. Revenue in 2015 was lower than we initially expected with volume declining 2% for the full year, but our continued focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. Looking ahead, we expect the coal headwinds to continue in 2016. As I mentioned earlier, domestic coal volume in 2016 is expected to be around 19 million tons per quarter, while full year export coal volume is expected to be around 20 million tons, again with some downside to the export estimate. In addition, for the full year, we will be operating in a more challenging freight environment than we saw in 2015. Natural gas and broader commodity prices are expected to remain at low levels, and the strength in the U.S. dollar is expected to persist during the year.
Furthermore, in 2016, we'll be cycling a couple of large items that benefited our 2015 results. Namely, we received about $100 million in liquidated damages and had an $80 million property gain in 2015, which are not expected to recur in 2016. As a result, we currently believe that 2016 earnings per share will be down from last year.
Looking at our expectations for 2016, we will continue to rightsize resources with lower demand and pursue structural cost opportunities across our network. In addition, we expect to deliver productivity savings of around $200 million in 2016, which builds on the $184 million of productivity that we achieved in 2015. Overall, we remain intensely focused this year on delivering a service product that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations, achieving strong pricing to support reinvestment in the business and driving efficiencies across our entire cost structure.
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

CSX has continued to deliver solid results for its shareholders despite the transformational decline in the energy environment and the challenging market conditions. The efforts of our dedicated employees, combined with the diversified business mix and the premier network in the east, have helped us overcome the significant losses in coal. As Frank mentioned, 2016 will be a more challenging year. Volume in the first quarter and for the full year will decline as growth in some markets continues to be offset by the significant impact of continued coal declines, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar.
We are taking necessary actions to manage our business in that environment, including making structural and network wide changes to match resources and cost with business demand, driving further efficiency gains and remaining focused on strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service. In response to the further challenges expected in 2016, we've also decreased the capital budget by more than $100 million. We expect to invest $2.4 billion this year as we remain competitive [ph] to preserving safety, service and efficiency for customers and communities alike, while positioning CSX for the future.
As we look to the future, this company will continue to transition its business toward long-term profitable growth opportunities in the merchandise and intermodal markets. In that regard, we remain focused on achieving a mid-60s operating ratio longer term as we execute our core strategy of meeting or exceeding customer needs to support strong pricing for the value of our rail service and continuously improving operational efficiency. With those efforts, we are confident that CSX will continue to be a preferred service provider for customers who face a growing population, a more integrated global economy and the need for more reliable, more sustainable supply chains.
Now we will be glad to take your questions."

And as a result of that, we felt this was a time where we went back and revisited what we could do to optimize our bottom line. And this is one market where we actually don't have fuel surcharge in. And as a result, the fuel price have declined throughout the year. We did feel that there was still an opportunity to do a little bit more there and still make money on it. So what you're seeing on the pricing side in the all-in is really a reflection of what we're doing in the export coal market. The core pricing actually sequentially improved quarter-over-quarter."

If we look at where we are, we're probably in the 110s or so in terms of the south, and more in the 80 range in the northern part of our network, which should probably be in the 55 to 70 range. So as we think about that 19 million of domestic coal, it really breaks down into 2 components. One is the utility coal, which is about 14 million tons, and steel and industrial about 5 million tons to make up that 19 million. We did about 13.6 million here in the fourth quarter. And so we're essentially saying we will continue that run rate. And we expect some destocking to occur over the year, but how much really will be dependent on the weather since we now are dispatched last. We're essentially peakers [ph], so we're very much weather dependent. If you have favorable weather conditions from a railroad perspective or utility perspective, then you can see a more significant destocking. If you have continued this sort of weather pattern we saw in the fourth quarter, where heating degree days were actually off by about 25% to 30% off normal, then that will be much more challenging.

Two of those, or 1 area that's included, is the actions that we took in the fourth quarter on the reduction in volume across the Erwin gateway and the closure of the Corbin locomotive facilities. So to the extent those are obviously in the coal fields, that is an impact to productivity in 2016 around both facilities, reduction in facilities and headcount reductions. So that's basically the way I see 2016 looking with productivity. As far as continued rationalization in the coalfields, as I said, we're going to look at that, not just in the coalfields but broadly, whether it's facility related and/or line segment. The line segments take a little bit longer to work through. They involve customers, they involve their constituencies. So as we make those determinations and make those decisions, we'll be very public with that information. But that's more longer term."

If you look at the overall portfolio of coal versus the rest of the business, I would say that it's still clearly more profitable because of the fact that it's such an efficient way for us to move the cargo. Heavy tonnage, just the unit train back and forth, it's very, very efficient for us to operate that way. And so it's still at the high end of our business."

I wanted to zero in on the change in coal guidance for next year. If I look at kind of what's changed, I think you were talking around kind of a 21 million ton domestic run rate going down to 19 million, so that's about an 8 million ton change. But it really looks like almost half of that drop was on the coking coal and domestic met side. So 2 questions. Number one, when I look at domestic, how much of that change is your view on utility versus your view on kind of other domestic coal? And when I look at the exports, you did about 31 million this year. The guidance is for 20 million. Can I look at end markets, and can we think about it that way in terms of where has the incremental demand ebbed for your export coal geographically?"

If you go back to the third quarter guidance that we did at the call, we essentially said 21 million tons per quarter of domestic, which was 15 million of domestic -- of utility and 6 million of steel and industrial. And what we said then about our export was about 6 million tons a quarter for 24 million in total. So we've essentially seen a deterioration in all of those 3 markets by about 1 million tons a quarter, and it's really a reflection of the fact that natural gas prices and the very mild fourth quarter on the utility side has dampened our expectations. On the steel and industrial side, it's the reflection of the fact that when we look at the steel industry right now, you're having utilization of about 60% versus 75% a year ago, and we saw it deteriorate throughout the fourth quarter. And on the export market, it's also just a reflection of the fact that underlying commodity indexes are telling us that the market has gotten softer as global oversupply continues. So in terms of where the export market is going, we did about 60-40 split here between meth and thermal. They'll probably a little bit higher next year, would be my guess at this point in terms of probably 1/3-2/3, 2/3 in favor of meth. And traditionally, over half of our business goes to Europe, but I would say that split is probably going to continue in terms of the end market as well. And so I think it's just proportional between the markets, and I think you're going to see relatively proportional cut in terms of the end markets as well."

Yesterday, CSX reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.37 compared to $0.45 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 14% in the quarter, a strong pricing across nearly all markets reflecting an improving service product, was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery, market conditions that drove a 5% volume decline, including a 31% decline in coal and a $95 million year-over-year decline in liquidated damages. Turning to operations. CSX remained an industry leader in safety and service measurements continued to advance in the quarter, consistent with our service excellence initiative to meet and exceed customer expectations. 
Expenses improved 12%, driven by lower fuel prices as well as efficiency gains and lower volume related costs, reflecting CSX's ongoing drive to aggressively reduce its cost structure as we continue to reshape the company in face of this challenging market environment. 
Including the impact of these cost-saving actions and the decline in liquidated damages, operating income decreased $139 million to $704 million for the quarter. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 73.1.

Let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year. With coal declining 31%, total volume decreased 5% from",1237,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. 
Let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year. With coal declining 31%, total volume decreased 5% from last year, which impacted revenue by about $140 million. 
In addition, fuel surcharge recovery declined $139 million. 
We continue to see strong core pricing from an improving service product, which for the first quarter was up 3.1% overall and 4.0%, excluding coal.  However, these gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix in the quarter. 
Other revenue decreased $85 million, driven mainly by cycling higher liquidated damages from last year, which totaled $105 million versus $10 million in this year's first quarter. 
Expenses decreased 12% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $133 million in efficiency gains, $78 million in lower fuel prices and $64 million in lower volume related costs. 
Operating income was $704 million in the first quarter, down 16% versus the prior year. 
Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. 
Then finally, income taxes were $212 million in the quarter, with an effective tax rate of about 37%. 
Overall, net earnings were $356 million, down 19% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.37 per share, down 18% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward, we, again, expect volumes to decline in the second quarter. The challenging freight environment will continue as headwinds in coal, energy and metals volume are expected to more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow as light vehicle production continues to be a bright spot in the economy. Minerals will benefit from the continued ramp up of a new flash remediation project and continued highway construction driving aggregates movement. 
Intermodal is expected to be neutral as we continue to cycle competitive international losses. This will be offset by secular domestic growth, driven by strategic investments supporting highway-to-rail conversion. Chemicals volume is expected to decline as energy markets continue to be marked by low crude oil prices and reduced drilling activity, which will impact our shale-related products more significantly in the second quarter. 
At the same time, the core chemical markets remain healthy. 
Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices currently around $2 and high levels of coal inventory at the utilities. As a result, we expect second quarter tonnage to be around 18 million tons. 
In addition, we anticipate a similar quarterly run rate for the second half, recognizing domestic coal volume will be largely dependent on weather. 
Export coal remains pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. As a result, we believe second quarter tonnage will be around 4 million to 5 million tons and expect a similar run rate for the remainder of the year. 
For the full year, we now expect around 18 million to 20 million tons of export coal in 2016. 
Despite a slowly recovering domestic steel production environment, metal is expected to be unfavorable year-over-year as the market works off excess supply from a strong U.S. dollar and imported products. 
Overall, we are still facing significant coal headwinds and a freight environment that continues to experience pronounced challenges associated with historically low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar. 
As a result, we expect second quarter volume to decline in the mid- to high-single-digit range year-over-year. 
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the second quarter. 
We expect second quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment and our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources as we continue to reshape the company. 
Over the course of the last 12 months, we have taken aggressive cost actions with headcount down nearly 4,500 versus the prior year. These actions include our train length initiative, closing facilities in the coal network, consolidating a division headquarters and streamlining mechanical and operations that support functions. 
These actions, along with cycling the impact of winter weather last year, drove high efficiency gains in excess of $130 million seen here in the first quarter.  And for the full year, we now expect to deliver efficiency gains of around $250 million. 
Looking at labor and fringe we expect second quarter average headcount to stay relatively flat sequentially. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the second quarter, in line with the levels seen here in the first quarter. 
Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation and the cycling of an operating property gain from last year to more than offset efficiency gains in volume-related savings. 
Fuel expense in the second quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. 
We expect depreciation in the second quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. 
Finally, equipment and other rents in the second quarter is expected to increase moderately from last year, with higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth, more than offsetting improved car cycle times. 
Now let me wrap up from the next slide. CSX's first quarter results reflect challenging freight conditions with low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar continuing to impact most markets, resulting in a 5% volume decline this quarter. However, as we continue to reshape the company, our focus on pricing for the relative value of real service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. 
Looking ahead, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continued this year. Low commodity prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar are expected to continue impacting many of CSX's markets. 
In particular, we now expect total coal volume to decline around 25% for the full year. 
Looking at our expectations for the second quarter and full year. The impact of current market conditions on CSX's volume, particularly in coal is expected to outweigh the positive momentum we are seeing in service, which drives pricing efficiency and rightsizing initiatives. 
In the second quarter, we expect mid- to high-single-digit volume declines, with efficiency gain moderating from the level seen here in the first quarter. 
For the full year, in addition to liquidated damages we cycled during the first quarter, as we previously discussed, we will also be cycling a significant property transaction in the fourth quarter. 
As a result, we continue to expect second quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. That said, we remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX service product, rightsizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. 
In particular, the aggressive cost actions we have taken over the last 12 months have helped to mitigate the challenging freight environment and weaker volumes. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect to deliver efficiency savings of around $250 million in 2016. 
With that, let me turn the the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

And then what probably is the biggest driver for us is health and welfare inflation as the industry is reducing resources, you've got fewer employees to spread the health and welfare costs over. So both of those are industry in nature. In terms of maybe some CSX specific dynamics, as you furlough employee generally those are going to be are less tenured employees with lower all-in wages and then maybe as a last point, Ken, when you look at a year-over-year number of employees in training, they were significantly more employees in training in the year ago quarter than they are currently just given sort of where we are on the resource side and training pay is less than marked up pay.

We, over the year, 2016 so 16% gains in our train lengths, and we're up to about 6,500 feet, 6,400 feet in total. We saw smallest incremental change in the fourth quarter as we had really large put in place all that we felt comfortably we could to maintain service to our customers, and we are bumping up against challenges. In the single track territory, we are citing little bit of the limit for us. Going forward, and then this year, we are planning to increase citing length in our corridor from Nashville to Cincinnati. That is presently limited to 6,500 feet, so we're making some structural adjustments to help us continue it, and we should see those investments in place and available to us in the back half of this year. So I would also say that one of the benefits of the initiative that we've seen is the ability to flex as seasonality impacts volume. So in summer months, we feel that we're a little bit less volume that's typically out there that we'll be able to continue to utilize train length in terms of reducing our cost, gives us ability that we haven't before. And certainly, if anything changes either up or down, we'll be able to adjust accordingly, to maintain train lengths. So we feel really good about the initiatives and our teams in the field has done a fantastic job putting it in place."

Specifically, the last couple of weeks to your question, we look at our 4 key markets: Merchandise, intermodal, coal and auto. Our merchandise business has stayed probably some of the 2 strongest weak in the last 2 weeks but then we have seen some weakness in our coal markets, which is consistent with our guidance. We also had some operational issues with some of the terminals we served on the export side that impacted our volumes. Our auto business was very strong early on in March. We probably had 65% of our cars under load, and that's kind of cycling through that right now, but we continue to see good strength there for the rest of the year.

And the rest of our network, and we'll continue to work in a coal network and in the coalfields in making the right decisions, while still serving the customers that we have there. We look at the rest of the network, we're focusing very hard on density, which is part of our train length initiatives really kind of the underlying component of train lengths initiatives. So as we look at our main arteries, how can we continue to drive density there, which then allows us to streamline some facilities around that. So you've seen us do that with some of the mechanical reductions that we announced that we were going to make in some of our car facilities. And then going forward, too, beyond just simply network type of actions, our technology implementation that allows us to automate. So we're looking at this as the ability from my perspective to create a plan and execute a plan that helps CSX thrive in a rail industry that is fundamentally changing. And so we will continue to drive all of these initiatives and look for ways to tweak them to get even better efficiency, while still and I have to say it's very important to us that we serve our customers and have a service product that meets or exceeds expectations."

There's certainly, right now, excess capacity, which reflected in the spot pricing. I would say though that as we look at some of the underlying drivers there, especially new orders for tracks, which is coming down pretty rapidly, you still have the challenges in terms of driver retention and to escalating cost there, and we have probably the biggest impact that I think all of you have followed and recently followed as well is the ELDs next year and the impact that, that will have definitely as we get in the second half of 2017. So this is a soft environment and of that will be with us for a couple quarters. I think of an about us that we talked about for a long time is very much intact, and we're seeing that in a partnership with the truckers that we continue to build on to allow us to do the long-haul and then to do the pickup and then the delivery with we saw some of the strategic challenges. So it is softer, but we do think that's a temporary issue and that the basic thesis of our intermodal investments and our bullish investment long-term, to 9 million loads, et cetera, is very much intact.

If you compare first quarter of '15 to this quarter, we actually have about 400 less locomotives active, which is about 10% in line with the volume reductions achieved that we talked about. Within that embedded in that is the fact that we've got 275 store but there's also another 96 that are leased returns that will be returned in the second and third quarter of this year that we've already pulled out. So we feel like we're fairly decently in line with GTM reduction and our workload reduction and our resource take down a result of that. And it also allows us if we gets surprisingly upside, we have the ability to pull more locomotives out. And I would also add that we are receiving locomotives in our long-term purchase plan we received 26 locomotives of that 100 total in the first quarter. So that's kind of the puts and takes around locomotives, and we are very obviously focused on rightsizing our resources around both locomotives, employees and cars, and I'll talk about cars here as well. In terms of what you're seeing with cars online, we have about 1,300 cars stored right now versus our 13,000 stored right now versus 5,500 this time last year. When you look at cars online, the cars that are actually stored don't come out of the count for a fairly long period of time, about 36 months, it's a standard that we all have.

I think we have seen a lot of change over the last couple of years. We would have thought that in 4 years, we would lose $1.4 billion of coal revenue, and we are pretty much on target here in 2016 to lose at least $500 million of coal revenue. And so",306,"Yes. I think we have seen a lot of change over the last couple of years. We would have thought that in 4 years, we would lose $1.4 billion of coal revenue, and we are pretty much on target here in 2016 to lose at least $500 million of coal revenue. And so, clearly, based on where natural gas prices are right now, there's an economic interest in diverting a lot of utility plans away from coal towards natural gas and some instance like you pointed out to all so to nuclear. We do think though that the where we are at these very depressed levels, both because of natural gas prices being so low and most likely unsustainable low place and the fact that stockpiles are also very, very high that there are opportunities to see some pick up at some point but there is no doubt that the trend on the utility side is downward going forward. But I don't think that we're  anywhere close to the pace that we've seen year over the last 4 to 5 years. So we monitor it very close. Of course, also looking at the direct impact of the regulation that is going to come -- kick in in here potentially as we get into 2020 and beyond. But I think as we look at the next couple of years, we have seen a significant portion of the pain behind us. And right now, it's about seeing where natural gas prices will stabilize and when do we get through this overhang in a stockpiles to get back to more normalized level. When that happens, we'll see where it is. But the general trend is obviously, it is going -- it's a downward path. 
All right, thank you for joining us. And we will see you again next quarter."

So let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year.

So let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year. With coal declining 31%, total volume decreased 5% from last year, which impacted revenue by about $140 million. In addition, fuel surcharge recoveries declined $139 million. 
We continue to see strong core pricing from an improving service product, which for the first quarter was up 3.1% overall and 4.0% excluding coal.  However, these gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix in the quarter. 
Other revenue decreased $85 million, driven mainly by cycling higher liquidated damages from last year, which totaled $105 million versus $10 million in this year's first quarter. 
Expenses decreased 12% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $133 million in efficiency gains, $78 million in lower fuel prices and $64 million in lower volume related costs. 
Operating income was $704 million in the first quarter, down 16% versus the prior year. 
Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels, partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. 
Then finally, income taxes were $212 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. 
Overall, net earnings were $356 million, down 19% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.37 per share, down 18% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward, we, again, expect volumes to decline in the second quarter. The challenging freight environment will continue as headwinds in coal, energy and metals volume are expected to more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow as light vehicle production continues to be a bright spot in the economy. Minerals will benefit from the continued ramp up of a new flash remediation project and continued highway construction driving aggregates movement. 
Intermodal is expected to be neutral as we continue to cycle competitive international losses. This will be offset by secular domestic growth, driven by strategic investments supporting highway-to-rail conversion. Chemicals volume is expected to decline as energy markets continue to be marked by low crude oil prices and reduced drilling activity, which will impact our shale-related products more significantly in the second quarter. At the same time, the core chemical markets remain healthy. 
Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices, currently around $2 and high levels of coal inventory at the utilities. As a result, we expect second quarter tonnage to be around 18 million tons. 
In addition, we anticipate a similar quarterly run rate for the second half, recognizing domestic coal volume will be largely dependent on weather. 
Export coal remains pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. As a result, we believe second quarter tonnage will be around 4 million to 5 million tons and expect a similar run rate for the remainder of the year. 
For the full year, we now expect around 18 million to 20 million tons of export coal in 2016. Despite a slowly recovering domestic steel production environment, metals is expected to be unfavorable year-over-year as the market works off excess supply from a strong U.S. dollar and imported product. 
Overall, we are still facing significant coal headwinds and a freight environment that continues to experience pronounced challenges associated with historically low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar. 
As a result, we expect second quarter volume to decline in the mid- to high-single-digit range year-over-year. 
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the second quarter. We expect second quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment and our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources as we continue to reshape the company. 
Over the course of the last 12 months, we have taken aggressive cost actions with headcount down nearly 4,500 versus the prior year. These actions include our train length initiative, closing facilities in the coal network, consolidating a division headquarters and streamlining mechanical and operations that support functions. 
These actions, along with cycling the impact of winter weather last year, drove high efficiency gains in excess of $130 million seen here in the first quarter. And for the full year, we now expect to deliver efficiency gains of around $250 million. 
Looking at labor and fringe, we expect second quarter average headcount to stay relatively flat sequentially. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the second quarter, in line with the levels seen here in the first quarter. 
Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation and the cycling of an operating property gain from last year to more than offset efficiency gains in volume-related savings. 
Fuel expense in the second quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. 
We expect depreciation in the second quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. 
Finally, equipment and other rents in the second quarter is expected to increase moderately from last year, with higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth more than offsetting improved car cycle times. 
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX' first quarter results reflect challenging freight conditions with low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar continuing to impact most markets, resulting in a 5% volume decline this quarter. However, as we continue to reshape the company, our focus on pricing for the relative value of real service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. 
Looking ahead, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue this year. Low commodity prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar are expected to continue impacting many of CSX' markets. In particular, we now expect total coal volume to decline around 25% for the full year. 
Looking at our expectations for the second quarter and full year, the impact of current market conditions on CSX' volume, particularly in coal, is expected to outweigh the positive momentum we are seeing in service, which drives pricing efficiency and rightsizing initiatives. 
In the second quarter, we expect mid- to high-single-digit volume declines with efficiency gain moderating from the level seen here in the first quarter. 
For the full year, in addition to liquidated damages we cycled during the first quarter, as we previously discussed, we will also be cycling a significant property transaction in the fourth quarter. 
As a result, we continue to expect second quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. That said, we remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX' service product, rightsizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. 
In particular, the aggressive cost actions we have taken over the last 12 months have helped to mitigate the challenging freight environment and weaker volumes. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect to deliver efficiency savings of around $250 million in 2016. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As the industry is reducing resources, you've got fewer employees to spread the health and welfare costs over. So both of those are industry in nature.

And we're also seeing -- while it's not directly dollar-related, some of the potential tariff and countervailing duties that we're seeing in metals business, we're starting to see drive down some of the imports into the country, which is starting, slowly but surely, I think, to heal the -- our metals business as well.

And we are bumping up against challenges in the single track territory where our siding length is a bit of a limiter for us. Going forward, and in this year, we are planning to increase siding length in our corridor from Nashville to Cincinnati. That is presently limited to 6,500 feet. So we are making some structural adjustments to help us continue it, and we should see those investments be in place and available to us in the back half of this year. So I would also say that one of the benefits of the initiative that we've seen is the ability to flex as seasonality impacts volume. So in summer months, we feel that with a little bit less volume that's typically out there that we'll be able to continue to utilize train length in terms of reducing our cost. It gives us ability to variablize where we haven't before. And certainly, if anything changes either up or down, we'll be able to adjust accordingly to maintain train length. So we feel really good about the initiatives, and our team in the field has done a fantastic job putting it in place."

Specifically, the last couple of weeks to your question, we look at the -- our 4 key markets: Merchandise, intermodal, coal and auto. Our merchandise business has stayed probably some of the 2 strongest weeks, frankly, the last 2 weeks, but then we have seen some weakness in our coal markets, which is consistent with our guidance. We also had some operational issues with some of the terminals we serve on the export side that impacted our volumes. Our auto business was very strong early on in March. We probably had 65% of our cars under load, and that's kind of cycling through that right now, but we continue to see good strength there for the rest of the year. And yes, we have seen a little bit of weakness in the intermodal space over the last few weeks, but I don't think anything that has structurally changed there.

So we have a significant comp that we have to work through in the second quarter. We tried to give you as much granular guidance as we could as we look out over the next 3 months. Certainly, we gave you some very specific tonnage guidance around coal, and then, the overall volumes in the mid- to high-single-digit range, just given the softness in the economy and certainly the coal headwinds play into that. And we're going to continue to focus on the things that we have the most impact on, certainly safety and service. Productivity, Cindy mentioned a run rate of 40 million to 50 million in the second quarter and improving service product as well as continued strong value pricing.

On the rest of our network, and we'll continue to work in the coal network and in the coalfields on making the right decisions, while still serving the customers that we have there. We look at the rest of the network, we're focusing very hard on density, which is part of our train length initiative is really kind of the underlying component of train length initiative. So as we look at our main arteries, how can we continue to drive density there, which then also allows us to streamline some facilities around that. So you've seen us do that with some of the mechanical reductions, that we announced, that we were going to make in some of our car facilities. And then going forward to beyond just simply network type of actions, our technology implementation that allows us to do -- to automate. So we're looking at this as the ability, from my perspective, to create the plan and execute a plan that helps CSX thrive in a rail industry that is fundamentally changing. And so we will continue to drive all of these initiatives and look for ways to tweak them to get even better efficiency, while still and I have to say, it's very important to us that we would serve our customers and have a service product that meets or exceeds their expectations."

I would say though that, as we look at some of the underlying drivers there, especially new orders for trucks, which is coming down pretty rapidly, you still have the challenges in terms of driver retention and the escalating cost there, and we have the -- probably the biggest impact that I think all of you have followed, and we certainly follow as well, is the ELDs next year, and the impact that, that will have, definitely as we get into the second half of 2017. So while this is a soft environment right now, that'll be with us for a couple quarters, I think the fundamentals that we've talked about for a long time is very much intact, and we're seeing that in the partnership with the truckers, that we continue to build on, to allow us to do the long-haul and then to do the pickup and the delivery, which solves some of their strategic challenges. So it is softer, but we do think that's a temporary issue, and that the basic thesis of our intermodal investments and our bullishness in it are more long-term, in 9 million loads, et cetera, is very much intact.

So we feel like we're fairly decently in line with the GTM reduction and our workload reduction and our resource take down as a result of that. And it also allows us, if we get surprised on the upside, we have the ability to pull more locomotives out. And I would also add that we are receiving locomotives. In our long-term purchase plan, we received 26 locomotives of that 100 total in the first quarter. So that's kind of the puts and takes around locomotives, and we are very, obviously, focused on rightsizing our resources around both locomotives, employees and cars, and I'll talk about cars here as well.

I think we have seen a lot of change over the last couple of years.

Who would have thought that in 4 years, we would lose $1.4 billion of coal revenue, and we are on -- pretty much on target here in 2016 to lose at least $500 million of coal revenue. And so, clearly, based on where natural gas prices are right now, there's an economic interest in diverting a lot of the utility plants away from coal towards natural gas, and in some instance, like you pointed out, to also to nuclear. We do think though that, where we are at these very depressed levels, both because of natural gas prices being so low, and most likely in an unsustainable low place, and the fact that stockpiles are also very, very high, that there are opportunities to see some pick up at some point, but there is no doubt that the trend on the utility side is downward going forward. But I don't think it anywhere close to the pace that we've seen here over the last 4 to 5 years. So we monitor that very close. Of course, also looking at the direct impact of the regulation that is going to come -- kick in here potentially, as we get into 2020 and beyond. But I think as we look at the next couple of years, we have seen a significant portion of the pain behind us. And right now, it's about seeing where natural gas prices will stabilize, and when do we get through this overhang in the stockpiles to get back to more normalized level. When that happens, we'll see where it is. But the general trend is obviously, it is going to -- it's a downward path."

Let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year.

Let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year. With coal declining 31%, total volume decreased 5% from last year, which impacted revenue by about $140 million. In addition, fuel surcharge recoveries declined $139 million. 
We continue to see strong core pricing from an improving service product, which for the first quarter was up 3.1% overall and 4.0% excluding coal.  However, these gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix in the quarter. 
Other revenue decreased $85 million, driven mainly by cycling higher liquidated damages from last year, which totaled $105 million versus $10 million in this year's first quarter. 
Expenses decreased 12% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $133 million in efficiency gains, $78 million in lower fuel prices and $64 million in lower volume related costs. 
Operating income was $704 million in the first quarter, down 16% versus the prior year. 
Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. 
And finally, income taxes were $212 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. 
Overall, net earnings were $356 million, down 19% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.37 per share, down 18% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward, we again expect volumes to decline in the second quarter. The challenging freight environment will continue as headwinds in coal, energy and metals volume are expected to more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow as light vehicle production continues to be a bright spot in the economy. Minerals will benefit from the continued ramp up of a new fly ash remediation project and continued highway construction driving aggregates movement. 
Intermodal is expected to be neutral as we continue to cycle competitive international losses. This will be offset by secular domestic growth, driven by strategic investments supporting highway-to-rail conversion. Chemicals volume is expected to decline as energy markets continue to be marked by low crude oil prices and reduced drilling activity, which will impact our shale-related products more significantly in the second quarter. At the same time, the core chemical markets remain healthy. 
Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices, currently around $2 and high levels of coal inventory at the utilities. As a result, we expect second quarter tonnage to be around 18 million tons. 
In addition, we anticipate a similar quarterly run rate for the second half, recognizing domestic coal volume will be largely dependent on weather. 
Export coal remains pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. As a result, we believe second quarter tonnage will be around 4 million to 5 million tons and expect a similar run rate for the remainder of the year. 
For the full year, we now expect around 18 million to 20 million tons of export coal in 2016. Despite a slowly recovering domestic steel production environment, metals is expected to be unfavorable year-over-year as the market works off excess supply from a strong U.S. dollar and imported product. 
Overall, we are still facing significant coal headwinds and a freight environment that continues to experience pronounced challenges associated with historically low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar. 
As a result, we expect second quarter volume to decline in the mid- to high-single-digit range year-over-year. 
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the second quarter. We expect second quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment and our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources as we continue to reshape the company. 
Over the course of the last 12 months, we have taken aggressive cost actions with headcount down nearly 4,500 versus the prior year. These actions include our train length initiative, closing facilities in the coal network, consolidating a division headquarters and streamlining mechanical and operations support functions. 
These actions, along with cycling the impact of winter weather last year, drove high efficiency gains in excess of $130 million seen here in the first quarter. And for the full year, we now expect to deliver efficiency gains of around $250 million. 
Looking at labor and fringe, we expect second quarter average headcount to stay relatively flat sequentially. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the second quarter, in line with the levels seen here in the first quarter. 
Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation and the cycling of an operating property gain from last year to more than offset efficiency gains in volume-related savings. 
Fuel expense in the second quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. 
We expect depreciation in the second quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. 
Finally, equipment and other rents in the second quarter is expected to increase moderately from last year, with higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth more than offsetting improved car cycle times. 
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX's first quarter results reflect challenging freight conditions with low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar continuing to impact most markets, resulting in a 5% volume decline this quarter. However, as we continue to reshape the company, our focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. 
Looking ahead, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue this year. Low commodity prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar are expected to continue impacting many of CSX's markets. In particular, we now expect total coal volume to decline around 25% for the full year. 
Looking at our expectations for the second quarter and full year, the impact of current market conditions on CSX's volume, particularly in coal, is expected to outweigh the positive momentum we are seeing in service, which drives pricing efficiency and rightsizing initiatives. 
In the second quarter, we expect mid- to high-single-digit volume declines with efficiency gains moderating from the levels seen here in the first quarter. 
For the full year, in addition to liquidated damages we cycled during the first quarter, as we previously discussed, we will also be cycling a significant property transaction in the fourth quarter. 
As a result, we continue to expect second quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. That said, we remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service product, rightsizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. 
In particular, the aggressive cost actions we have taken over the last 12 months have helped to mitigate the challenging freight environment and weaker volumes. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect to deliver efficiency savings of around $250 million in 2016. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As the industry is reducing resources, you've got fewer employees to spread the health and welfare costs over. So both of those are industry in nature. In terms of maybe some CSX specific dynamics, as you furlough employees, generally those are going to be your less tenured employees with lower all-in wages. And then maybe as a last point, Ken, when you look at a year-over-year number of employees in training, there were significantly more employees in training in the year ago quarter than there are currently just given sort of where we are on the resource side and training pay is less than marked up pay.

And we're also seeing -- while it's not directly dollar-related, some of the potential tariff and countervailing duties that we're seeing in metals business, we're starting to see drive down some of the imports into the country, which is starting, slowly but surely, I think, to heal the -- our metals business as well.

So we are making some structural adjustments to help us continue it, and we should see those investments be in place and available to us in the back half of this year. So I would also say that one of the benefits of the initiative that we've seen is the ability to flex as seasonality impacts volume. So in summer months, we feel that with a little bit less volume that's typically out there that we'll be able to continue to utilize train length in terms of reducing our cost. It gives us ability to variabilize where we haven't before. And certainly, if anything changes either up or down, we'll be able to adjust accordingly to maintain train length.

Specifically, the last couple of weeks to your question, we look at the -- our 4 key markets: Merchandise, intermodal, coal and auto. Our merchandise business has stayed probably some of the 2 strongest weeks, frankly, the last 2 weeks, but then we have seen some weakness in our coal markets, which is consistent with our guidance. We also had some operational issues with some of the terminals we serve on the export side that impacted our volumes. Our auto business was very strong early on in March. We probably had 65% of our cars under load, and that's kind of cycling through that right now, but we continue to see good strength there for the rest of the year.

On the rest of our network -- and we'll continue to work in the coal network and in the coalfields on making the right decisions, while still serving the customers that we have there. We look at the rest of the network, we're focusing very hard on density, which is part of our train length initiative is really kind of the underlying component of train length initiatives. So as we look at our main arteries, how can we continue to drive density there, which then also allows us to streamline some facilities around that. So you've seen us do that with some of the mechanical reductions that we announced that we were going to make in some of our car facilities. And then going forward to beyond just simply network type of actions, our technology implementation that allows us to do -- to automate. So we're looking at this as the ability, from my perspective, to create the plan and execute a plan that helps CSX thrive in a rail industry that is fundamentally changing. And so we will continue to drive all of these initiatives and look for ways to tweak them to get even better efficiency, while still and I have to say, it's very important to us that we serve our customers and have a service product that meets or exceeds their expectations."

So while this is a soft environment right now that'll be with us for a couple quarters, I think the fundamentals that we've talked about for a long time is very much intact, and we're seeing that in the partnership with the truckers that we continue to build on to allow us to do the long-haul and then to do the pickup and the delivery, which solves some of their strategic challenges. So it is softer, but we do think that's a temporary issue, and that the basic thesis of our intermodal investments and our bullishness in it are more long-term, in 9 million loads, et cetera, is very much intact.

In our long-term purchase plan, we received 26 locomotives of that 100 total in the first quarter. So that's kind of the puts and takes around locomotives, and we are very, obviously, focused on rightsizing our resources around both locomotives, employees and cars, and I'll talk about cars here as well.

Who would have thought that in 4 years, we would lose $1.4 billion of coal revenue, and we are on -- pretty much on target here in 2016 to lose at least $500 million of coal revenue. And so, clearly, based on where natural gas prices are right now, there's an economic interest in diverting a lot of the utility plants away from coal towards natural gas, and in some instance, like you pointed out, to also to nuclear. We do think though that, where we are at these very depressed levels, both because of natural gas prices being so low, and most likely in an unsustainable low place, and the fact that stockpiles are also very, very high, that there are opportunities to see some pick-up at some point, but there is no doubt that the trend on the utility side is downward going forward. But I don't think it anywhere close to the pace that we've seen here over the last 4 to 5 years. So we monitor that very close while, of course, also looking at the direct impact of the regulation that is going to come -- kick in here potentially, as we get into 2020 and beyond. But I think as we look at the next couple of years, we have seen a significant portion of the pain behind us. And right now, it's about seeing where natural gas prices will stabilize, and when do we get through this overhang in the stockpiles to get back to more normalized level. When that happens, we'll see where it is. But the general trend is obviously, it is going to -- it's a downward path."

Let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year.

Let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year. With coal declining 31%, total volume decreased 5% from last year, which impacted revenue by about $140 million. In addition, fuel surcharge recoveries declined $139 million. 
We continue to see strong core pricing from an improving service product, which for the first quarter was up 3.1% overall and 4.0% excluding coal.  However, these gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix in the quarter. 
Other revenue decreased $85 million, driven mainly by cycling higher liquidated damages from last year, which totaled $105 million versus $10 million in this year's first quarter. 
Expenses decreased 12% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $133 million in efficiency gains, $78 million in lower fuel prices and $64 million in lower volume related costs. 
Operating income was $704 million in the first quarter, down 16% versus the prior year. 
Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. 
And finally, income taxes were $212 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. 
Overall, net earnings were $356 million, down 19% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.37 per share, down 18% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward, we again expect volumes to decline in the second quarter. The challenging freight environment will continue as headwinds in coal, energy and metals volume are expected to more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow as light vehicle production continues to be a bright spot in the economy. Minerals will benefit from the continued ramp up of a new fly ash remediation project and continued highway construction driving aggregates movement. 
Intermodal is expected to be neutral as we continue to cycle competitive international losses. This will be offset by secular domestic growth, driven by strategic investments supporting highway-to-rail conversion. Chemicals volume is expected to decline as energy markets continue to be marked by low crude oil prices and reduced drilling activity, which will impact our shale-related products more significantly in the second quarter. At the same time, the core chemical markets remain healthy. 
Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices, currently around $2 and high levels of coal inventory at the utilities. As a result, we expect second quarter tonnage to be around 18 million tons. 
In addition, we anticipate a similar quarterly run rate for the second half, recognizing domestic coal volume will be largely dependent on weather. 
Export coal remains pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. As a result, we believe second quarter tonnage will be around 4 million to 5 million tons and expect a similar run rate for the remainder of the year. 
For the full year, we now expect around 18 million to 20 million tons of export coal in 2016. Despite a slowly recovering domestic steel production environment, metals is expected to be unfavorable year-over-year as the market works off excess supply from a strong U.S. dollar and imported product. 
Overall, we are still facing significant coal headwinds and a freight environment that continues to experience pronounced challenges associated with historically low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar. 
As a result, we expect second quarter volume to decline in the mid- to high-single-digit range year-over-year. 
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the second quarter. We expect second quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment and our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources as we continue to reshape the company. 
Over the course of the last 12 months, we have taken aggressive cost actions with headcount down nearly 4,500 versus the prior year. These actions include our train length initiative, closing facilities in the coal network, consolidating a division headquarters and streamlining mechanical and operations support functions. 
These actions, along with cycling the impact of winter weather last year, drove high efficiency gains in excess of $130 million seen here in the first quarter. And for the full year, we now expect to deliver efficiency gains of around $250 million. 
Looking at labor and fringe, we expect second quarter average headcount to stay relatively flat sequentially. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the second quarter, in line with the levels seen here in the first quarter. 
Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation and the cycling of an operating property gain from last year to more than offset efficiency gains in volume-related savings. 
Fuel expense in the second quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. 
We expect depreciation in the second quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. 
Finally, equipment and other rents in the second quarter is expected to increase moderately from last year, with higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth more than offsetting improved car cycle times. 
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX' first quarter results reflect challenging freight conditions with low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar continuing to impact most markets, resulting in a 5% volume decline this quarter. However, as we continue to reshape the company, our focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. 
Looking ahead, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue this year. Low commodity prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar are expected to continue impacting many of CSX' markets. In particular, we now expect total coal volume to decline around 25% for the full year. 
Looking at our expectations for the second quarter and full year, the impact of current market conditions on CSX' volume, particularly in coal, is expected to outweigh the positive momentum we are seeing in service, which drives pricing efficiency and rightsizing initiatives. 
In the second quarter, we expect mid- to high-single-digit volume declines with efficiency gains moderating from the levels seen here in the first quarter. 
For the full year, in addition to liquidated damages we cycled during the first quarter, as we previously discussed, we will also be cycling a significant property transaction in the fourth quarter. 
As a result, we continue to expect second quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. That said, we remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX' service product, rightsizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. 
In particular, the aggressive cost actions we have taken over the last 12 months have helped to mitigate the challenging freight environment and weaker volumes. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect to deliver efficiency savings of around $250 million in 2016. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

We also enjoyed some spot moves here in the first quarter that we don't necessarily see in the remaining 3 quarters, so maybe a 4 million to 5 million tons a quarter on the export side.

Clearly, you have general wage inflation of, say, 4% a year or so. And then what probably is the biggest driver for us is health and welfare inflation. As the industry is reducing resources, you've got fewer employees to spread the health and welfare costs over. So both of those are industry in nature. In terms of maybe some CSX specific dynamics, as you furlough employees, generally those are going to be your less tenured employees with lower all-in wages. And then maybe as a last point, Ken, when you look at a year-over-year number of employees in training, there were significantly more employees in training in the year ago quarter than there are currently just given sort of where we are on the resource side and training pay is less than marked up pay.

And we're also seeing -- while it's not directly dollar-related, some of the potential tariff and countervailing duties that we're seeing in metals business, we're starting to see drive down some of the imports into the country, which is starting, slowly but surely, I think, to heal the -- our metals business as well.

So we are making some structural adjustments to help us continue it, and we should see those investments be in place and available to us in the back half of this year. So I would also say that one of the benefits of the initiative that we've seen is the ability to flex as seasonality impacts volume. So in summer months, we feel that with a little bit less volume that's typically out there that we'll be able to continue to utilize train length in terms of reducing our cost. It gives us ability to variabilize where we haven't before. And certainly, if anything changes either up or down, we'll be able to adjust accordingly to maintain train length.

Our merchandise business has stayed probably some of the 2 strongest weeks, frankly, the last 2 weeks, but then we have seen some weakness in our coal markets, which is consistent with our guidance. We also had some operational issues with some of the terminals we serve on the export side that impacted our volumes. Our auto business was very strong early on in March.

On the rest of our network -- and we'll continue to work in the coal network and in the coalfields on making the right decisions, while still serving the customers that we have there. We look at the rest of the network, we're focusing very hard on density, which is part of our train length initiative is really kind of the underlying component of train length initiatives. So as we look at our main arteries, how can we continue to drive density there, which then also allows us to streamline some facilities around that. So you've seen us do that with some of the mechanical reductions that we announced that we were going to make in some of our car facilities. And then going forward to beyond just simply network type of actions, our technology implementation that allows us to do -- to automate. So we're looking at this as the ability, from my perspective, to create the plan and execute a plan that helps CSX thrive in a rail industry that is fundamentally changing.

So while this is a soft environment right now that'll be with us for a couple quarters, I think the fundamentals that we've talked about for a long time is very much intact, and we're seeing that in the partnership with the truckers that we continue to build on to allow us to do the long-haul and then to do the pickup and the delivery, which solves some of their strategic challenges. So it is softer, but we do think that's a temporary issue, and that the basic thesis of our intermodal investments and our bullishness in it are more long-term, in 9 million loads, et cetera, is very much intact.

If you compare first quarter of '15 to this quarter, we actually have about 400 less locomotives active, which is about 10% in line with the volume reductions achieved -- we talked about. Within that -- embedded in that is the fact that we've got 275 store, but there's also another 96 that are lease returns that will be returned in the second and third quarter of this year that we've already pulled out. So we feel like we're fairly decently in line with the GTM reduction and our workload reduction and our resource takedown as a result of that. And it also allows us, if we get surprised on the upside, we have the ability to pull more locomotives out. And I would also add that we are receiving locomotives. In our long-term purchase plan, we received 26 locomotives of that 100 total in the first quarter. So that's kind of the puts and takes around locomotives, and we are very, obviously, focused on rightsizing our resources around both locomotives, employees and cars, and I'll talk about cars here as well. In terms of what you're seeing with cars online, we have about 1,300 cars stored right now versus -- 13,000 stored right now versus 5,500 this time last year. When you look at cars online, the cars that are actually stored don't come out of the count for a fairly long period of time, about 36 months, it's a standard that we all have. So if you include those additional cars that have -- were pulled out in the first quarter, we're down about 4%, in terms of cars online -- if you take those out of cars online number. So again, we feel like we're fairly well-resourced appropriately for the demand that we have."

Who would have thought that in 4 years, we would lose $1.4 billion of coal revenue, and we are on -- pretty much on target here in 2016 to lose at least $500 million of coal revenue. And so, clearly, based on where natural gas prices are right now, there's an economic interest in diverting a lot of the utility plants away from coal towards natural gas, and in some instance, like you pointed out, to also to nuclear. We do think though that, where we are at these very depressed levels, both because of natural gas prices being so low, and most likely in an unsustainable low place, and the fact that stockpiles are also very, very high, that there are opportunities to see some pick-up at some point, but there is no doubt that the trend on the utility side is downward going forward. But I don't think it anywhere close to the pace that we've seen here over the last 4 to 5 years. So we monitor that very close while, of course, also looking at the direct impact of the regulation that is going to come -- kick in here potentially, as we get into 2020 and beyond. But I think as we look at the next couple of years, we have seen a significant portion of the pain behind us. And right now, it's about seeing where natural gas prices will stabilize, and when do we get through this overhang in the stockpiles to get back to more normalized level. When that happens, we'll see where it is. But the general trend is obviously, it is going to -- it's a downward path."

Yesterday, CSX reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.47 compared to $0.56 per share in the same period last year.

Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased",1311,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 9%, which impacted revenue by about $260 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $98 million. We continue to see strong core pricing from an improving service product, which for the second quarter was up 2.9% overall and 4.0%, excluding coal. However, this was partially offset by negative business mix in the quarter. Other revenue decreased $29 million driven mainly by lower incidental charges and coal-related revenue from affiliate railroads. Expenses decreased 9% versus the prior year driven mainly by $96 million in efficiency gains, $86 million in lower volume-related costs and $56 million in lower fuel prices. Operating income was $840 million in the second quarter, down 17% from last year.  Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. And finally, income taxes were $262 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%.  Overall, net earnings were $445 million, down 20% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.47 per share, down 16% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect year-over-year volumes to decline in the third quarter in the mid- to high-single-digit range. Despite some markets growing, the majority of our markets will be down with the most significant declines continuing to be concentrated in coal and crude oil. Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remains higher on a year-over-year basis. Minerals volume will be higher with the continued ramp up of new fly ash remediation business and ongoing strength in construction, which drives demand for aggregates. Agricultural products are expected to decline as the strong dollar and low commodity prices continue to pressure both domestic and export shipments. Chemicals will be down due to the continued declines in shale-related products resulting from low crude oil and natural gas prices. We expect crude oil volume to be moderately lower on a sequential basis. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by an excess supply of natural gas at a price point that favors gas burn over coal in the east. In addition, coal inventories remain hot and year-over-year volume declines will continue to be significant, although less severe than the second quarter due to softer comps in the back half of 2015. Export coal should be moderately lower in the second half of the year from the first half tonnage run rate consistent with the seasonality we have seen in recent years. Despite modest improvements in the met and thermal benchmarks, the export market will remain pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. With that  said, we saw more spot moves anticipated in the second quarter. As such, we now expect full year export coal tonnage of around 20 million tons. 
For the total coal market, we continue to expect full year tonnage declines of around 25%, with third quarter coal tonnage roughly stable sequentially to what we have seen in the first half of this year or approximately 22 million to 23 million tons in the quarter. Intermodal is expected to be down as we continue to cycle prior competitive losses in international through the remainder of 2016. Domestic intermodal is anticipated to be roughly flat in light of difficult comps that reflected new business shifting to CSX in the third quarter of last year. Overall, our business continues to reflect a market environment driven by low crude oil, natural gas and broader commodity prices as well as continued strength in the U.S. dollar. 
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the third quarter. Since last year, we have taken aggressive cost actions, which includes reducing headcount by about 4,500 versus the prior year. As a result, we have achieved about $230 million of efficiency gains in the first half of 2016 and now expect full year productivity savings to approach $350 million. We expect third quarter expense to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources. 
Looking first at labor and fringe. We expect third quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. In addition, we expect labor inflation to be around $30 million in the third quarter. Finally, we expect a headwind in the third quarter of $25 million to $30 million versus the prior year driven by higher incentive compensation. 
As a reminder, in 2015, we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as market conditions drove CSX's financial results below our initial plan. 
Looking at MS&O expense. We expect efficiency gains and volume-related savings to more than offset inflation. As a result, MS&O costs are expected to be down moderately versus the prior year. Fuel expense in the third quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon year-over-year reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the third quarter to increase around $20 million versus the prior year reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. 
Finally, equipment and other rents in the third quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth. 
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX's second quarter results reflect success in the challenging freight environment with macroeconomic and coal headwinds impacting most markets resulting in a 9% volume decline this quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset those substantial volume headwinds. 
Looking ahead, let me first provide an update on our 2016 capital investment. Projected capital investment has increased $300 million from our initial plan as CSX now anticipates accelerating payments for locomotives delivered throughout 2016 under a long-term commitment. We originally intended to pay for these locomotives in 2017. As such, 2016 capital investment is now expected to be $2.7 billion. By completing our locomotive purchase commitment this year, we simultaneously clear the path in 2017 for CSX to begin returning to our long-term core capital investment guidance of around 16% to 17% of revenue. 
As we think about market conditions for the remainder of the year, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue. Low commodity prices and strength in the U.S. dollar will continue to impact many of CSX's merchandise markets, while natural gas prices below $3.50 and elevated stockpiles are driving significant headwinds in coal. As a result, we continue to expect total coal tonnage to decline around 25% for the full year. 
Looking at our expectations for the third quarter and full year. We remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service products, rightsizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network.  As a result of these initiatives, we now expect efficiency gains to approach $350 million in 2016. 
With that said, the impact of current market conditions on CSX's volume, particularly in coal, is expected to outweigh our positive momentum. As a result, we continue to expect third quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. Furthermore, as a reminder, third quarter EPS is typically down sequentially from second quarter results reflecting the seasonality of our business. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As Frank discussed, it's clear this continues to be a challenging freight environment with plenty of macroeconomic headwinds. Thanks to the extraordinary work of our employees, CSX is delivering record levels of efficiency and rightsizing resources to the business demand of today. 
Looking longer term, the company has a bright future as the men and women of CSX are simultaneously positioning the company for growth, where we have the resource flexibility to serve future demand. This will position CSX to maximize long-term opportunities in both our merchandise and intermodal markets. As a result, we continue to be enthusiastic about the core earning power of the company as the market headwinds subside. 
As we work to transform this company into the CSX of tomorrow, we must grow and make more profitable the merchandise and intermodal markets which represent our future. At the same time, we will continue to preserve the business value of coal recognizing that it will become a smaller but still important part of our company. 
Our future involves leveraging a premier highly efficient network that reaches diverse merchandise and intermodal markets and nearly 2/3 of the American consumers. It requires consistent excellent service for customers, which in turn supports efficiency, profitable growth and pricing that allows us to continue investing for the future. And it includes technology solutions to drive an evermore safe, reliable and efficient railroads. As we manage today's business environment to deliver on the future potential, we continue to focus on achieving a mid-60s operating ratio longer term to deliver compelling value for you, our shareholders. 
And now, we are pleased to take your questions."

You'll continue to see us focus hard on core capital and making sure that we're making the right decisions in terms of infrastructure, equipment and return-seeking investments. As you think about PTC going into 2017, that number should decline some from the levels that you see here in 2016, it should step down a little bit, and then again, between '17 and '18 as we set our sights towards being compliant with the FRA's and Congress's mandate that will be hardware complete by the end of 2018.

What we do in terms of tracking productivity, we make sure that we normalize for volume first. So to the extent that there are volume-variable expenses, then those don't count toward productivity. And what you've seen this year is that in the first half, we're about $150 million of what we call rightsizing or volume-variable cost reductions, and then $230 million of structural cost efficiencies. There is a lot of accountability around productivity, and again, that is the way that we take cost out long term. Let me give you just a simplistic example that may help illustrate it. If so -- let's use coal just because coal volumes have come down. So if a coal train ran last year but doesn't run this year, then the cost associated with locomotives and crudes and fuel and car costs would come out of volume variable expenses, and so you'd hear us talk about those in terms of rightsizing. If, for example, and we have instances of this where you have 2 coal trains that ran last year and this year through the train length initiative and that we're outing, we've actually put those 2 trains together and run a 200-car trains to 100-car trains, the efficiencies associated with less locomotive-intensity, crew-intensity, fuel-intensity, et cetera, would be allocated toward productivity."

We've also announced publicly and probably consolidated facilities in Central Florida with Winston Yard in Tampa, consolidation actually in Tampa and also streamlining sort of our mechanical facilities and shops that are aligned more with our triangle in the core network that we have. Our job is to really become less resource intensive, so between train lengths and the sort of density of the train as well as the density of the route that we route the train has also allowed us significant savings across the board.

That is a pretty significant structural change. In the meantime, what we're trying to do is work on terminal productivity. We have a variety of initiatives in place there that has yielded a lot of results here. We continue to work on train lengths in the intermodal space to make sure, just as we do elsewhere in our business, to allow for the leverage that occurs there. Of course, double-stack clearance is as important. And you know where we are with the Virginia Avenue tunnel. By the end of this year, we should be able to double-stack clear there as well. And then the hub-and-spoke strategy that we've lined out for all of you for a long time has allowed for a significant amount of efficiency being able to penetrate some of these smaller markets with a lot more density that we otherwise could.

And part of what has helped that has been that the countervailing tariffs and so forth has been very helpful to stem the flow of imports into the United States.

We have 1 mill that we both have inbound and outbound too that has closed down. That was really a big driver for our volume decline.

Yesterday, CSX reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.47 compared to $0.56 per share in the same period last year.

Regarding operating performance, CSX continued to deliver strong safety performance, and service continued to meet and exceed customer expectations and drive further efficiency. 
In the quarter, CSX continued to aggressively and successfully reduce its cost structure throughout the network, recognizing that this company's long-term future is built on a fluid and efficient network, serving primarily intermodal and merchandise markets.

Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decrease",1312,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 9%, which impacted revenue by about $260 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $98 million. We continue to see strong core pricing from an improving service product, which for the second quarter was up 2.9% overall and 4.0% excluding coal. However, this was partially offset by negative business mix in the quarter. 
Other revenue decreased $29 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges and coal-related revenue from affiliate railroads. Expenses decreased 9% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $96 million in efficiency gains, $86 million in lower volume-related costs and $56 million in lower fuel prices. 
Operating income was $840 million in the second quarter, down 17% from last year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. 
And finally, income taxes were $262 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. 
Overall, net earnings were $445 million, down 20% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.47 per share, down 16% versus last year.
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect year-over-year volumes to decline in the third quarter in the mid- to high-single-digit range. Despite some markets growing, the majority of our markets will be down, with the most significant declines continuing to be concentrated in coal and crude oil. Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remains higher on a year-over-year basis. Minerals volume will be higher with the continued ramp up of new fly ash remediation business and ongoing strength in construction, which drives demand for aggregates. 
Agricultural products are expected to decline as the strong dollar and low commodity prices continue to pressure both domestic and export shipments. Chemicals will be down due to the continued declines in shale-related products resulting from low crude oil and natural gas prices. We expect crude oil volume to be moderately lower on a sequential basis. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by an excess supply of natural gas at a price point that favors gas burn over coal in the east. In addition, coal inventories remain hot and year-over-year volume declines will continue to be significant, although less severe than the second quarter due to softer comps in the back half of 2015. 
Export coal should be moderately lower in the second half of the year from the first half tonnage run rate, consistent with the seasonality we have seen in recent years. Despite modest improvements in the met and thermal benchmarks, the export market will remain pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. With that said, we saw more spot moves than anticipated in the second quarter. As such, we now expect full year export coal tonnage of around 20 million tons.
For the total coal market, we continue to expect full year tonnage declines of around 25%, with third quarter coal tonnage roughly stable sequentially to what we have seen in the first half of this year or approximately 22 million to 23 million tons in the quarter. 
Intermodal is expected to be down as we continue to cycle prior competitive losses in international through the remainder of 2016. Domestic intermodal is anticipated to be roughly flat in light of difficult comps that reflected new business shifting to CSX in the third quarter of last year. 
Overall, our business continues to reflect a market environment driven by low crude oil, natural gas and broader commodity prices as well as continued strength in the U.S. dollar.
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the third quarter. Since last year, we have taken aggressive cost actions, which includes reducing headcount by about 4,500 versus the prior year. As a result, we have achieved about $230 million of efficiency gains in the first half of 2016 and now expect full year productivity savings to approach $350 million. We expect third quarter expense to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources.
Looking first at labor and fringe. We expect third quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. In addition, we expect labor inflation to be around $30 million in the third quarter. Finally, we expect a headwind in the third quarter of $25 million to $30 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015, we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as market conditions drove CSX's financial results below our initial plan.
Looking at MS&O expense. We expect efficiency gains and volume-related savings to more than offset inflation. As a result, MS&O costs are expected to be down moderately versus the prior year. Fuel expense in the third quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon year-over-year, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the third quarter to increase around $20 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business.
Finally, equipment and other rents in the third quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth.
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX's second quarter results reflect success in a challenging freight environment with macroeconomic and coal headwinds impacting most markets, resulting in a 9% volume decline this quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset those substantial volume headwinds.
Looking ahead, let me first provide an update on our 2016 capital investment. Projected capital investment has increased $300 million from our initial plan as CSX now anticipates accelerating payments for locomotives delivered throughout 2016 under a long-term commitment. We originally intended to pay for these locomotives in 2017. As such, 2016 capital investment is now expected to be $2.7 billion. By completing our locomotive purchase commitment this year, we simultaneously clear the path in 2017 for CSX to begin returning to our long-term core capital investment guidance of around 16% to 17% of revenue.
As we think about market conditions for the remainder of the year, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue. Low commodity prices and strength in the U.S. dollar will continue to impact many of CSX's merchandise markets, while natural gas prices below $3.50 and elevated stockpiles are driving significant headwinds in coal. As a result, we continue to expect total coal tonnage to decline around 25% for the full year.
Looking at our expectations for the third quarter and full year. We remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service products, rightsizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect efficiency gains to approach $350 million in 2016. 
With that said, the impact of current market conditions on CSX's volume, particularly in coal, is expected to outweigh our positive momentum. As a result, we continue to expect third quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. Furthermore, as a reminder, third quarter EPS is typically down sequentially from second quarter results, reflecting the seasonality of our business. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As Frank discussed, it's clear this continues to be a challenging freight environment with plenty of macroeconomic headwinds. Thanks to the extraordinary work of our employees, CSX is delivering record levels of efficiency and rightsizing resources to the business demand of today. 
Looking longer term, the company has a bright future as the men and women of CSX are simultaneously positioning the company for growth, where we have the resource flexibility to serve future demand. This will position CSX to maximize long-term opportunities in both our merchandise and intermodal markets. As a result, we continue to be enthusiastic about the core earning power of the company as the market headwinds subside.
As we work to transform this company into the CSX of tomorrow, we must grow and make more profitable the merchandise and intermodal markets which represent our future. At the same time, we will continue to preserve the business value of coal, recognizing that it will become a smaller but still important part of our company. 
Our future involves leveraging a premier, highly efficient network that reaches diverse merchandise and intermodal markets and nearly 2/3 of the American consumers. It requires consistent excellent service for customers, which in turn supports efficiency, profitable growth and pricing that allows us to continue investing for the future. And it includes technology solutions that drive an evermore safe, reliable and efficient railroad.

So we've got some negative mix. And then moderating productivity as we get throughout the year. Obviously, we have delivered about $230 million in productivity in the first half, and that implies a certainly moderating productivity level as you get into the Q3 and Q4. And then we tried to give you some clarity in the third quarter remarks about where incentive comp might be. And certainly with fuel prices, where they're going, and cycling some of the fuel positives that we had in the third quarter of last year, we're going to have a net fuel headwind as well. So we've got some challenges looking ahead of us in the third quarter. But as I'm sure Cindy will mention later in the call, everything's on the table on the productivity side, and pricing continues to be favorable, given the environment."

There is a lot of accountability around productivity, and again, that is the way that we take cost out long term. Let me give you just a simplistic example that may help illustrate it. If so -- let's use coal just because coal volumes have come down. So if a coal train ran last year but doesn't run this year, then the cost associated with locomotives and crudes and fuel and car costs would come out of volume variable expenses, and so you'd hear us talk about those in terms of rightsizing. If, for example, and we have instances of this where you have 2 coal trains that ran last year and this year through the train length initiative and that we're outing, we've actually put those 2 trains together and run a 200-car trains to 100-car trains, the efficiencies associated with less locomotive intensity, crew intensity, fuel intensity, et cetera, would be allocated toward productivity."

Our job is to really become less resource intensive, so between train length and sort of density of the train as well as the density of the route that we route the train has also allowed us significant savings across the board. So I think there's really no one thing. I think that we've accelerated that would really answer your question, but we are able -- as we're able to put initiatives in place, we are doing so and continually looking for more.

In the meantime, what we're trying to do is work on terminal productivity. We have a variety of initiatives in place there that has yielded a lot of results here. We continue to work on train lengths in our intermodal space to make sure, just as we do elsewhere in our business, to allow for the leverage that occurs there. Of course, double-stack clearance is as important. And you know where we are with the Virginia Avenue tunnel. By the end of this year, we should be able to be double-stack clear there as well. And then the hub-and-spoke strategy that we've lined out for all of you for a long time has allowed for a significant amount of efficiency being able to penetrate some of these smaller markets with a lot more density that we otherwise could.

So also that's a great example on a previous question around that. Things change very fast in terms of how much we move. And we did see a pickup on the export side in the second quarter beyond what we had originally anticipated, which is why we increased the guidance on the export side to about 20 million tons for the year. On the domestic side, really, the cost that we've received is really coming here over the last, I would say, 3 to 4 weeks, and so we really haven't had a chance to move a lot of that yet, but we do expect a little bit of a sequential uptick on the domestic coal, which is embedded in the guidance as we expect export coal to be weaker in the second half. We expect the domestic coal to be slightly stronger within that $22 million to $23 million -- 22 million to 23 million tons for the quarter."

And part of what has helped that has been that the countervailing tariffs and so forth has been very helpful to stem the flow of imports into the United States.

Yesterday, CSX reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.47 compared to $0.56 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 12% in the quarter as strong pricing across nearly all markets was more than offset by the impact of a 9% volume decline, which included a 34% decline in coal as well as negative mix and lower fuel recovery.
Regarding operating performance, CSX continued to deliver strong safety performance, and service continued to meet and exceed customer expectations and drive further efficiency. 
In the quarter, CSX continued to aggressively and successfully reduce its cost structure throughout the network, recognizing that this company's long-term future is built on a fluid and efficient network, serving primarily intermodal and merchandise markets. Despite these cost-saving actions, operating income declined $177 million to $840 million. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 210 basis points year-over-year to 68.9%.

Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decrease",1311,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 9%, which impacted revenue by about $260 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $98 million. We continue to see strong core pricing from an improving service product, which, for the second quarter, was up 2.9% overall and 4.0% excluding coal. However, this was partially offset by negative business mix in the quarter. 
Other revenue decreased $29 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges and coal-related revenue from affiliate railroads. Expenses decreased 9% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $96 million in efficiency gains, $86 million in lower volume-related costs and $56 million in lower fuel prices. 
Operating income was $840 million in the second quarter, down 17% from last year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. 
And finally, income taxes were $262 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. 
Overall, net earnings were $445 million, down 20% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.47 per share, down 16% versus last year.
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect year-over-year volumes to decline in the third quarter in the mid- to high-single-digit range. Despite some markets growing, the majority of our markets will be down, with the most significant declines continuing to be concentrated in coal and crude oil. Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remains higher on a year-over-year basis. Minerals volume will be higher with the continued ramp up of new fly ash remediation business and ongoing strength in construction, which drives demand for aggregates. 
Agricultural products are expected to decline as the strong dollar and low commodity prices continue to pressure both domestic and export shipments. Chemicals will be down due to the continued declines in shale-related products resulting from low crude oil and natural gas prices. We expect crude oil volume to be moderately lower on a sequential basis. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by an excess supply of natural gas at a price point that favors gas burn over coal in the east. In addition, coal inventories remain hot and year-over-year volume declines will continue to be significant, although less severe than the second quarter due to softer comps in the back half of 2015. 
Export coal should be moderately lower in the second half of the year from the first half tonnage run rate, consistent with the seasonality we have seen in recent years. Despite modest improvements in the met and thermal benchmarks, the export market will remain pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. That said; we saw more spot moves than anticipated in the second quarter. As such, we now expect full year export coal tonnage of around 20 million tons.
For the total coal market, we continue to expect full year tonnage declines of around 25%, with third quarter coal tonnage roughly stable sequentially to what we have seen in the first half of this year or approximately 22 million to 23 million tons in the quarter. 
Intermodal is expected to be down as we continue to cycle prior competitive losses in international through the remainder of 2016. Domestic intermodal is anticipated to be roughly flat in light of difficult comps that reflected new business shifting to CSX in the third quarter of last year. 
Overall, our business continues to reflect a market environment driven by low crude oil, natural gas and broader commodity prices, as well as continued strength in the U.S. dollar.
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the third quarter. Since last year, we have taken aggressive cost actions, which includes reducing headcount by about 4,500 versus the prior year. As a result, we have achieved about $230 million of efficiency gains in the first half of 2016 and now expect full year productivity savings to approach $350 million. We expect third quarter expense to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources.
Looking first at labor and fringe. We expect third quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. In addition, we expect labor inflation to be around $30 million in the third quarter. Finally, we expect a headwind in the third quarter of $25 million to $30 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015, we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as market conditions drove CSX's financial results below our initial plan.
Looking at MS&O expense. We expect efficiency gains and volume-related savings to more than offset inflation. As a result, MS&O costs are expected to be down moderately versus the prior year. Fuel expense in the third quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon year-over-year, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the third quarter to increase around $20 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business.
Finally, equipment and other rents in the third quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth.
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX's second quarter results reflect success in a challenging freight environment with macroeconomic and coal headwinds impacting most markets, resulting in a 9% volume decline this quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset those substantial volume headwinds.
Looking ahead, let me first provide an update on our 2016 capital investment. Projected capital investment has increased $300 million from our initial plan as CSX now anticipates accelerating payments for locomotives delivered throughout 2016 under a long-term commitment. We originally intended to pay for these locomotives in 2017. As such, 2016 capital investment is now expected to be $2.7 billion. By completing our locomotive purchase commitment this year, we simultaneously clear the path in 2017 for CSX to begin returning to our long-term core capital investment guidance of around 16% to 17% of revenue.
As we think about market conditions for the remainder of the year, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue. Low commodity prices and strength in the U.S. dollar will continue to impact many of CSX's merchandise markets, while natural gas prices below $3.50 and elevated stockpiles are driving significant headwinds in coal. As a result, we continue to expect total coal tonnage to decline around 25% for the full year.
Looking at our expectations for the third quarter and full year. We remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service products, rightsizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect efficiency gains to approach $350 million in 2016. 
With that said, the impact of current market conditions on CSX's volume, particularly in coal, is expected to outweigh our positive momentum. As a result, we continue to expect third quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. Furthermore, as a reminder, third quarter EPS is typically down sequentially from second quarter results, reflecting the seasonality of our business. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As Frank discussed, it's clear this continues to be a challenging freight environment with plenty of macroeconomic headwinds. Thanks to the extraordinary work of our employees, CSX is delivering record levels of efficiency and rightsizing resources to the business demand of today. 
Looking longer term, the company has a bright future as the men and women of CSX are simultaneously positioning the company for growth, where we have the resource flexibility to serve future demand. This will position CSX to maximize long-term opportunities in both our merchandise and intermodal markets. As a result, we continue to be enthusiastic about the core earning power of the company as the market headwinds subside.
As we work to transform this company into the CSX of tomorrow, we must grow and make more profitable the merchandise and intermodal markets which represent our future. At the same time, we will continue to preserve the business value of coal, recognizing that it will become a smaller but still important part of our company. 
Our future involves leveraging a premier, highly efficient network that reaches diverse merchandise in intermodal markets and nearly 2/3 of the American consumers. It requires consistent excellent service for customers, which, in turn, supports efficiency, profitable growth and pricing that allows us to continue investing for the future and includes technology solutions that drive an ever more safe, reliable and efficient railroad.

We got the challenging market environment that I know Fredrik will get into later in the call impacting the top line. There are comps that begin to ease as we get into the back half of the year. Although as we've mentioned, volumes in the third quarter will be down mid- to high-single digits, with crude down, international intermodal losses in the coal, as we mentioned, on a year-over-year basis, down as well. So we've got some negative mix. And then moderating productivity as we get throughout the year; obviously, we have delivered about $230 million in productivity in the first half, and that implies a certainly moderating productivity level as you get into the Q3 and Q4. And then we tried to give you some clarity in the third quarter remarks about where incentive comp might be. And certainly, with fuel prices where they're going and cycling some of the fuel positives that we had in the third quarter of last year, we're going to have a net fuel headwind as well. So we've got some challenges looking ahead of us in the third quarter. But as I'm sure Cindy will mention later in the call, everything's on the table on the productivity side, and pricing continues to be favorable, given the environment."

What we do in terms of tracking productivity, we make sure that we normalize for volume first. So to the extent that there are volume-variable expenses, then those don't count toward productivity. And what you've seen this year is that in the first half were about $150 million of what we call rightsizing or volume-variable cost reductions, and then $230 million of structural cost efficiencies. There is a lot of accountability around productivity, and again, that is the way that we take costs out long term. Let me give you just a simplistic example that may help illustrate it. If -- so let's use coal just because coal volumes have come down. So if a coal train ran last year but doesn't run this year, then the cost associated with locomotives and crudes and fuel and car costs would come out of volume-variable expenses, and so you'd hear us talk about those in terms of rightsizing. If, for example, and we have instances of this where you have 2 coal trains that ran last year and this year through the train length initiative and that we're routing, we've actually put those 2 trains together and run a 200-car trains to 2 100-car trains, the efficiencies associated with less locomotive intensity, crew intensity, fuel intensity, et cetera, would be allocated toward productivity."

And when volumes inflect positively, obviously, we'll be able to grow with that both on the earnings and the margin side. And to the extent the growth comes in the batch merchandise business or the intermodal business or the automotive business, you should see us grow with hopefully incremental margins. So I think what you're seeing is the company focused on cost given the environment."

With the closure of facilities late last year in the coal network and moving forward into this year where we also closed Russell yard and also consolidated our Huntington Division headquarters. But it's not just in the coal space. We've also announced publicly and you've probably read it where we've consolidated facilities in Central Florida with Winston Yard in Tampa, consolidation actually in Tampa and also streamlining sort of our mechanical facilities and shops that are aligned more with our outer triangle and the core network that we have. Our job is to really become less resource intensive, so between train length and -- so the density of the train, as well as the density of the route that we route the train has also allowed us significant savings across the board. So I think there's really no one thing. I think that we've accelerated it that would really answer your question, but we are able -- as we're able to put initiatives in place, we are doing so and continually looking for more.

And it occurs to me that some of the initiatives to achieve that goal come from the marketing side. And I was wondering if Fredrik could talk about some of the initiatives that perhaps sales and marketing has underway within intermodal to sort of normalize the volume so that you're running full trains every day of the week, every week of the year, that that's an obviously very difficult mountain to climb, but can you talk a little bit about what you're doing there, perhaps in working with third parties to fill all the trains up every day to really leverage that productivity?"

And some of them are, I think, at this point ready for public consumption, some of them are not. But overall, you're absolutely right. In the environment where the RPU is so much lower, one of the key things that you can do to drive up margins is to make sure that you have a much more leveled workload, and the team is certainly working on that and thinking through how we can do that longer term. That is a pretty significant structural change. In the meantime, what we're trying to do is work on terminal productivity. We have a variety of initiatives in place there that has yielded a lot of results here. We continue to work on train lengths in our intermodal space to make sure -- just as we do elsewhere in our business, to allow for the leverage that occurs there. Of course, double-stack clearances are important and you know where we are with the Virginia Avenue tunnel. By the end of this year, we should be able to be double-stack clear there as well. And then the hub-and-spoke strategy that we've lined out for all of you for a long time has allowed for a significant amount of efficiency being able to penetrate some of these smaller markets with a lot more density than we otherwise could. And of course, overall speed of the network itself, which I alluded to before, which has been a priority as we think about the service improvements here in 2016, because the turn time on the equipment is critical. And then to your point, and this is a little bit, a little more longer term, how do you structurally ensure that the day of the week balancing is a little bit better than what it is today.

And part of what has helped that has been that the countervailing tariffs and so forth has been very helpful to stem the flow of imports into the United States.

We have 1 mill that we both have inbound and outbound too that has closed down. That was really big driver for our volume decline. And we also are seeing the impact in a metal side from a little bit more truck competition that we've seen before. And so as we think about the second half, I think it's a little too early.

Yesterday, CSX reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.47 compared to $0.56 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 12% in the quarter as strong pricing across nearly all markets was more than offset by the impact of a 9% volume decline, which included a 34% decline in coal as well as negative mix and lower fuel recovery.
Regarding operating performance, CSX continued to deliver strong safety performance, and service continued to meet and exceed customer expectations and drive further efficiency. 
In the quarter, CSX continued to aggressively and successfully reduce its cost structure throughout the network, recognizing that this company's long-term future is built on a fluid and efficient network, serving primarily intermodal and merchandise markets. Despite these cost-saving actions, operating income declined $177 million to $840 million. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 210 basis points year-over-year to 68.9%.

Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decrease",1311,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 9%, which impacted revenue by about $260 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $98 million. We continue to see strong core pricing from an improving service product, which, for the second quarter, was up 2.9% overall and 4.0% excluding coal. However, this was partially offset by negative business mix in the quarter. 
Other revenue decreased $29 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges and coal-related revenue from affiliate railroads. Expenses decreased 9% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $96 million in efficiency gains, $86 million in lower volume-related costs and $56 million in lower fuel prices. 
Operating income was $840 million in the second quarter, down 17% from last year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. 
And finally, income taxes were $262 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. 
Overall, net earnings were $445 million, down 20% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.47 per share, down 16% versus last year.
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect year-over-year volumes to decline in the third quarter in the mid- to high-single-digit range. Despite some markets growing, the majority of our markets will be down, with the most significant declines continuing to be concentrated in coal and crude oil. Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remains higher on a year-over-year basis. Minerals volume will be higher with the continued ramp up of new fly ash remediation business and ongoing strength in construction, which drives demand for aggregates. 
Agricultural products are expected to decline as the strong dollar and low commodity prices continue to pressure both domestic and export shipments. Chemicals will be down due to the continued declines in shale-related products resulting from low crude oil and natural gas prices. We expect crude oil volume to be moderately lower on a sequential basis. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by an excess supply of natural gas at a price point that favors gas burn over coal in the east. In addition, coal inventories remain hot and year-over-year volume declines will continue to be significant, although less severe than the second quarter due to softer comps in the back half of 2015. 
Export coal should be moderately lower in the second half of the year from the first half tonnage run rate, consistent with the seasonality we have seen in recent years. Despite modest improvements in the met and thermal benchmarks, the export market will remain pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. That said; we saw more spot moves than anticipated in the second quarter. As such, we now expect full year export coal tonnage of around 20 million tons.
For the total coal market, we continue to expect full year tonnage declines of around 25%, with third quarter coal tonnage roughly stable sequentially to what we have seen in the first half of this year or approximately 22 million to 23 million tons in the quarter. 
Intermodal is expected to be down as we continue to cycle prior competitive losses in international through the remainder of 2016. Domestic intermodal is anticipated to be roughly flat in light of difficult comps that reflected new business shifting to CSX in the third quarter of last year. 
Overall, our business continues to reflect a market environment driven by low crude oil, natural gas and broader commodity prices, as well as continued strength in the U.S. dollar.
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the third quarter. Since last year, we have taken aggressive cost actions, which includes reducing headcount by about 4,500 versus the prior year. As a result, we have achieved about $230 million of efficiency gains in the first half of 2016 and now expect full year productivity savings to approach $350 million. We expect third quarter expense to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources.
Looking first at labor and fringe. We expect third quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. In addition, we expect labor inflation to be around $30 million in the third quarter. Finally, we expect a headwind in the third quarter of $25 million to $30 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015, we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as market conditions drove CSX's financial results below our initial plan.
Looking at MS&O expense. We expect efficiency gains and volume-related savings to more than offset inflation. As a result, MS&O costs are expected to be down moderately versus the prior year. Fuel expense in the third quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon year-over-year, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the third quarter to increase around $20 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business.
Finally, equipment and other rents in the third quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth.
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX's second quarter results reflect success in a challenging freight environment with macroeconomic and coal headwinds impacting most markets, resulting in a 9% volume decline this quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset those substantial volume headwinds.
Looking ahead, let me first provide an update on our 2016 capital investment. Projected capital investment has increased $300 million from our initial plan as CSX now anticipates accelerating payments for locomotives delivered throughout 2016 under a long-term commitment. We originally intended to pay for these locomotives in 2017. As such, 2016 capital investment is now expected to be $2.7 billion. By completing our locomotive purchase commitment this year, we simultaneously clear the path in 2017 for CSX to begin returning to our long-term core capital investment guidance of around 16% to 17% of revenue.
As we think about market conditions for the remainder of the year, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue. Low commodity prices and strength in the U.S. dollar will continue to impact many of CSX's merchandise markets, while natural gas prices below $3.50 and elevated stockpiles are driving significant headwinds in coal. As a result, we continue to expect total coal tonnage to decline around 25% for the full year.
Looking at our expectations for the third quarter and full year. We remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service products, rightsizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect efficiency gains to approach $350 million in 2016. 
With that said, the impact of current market conditions on CSX's volume, particularly in coal, is expected to outweigh our positive momentum. As a result, we continue to expect third quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. Furthermore, as a reminder, third quarter EPS is typically down sequentially from second quarter results, reflecting the seasonality of our business. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As Frank discussed, it's clear this continues to be a challenging freight environment with plenty of macroeconomic headwinds. Thanks to the extraordinary work of our employees, CSX is delivering record levels of efficiency and rightsizing resources to the business demand of today. 
Looking longer term, the company has a bright future as the men and women of CSX are simultaneously positioning the company for growth, where we have the resource flexibility to serve future demand. This will position CSX to maximize long-term opportunities in both our merchandise and intermodal markets. As a result, we continue to be enthusiastic about the core earning power of the company as the market headwinds subside.
As we work to transform this company into the CSX of tomorrow, we must grow and make more profitable the merchandise and intermodal markets which represent our future. At the same time, we will continue to preserve the business value of coal, recognizing that it will become a smaller but still important part of our company. 
Our future involves leveraging a premier, highly efficient network that reaches diverse merchandise and intermodal markets and nearly 2/3 of the American consumers. It requires consistent excellent service for customers, which, in turn, supports efficiency, profitable growth and pricing that allows us to continue investing for the future and includes technology solutions that drive an ever more safe, reliable and efficient railroad.

So we've got some negative mix.

And then we tried to give you some clarity in the third quarter remarks about where incentive comp might be.

And I think a big part of what is going to help us to do that is our CSX of Tomorrow initiatives, around the network of tomorrow, as well as automation and technology is going to allow us to continue to drive productivity. And I would also want to mention that the actions that we are taking are not reactions; they are actual actions that are driving our decision-making relative to our coal portfolio getting much smaller and the importance of providing a safe and reliable service product in the merchandise and intermodal portions of our business. And that this part of our core CSX of Tomorrow strategy, and we're executing on that.

There is a lot of accountability around productivity, and again, that is the way that we take costs out long term. Let me give you just a simplistic example that may help illustrate it. If -- so let's use coal just because coal volumes have come down. So if a coal train ran last year but doesn't run this year, then the cost associated with locomotives and crudes and fuel and car costs would come out of volume-variable expenses, and so you'd hear us talk about those in terms of rightsizing. If, for example, and we have instances of this where you have 2 coal trains that ran last year and this year through the train length initiative and that we're routing, we've actually put those 2 trains together and run a 200-car trains to 2 100-car trains, the efficiencies associated with less locomotive intensity, crew intensity, fuel intensity, et cetera, would be allocated toward productivity."

With the closure of facilities late last year in the coal network and moving forward into this year where we also closed Russell yard and also consolidated our Huntington Division headquarters. But it's not just in the coal space. We've also announced publicly and you've probably read it where we've consolidated facilities in Central Florida with Winston Yard in Tampa, consolidation actually in Tampa and also streamlining sort of our mechanical facilities and shops that are aligned more with our outer triangle and the core network that we have. Our job is to really become less resource intensive, so between train length and -- so the density of the train, as well as the density of the route that we route the train has also allowed us significant savings across the board. So I think there's really no one thing. I think that we've accelerated it that would really answer your question, but we are able -- as we're able to put initiatives in place, we are doing so and continually looking for more. We have great momentum here. Everyone is overdelivering. And I think technology's a big help for us. And also, some of our -- working with our labor organization is also a big help for us."

And then maybe as a follow-on, I understand that there's a fairly big initiative internally, given that intermodal is going to be a bigger part of the puzzle going forward, to make intermodal more consistently profitable going forward. And it occurs to me that some of the initiatives to achieve that goal come from the marketing side. And I was wondering if Fredrik could talk about some of the initiatives that perhaps sales and marketing has underway within intermodal to sort of normalize the volume so that you're running full trains every day of the week, every week of the year, that that's an obviously very difficult mountain to climb, but can you talk a little bit about what you're doing there, perhaps in working with third parties to fill all the trains up every day to really leverage that productivity?"

And some of them are, I think, at this point ready for public consumption, some of them are not. But overall, you're absolutely right. In the environment where the RPU is so much lower, one of the key things that you can do to drive up margins is to make sure that you have a much more leveled workload, and the team is certainly working on that and thinking through how we can do that longer term. That is a pretty significant structural change. In the meantime, what we're trying to do is work on terminal productivity. We have a variety of initiatives in place there that has yielded a lot of results here. We continue to work on train lengths in our intermodal space to make sure -- just as we do elsewhere in our business, to allow for the leverage that occurs there. Of course, double-stack clearances are important and you know where we are with the Virginia Avenue tunnel. By the end of this year, we should be able to be double-stack clear there as well. And then the hub-and-spoke strategy that we've lined out for all of you for a long time has allowed for a significant amount of efficiency being able to penetrate some of these smaller markets with a lot more density than we otherwise could. And of course, overall speed of the network itself, which I alluded to before, which has been a priority as we think about the service improvements here in 2016, because the turn time on the equipment is critical. And then to your point, and this is a little bit, a little more longer term, how do you structurally ensure that the day of the week balancing is a little bit better than what it is today.

And there is excess capacity in the truck market, and that is probably impacting our volume to some degree, but one of the key things for us is to continue to be able to reinvest in our business, and not necessarily chase that down too much when we see these temporary changes because we do have to be able to be there for our customers day in and day out. And that's one of the things that we sell with our customers, that we're going to work through the downturn that we're seeing right now, and we want to be able to be there for you, not just today, but also tomorrow when capacity is tighter. So we are seeing in certain of the markets beyond intermodal where there has been probably some share loss to truck. We look at that each and every deal as the marketplace, and we always try to estimate what the second-best alternative is and try to match that. And in certain places where that is, is below what we think is long-term reinvestable for us, and, at that point, we probably don't participate because we don’t want to do anything artificially. It's -- the pricing lever is critical. With the service improvements that we've gotten here, we've been able to sustain and allow customers to see the long-term value that access to our network provides, but in certain places, we have seen some traffic go way back to truck."

I don't think that, that will be material in any way, shape or form to our same-store sales measure. And as I said, it really is more about ensuring that as we try to rationalize the infrastructure in the coal fields, that we, from a sales and marketing perspective, help operations to do that by truly reflecting what it costs to move some coal from certain of the mines that are further away from some of our core routes. That's really all it's about. It's not so much about the same-store sales changing because of it, even though I think, overall, I would say, probably it's slightly helpful."

And part of what has helped that has been that the countervailing tariffs and so forth has been very helpful to stem the flow of imports into the United States.

We have 1 mill that we both have inbound and outbound too that has closed down. That was really big driver for our volume decline. And we also are seeing the impact in a metal side from a little bit more truck competition that we've seen before. And so as we think about the second half, I think it's a little too early.

Yesterday, CSX reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.47 compared to $0.56 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 12% in the quarter as strong pricing across nearly all markets was more than offset by the impact of a 9% volume decline, which included a 34% decline in coal as well as negative mix and lower fuel recovery.
Regarding operating performance, CSX continued to deliver strong safety performance, and service continued to meet and exceed customer expectations and drive further efficiency. 
In the quarter, CSX continued to aggressively and successfully reduce its cost structure throughout the network, recognizing that this company's long-term future is built on a fluid and efficient network, serving primarily intermodal and merchandise markets. Despite these cost-saving actions, operating income declined $177 million to $840 million. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 210 basis points year-over-year to 68.9%.

Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decrease",1311,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 9%, which impacted revenue by about $260 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $98 million. We continue to see strong core pricing from an improving service product, which, for the second quarter, was up 2.9% overall and 4.0% excluding coal. However, this was partially offset by negative business mix in the quarter. 
Other revenue decreased $29 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges and coal-related revenue from affiliate railroads. Expenses decreased 9% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $96 million in efficiency gains, $86 million in lower volume-related costs and $56 million in lower fuel prices. 
Operating income was $840 million in the second quarter, down 17% from last year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. 
And finally, income taxes were $262 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. 
Overall, net earnings were $445 million, down 20% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.47 per share, down 16% versus last year.
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect year-over-year volumes to decline in the third quarter in the mid- to high-single-digit range. Despite some markets growing, the majority of our markets will be down, with the most significant declines continuing to be concentrated in coal and crude oil. Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remains higher on a year-over-year basis. Minerals volume will be higher with the continued ramp up of new fly ash remediation business and ongoing strength in construction, which drives demand for aggregates. 
Agricultural products are expected to decline as the strong dollar and low commodity prices continue to pressure both domestic and export shipments. Chemicals will be down due to the continued declines in shale-related products resulting from low crude oil and natural gas prices. We expect crude oil volume to be moderately lower on a sequential basis. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by an excess supply of natural gas at a price point that favors gas burn over coal in the east. In addition, coal inventories remain hot and year-over-year volume declines will continue to be significant, although less severe than the second quarter due to softer comps in the back half of 2015. 
Export coal should be moderately lower in the second half of the year from the first half tonnage run rate, consistent with the seasonality we have seen in recent years. Despite modest improvements in the met and thermal benchmarks, the export market will remain pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. That said; we saw more spot moves than anticipated in the second quarter. As such, we now expect full year export coal tonnage of around 20 million tons.
For the total coal market, we continue to expect full year tonnage declines of around 25%, with third quarter coal tonnage roughly stable sequentially to what we have seen in the first half of this year or approximately 22 million to 23 million tons in the quarter. 
Intermodal is expected to be down as we continue to cycle prior competitive losses in international through the remainder of 2016. Domestic intermodal is anticipated to be roughly flat in light of difficult comps that reflected new business shifting to CSX in the third quarter of last year. 
Overall, our business continues to reflect a market environment driven by low crude oil, natural gas and broader commodity prices, as well as continued strength in the U.S. dollar.
Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the third quarter. Since last year, we have taken aggressive cost actions, which includes reducing headcount by about 4,500 versus the prior year. As a result, we have achieved about $230 million of efficiency gains in the first half of 2016 and now expect full year productivity savings to approach $350 million. We expect third quarter expense to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources.
Looking first at labor and fringe. We expect third quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. In addition, we expect labor inflation to be around $30 million in the third quarter. Finally, we expect a headwind in the third quarter of $25 million to $30 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015, we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as market conditions drove CSX's financial results below our initial plan.
Looking at MS&O expense. We expect efficiency gains and volume-related savings to more than offset inflation. As a result, MS&O costs are expected to be down moderately versus the prior year. Fuel expense in the third quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon year-over-year, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the third quarter to increase around $20 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business.
Finally, equipment and other rents in the third quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth.
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX's second quarter results reflect success in a challenging freight environment with macroeconomic and coal headwinds impacting most markets, resulting in a 9% volume decline this quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset those substantial volume headwinds.
Looking ahead, let me first provide an update on our 2016 capital investment. Projected capital investment has increased $300 million from our initial plan as CSX now anticipates accelerating payments for locomotives delivered throughout 2016 under a long-term commitment. We originally intended to pay for these locomotives in 2017. As such, 2016 capital investment is now expected to be $2.7 billion. By completing our locomotive purchase commitment this year, we simultaneously clear the path in 2017 for CSX to begin returning to our long-term core capital investment guidance of around 16% to 17% of revenue.
As we think about market conditions for the remainder of the year, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue. Low commodity prices and strength in the U.S. dollar will continue to impact many of CSX's merchandise markets, while natural gas prices below $3.50 and elevated stockpiles are driving significant headwinds in coal. As a result, we continue to expect total coal tonnage to decline around 25% for the full year.
Looking at our expectations for the third quarter and full year. We remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX's service products, rightsizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect efficiency gains to approach $350 million in 2016. 
With that said, the impact of current market conditions on CSX's volume, particularly in coal, is expected to outweigh our positive momentum. As a result, we continue to expect third quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. Furthermore, as a reminder, third quarter EPS is typically down sequentially from second quarter results, reflecting the seasonality of our business. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As Frank discussed, it's clear this continues to be a challenging freight environment with plenty of macroeconomic headwinds. Thanks to the extraordinary work of our employees, CSX is delivering record levels of efficiency and rightsizing resources to the business demand of today. 
Looking longer term, the company has a bright future as the men and women of CSX are simultaneously positioning the company for growth, where we have the resource flexibility to serve future demand. This will position CSX to maximize long-term opportunities in both our merchandise and intermodal markets. As a result, we continue to be enthusiastic about the core earning power of the company as the market headwinds subside.
As we work to transform this company into the CSX of tomorrow, we must grow and make more profitable the merchandise and intermodal markets which represent our future. At the same time, we will continue to preserve the business value of coal, recognizing that it will become a smaller but still important part of our company. 
Our future involves leveraging a premier, highly efficient network that reaches diverse merchandise and intermodal markets and nearly 2/3 of the American consumers. It requires consistent excellent service for customers, which, in turn, supports efficiency, profitable growth and pricing that allows us to continue investing for the future and includes technology solutions that drive an ever more safe, reliable and efficient railroad.

So we've got some negative mix.

And then we tried to give you some clarity in the third quarter remarks about where incentive comp might be.

When we look at what we've done so far, clearly, we've had -- we're lapping some of the big initiatives that we took late in 2015 and earlier this year. But we see we have a very long initiative base. We've pulled some of those forward. But I think when we look out into the future, I think we'll continue to drive results, both in the back half of the year, as Fredrik has -- I mean, as Frank has talked about, it'll be a little bit less in terms of quarterly numbers, but it's going to be better than what we traditionally do on a quarterly basis. And as I look into 2017, I think we'll be able to overcome inflation. And I think a big part of what is going to help us to do that is our CSX of Tomorrow initiatives, around the network of tomorrow, as well as automation and technology is going to allow us to continue to drive productivity. And I would also want to mention that the actions that we are taking are not reactions; they are actual actions that are driving our decision-making relative to our coal portfolio getting much smaller and the importance of providing a safe and reliable service product in the merchandise and intermodal portions of our business. And that this part of our core CSX of Tomorrow strategy, and we're executing on that. It will help us to be both service-sensitive -- more service-sensitive company, as well as a more efficient company."

You'll continue to see us focus hard on core capital and making sure that we're making the right decisions in terms of infrastructure, equipment and return-seeking investments. As you think about PTC going into 2017, that number should decline some. From the levels that you see here in 2016, it should step down a little bit, and then again, between '17 and '18, as we set our sights toward being compliant with the FRA's and Congress's mandate that we be hardware-complete by the end of 2018.

There is a lot of accountability around productivity, and again, that is the way that we take costs out long term. Let me give you just a simplistic example that may help illustrate it. If -- so let's use coal just because coal volumes have come down. So if a coal train ran last year but doesn't run this year, then the cost associated with locomotives and crudes and fuel and car costs would come out of volume-variable expenses, and so you'd hear us talk about those in terms of rightsizing. If, for example, and we have instances of this where you have 2 coal trains that ran last year and this year through the train length initiative and that we're routing, we've actually put those 2 trains together and run a 200-car trains to 2 100-car trains, the efficiencies associated with less locomotive intensity, crew intensity, fuel intensity, et cetera, would be allocated toward productivity."

I think that we've accelerated it that would really answer your question, but we are able -- as we're able to put initiatives in place, we are doing so and continually looking for more. We have great momentum here. Everyone is overdelivering. And I think technology's a big help for us. And also, some of our -- working with our labor organization is also a big help for us."

And then maybe as a follow-on, I understand that there's a fairly big initiative internally, given that intermodal is going to be a bigger part of the puzzle going forward, to make intermodal more consistently profitable going forward. And it occurs to me that some of the initiatives to achieve that goal come from the marketing side. And I was wondering if Fredrik could talk about some of the initiatives that perhaps sales and marketing has underway within intermodal to sort of normalize the volume so that you're running full trains every day of the week, every week of the year, that that's an obviously very difficult mountain to climb, but can you talk a little bit about what you're doing there, perhaps in working with third parties to fill all the trains up every day to really leverage that productivity?"

And some of them are, I think, at this point ready for public consumption, some of them are not. But overall, you're absolutely right. In the environment where the RPU is so much lower, one of the key things that you can do to drive up margins is to make sure that you have a much more leveled workload, and the team is certainly working on that and thinking through how we can do that longer term. That is a pretty significant structural change. In the meantime, what we're trying to do is work on terminal productivity. We have a variety of initiatives in place there that has yielded a lot of results here. We continue to work on train lengths in our intermodal space to make sure -- just as we do elsewhere in our business, to allow for the leverage that occurs there. Of course, double-stack clearances are important and you know where we are with the Virginia Avenue tunnel. By the end of this year, we should be able to be double-stack clear there as well. And then the hub-and-spoke strategy that we've lined out for all of you for a long time has allowed for a significant amount of efficiency being able to penetrate some of these smaller markets with a lot more density than we otherwise could. And of course, overall speed of the network itself, which I alluded to before, which has been a priority as we think about the service improvements here in 2016, because the turn time on the equipment is critical. And then to your point, and this is a little bit, a little more longer term, how do you structurally ensure that the day of the week balancing is a little bit better than what it is today. But that is, I think, a little bit longer-term initiative from our perspective."

And there is excess capacity in the truck market, and that is probably impacting our volume to some degree, but one of the key things for us is to continue to be able to reinvest in our business, and not necessarily chase that down too much when we see these temporary changes because we do have to be able to be there for our customers day in and day out. And that's one of the things that we sell with our customers, that we're going to work through the downturn that we're seeing right now, and we want to be able to be there for you, not just today, but also tomorrow when capacity is tighter. So we are seeing in certain of the markets beyond intermodal where there has been probably some share loss to truck. We look at that each and every deal as the marketplace, and we always try to estimate what the second-best alternative is and try to match that. And in certain places where that is, is below what we think is long-term reinvestable for us, and, at that point, we probably don't participate because we don’t want to do anything artificially. It's -- the pricing lever is critical. With the service improvements that we've gotten here, we've been able to sustain and allow customers to see the long-term value that access to our network provides, but in certain places, we have seen some traffic go way back to truck."

And as I said, it really is more about ensuring that as we try to rationalize the infrastructure in the coal fields, that we, from a sales and marketing perspective, help operations to do that by truly reflecting what it costs to move some coal from certain of the mines that are further away from some of our core routes. That's really all it's about. It's not so much about the same-store sales changing because of it, even though I think, overall, I would say, probably it's slightly helpful."

And part of what has helped that has been that the countervailing tariffs and so forth has been very helpful to stem the flow of imports into the United States. Our volumes are down a little bit more than that, and the reason for that is, on one hand, mill closures that has affected us specifically. We have 1 mill that we both have inbound and outbound too that has closed down. That was really big driver for our volume decline. And we also are seeing the impact in a metal side from a little bit more truck competition that we've seen before. And so as we think about the second half, I think it's a little too early. I think we're going to have some of the specific CSX-related issues. That is going to hurt us as we get into the second half of the year. So I think the second half will be pretty challenging still, and -- but the key thing for us is to continue to work with our customers on the steel side, provide a better service product and continue to make sure we can reinvest in the business, and that's where we're focusing on."

Yesterday, CSX reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.48 compared to $0.52 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 8% in the quarter, consistent with an overall volume decline of 8%, which included a 21% decline in coal volume. 
Turning to operations. Safety performance remained strong, and service levels continued to meet or exceed customer expectations, driving further network efficiency improvements. In addition, CSX further reduced structural costs in the quarter and aligned resources levels to lower volume while retaining the ability to flex those resources with demand. Continuing to match resources to demand, combined with our ongoing initiatives to support network fluidity, form the foundation to maximize future merchandise and intermodal growth opportunities. As significant cost savings partially offset the impact of lower volume and a changing business mix, operating income declined $92 million year-over-year to $841 million. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 69.0%. 
Before I hand the presentation over to Frank, let me thank our employees, customer and suppliers for their skillful planning and tireless efforts working together to manage the effects of Hurricane Matthew over the weekend and through this week.

As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 8% or $229 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 8%, which impacted revenue by about $220 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $63 million in the quarter but was offset by strong core pricing from an improved service product. Thanks to our sales, pricing for the third quarter was up 2.3% overall and 3.6% excluding coal. 
Other revenue decreased $9 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges versus the prior year.  Expenses decreased 7% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $112 million in efficiency gains and $53 million in lower volume-related costs. Operating income was $841 million in the third quarter, down 10% from last year. 
Looking below the line. Interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income increased $11 million. And finally, income taxes were $260 million in the quarter, with an effective tax rate of about 36%. Overall, net earnings were $455 million, down 10% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 8% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, you will notice that the outlook reflects our adjusted market alignments. As released in our third quarter earnings, we are now referring to our markets as shown on this slide, which is consistent with how we are managing the business. The previous food and consumer market is now part of agricultural and food products. Waste and the fly ash business have moved to chemicals, and the equipment business now resides in the renamed metals and equipment market. Reclass volume, revenue and RPU information for the last 3 years are available on our Investor Relations web page. 
In 2016, CSX' fiscal calendar includes a 53rd week, and as such, we will be reporting a 14-week fourth quarter. When talking -- excuse me, when taking the full quarter into account, with an extra week versus the same period last year, we expect volume to be roughly flat. However, on a 13-week comparable quarter basis, we continue to see a soft but stabilizing industrial economy with volume down year-over-year. In addition to the standard view we provide each quarter, which, on the slide, shows expectations for the 13-week comparable period, we have included a red, yellow, green designation to the far right, which shows the full quarter impact of the extra week on volume expectations. With that said, the market comments that follow reflect expectations on a 13-week comparable basis. 
Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remains strong and new business continues to ramp up. Agricultural and food products is expected to be neutral. The record grain harvest will drive year-over-year gains. However, market dynamics for ethanol remain challenged near term for CSX due to increased movements in storage in the Gulf region.  Export coal is also neutral as we are seeing some near-term increase in metallurgical demand, driven by reduced Chinese supplies, such that volume should be similar to last year's levels. We expect our full year export coal tonnage to be around 25 million tons. 
Chemicals will be down, with continued weakness in drilling-related products, especially crude oil, due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads. This impact more than offsets growth in core chemicals and the continued ramp-up of new fly ash business. 
Domestic coal will again be down. However, in the fourth quarter, we will cycle the start of the pronounced market weakness which took hold in the fourth quarter last year. While the excess supply of natural gas continues to provide a price point that favors gas burn over coal, the easier comparables will moderate the rate of decline we've seen over the last several quarters. We expect domestic coal tonnage to be relatively stable to what we saw in the third quarter. 
Intermodal will decline as we continue to cycle competitive losses in international in the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we previously reported, we will continue to cycle some short-haul traffic loss in the domestic market, which began in the third quarter. Absent this, we continue to experience strength in the domestic segment, driven by our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversion. Minerals will be down in the quarter as we cycle a strong period last year that benefited from an extended aggregate shipping season in the north due to mild weather late into the year. 
Overall, on a comparable 13-week basis, we expect volume to be down mid-single digits. Low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices as well as strength in the U.S. dollar continue to challenge the rail marketplace, although the impact of these factors is beginning to moderate as we move through a full year of this external climate. 
When we report earnings in the fourth quarter, our GAAP numbers will include the full 14 weeks of volume and revenue. Again, a preview of 14-week volume expectations is reflected to the far right of the slide, which, in total, represents about flat volume year-over-year. When we report next quarter, we will provide a breakout of volume and revenue for the final week of the fiscal year, which is a holiday week, to facilitate year-over-year comparisons. 
Turning to the next slide. Let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the fourth quarter. As a result of aggressive cost actions, we have achieved over $340 million of efficiency gains year-to-date and now expect full year productivity savings to be about $400 million. Looking at the fourth quarter, the drivers for each expense category are shown on a comparable 13-week basis versus the prior year. Separately, at the bottom of the slide, we have provided guidance for the incremental costs associated with the 53rd week this year. In addition, we will be cycling $48 million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter, which impacted labor and fringe by $37 million and MS&O by $11 million in the prior year. 
Looking first at labor and fringe, we expect fourth quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis, although not to the same level we saw in the third quarter. Labor inflation is expected to be around $30 million in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be more than offset by continued efficiency and volume-related cost savings. Similar to this quarter, we expect a headwind in the fourth quarter of about $40 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015, we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as sharp declines in the energy markets, coupled with broad-based commodity and dollar impacts, drove CSX' financial results well below our initial expectations. 
MS&O expense is expected to be relatively flat to the prior year, with continued efficiency gains offsetting inflation. We expect fuel expense to decline in the fourth quarter, with the higher cost per gallon year-over-year, reflecting the current forward curve, being more than offset by volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the fourth quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business, partially offset by the favorable impact of an equipment life study. 
Equipment and other rents in the fourth quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year, with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth. 
Finally, fourth quarter expense will also be impacted by the extra week. And when we report earnings in the fourth quarter, we will provide detail to help you better understand the impact of the 53rd week. 
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. With macroeconomic and energy headwinds impacting most markets, CSX, once again, delivered solid financial results in the third quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset an 8% volume decline this quarter. To mitigate the weak demand, we have taken significant cost actions this year, resulting in year-to-date efficiency savings of about $340 million and rightsizing savings of around $200 million. We continue to pursue structural cost opportunities across the network and now expect full year efficiency savings to be about $400 million. 
Looking at our expectations for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned previously, we expect volume to be relatively flat to last year, which includes the impact of the extra week. We remain intensely focused on pricing to the value of our service and expect our strong cost performance to continue into the fourth quarter. 
We will also be cycling an $80 million property gain from the prior year, which was below the line in other income, in addition to cycling the $48 million in restructuring costs. As a result, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share, on a reported basis, including the impact of the extra week, to be flat to slightly down versus the earnings we reported last year. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As you heard today, CSX is continuing to drive results for shareholders in this dynamic business climate by aggressively managing cost and delivering record efficiency savings. The men and women of CSX are working relentlessly to safely, efficiently and successfully serve our customers. 
As we continue to manage to the current macroeconomic and energy environment, we are simultaneously focused on positioning CSX to maximize opportunities going forward. The transformation into the CSX of Tomorrow requires growth and increased profitability in our merchandise and intermodal businesses while preserving the business value of coal as it becomes a smaller part of CSX going forward.  With that focus, we'll continue to drive earnings growth and margin expansion for our shareholders as we redeploy capital to further improve the network, support new technology solutions and automation and enhance merchandise and intermodal operations. 
With continued population growth as well as the challenges facing the trucking industry, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth prospects for domestic intermodal. In support of that vision, we continue our multiyear strategy to add network capabilities and new service offerings. This strategy supports improved profitability and the ability to serve ever more service-sensitive freight. As we look to the future, our core earnings power remains strong, and the CSX of Tomorrow will continue delivering compelling shareholder value as we further progress toward a target of a mid-60s operating ratio longer term.

Here's how I think about this year and going into the next year. So when we, as a company, started looking at how coal was becoming less and less of our product mix, our service product mix, we took a real hard look at how we needed to use our network differently to drive efficiencies, to drive margin expansion from a cost perspective. So a big -- a portion of what you have seen here this year is looking at structural changes in the coal fields, and we're lapping those this month actually, when we shut down Erwin and Corbin. And so those, we would not obviously repeat going into future years. But we also have looked at driving density both on our routes, on our core routes, and density on our trains in terms of train length. And while we are lapping some of the big steps that we were able to take with train length, we do see other opportunities for that. It does require investment, so the timing of it becomes contingent upon those investments being -- coming to fruition. And then there's a traditional track -- productivity that we look at and have over many, many years, and technology is a huge part of that. So we're streamlining, streamlining to align with our core network, our network of tomorrow. And so when I think about that type of technology or that type of productivity, I see next year looking a little bit more normalized in terms of run rate around offsetting inflation, around $150 million. But we don't put any upper limits on productivity. We are going to address and bringing everything we possibly can. And I think, particularly, the technology lever is an exciting one for us both in terms of mobility and utilizing machine vision and then other areas around predictive analytics to help us be more reliable with our assets. So I think you'll see us -- we pulled a lot forward into this year, which is part of what you're pulling on. I think we'll see a more normal year next year, but we are not leaving anything on the table."

As far as Hurricane Matthew, I think, both from a preparation and recovery, our employees have done an outstanding job managing through a storm that was highly impactful in terms of the amount of territory that was affected. And so as of this morning, we are open on our core route on I-95, albeit with the use of generators to provide power to our assets that require electricity, crossings and signaling systems with generators. And commercial power is still not back. We'll still be nursing those generators until we can get commercial power back. But opening that route is very, very important to us. It's part of our triangle of core operations. We do have yet still some branch lines that are out, so unable to serve those customers as of this point, but we see good equipment availability and energy around getting those routes restored as well. And I think our impacts are going to be -- some will be capital, some will be operating expense. And then within that operating expense, we'll see some cycle time impacts from the storm. But truthfully, I am extremely pleased with where we are considering where the hurricane affected us and how quickly we've been able to come back."

What we're looking forward to doing on a going-forward basis is to increase that allocation to more like 20% or 25% of the capital portfolio. So not looking to necessarily increase capital based on the strategy, we're really looking to reallocate to make sure that the focus on the things that are going to drive value in the future."

If it's something that's on the bulk side of the business, which is going to be a new train starts, the incremental margins are going to essentially be with the absolute margins are in that business, by and large.

We didn't see necessarily as much of that last year, but we're expecting that this year just given what we understand the winter to hold. There's a normal seasonal shift between the third quarter and the fourth quarter as we stop the construction season as it gets too cold and too icy to work up north so we do have that. And then there's normally on the technology side on the hardware and software contracts come due, so we have that just in terms of seasonality. And then we're usually a little less fuel efficient as we get into the fourth quarter, and we're going to pull on everything as you've seen us do already this year. But as we set up a more normal fourth quarter, that's how we see it going. The other thing to think through is a lot of the hurricane side expenses to the extent that hit the OpEx line are going to hit here. So we got a little bit of a piece in there. And then when you look at the productivity as we've targeted about $400 million, it implies about a $60 million run rate for the quarter, and that's a little less than what we had seen in the third quarter.

Revenue declined 8% in the quarter, consistent with an overall volume decline of 8%, which included a 21% decline in coal volume. 
Turning to operations. Safety performance remained strong, and service levels continued to meet or exceed customer expectations, driving further network efficiency improvements. In addition, CSX further reduced structural costs in the quarter and aligned resources levels to lower volume while retaining the ability to flex those resources with demand. Continuing to match resources to demand, combined with our ongoing initiatives to support network fluidity, form the foundation to maximize future merchandise and intermodal growth opportunities. As significant cost savings partially offset the impact of lower volume and a changing business mix, operating income declined $92 million year-over-year to $841 million. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 69.0%.

Total volume decreased",1557,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our third quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 8% or $229 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 8%, which impacted revenue by about $220 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $63 million in the quarter but was offset by strong core pricing from an improved service product. Thanks to our sales, pricing for the third quarter was up 2.3% overall and 3.6% excluding coal. 
Other revenue decreased $9 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges versus the prior year.  Expenses decreased 7% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $112 million in efficiency gains and $53 million in lower volume-related costs. Operating income was $841 million in the third quarter, down 10% from last year. 
Looking below the line. Interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income increased $11 million. And finally, income taxes were $260 million in the quarter, with an effective tax rate of about 36%. Overall, net earnings were $455 million, down 10% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 8% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, you will notice that the outlook reflects our adjusted market alignments. As released in our third quarter earnings, we are now referring to our markets as shown on this slide, which is consistent with how we are managing the business. The previous food and consumer market is now part of agricultural and food products. Waste and the fly ash business have moved to chemicals, and the equipment business now resides in the renamed metals and equipment market. Reclass volume, revenue and RPU information for the last 3 years are available on our Investor Relations web page. 
In 2016, CSX' fiscal calendar includes a 53rd week, and as such, we will be reporting a 14-week fourth quarter. When talking -- excuse me, when taking the full quarter into account, with an extra week versus the same period last year, we expect volume to be roughly flat. However, on a 13-week comparable quarter basis, we continue to see a soft but stabilizing industrial economy with volume down year-over-year. In addition to the standard view we provide each quarter, which, on the slide, shows expectations for the 13-week comparable period, we have included a red, yellow, green designation to the far right, which shows the full quarter impact of the extra week on volume expectations. With that said, the market comments that follow reflect expectations on a 13-week comparable basis. 
Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remains strong and new business continues to ramp up. Agricultural and food products is expected to be neutral. The record grain harvest will drive year-over-year gains. However, market dynamics for ethanol remain challenged near term for CSX due to increased movements in storage in the Gulf region.  Export coal is also neutral as we are seeing some near-term increase in metallurgical demand, driven by reduced Chinese supplies, such that volume should be similar to last year's levels. We expect our full year export coal tonnage to be around 25 million tons. 
Chemicals will be down, with continued weakness in drilling-related products, especially crude oil, due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads. This impact more than offsets growth in core chemicals and the continued ramp-up of new fly ash business. 
Domestic coal will again be down. However, in the fourth quarter, we will cycle the start of the pronounced market weakness which took hold in the fourth quarter last year. While the excess supply of natural gas continues to provide a price point that favors gas burn over coal, the easier comparables will moderate the rate of decline we've seen over the last several quarters. We expect domestic coal tonnage to be relatively stable to what we saw in the third quarter. 
Intermodal will decline as we continue to cycle competitive losses in international in the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we previously reported, we will continue to cycle some short-haul traffic loss in the domestic market, which began in the third quarter. Absent this, we continue to experience strength in the domestic segment, driven by our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversion. Minerals will be down in the quarter as we cycle a strong period last year that benefited from an extended aggregate shipping season in the north due to mild weather late into the year. 
Overall, on a comparable 13-week basis, we expect volume to be down mid-single digits. Low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices as well as strength in the U.S. dollar continue to challenge the rail marketplace, although the impact of these factors is beginning to moderate as we move through a full year of this external climate. 
When we report earnings in the fourth quarter, our GAAP numbers will include the full 14 weeks of volume and revenue. Again, a preview of 14-week volume expectations is reflected to the far right of the slide, which, in total, represents about flat volume year-over-year. When we report next quarter, we will provide a breakout of volume and revenue for the final week of the fiscal year, which is a holiday week, to facilitate year-over-year comparisons. 
Turning to the next slide. Let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the fourth quarter. As a result of aggressive cost actions, we have achieved over $340 million of efficiency gains year-to-date and now expect full year productivity savings to be about $400 million. Looking at the fourth quarter, the drivers for each expense category are shown on a comparable 13-week basis versus the prior year. Separately, at the bottom of the slide, we have provided guidance for the incremental costs associated with the 53rd week this year. In addition, we will be cycling $48 million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter, which impacted labor and fringe by $37 million and MS&O by $11 million in the prior year. 
Looking first at labor and fringe, we expect fourth quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis, although not to the same level we saw in the third quarter. Labor inflation is expected to be around $30 million in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be more than offset by continued efficiency and volume-related cost savings. Similar to this quarter, we expect a headwind in the fourth quarter of about $40 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015, we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as sharp declines in the energy markets, coupled with broad-based commodity and dollar impacts, drove CSX' financial results well below our initial expectations. 
MS&O expense is expected to be relatively flat to the prior year, with continued efficiency gains offsetting inflation. We expect fuel expense to decline in the fourth quarter, with the higher cost per gallon year-over-year, reflecting the current forward curve, being more than offset by volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the fourth quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business, partially offset by the favorable impact of an equipment life study. 
Equipment and other rents in the fourth quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year, with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth. 
Finally, fourth quarter expense will also be impacted by the extra week. And when we report earnings in the fourth quarter, we will provide detail to help you better understand the impact of the 53rd week. 
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. With macroeconomic and energy headwinds impacting most markets, CSX, once again, delivered solid financial results in the third quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset an 8% volume decline this quarter. To mitigate the weak demand, we have taken significant cost actions this year, resulting in year-to-date efficiency savings of about $340 million and rightsizing savings of around $200 million. We continue to pursue structural cost opportunities across the network and now expect full year efficiency savings to be about $400 million. 
Looking at our expectations for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned previously, we expect volume to be relatively flat to last year, which includes the impact of the extra week. We remain intensely focused on pricing to the value of our service and expect our strong cost performance to continue into the fourth quarter. 
We will also be cycling an $80 million property gain from the prior year, which was below the line in other income, in addition to cycling the $48 million in restructuring costs. As a result, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share, on a reported basis, including the impact of the extra week, to be flat to slightly down versus the earnings we reported last year. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As you heard today, CSX is continuing to drive results for shareholders in this dynamic business climate by aggressively managing cost and delivering record efficiency savings. The men and women of CSX are working relentlessly to safely, efficiently and successfully serve our customers. 
As we continue to manage to the current macroeconomic and energy environment, we are simultaneously focused on positioning CSX to maximize opportunities going forward. The transformation into the CSX of Tomorrow requires growth and increased profitability in our merchandise and intermodal businesses while preserving the business value of coal as it becomes a smaller part of CSX going forward.  With that focus, we'll continue to drive earnings growth and margin expansion for our shareholders as we redeploy capital to further improve the network, support new technology solutions and automation and enhance merchandise and intermodal operations. 
With continued population growth as well as the challenges facing the trucking industry, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth prospects for domestic intermodal. In support of that vision, we continue our multiyear strategy to add network capabilities and new service offerings. This strategy supports improved profitability and the ability to serve ever more service-sensitive freight. As we look to the future, our core earnings power remains strong, and the CSX of Tomorrow will continue delivering compelling shareholder value as we further progress toward a target of a mid-60s operating ratio longer term. 
And now we'll be pleased to take your questions."

Here's how I think about this year and going into the next year. So when we, as a company, started looking at how coal was becoming less and less of our product mix, our service product mix, we took a real hard look at how we needed to use our network differently to drive efficiencies, to drive margin expansion from a cost perspective. So a big -- a portion of what you have seen here this year is looking at structural changes in the coal fields, and we're lapping those this month actually, when we shut down Erwin and Corbin. And so those, we would not obviously repeat going into future years. But we also have looked at driving density both on our routes, on our core routes, and density on our trains in terms of train length. And while we are lapping some of the big steps that we were able to take with train length, we do see other opportunities for that. It does require investment, so the timing of it becomes contingent upon those investments being -- coming to fruition. And then there's a traditional track -- productivity that we look at and have over many, many years, and technology is a huge part of that. So we're streamlining, streamlining to align with our core network, our network of tomorrow. And so when I think about that type of technology or that type of productivity, I see next year looking a little bit more normalized in terms of run rate around offsetting inflation, around $150 million. But we don't put any upper limits on productivity. We are going to address and bringing everything we possibly can. And I think, particularly, the technology lever is an exciting one for us both in terms of mobility and utilizing machine vision and then other areas around predictive analytics to help us be more reliable with our assets. So I think you'll see us -- we pulled a lot forward into this year, which is part of what you're pulling on. I think we'll see a more normal year next year, but we are not leaving anything on the table."

And from a cost -- and the operating department has a huge lever we have to pull on the cost side to make that happen. So we're going to continue to look for those opportunities and drive it forward. And I will say -- add to that, that we also are going to serve our customers effectively to provide a very good service for them that allows Fredrik to grow the business and price the business."

So your $2.7 billion is -- again, we're trying to be very transparent with you in terms of the capital dollars that we're spending this year, although you do have some geography differences on the cash flow statement. In terms of 2017, when you think about where we are, we're looking very hard at infrastructure and equipment, given the environment that we're in and given the network of tomorrow strategy that we have. What we've been talking about is in a normalized, say, 5- or 10-year view in retrospect for CapEx, we generally spent somewhere between 12% and 15% of that capital portfolio on return-seeking investments. What we're looking forward to doing, on a going-forward basis, is to increase that allocation to more like 20% or 25% of the capital portfolio.

But as I alluded to in the answer to the earlier question, it really depends on how the business comes back. If it comes back in areas where you're adding a boxcar onto an existing train, an intermodal container onto an existing train, an auto rack onto an existing train, that's really where you're going to get the incremental margins and the operating leverage that you're referring to. If it's something that's on the bulk side of the business, which is going to be a new train start, the incremental margins are going to essentially be what the absolute margins are in that business, by and large.

There's a few things on the sequential side to think through. Given that we've got some incremental bulk business on the export side, the grain side and the automotive side, we've got additional engines and freight cars in the mix relative to third quarter, so clearly, that's going to impact MS&O line on the materials and supply side. We are expecting normal seasonality in terms of normal winter. We didn't see necessarily as much of that last year, but we're expecting that this year just given what we understand the winter to hold. There's a normal seasonal shift between the third quarter and the fourth quarter as we stop the construction season as it gets too cold and too icy to work up north, so we do have that. And then there's normally on the technology side as annual hardware, software maintenance contracts come due, so we have that just in terms of seasonality. And then we're usually a little less fuel efficient as we get into the fourth quarter. I mean we're going to pull on everything, as you've seen us do already this year, but as we set up a more normal fourth quarter, that's how we see it going. The other thing to think through is a lot of the hurricane-side expenses, to the extent they hit the OpEx line, are going to hit here. So we've got a little bit of piece in there. And then when you look at the productivity, as we've targeted about $400 million, it implies about a $60 million run rate for the quarter, and that's a little less than what we had seen in the third quarter.

I mean, it is clear that we've had a tough market for an extended period of time now in terms of excess capacity, and it does impact not just intermodal business but certain markets within our merchandise business as well, generally shorter haul, also generally lower contributor traffic that are most susceptible to being switched over to truck. As the market turns, and it will turn, we see new orders of truck -- of Class 8 trucks have come down significantly, 30%, 40% year-over-year, year-to-date. We know ELDs will be coming in by -- some time in the second half of next year. And if the economy continues to expand and unemployment stays low, that should lead to a much better environment as we get into late '17, and that will be helpful. So our challenge to our team right now is to sell that improved service product that we have, sell through this kind of trough and sell the long-term access to our network that allows us to continue to reinvest in our business."

Yesterday, CSX reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.48 compared to $0.52 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 8% in the quarter, consistent with an overall volume decline of 8%, which included a 21% decline in coal volume. 
Turning to operations. Safety performance remained strong and service levels continued to meet or exceed customer expectations driving further network efficiency improvements. In addition, CSX further reduced structural costs in the quarter and aligned resources levels to lower volume while retaining the ability to flex those resources with demand. Continuing to match resources to demand, combined with our ongoing initiatives to support network fluidity, form the foundation to maximize future merchandise and intermodal growth opportunities. As significant cost savings partially offset the impact of lower volume and a changing business mix, operating income declined $92 million year-over-year to $841 million. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 69.0%. 
Before I hand the presentation over to Frank, let me thank our employees, customer and suppliers for their skillful planning and tireless efforts working together to manage the effects of Hurricane Matthew over the weekend and through this week.

As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 8% or $229 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 8%, which impacted revenue by about $220 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $63 million in the quarter but was offset by strong core pricing from an improved service product. Same-store sales pricing for the third quarter was up 2.3% overall and 3.6% excluding coal. 
Other revenue decreased $9 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges versus the prior year.  Expenses decreased 7% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $112 million in efficiency gains and $53 million in lower volume-related costs. Operating income was $841 million in the third quarter, down 10% from last year. 
Looking below the line. Interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income increased $11 million. And finally, income taxes were $260 million in the quarter, with an effective tax rate of about 36%. Overall, net earnings were $455 million, down 10% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 8% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, you will notice that the outlook reflects our adjusted market alignments. As released in our third quarter earnings, we are now referring to our markets as shown on this slide, which is consistent with how we are managing the business. The previous food and consumer market is now part of agricultural and food products. Waste and the fly ash business have moved to chemicals, and the equipment business now resides in the renamed metals and equipment market. Reclass volume, revenue and RPU information for the last 3 years are available on our Investor Relations web page. 
In 2016, CSX' fiscal calendar includes a 53rd week, and as such, we will be reporting a 14-week fourth quarter. When talking -- excuse me, when taking the full quarter into account, with an extra week versus the same period last year, we expect volume to be roughly flat. However, on a 13-week comparable quarter basis, we continue to see a soft but stabilizing industrial economy with volume down year-over-year. In addition to the standard view we provide each quarter, which, on the slide, shows expectations for the 13-week comparable period, we have included a red, yellow, green designation to the far right, which shows the full quarter impact of the extra week on volume expectations. With that said, the market comments that follow reflect expectations on a 13-week comparable basis. 
Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remains strong and new business continues to ramp up. Agricultural and food products is expected to be neutral. The record grain harvest will drive year-over-year gains. However, market dynamics for ethanol remain challenged near term for CSX due to increased movements and storage in the Gulf region.  Export coal is also neutral as we are seeing some near-term increase in metallurgical demand, driven by reduced Chinese supply, such that volume should be similar to last year's levels. We expect our full year export coal tonnage to be around 25 million tons. 
Chemicals will be down, with continued weakness in drilling-related products, especially crude oil, due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads. This impact more than offsets growth in core chemicals and the continued ramp-up of new fly ash business. 
Domestic coal will again be down. However, in the fourth quarter, we will cycle the start of the pronounced market weakness which took hold in the fourth quarter last year. While the excess supply of natural gas continues to provide a price point that favors gas burn over coal, the easier comparables will moderate the rate of decline we've seen over the last several quarters. We expect domestic coal tonnage to be relatively stable to what we saw in the third quarter. 
Intermodal will decline as we continue to cycle competitive losses in international in the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we previously reported, we will continue to cycle some short-haul traffic loss in the domestic market, which began in the third quarter. Absent this, we continue to experience strength in the domestic segment, driven by our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversion. Minerals will be down in the quarter as we cycle a strong period last year that benefited from an extended aggregate shipping season in the north due to mild weather late into the year. 
Overall, on a comparable 13-week basis, we expect volume to be down mid-single digits. Low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices as well as strength in the U.S. dollar continue to challenge the rail marketplace, although the impact of these factors is beginning to moderate as we move through a full year of this external climate. 
When we report earnings in the fourth quarter, our GAAP numbers will include the full 14 weeks of volume and revenue. Again, a preview of 14-week volume expectations is reflected to the far right of the slide, which, in total, represents about flat volume year-over-year. When we report next quarter, we will provide a breakout of volume and revenue for the final week of the fiscal year, which is a holiday week, to facilitate year-over-year comparisons. 
Turning to the next slide. Let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the fourth quarter. As a result of aggressive cost actions, we have achieved over $340 million of efficiency gains year-to-date and now expect full year productivity savings to be about $400 million. Looking at the fourth quarter, the drivers for each expense category are shown on a comparable 13-week basis versus the prior year. Separately, at the bottom of the slide, we have provided guidance for the incremental costs associated with the 53rd week this year. In addition, we will be cycling $48 million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter, which impacted labor and fringe by $37 million and MS&O by $11 million in the prior year. 
Looking first at labor and fringe, we expect fourth quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis, although not to the same level we saw in the third quarter. Labor inflation is expected to be around $30 million in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be more than offset by continued efficiency and volume-related cost savings. Similar to this quarter, we expect a headwind in the fourth quarter of about $40 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015, we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as sharp declines in the energy markets, coupled with broad-based commodity and dollar impacts, drove CSX' financial results well below our initial expectations. 
MS&O expense is expected to be relatively flat to the prior year, with continued efficiency gains offsetting inflation. We expect fuel expense to decline in the fourth quarter, with the higher cost per gallon year-over-year, reflecting the current forward curve, being more than offset by volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the fourth quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business, partially offset by the favorable impact of an equipment life study. 
Equipment and other rents in the fourth quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year, with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth. 
Finally, fourth quarter expense will also be impacted by the extra week. And when we report earnings in the fourth quarter, we will provide detail to help you better understand the impact of the 53rd week. 
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. With macroeconomic and energy headwinds impacting most markets, CSX, once again, delivered solid financial results in the third quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset an 8% volume decline this quarter. To mitigate the weak demand, we have taken significant cost actions this year, resulting in year-to-date efficiency savings of about $340 million and rightsizing savings of around $200 million. We continue to pursue structural cost opportunities across the network and now expect full year efficiency savings to be about $400 million. 
Looking at our expectations for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned previously, we expect volume to be relatively flat to last year, which includes the impact of the extra week. We remain intensely focused on pricing to the value of our service and expect our strong cost performance to continue into the fourth quarter. 
We will also be cycling an $80 million property gain from the prior year, which was below the line in other income, in addition to cycling the $48 million in restructuring costs. As a result, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share, on a reported basis, including the impact of the extra week, to be flat to slightly down versus the earnings we reported last year. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As you heard today, CSX is continuing to drive results for shareholders in this dynamic business climate by aggressively managing costs and delivering record efficiency savings. The men and women of CSX are working relentlessly to safely, efficiently and successfully serve our customers. 
As we continue to manage through the current macroeconomic and energy environment, we are simultaneously focused on positioning CSX to maximize opportunities going forward. The transformation into the CSX of Tomorrow requires growth and increased profitability in our merchandise and intermodal businesses while preserving the business value of coal as it becomes a smaller part of CSX going forward.  With that focus, we'll continue to drive earnings growth and margin expansion for our shareholders as we redeploy capital to further improve the network, support new technology solutions and automation and enhance merchandise and intermodal operations. 
With continued population growth as well as the challenges facing the trucking industry, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth prospects for domestic intermodal. In support of that vision, we continue our multiyear strategy to add network capabilities and new service offerings. This strategy supports improved profitability and the ability to serve ever more service-sensitive freight. As we look to the future, our core earnings power remains strong, and the CSX of Tomorrow will continue delivering compelling shareholder value as we further progress towards a target of a mid-60s operating ratio longer term.

Here's how I think about this year and going into next year. So when we, as a company, started looking at how coal was becoming less and less of our product mix, our service product mix, we took a real hard look at how we needed to use our network differently to drive efficiencies, to drive margin expansion from a cost perspective. So a big -- a portion of what you have seen here this year is looking at structural changes in the coal fields, and we're lapping those this month, actually, when we shut down Erwin and Corbin. And so those we would not, obviously, repeat going into future years. But we also have looked at driving density both on our routes, on our core routes, and density on our trains in terms of train length. And while we are lapping some of the big steps that we were able to take with train length, we do see other opportunities for that. It does require investment, so the timing of it becomes contingent upon those investments being -- coming to fruition. And then there's a traditional track -- productivity that we look at and have over many, many years, and technology is a huge part of that. So we're streamlining, streamlining to align with our core network, our Network of Tomorrow. And so when I think about that type of technology or that type of productivity, I see next year looking a little bit more normalized in terms of run rate around offsetting inflation, around $150 million. But we don't put any upper limits on productivity. We are going to address and bring in everything we possibly can. And I think, particularly, the technology lever is an exciting one for us, both in terms of mobility and utilizing machine vision and then other areas around predictive analytics to help us be more reliable with our assets. So I think you'll see us -- we pulled a lot forward into this year, which is part of what you're pulling on. I think we'll see a more normal year next year, but we are not leaving anything on the table."

In terms of 2017, when you think about where we are, we're looking very hard at infrastructure and equipment, given the environment that we're in and given the Network of Tomorrow strategy that we have. What we've been talking about is in a normalized, say, 5- or 10-year view in retrospect for CapEx, we've generally spent somewhere between 12% and 15% of that capital portfolio on return-seeking investments. What we're looking forward to doing, on a going-forward basis, is to increase that allocation to more like 20% or 25% of the capital portfolio.

Given the cost take-out that you've achieved over the last several quarters, it's been a while since we've had a year where you went from a big revenue decline to, potentially, a return to growth. And your best incrementals of the recent years have been around 50% on the margin side. I'm just curious.

But as I had alluded to in the answer to the earlier question, it really depends on how the business comes back. If it comes back in areas where you're adding a boxcar onto an existing train, an intermodal container onto an existing train, an auto rack onto an existing train, that's really where you're going to get the incremental margins and the operating leverage that you're referring to. If it's something that's on the bulk side of the business, which is going to be a new train start, the incremental margins are going to essentially be what the absolute margins are in that business, by and large. So I do think we've set ourselves up for a good run as the economy improves and as volume comes back, especially on the class side of the business."

There's a few things on the sequential side to think through. Given that we've got some incremental bulk business on the export side, the grain side and the automotive side, we've got additional engines and freight cars in the mix relative to third quarter, so clearly, that's going to impact the MS&O line on the materials and supply side. We are expecting normal seasonality in terms of normal winter. We didn't see necessarily as much of that last year, but we're expecting that this year just given what we understand the winter to hold. There's a normal seasonal shift between the third quarter and the fourth quarter as we stop the construction season as it gets too cold and too icy to work up north, so we do have that. And then there's normally on the technology side as annual hardware, software maintenance contracts come due, so we have that just in terms of seasonality. And then we're usually a little less fuel efficient as we get into the fourth quarter. I mean we're going to pull on everything, as you've seen us do already this year, but as we set up a more normal fourth quarter, that's how we see it going. The other thing to think through is a lot of the hurricane-side expenses, to the extent they hit the OpEx line, are going to hit here. So we've got a little bit of a piece in there. And then when you look at the productivity, as we've targeted about $400 million, it implies about a $60 million run rate for the quarter, and that's a little less than what we had seen in the third quarter. So you add all of that up and it's going to be about flat on a year-over-year basis."

I think on the inflation side, we have been in a little bit of a muted environment here in the last couple of years. When you start thinking about the inflation more broadly as well as GDP and IDP potentially going up, there could be a little bit of pressure on the upside. There is a little bit of nuance in the second half of the year for labor and fringe inflation that you're picking up on, which is wage accruals that came up starting in the middle of the year. So there's that in there rather than a sort of a core external inflation run rate that's out there. But I think what you're hearing from us is regardless of what inflation is, we're going to do our level best to more than offset that with productivity.

Yesterday, CSX reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.48 compared to $0.52 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 8% in the quarter, consistent with an overall volume decline of 8%, which included a 21% decline in coal volume. 
Turning to operations. Safety performance remained strong, and service levels continued to meet or exceed customer expectations, driving further network efficiency improvements. In addition, CSX further reduced structural costs in the quarter and aligned resources levels to lower volume while retaining the ability to flex those resources with demand. Continuing to match resources to demand, combined with our ongoing initiatives to support network fluidity, form the foundation to maximize future merchandise and intermodal growth opportunities. As significant cost savings partially offset the impact of lower volume and a changing business mix, operating income declined $92 million year-over-year to $841 million. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 69.0%.

As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 8% or $229 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 8%, which impacted revenue by about $220 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $63 million in the quarter but was offset by strong core pricing from an improved service product. Same-store sales pricing for the third quarter was up 2.3% overall and 3.6% excluding coal. 
Other revenue decreased $9 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges versus the prior year.  Expenses decreased 7% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $112 million in efficiency gains and $53 million in lower volume-related costs. Operating income was $841 million in the third quarter, down 10% from last year. 
Looking below the line. Interest expense was up slightly from last year, with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income increased $11 million. And finally, income taxes were $260 million in the quarter, with an effective tax rate of about 36%. Overall, net earnings were $455 million, down 10% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 8% versus last year. 
Now let me turn to the market outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, you will notice that the outlook reflects our adjusted market alignments. As released in our third quarter earnings, we are now referring to our markets as shown on this slide, which is consistent with how we are managing the business. The previous food and consumer market is now part of agricultural and food products. Waste and the fly ash business have moved to chemicals, and the equipment business now resides in the renamed metals and equipment market. Reclass volume, revenue and RPU information for the last 3 years are available on our Investor Relations web page. 
In 2016, CSX' fiscal calendar includes a 53rd week, and as such, we will be reporting a 14-week fourth quarter. When talking -- excuse me, when taking the full quarter into account, with an extra week versus the same period last year, we expect volume to be roughly flat. However, on a 13-week comparable quarter basis, we continue to see a soft but stabilizing industrial economy with volume down year-over-year. In addition to the standard view we provide each quarter, which, on the slide, shows expectations for the 13-week comparable period, we have included a red, yellow, green designation to the far right, which shows the full quarter impact of the extra week on volume expectations. With that said, the market comments that follow reflect expectations on a 13-week comparable basis. 
Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remains strong and new business continues to ramp up. Agricultural and food products is expected to be neutral. The record grain harvest will drive year-over-year gains. However, market dynamics for ethanol remain challenged near term for CSX due to increased movements in storage in the Gulf region.  Export coal is also neutral as we are seeing some near-term increase in metallurgical demand, driven by reduced Chinese supply, such that volume should be similar to last year's levels. We expect our full year export coal tonnage to be around 25 million tons. 
Chemicals will be down, with continued weakness in drilling-related products, especially crude oil, due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads. This impact more than offsets growth in core chemicals and the continued ramp-up of new fly ash business. 
Domestic coal will again be down. However, in the fourth quarter, we will cycle the start of the pronounced market weakness which took hold in the fourth quarter last year. While the excess supply of natural gas continues to provide a price point that favors gas burn over coal, the easier comparables will moderate the rate of decline we've seen over the last several quarters. We expect domestic coal tonnage to be relatively stable to what we saw in the third quarter. 
Intermodal will decline as we continue to cycle competitive losses in international in the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we previously reported, we will continue to cycle some short-haul traffic loss in the domestic market, which began in the third quarter. Absent this, we continue to experience strength in the domestic segment, driven by our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversion. Minerals will be down in the quarter as we cycle a strong period last year that benefited from an extended aggregate shipping season in the north due to mild weather late into the year. 
Overall, on a comparable 13-week basis, we expect volume to be down mid-single digits. Low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices as well as strength in the U.S. dollar continue to challenge the rail marketplace, although the impact of these factors is beginning to moderate as we move through a full year of this external climate. 
When we report earnings in the fourth quarter, our GAAP numbers will include the full 14 weeks of volume and revenue. Again, a preview of 14-week volume expectations is reflected to the far right of the slide, which, in total, represents about flat volume year-over-year. When we report next quarter, we will provide a breakout of volume and revenue for the final week of the fiscal year, which is a holiday week, to facilitate year-over-year comparisons. 
Turning to the next slide. Let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the fourth quarter. As a result of aggressive cost actions, we have achieved over $340 million of efficiency gains year-to-date and now expect full year productivity savings to be about $400 million. Looking at the fourth quarter, the drivers for each expense category are shown on a comparable 13-week basis versus the prior year. Separately, at the bottom of the slide, we have provided guidance for the incremental costs associated with the 53rd week this year. In addition, we will be cycling $48 million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter, which impacted labor and fringe by $37 million and MS&O by $11 million in the prior year. 
Looking first at labor and fringe, we expect fourth quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis, although not to the same level we saw in the third quarter. Labor inflation is expected to be around $30 million in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be more than offset by continued efficiency and volume-related cost savings. Similar to this quarter, we expect a headwind in the fourth quarter of about $40 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015, we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as sharp declines in the energy markets, coupled with broad-based commodity and dollar impacts, drove CSX' financial results well below our initial expectations. 
MS&O expense is expected to be relatively flat to the prior year, with continued efficiency gains offsetting inflation. We expect fuel expense to decline in the fourth quarter, with the higher cost per gallon year-over-year, reflecting the current forward curve, being more than offset by volume-related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the fourth quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business, partially offset by the favorable impact of an equipment life study. 
Equipment and other rents in the fourth quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year, with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume-related costs associated with automotive growth. 
Finally, fourth quarter expense will also be impacted by the extra week. And when we report earnings in the fourth quarter, we will provide detail to help you better understand the impact of the 53rd week. 
Now let me wrap up on the next slide. With macroeconomic and energy headwinds impacting most markets, CSX, once again, delivered solid financial results in the third quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset an 8% volume decline this quarter. To mitigate the weak demand, we have taken significant cost actions this year, resulting in year-to-date efficiency savings of about $340 million and rightsizing savings of around $200 million. We continue to pursue structural cost opportunities across the network and now expect full year efficiency savings to be about $400 million. 
Looking at our expectations for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned previously, we expect volume to be relatively flat to last year, which includes the impact of the extra week. We remain intensely focused on pricing to the value of our service and expect our strong cost performance to continue into the fourth quarter. 
We will also be cycling an $80 million property gain from the prior year, which was below the line in other income, in addition to cycling the $48 million in restructuring costs. As a result, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share, on a reported basis, including the impact of the extra week, to be flat to slightly down versus the earnings we reported last year. 
With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks."

As you heard today, CSX is continuing to drive results for shareholders in this dynamic business climate by aggressively managing costs and delivering record efficiency savings. The men and women of CSX are working relentlessly to safely, efficiently and successfully serve our customers. 
As we continue to manage through the current macroeconomic and energy environment, we are simultaneously focused on positioning CSX to maximize opportunities going forward. The transformation into the CSX of Tomorrow requires growth and increased profitability in our merchandise and intermodal businesses while preserving the business value of coal as it becomes a smaller part of CSX going forward.  With that focus, we'll continue to drive earnings growth and margin expansion for our shareholders as we redeploy capital to further improve the network, support new technology solutions and automation and enhance merchandise and intermodal operations. 
With continued population growth as well as the challenges facing the trucking industry, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth prospects for domestic intermodal. In support of that vision, we continue our multiyear strategy to add network capabilities and new service offerings. This strategy supports improved profitability and the ability to serve ever more service-sensitive freight. As we look to the future, our core earnings power remains strong, and the CSX of Tomorrow will continue delivering compelling shareholder value as we further progress towards a target of a mid-60s operating ratio longer term. 
And now we'll be pleased to take your questions."

Here's how I think about this year and going into next year. So when we, as a company, started looking at how coal was becoming less and less of our product mix, our service product mix, we took a real hard look at how we needed to use our network differently to drive efficiencies, to drive margin expansion from a cost perspective. So a big -- a portion of what you have seen here this year is looking at structural changes in the coal fields, and we're lapping those this month, actually, when we shut down Erwin and Corbin. And so those we would not, obviously, repeat going into future years. But we also have looked at driving density both on our routes, on our core routes, and density on our trains in terms of train length. And while we are lapping some of the big steps that we were able to take with train length, we do see other opportunities for that. It does require investment, so the timing of it becomes contingent upon those investments being -- coming to fruition. And then there's a traditional track -- productivity that we look at and have over many, many years, and technology is a huge part of that. So we're streamlining, streamlining to align with our core network, our network of tomorrow. And so when I think about that type of technology or that type of productivity, I see next year looking a little bit more normalized in terms of run rate around offsetting inflation, around $150 million. But we don't put any upper limits on productivity. We are going to address and bring in everything we possibly can. And I think, particularly, the technology lever is an exciting one for us, both in terms of mobility and utilizing machine vision and then other areas around predictive analytics to help us be more reliable with our assets. So I think you'll see us -- we pulled a lot forward into this year, which is part of what you're pulling on. I think we'll see a more normal year next year, but we are not leaving anything on the table."

The other piece, which will show up in other financing activities, so not in the property additions line, will be $300 million for paying off engines that we took delivery of last year. So your $2.7 billion is -- again, we're trying to be very transparent with you in terms of the capital dollars that we're spending this year, although you do have some geography differences on the cash flow statement. In terms of 2017, when you think about where we are, we're looking very hard at infrastructure and equipment, given the environment that we're in and given the network of tomorrow strategy that we have. What we've been talking about is in a normalized, say, 5- or 10-year view in retrospect for CapEx, we've generally spent somewhere between 12% and 15% of that capital portfolio on return-seeking investments. What we're looking forward to doing, on a going-forward basis, is to increase that allocation to more like 20% or 25% of the capital portfolio.

If it comes back in areas where you're adding a boxcar onto an existing train, an intermodal container onto an existing train, an auto rack onto an existing train, that's really where you're going to get the incremental margins and the operating leverage that you're referring to. If it's something that's on the bulk side of the business, which is going to be a new train start, the incremental margins are going to essentially be what the absolute margins are in that business, by and large.

There's a few things on the sequential side to think through. Given that we've got some incremental bulk business on the export side, the grain side and the automotive side, we've got additional engines and freight cars in the mix relative to third quarter, so clearly, that's going to impact the MS&O line on the materials and supply side. We are expecting normal seasonality in terms of normal winter. We didn't see necessarily as much of that last year, but we're expecting that this year just given what we understand the winter to hold. There's a normal seasonal shift between the third quarter and the fourth quarter as we stop the construction season as it gets too cold and too icy to work up north, so we do have that. And then there's normally on the technology side as annual hardware, software maintenance contracts come due, so we have that just in terms of seasonality. And then we're usually a little less fuel efficient as we get into the fourth quarter. I mean we're going to pull on everything, as you've seen us do already this year, but as we set up a more normal fourth quarter, that's how we see it going. The other thing to think through is a lot of the hurricane-side expenses, to the extent they hit the OpEx line, are going to hit here. So we've got a little bit of a piece in there. And then when you look at the productivity, as we've targeted about $400 million, it implies about a $60 million run rate for the quarter, and that's a little less than what we had seen in the third quarter.

I mean, it is clear that we've had a tough market for an extended period of time now in terms of excess capacity, and it does impact not just intermodal business but certain markets within our merchandise business as well, generally shorter haul, also generally lower contributory traffic that are most susceptible to being switched over to truck. As the market turns, and it will turn, we see new orders of truck -- of Class 8 trucks have come down significantly, 30%, 40% year-over-year, year-to-date. We know ELDs will be coming in by -- some time in the second half of next year. And if the economy continues to expand and unemployment stays low, that should lead to a much better environment as we get into late '17, and that will be helpful. So our challenge to our team right now is to sell that improved service product that we have, sell through this kind of trough and sell the long-term access to our network that allows us to continue to reinvest in our business."

So if you have ELDs and other regulatory constraints put pressure on the supply side, clearly, additional growth in the economy is also helpful.
