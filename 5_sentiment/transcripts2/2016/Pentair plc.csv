I'll start with the executive summary on Page 4. There's no doubt that 2015 was a challenging year for Pentair and most other industrial companies, but we are encouraged that our fourth quarter results met our expectations operationally. Overall, earnings came in higher than forecast due to a better ongoing tax rate, and our ability to forecast sales demonstrates that the quarter-to-quarter volatility in some of our served markets may finally be showing signs of stabilizing. 
While our businesses serving the Energy and Industrial markets will likely face continued challenges in 2016, the 2 bright spots in 2015, Food & Beverage and Residential & Commercial, appear to still have more upside. In addition, we've finally seen sign of stabilizations and green shoots of growth within our smaller vertical, Infrastructure. We understand way Valves & Controls focus for many of our investors and their efforts to rightsize the business in the face of this significant energy -- in the significant energy industry reset remains a big priority.
While we're now seeing sales and orders in Valves & Controls meet our forecast the second consecutive quarter, gross margins remain under pressure due to project pricing and mix. Our acquisition of ERICO completed at the end of the third quarter is delivering what we expected, and the integration is well underway. Cash flow, which has historically been a hallmark for Pentair, did come in slightly short of our forecast as we have foreshadowed in our outlook call last December. This is due exclusively to working capital timing and are fully committed to demonstrating our cash flow prowess in 2016, expecting greater than 100% adjusted net income conversion as we doubled down in working capital following the dramatic top line challenges faced in 2015, principally within Valves & Controls.
We're maintaining our 2016 full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.05 per share to $4.25 per share. We made good progress on further reducing the tax rate as demonstrated in the fourth quarter. While this improved tax rate was just under a $0.10 compared to our prior forecast, we've lowered our Valves & Controls forecast by a similar mark, given the degree of margin compression the business has faced due to project pricing and uncertainty around the timing of the recovery in the short-cycle business, which slowed in 2015. Overall, we're pleased to have met our fourth quarter expectations, and our 2016 outlook remains intact. 
Now let's to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q4 2015 results. Fourth quarter core sales declined 4%, which is a modest improvement from the 5% decline in the third quarter. Valves & Controls is slightly better in our sales forecast, and the rate of decline is stabilizing in the mid-teens. Water Quality Systems delivered strong 7% core growth. Core sales were flat and Flow & Filtration Solutions showed further signs of stabilization on the top line. Overall, FX remained a headwind in the quarter, and ERICO contributed positively and in line with our commitments.
Segment income declined 7%, and margins were down 90 basis points to 15.9%. As expected, Valves & Controls was a major contributor to margin contraction, while Water Quality Systems has a very strong margin quarter. Flow & Filtration Solutions had another quarter of margin expansion, which is why we believe this segment is well positioned for further gains in 2016. Due to the end-of-the-year tax adjustment, tax rate in the quarter was favorable, and our full year rate finished just north of 21%. We believe this is an ongoing rate and expect further improvement to the tax rate in 2016.
Free cash flow ended the year at $643 million, which is short of our $700 million forecast. As mentioned, free cash flow has been impacted by working capital timing due to the top line softness we've experienced so quickly, but we expect that free cash flow to return to greater than 100% of adjusted net income in 2016.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss Pentair's Q4 2015 performance elements. Our performance by vertical similar to the third quarter with solid gains in Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage being offset by ongoing pressures in both Energy and Industrial. Encouragingly, Infrastructure was flat in the quarter and continue to show signs of stabilization and potential return to growth in 2016.
As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, we had another solid quarter of productivity and with price more than offset inflation. Our cost cut actions in Valves & Controls continued through 2015, and we still expect over $135 million in savings to read out in 2016. Negative mix impacted both Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions, but our other 2 segments, Flow & Filtration Solutions and Water Quality Systems, delivered improved margins.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a review Valves & Controls. The fourth quarter Valves & Controls core sales declined 15%, which is 1 point better than our forecast and an improvement from the 18% core decline experienced in the third quarter. FX remained a considerable headwind at 7%. Backlog was down 4%, which includes a negative FX translation. Core orders declined 15%, which is consistent with a double-digit rate of decline the business experienced throughout the year. Core sales declined in 3 of the 4 subverticals served by Valves & Controls as mining showed growth in the quarter on the results of 1 project shipping. We continue to see weakness in our short-cycle business as many of our customers have cut their operational budgets in addition to their capital budgets, including scaling back maintenance turnarounds. We do not expect this trend to revers in the third quarter remain optimistic that customers will begin spending more on maintenance as 2016 [ph] progresses. As we indicated last quarter, we've seen a trend of customers delaying shipment, but there are a few other cancellations in the current time. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls segment income and margins. While we continue to drive productivity which offset inflation, it is not nearly enough to overcome the dramatic top line drop experienced during the quarter and the year. We've aggressively been rightsizing the cost structure, but it does take time for the benefits from those actions to read out. In addition, we've seen higher-than-normal margin compression due to pricing pressure within the project business. Mix has also been a headwind to margins as the higher-margin short-cycle businesses remain under pressure.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on Slide 8 Valves & Controls backlog is broken down into 4 key subverticals, 3 of which fall into our Energy vertical, Oil & Gas, Power and Mining and one on our Industrial vertical, which is the Process business. Orders declined in all 4 of her subverticals with oil & gas the only business to not decline double digits. As 2015 progressed, we saw customers continue to curtail spending as they assess their long-term plans and adjusted to the reality of lower oil prices. Many expected Oil & Gas to feel the pressure but delays in project timing have extended to other areas like LNG and petrochem. As stated previously, it's not just been projects that had been delayed or cut. It's clearly customers have been delaying maintenance spending as well. It's still too early to call a bottom. We're encouraged that orders have met our forecast for the second consecutive quarter in the short-cycle business will return, but maintenance cannot be deferred for ever, and we're watching for some signs of improvement beginning the second quarter this year.
Now let's move to Slide 9 to discuss the Q4 performance of Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions had an 8% top line decline with core sales down 2% and foreign exchange translation of 6% headwind. The fourth quarter showed signs of stabilization segment. We continue to expect the business to return to growth in 2016. We did see all 4 served verticals contract in the quarter. Food & Beverage was down as growth in our beverage business was on not enough to offset the ongoing headwinds with agriculture. We would note that our sales decline in our agricultural-related businesses was not as bad as the overall industry. Residential & Commercial was down due to product line exits we made to better position this business longer-term. While Infrastructure overall is down, this was the result of the comparison last year when we had large filtration project shift. We're encouraged to see further improvement with our North America municipal pump business. Segment income was down modestly, but margins expanded 40 basis points to 11.3%. This marks the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion and believe it a positive sign that the actions taken in 2015 positioned the segment for further gains in 2016 and beyond.
Now let's move to Slide 10 to look at Water Quality Systems. We believe that the slower top line growth seen in the third quarter was an anomaly, and the fourth quarter growth performance was validation that Water Quality Systems remains on a positive track. During the quarter, sales grew 4%, which consisted of 7% core sales growth offset by a 3% FX headwind. Both Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage grew at high single-digit rates in the quarter. Our Aquatics business led the way once again, and pre-buy activity is a good foretoken that 2016 should be another good year for Aquatics. Our Water Purification business some favorable growth in Europe, which remained weak as distributors exhibited caution in their orders -- order patterns. Foodservice had another solid quarter and saw growth return in China after a pause in the third quarter. Segment income grew 30%, and margin expanded an impressive 450 basis points to 22.3%. This dramatic improvement was a combination of strong productivity execution and positive mix on top of an easier comparison against last year's fourth quarter results.
Water Quality Systems have proven to be a consistently high performer, and we remain committed to getting all of our businesses at the same level of performance.
Now let's move to Slide 11 for a look at how Technical Solutions performed in Q4. Technical Solutions reported 23% growth for the quarter, which consisted of flat core sales, a 6% headwind from FX and a 29% positive contribution from ERICO. Industrial sales were down 2% overall as we saw some further caution exercised by North American electrical distributor, offset partially by our Industrial heat tracing business. Energy was down 3% after growth in the past few quarters as a couple of larger heat tracing projects began to wind down. Infrastructure saw a modest 2% growth following tough year-over-year comparison the past 2 quarters. Residential & Commercial showed strong 7% core growth in the quarter, and ERICO, which generates a large portion of the sales from commercial, track with our expectations. Segment income grew 17%, while operating margins contracted 130 basis points to a still strong 22.6%. Principal factor contributing into margin performance in the fourth quarter was more project shipments and shipments within Industrial heat chasing, and the margin differential between them created the negative mix impact. ERICO met our income expectations, including synergies. While 2016 will see headwinds with the absence of 2 Energy projects and expected first half softness continuing in a short-cycle Industrial business, we remain focused on driving productivity and have taken further cost actions to deliver in this typically high-performance segment.
Let's now turn to Slide 12 for a look at our full year Pentair results. For the full year 2015, our core sales declined 4% as performance in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions was not enough to offset significant challenges faced by Valves & Controls served markets. Segment income declined 12%, and margins contracted 60 basis points to 15.5%. Our tax rate ended the year at just over 21%, which is better than the 23% we projected at the beginning of the year. We believe this improved tax rate is sustainable and would expect further improvement in reducing the tax rate in 2016. We're not pleased with our free cash flow performance of $643 million, which represented only 90% of adjusted net income, but we know this is fully to working capital timing and remain committed to correct it in 2016.
Overall, 2015 was a challenging year where we saw 2 of our segments deliver strong performance, 1 segment stabilize, and we're addressing the reality of the other segment.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 for the 2016 outlook assumptions. Before I turn the call over to John to provide additional insight on Valves & Controls and discuss our first quarter and 2016 outlook, I wanted to update you on what has changed since we issued our initial 2016 outlook in mid-December. As you can see on this slide, the majority for key assumptions remain unchanged. We continue to expect solid performance for our businesses serving Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage. We've seen signs of stabilization within Infrastructure. Industrial is expected to continue to have a challenging first half of the year comparisons become less difficult in the second half, and we're encouraged that distributors may begin ordering once again in the back half of the year. Foreign exchange has been tracking to where we plan. We all know that this can change at any time. The one area that has worsen is Energy, particularly the further decline seen in the price of oil. We've seen several major energy companies announced capital expenditure plans and call for additional 20% plus cuts following the similar reductions in 2015. Further delays in the short-cycle business give us pause. Don't expect any signs of improvement in the first quarter, we watch the second quarter trends closely to see if customers stop deferring their maintenance spending. The other bright spot we have is the improvement in our tax rate. This added structural improvement provides an offset to further weakening in Energy and gives us increased confidence in maintaining our full year guidance.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

We thought it would be helpful to provide an update of our Valves & Controls business and the further deteriorating conditions that it's faced since issuing our initial 2006 guidance last Decem",906,"Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #14 titled V&C update. We thought it would be helpful to provide an update of our Valves & Controls business and the further deteriorating conditions that it's faced since issuing our initial 2006 guidance last December. We continue to see pressure on incoming orders and now expect orders to be down as much as 5% for the full year of 2016. The well-publicized decline in oil prices is just one of the factors that leads us to remain cautious about the timing of orders stabilization, but even more, we are watching the short-cycle business for signs that customers will begin to accelerate maintenance spending. As a result, we modestly lowered our full year revenue forecast for 2016. We continue to see pricing pressure on the project side of the business, and this shows up as margin compression. While we have aggressively implemented cost-out actions, we expect industry uncertainty to persist, we plan to remove additional cost in the business. When forecasting where we see sales and orders, coupled further anticipated margin compression, we're now forecasting return on sales in Valves & Controls to be 100 basis points lower than our original forecast at 10.5%.
Please turn to Slide #15 labeled noncash goodwill impairment. We performed step 1 of our goodwill impairment analysis as required by the accounting rules and concluded that the fair value of Valves & Controls is below its carrying value. The carrying value was determined when we completed the Flow Control merger in 2012 when oil was over $100 that year. Since 2012, the energy industry has reset significantly, and uncertainty remains around the timing of any recovery. We are finalizing the analysis, and we currently estimate that there'll be a noncash impairment charge in the range of $400 million to $600 million through reported at the time our 10-K was published. 
Please turn to Slide #16 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet changed significantly with the closing of the ERICO acquisition. We added the -- we ended the year with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. While our balance sheet leveraged at 3.75x, higher than our targeted 2.5 leverage ratio, we expect to bring net leverage ratio at around 3.3 by the end of 2016. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.9% as our operating income came under pressure with the top line challenges experienced within our Valves & Controls segment. Although free cash flow ended the year roughly 90% of adjusted net income, this is due exclusively to working capital timing, and we expect the 100% conversion rate in 2016.
Please turn to Slide #17 labeled Q1 2016 Pentair outlook. For the first quarter, we expect core sales to be up a modest 1% and total sales to grow 7% inclusive of FX headwinds in the ERICO acquisition. On the core sales basis, we expect Valves & Controls to be down roughly 7%, which is the slower rate of decline to be expected in 2015. Flow & Filtration systems core sales are expected to be up 4% on easier year-over-year comparison and project shipment timing. Water Quality Systems core sales are anticipated to increase approximately 5% on continued strength in Aquatics. Finally, Technical Solutions core sales are expected to be up 4% and Industrial heat tracing helped to offset ongoing sluggishness and closures. We have not made any changes to our ERICO forecast or expectations around synergies. We are expecting segment income to decrease modestly and return on sales to contract 110 basis points.
Below the operating line, we expect an improved tax rate of around 20.5%. Net interest and other around $33 million and the share count around 183 million. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.70 to $0.72, which is roughly a 7% year-over-year decline.
We expect historically typical free cash flow usage in the first quarter but turning positive as the year progresses as we continue to focus on improving our working capital performance.
Please turn to Slide #18 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook or $4.05 to $4.25, although the components have changed some from our initial outlook provided December. For the full year, we expect core sales decline of approximately 2%. Valves & Controls core sales are now anticipated to be down 8%, which is 3 points worse than our original forecast as I highlighted a few slides ago. We now expect Flow & Filtration core sales to be up modestly for the full year. Water Quality Systems core sales are anticipated to grow approximately 4%, and Technical Solutions core sales are expected to decline 4% for the full year. We expect segment income to be up 9%, and return on sales to expand 100 basis points to 16.5% with 3 of our 4 segments delivering full year margin expansion. We expect overall corporate cost to be approximately $90 million. Net interest and other to be around $135 million, our full year tax rate to be around 20.5% and the share count for the full year to be around 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 5% at the midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect the strong year free cash flow expected to be approximately 100% of adjusted net income with our working capital opportunities providing potential upside. Jordan, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

There's a hopping business being down and versus those project. That gets better in the second half because just by comparison, because was down in second half and we don't think it's -- as we get to lapping that we don't think we'll see further down there should be a mix improvement in Technical Solutions in the second half."

I'll start with the executive summary on Page 4. There's no doubt that 2015 was a challenging year for Pentair and most other industrial companies, but we are encouraged that our fourth quarter results met our expectations operationally. Overall, earnings came in higher than forecast due to a better ongoing tax rate, and our ability to forecast sales demonstrates that the quarter-to-quarter volatility in some of our served markets may finally be showing signs of stabilizing. 
While our businesses serving the Energy and Industrial markets will likely face continued challenges in 2016, the 2 bright spots in 2015, Food & Beverage and Residential & Commercial, appear to still have more upside. In addition, we've finally seen signs of stabilizations and some green shoots of growth within our smallest vertical, Infrastructure. We understand why Valves & Controls have been a focus of many of our investors as our efforts to rightsize the business in the face of this significant energy -- in the significant energy industry reset remains a big priority.
While we're now seeing sales and orders in Valves & Controls meet our forecast for the second consecutive quarter, gross margins remain under pressure due to project pricing and mix. Our acquisition of ERICO completed at the end of the third quarter is delivering what we expected, and the integration is well underway. Cash flow, which has historically been a hallmark for Pentair, did come in slightly short of our forecast as we had foreshadowed in our outlook call last December. This is due exclusively to working capital timing and we're fully committed to demonstrating our cash flow prowess in 2016, expecting greater than 100% adjusted net income conversion as we doubled down on working capital following the dramatic top line challenges faced in 2015, principally within Valves & Controls.
We're maintaining our 2016 full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.05 per share to $4.25 per share. We made good progress on further reducing the tax rate as demonstrated in the fourth quarter. While this improved tax rate will add just under $0.10 compared to our prior forecast, we've lowered our Valves & Controls forecast by a similar amount, given the degree of margin compression the business has faced due to project pricing and uncertainty around the timing of the recovery in the short-cycle business, which slowed in 2015. Overall, we're pleased to have met our fourth quarter expectations, and our 2016 outlook remains intact. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q4 2015 results. Fourth quarter core sales declined 4%, which is a modest improvement from the 5% decline in the third quarter. Valves & Controls was slightly better than our sales forecast, and the rate of decline is stabilizing in the mid-teens. Water Quality Systems delivered strong 7% core growth. Technical Solutions core sales were flat and Flow & Filtration Solutions showed further signs of stabilization on the top line. Overall, FX remained a headwind in the quarter, and ERICO contributed positively and in line with our commitments.
Segment income declined 7%, and margins were down 90 basis points to 15.9%. As expected, Valves & Controls was the major contributor to the margin contraction, while Water Quality Systems had a very strong margin quarter. Flow & Filtration Solutions had another quarter of margin expansion, which is why we believe this segment is well positioned for further gains in 2016. Due to end-of-the-year tax adjustment, the tax rate in the quarter was favorable, and our full year rate finished just north of 21%. We believe this is an ongoing rate and expect further improvements to the tax rate in 2016.
Free cash flow ended the year at $643 million, which was short of our $700 million forecast. As mentioned, free cash flow has been impacted by working capital timing due to the top line softness we've experienced so quickly, but we expect that free cash flow to return to greater than 100% of adjusted net income in 2016.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss Pentair's Q4 2015 performance elements. Our performance by vertical was similar to the third quarter, with solid gains in Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage being offset by ongoing pressures in both Energy and Industrial. Encouragingly, Infrastructure was flat in the quarter and continue to show signs of stabilization and potential return to growth in 2016.
As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, we had another solid quarter of productivity and with price, they more than offset inflation. Our cost cut actions in Valves & Controls continued through 2015, and we still expect over $135 million in savings to read out in 2016. Negative mix impacted both Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions, but our other 2 segments, Flow & Filtration Solutions and Water Quality Systems, delivered improved margins.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a review of Valves & Controls. For the fourth quarter Valves & Controls core sales declined 15%, which is a point better than our forecast and an improvement from the 18% core decline experienced in the third quarter. FX remained a considerable headwind at 7%. Backlog was down 4%, which includes the negative FX translation. Core orders declined 15%, which is consistent with the double-digit rate of decline the business experienced throughout the year. Core sales declined in 3 of the 4 subverticals served by Valves & Controls as mining showed growth in the quarter on the results of one project shipping. 
We continue to see weakness in our short-cycle business as many of our customers have cut their operational budgets in addition to their capital budgets, including scaling back maintenance turnarounds. We do not expect this trend to reverse in the first quarter. We'll remain optimistic that customers will begin spending more on maintenance as 2006 (sic) progresses. 
As we indicated last quarter, we've seen a trend of customers delaying shipment, but there are a few order cancellations at the current time. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls segment income and margins. While we continued to drive productivity, which offset inflation, it is not nearly enough to overcome the dramatic top line drop experienced during the quarter and the year. We've aggressively been rightsizing the cost structure, but it does take time for the benefits from those actions to read out. In addition, we've seen higher-than-normal margin compression due to pricing pressure within the project business. Mix has also been a headwind to margins as the higher-margin and short-cycle businesses has remained under pressure.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on Slide 8 Valves & Controls backlog is broken down into 4 key subverticals, 3 of which fall into our Energy vertical, Oil & Gas, Power and Mining, and one in our Industrial vertical, which is the Process business. 
Orders declined in all 4 of our subverticals, with Oil & Gas the only business to not decline double digits. As 2015 progressed, we saw customers continue to curtail spending as they assess their long-term plans and adjusted to the reality of lower oil prices. Many expected Oil & Gas to feel the pressure, but delays in project timing have extended to other areas like LNG and petrochem. As stated previously, it has not just been projects that had been delayed or cut. It's clear the customers have been delaying maintenance spending as well. It's still too early to call a bottom. We're encouraged that orders have met our forecast for the second consecutive quarter. It's uncertain when the short-cycle business will return, but maintenance cannot be deferred forever, and we're watching for some signs of improvement beginning the second quarter this year.
Now let's move to Slide 9 to discuss the Q4 performance of Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions had an 8% top line decline, with core sales down 2% and foreign exchange translation of 6% headwind. The fourth quarter showed signs of stabilization with the segment. We continue to expect the business to return to growth in 2016. 
We did see all 4 served verticals contract in the quarter. Food & Beverage was down as growth in our beverage business was not enough to offset the ongoing headwinds within agriculture. We would note that our sales decline in our agriculture-related businesses was not as bad as the overall industry. Residential & Commercial was down due to product line exits we made to better position this business longer-term. While Infrastructure overall was down, this was the result of a tough comparison last year when we had a large filtration project shift. 
We're encouraged to see further improvement with our North America municipal pump business. Segment income was down modestly, but margins expanded 40 basis points to 11.3%. This marks the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion and believe it a positive sign that the actions taken in 2015 positioned the segment for further gains in 2016 and beyond.
Now let's move to Slide 10 to look at Water Quality Systems. We believe that the slower top line growth seen in the third quarter was an anomaly, and the fourth quarter growth performance was validation that Water Quality Systems remains on a positive track. During the quarter, sales grew 4%, which consisted of 7% core sales growth offset by a 3% FX headwind. Both Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage grew at high single-digit rates in the quarter. 
Our Aquatics business led the way once again, and pre-buy activity is a good foretoken that 2016 should be another good year for Aquatics. Our Water Purification business saw favorable growth in Europe, but China remained weak as distributors exhibited caution in their orders -- order patterns. Foodservice had another solid quarter and saw growth return in China after a pause in the third quarter. Segment income grew 30%, and margin expanded an impressive 450 basis points to 22.3%. This dramatic improvement was the combination of strong productivity execution and positive mix on top of an easier comparison against last year's fourth quarter results.
Water Quality Systems has proven to be a consistently high performer, and we remain committed to getting all of our businesses to the same level of performance.
Now let's move to Slide 11 for a look at how Technical Solutions performed in Q4. Technical Solutions reported 23% growth for the quarter, which consisted of flat core sales, a 6% headwind from FX and a 29% positive contribution from ERICO. Industrial sales were down 2% overall as we saw further caution exercised by North American electrical distributors, offset partially by our Industrial heat tracing business. 
Energy was down 3% after growth in the past few quarters as a couple of larger heat tracing projects began to wind down. Infrastructure saw a modest 2% growth following tough year-over-year comparison the past 2 quarters. Residential & Commercial showed strong 7% core growth in the quarter, and ERICO, which generates a large portion of the sales from commercial, track with our expectations. 
Segment income grew 17%, while operating margins contracted 130 basis points to a still strong 22.6%. Principal factor contributing to margin performance in the fourth quarter was more project shipments than product shipments within Industrial heat tracing, and the margin differential between them created a negative mix impact. ERICO met our income expectations, including synergies. While 2016 will see headwinds with the absence of 2 Energy projects and expected first half softness continuing in a short-cycle Industrial business, we remain focused on driving productivity and have taken further cost actions to deliver in this typically high-performance segment.
Let's now turn to Slide 12 for a look at our full year Pentair results. For the full year 2015, our core sales declined 4% as performance in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions was not enough to offset significant challenges faced by Valves & Controls served markets. Segment income declined 12%, and margins contracted 60 basis points to 15.5%. Our tax rate ended the year at just over 21%, which was better than the 23% we projected at the beginning of the year. We believe this improved tax rate is sustainable and would expect further improvement in reducing the tax rate in 2016. 
We're not pleased with our free cash flow performance of $643 million, which represented only 90% of adjusted net income, but we know this is due fully to working capital timing and remain committed to correct it in 2016.
Overall, 2015 was a challenging year where we saw 2 of our segments deliver strong performance, one segment stabilize, and we're addressing the reality of the other segment.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 for the 2016 outlook assumptions. Before I turn the call over to John to provide additional insight on Valves & Controls and to discuss our first quarter and 2016 outlook, I wanted to update you on what has changed since we issued our initial 2016 outlook in mid-December. As you can see on this slide, the majority of our key assumptions remain unchanged. We continue to expect solid performance for our businesses serving Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage. We've seen signs of stabilization within Infrastructure. Industrial is expected to continue to have a challenging first half of the year, but comparisons become less difficult in the second half, and we're encouraged that distributors may begin ordering once again in the back half of the year. Foreign exchange has been tracking to where we plan. We all know that this can change at any time. 
The one area that has worsened is Energy, particularly the further decline seen in the price of oil. We've seen several major energy companies announce capital expenditure plans and call for additional 20% plus cuts following similar reductions in 2015. Further the delays in the short-cycle business give us pause. Don't expect any signs of improvement in the first quarter, and we'll watch the second quarter trends closely to see if customers stop deferring their maintenance spending. The other bright spot we have is the improvement in our tax rate. This added structural improvement provides an offset to the further weakening in Energy and gives us increased confidence in maintaining our full year guidance.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."
295688,321963138,924790,"Pentair plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Pentair plc","Executives","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #14 titled V&C Update. We thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our Valves & Controls business and the further deteriorating conditions that it's faced since issuing our initial 2006 guidance last Decem",919,"Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #14 titled V&C Update. We thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our Valves & Controls business and the further deteriorating conditions that it's faced since issuing our initial 2006 guidance last December. We continue to see pressure on incoming orders and now expect orders to be down as much as 5% for the full year of 2016. The well-publicized decline in oil prices is just one of the factors that leads us to remain cautious about the timing of order stabilization, but even more, we are watching the short-cycle business for signs that customers will begin to accelerate maintenance spending. As a result, we have modestly lowered our full year revenue forecast for 2016. 
We continue to see pricing pressure on the project side of the business, and this shows up as margin compression. While we have aggressively implemented cost-out actions, we expect industry uncertainty to persist, and we plan to remove additional cost from the business. When forecasting where we see sales and orders, coupled with further anticipated margin compression, we now are forecasting return on sales in Valves & Controls to be 100 basis points lower than our original forecast at 10.5%.
Please turn to Slide #15 labeled Noncash Goodwill Impairment. We performed Step 1 of our goodwill impairment analysis as required by the accounting rules and concluded that the fair value of Valves & Controls is below its carrying value. The carrying value was determined when we completed the Flow Control merger in 2012 when oil was over $100 that year. Since 2012, the energy industry has reset significantly, and uncertainty remains around the timing of any recovery. We are finalizing the analysis, but we currently estimate that there will be a noncash impairment charge in the range of $400 million to $600 million to be recorded at the time that our 10-K is published.
Please turn to Slide #16 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet changed significantly with the closing of the ERICO acquisition. We added the -- ended the year with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. While our balance sheet leveraged at 3.75x, higher than our targeted 2.5 leverage ratio, we expect to bring net leverage ratio to around 3.3 by the end of 2016. 
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.9% as our operating income came under pressure with the top line challenges experienced within our Valves & Controls segment. Although free cash flow ended the year at roughly 90% of adjusted net income, this was due exclusively to working capital timing, and we expect a 100% conversion rate in 2016.
Please turn to Slide #17 labeled Q1 2016 Pentair Outlook. For the first quarter, we expect core sales to be up a modest 1% and total sales to grow 7% inclusive of FX headwinds in the ERICO acquisition. On a core sales basis, we expect Valves & Controls to be down roughly 7%, which is a slower rate of decline than we experienced throughout 2015. 
Flow & Filtration systems core sales are expected to be up 4% on an easier year-over-year comparison than project shipment timing. Water Quality Systems core sales are anticipated to increase approximately 5% on continued strength in Aquatics. 
Finally, Technical Solutions core sales are expected to be up 4% as Industrial heat tracing and electronics helped to offset ongoing sluggishness and closures. We have not made any changes to our ERICO forecast or expectations around synergies. We are expecting segment income to decrease modestly and return on sales to contract 110 basis points.
Below the operating line, we expect an improved tax rate of around 20.5%. Net interest and other around $33 million and the share count around 183 million. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.70 to $0.72, which is roughly a 7% year-over-year decline.
We expect historically typical free cash flow usage in the first quarter, but turning positive as the year progresses as we continue to focus on improving our working capital performance.
Please turn to Slide #18 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook or $4.05 to $4.25, although the components have changed some from our initial outlook provided in December. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline approximately 2%. Valves & Controls core sales are now anticipated to be down 8%, which is 3 points worse than our original forecast as I highlighted a few slides ago. We now expect Flow & Filtration core sales to be up modestly for the full year. Water Quality Systems core sales are anticipated to grow approximately 4%, and Technical Solutions core sales are expected to decline 4% for the full year. 
We expect segment income to be up 9%, and return on sales to expand 100 basis points to 16.5% with 3 of our 4 segments delivering full year margin expansion. We expect overall corporate cost to be approximately $90 million. Net interest and other to be around $135 million, our full year tax rate to be around 20.5% and the share count for the full year to be around 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 5% at the midpoint of the range. 
Finally, we expect the strong year of free cash flow expect it to be approximately 100% of adjusted net income with our working capital opportunities providing potential upside. 
Jordan, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

We've recognized about $11 million to $12 million on a quarterly basis in the cost takeout of the 150, and that ramps throughout the year, and the first quarter reflects what we have to do with the inventory accounting and putting that into the inventory and then shipping the old inventory first before we can recognize the benefits.

That's why we're saying that we're watching to see whether there's improvements. And we're certainly taking actions to help improve that in Valves & Controls. In the case of Technical Solutions, where we have the industrial heat trace projects, which a lot of them are not oil and gas-related, they're other industries. And the backlog is good there. There's a Hoffman business being down versus those projects. That gets better in the second half because just by comparison because Hoffman was down in second half, we don't think it's -- as we get to lapping that, we don't think we'll see further down. So there should be a mix improvement in Technical Solutions in the second half."

I'll start with the executive summary on Page 4. There's no doubt that 2015 was a challenging year for Pentair and most other industrial companies, but we are encouraged that our fourth quarter results met our expectations operationally. Overall, earnings came in higher than forecast due to a better ongoing tax rate, and our ability to forecast sales demonstrates that the quarter-to-quarter volatility in some of our served markets may finally be showing signs of stabilizing. 
While our businesses serving the Energy and Industrial markets will likely face continued challenges in 2016, the 2 bright spots in 2015, Food & Beverage and Residential & Commercial, appear to still have more upside. In addition, we've finally seen signs of stabilizations and some green shoots of growth within our smallest vertical, Infrastructure. We understand why Valves & Controls have been a focus of many of our investors as our efforts to rightsize the business in the face of this significant energy -- in the significant energy industry reset remains a big priority.
While we're now seeing sales and orders in Valves & Controls meet our forecast for the second consecutive quarter, gross margins remain under pressure due to project pricing and mix. Our acquisition of ERICO completed at the end of the third quarter is delivering what we expected, and the integration is well underway. Cash flow, which has historically been a hallmark for Pentair, did come in slightly short of our forecast as we had foreshadowed in our outlook call last December. This is due exclusively to working capital timing and we're fully committed to demonstrating our cash flow prowess in 2016, expecting greater than 100% adjusted net income conversion as we doubled down on working capital following the dramatic top line challenges faced in 2015, principally within Valves & Controls.
We're maintaining our 2016 full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.05 per share to $4.25 per share. We made good progress on further reducing the tax rate as demonstrated in the fourth quarter. While this improved tax rate will add just under $0.10 compared to our prior forecast, we've lowered our Valves & Controls forecast by a similar amount, given the degree of margin compression the business has faced due to project pricing and uncertainty around the timing of the recovery in the short-cycle business, which slowed in 2015. Overall, we're pleased to have met our fourth quarter expectations, and our 2016 outlook remains intact. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q4 2015 results. Fourth quarter core sales declined 4%, which is a modest improvement from the 5% decline in the third quarter. Valves & Controls was slightly better than our sales forecast, and the rate of decline is stabilizing in the mid-teens. Water Quality Systems delivered strong 7% core growth. Technical Solutions core sales were flat and Flow & Filtration Solutions showed further signs of stabilization on the top line. Overall, FX remained a headwind in the quarter, and ERICO contributed positively and in line with our commitments.
Segment income declined 7%, and margins were down 90 basis points to 15.9%. As expected, Valves & Controls was the major contributor to the margin contraction, while Water Quality Systems had a very strong margin quarter. Flow & Filtration Solutions had another quarter of margin expansion, which is why we believe this segment is well positioned for further gains in 2016. Due to end-of-the-year tax adjustments, the tax rate in the quarter was favorable, and our full year rate finished just north of 21%. We believe this is an ongoing rate and expect further improvements to the tax rate in 2016.
Free cash flow ended the year at $643 million, which was short of our $700 million forecast. As mentioned, free cash flow has been impacted by working capital timing due to the top line softness we've experienced so quickly, but we expect that free cash flow to return to greater than 100% of adjusted net income in 2016.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss Pentair's Q4 2015 performance elements. Our performance by vertical was similar to the third quarter, with solid gains in Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage being offset by ongoing pressures in both Energy and Industrial. Encouragingly, Infrastructure was flat in the quarter and continued to show signs of stabilization and potential return to growth in 2016.
As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, we had another solid quarter of productivity and with price, they more than offset inflation. Our cost-out actions in Valves & Controls continued through 2015, and we still expect over $135 million in savings to read out in 2016. Negative mix impacted both Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions, but our other 2 segments, Flow & Filtration Solutions and Water Quality Systems, delivered improved margins.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a review of Valves & Controls. The fourth quarter Valves & Controls core sales declined 15%, which is a point better than our forecast and an improvement from the 18% core decline experienced in the third quarter. FX remained a considerable headwind at 7%. Backlog was down 4%, which includes the negative FX translation. Core orders declined 15%, which is consistent with the double-digit rate of decline the business experienced throughout the year. Core sales declined in 3 of the 4 subverticals served by Valves & Controls as mining showed growth in the quarter on the results of one project shipping. 
We continue to see weakness in our short-cycle business as many of our customers have cut their operational budgets in addition to their capital budgets, including scaling back maintenance turnarounds. We do not expect this trend to reverse in the first quarter. We'll remain optimistic that customers will begin spending more on maintenance as 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] progresses. 
As we indicated last quarter, we've seen a trend of customers delaying shipment, but there are a few order cancellations at the current time. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls segment income and margins. While we continued to drive productivity, which offset inflation, it is not nearly enough to overcome the dramatic top line drop experienced during the quarter and the year. We've aggressively been rightsizing the cost structure, but it does take time for the benefits from those actions to read out. In addition, we've seen higher-than-normal margin compression due to pricing pressure within the project business. Mix has also been a headwind to margins as the higher-margin and short-cycle businesses has remained under pressure.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on Slide 8 Valves & Controls backlog is broken down into 4 key subverticals, 3 of which fall into our Energy vertical, Oil & Gas, Power and Mining, and one in our Industrial vertical, which is the Process business. 
Orders declined in all 4 of our subverticals, with Oil & Gas the only business to not decline double digits. As 2015 progressed, we saw customers continue to curtail spending as they assess their long-term plans and adjusted to the reality of lower oil prices. Many expected Oil & Gas to feel the pressure, but delays in project timing have extended to other areas like LNG and petrochem. As stated previously, it has not just been projects that had been delayed or cut. It's clear the customers have been delaying maintenance spending as well. It's still too early to call a bottom. We're encouraged that orders have met our forecast for the second consecutive quarter. It's uncertain when the short-cycle business will return, but maintenance cannot be deferred forever, and we're watching for some signs of improvement beginning the second quarter this year.
Now let's move to Slide 9 to discuss the Q4 performance of Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions had an 8% top line decline, with core sales down 2% and foreign exchange translation of 6% headwind. The fourth quarter showed signs of stabilization with the segment. We continue to expect the business to return to growth in 2016. 
We did see all 4 served verticals contract in the quarter. Food & Beverage was down as growth in our beverage business was not enough to offset the ongoing headwinds within agriculture. We would note that our sales decline in our agriculture-related businesses was not as bad as the overall industry. Residential & Commercial was down due to product line exits we made to better position this business longer-term. While Infrastructure overall was down, this was the result of a tough comparison last year when we had a large filtration project shift. 
We're encouraged to see further improvement with our North America municipal pump business. Segment income was down modestly, but margins expanded 40 basis points to 11.3%. This marks the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion and believe it a positive sign that the actions taken in 2015 positioned the segment for further gains in 2016 and beyond.
Now let's move to Slide 10 to look at Water Quality Systems. We believe that the slower top line growth seen in the third quarter was an anomaly, and the fourth quarter growth performance was validation that Water Quality Systems remains on a positive track. During the quarter, sales grew 4%, which consisted of 7% core sales growth offset by a 3% FX headwind. Both Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage grew at high single-digit rates in the quarter. 
Our Aquatics business led the way once again, and pre-buy activity is a good foretoken that 2016 should be another good year for Aquatics. Our Water Purification business saw favorable growth in Europe, but China remained weak as distributors exhibited caution in their orders -- order patterns. Foodservice had another solid quarter and saw growth return in China after a pause in the third quarter. Segment income grew 30%, and margin expanded an impressive 450 basis points to 22.3%. This dramatic improvement was the combination of strong productivity execution and positive mix on top of an easier comparison against last year's fourth quarter results.
Water Quality Systems has proven to be a consistently high performer, and we remain committed to getting all of our businesses to the same level of performance.
Now let's move to Slide 11 for a look at how Technical Solutions performed in Q4. Technical Solutions reported 23% growth for the quarter, which consisted of flat core sales, a 6% headwind from FX and a 29% positive contribution from ERICO. Industrial sales were down 2% overall as we saw further caution exercised by North American electrical distributors, offset partially by our Industrial heat tracing business. 
Energy was down 3% after growth in the past few quarters as a couple of larger heat tracing projects began to wind down. Infrastructure saw a modest 2% growth following tough year-over-year comparison the past 2 quarters. Residential & Commercial showed strong 7% core growth in the quarter, and ERICO, which generates a large portion of the sales from commercial, track with our expectations. 
Segment income grew 17%, while operating margins contracted 130 basis points to a still strong 22.6%. Principal factor contributing to margin performance in the fourth quarter was more project shipments than product shipments within Industrial heat tracing, and the margin differential between them created a negative mix impact. ERICO met our income expectations, including synergies. While 2016 will see headwinds with the absence of 2 Energy projects and expected first half softness continuing in a short-cycle Industrial business, we remain focused on driving productivity and have taken further cost actions to deliver in this typically high-performance segment.
Let's now turn to Slide 12 for a look at our full year Pentair results. For the full year 2015, our core sales declined 4% as performance in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions was not enough to offset significant challenges faced by Valves & Controls served markets. Segment income declined 12%, and margins contracted 60 basis points to 15.5%. Our tax rate ended the year at just over 21%, which was better than the 23% we projected at the beginning of the year. We believe this improved tax rate is sustainable and would expect further improvement in reducing the tax rate in 2016. 
We're not pleased with our free cash flow performance of $643 million, which represented only 90% of adjusted net income, but we know this is due fully to working capital timing and remain committed to correct it in 2016.
Overall, 2015 was a challenging year where we saw 2 of our segments deliver strong performance, one segment stabilize, and we're addressing the reality of the other segment.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 for the 2016 outlook assumptions. Before I turn the call over to John to provide additional insight on Valves & Controls and to discuss our first quarter and 2016 outlook, I wanted to update you on what has changed since we issued our initial 2016 outlook in mid-December. As you can see on this slide, the majority of our key assumptions remain unchanged. We continue to expect solid performance for our businesses serving Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage. We've seen signs of stabilization within Infrastructure. Industrial is expected to continue to have a challenging first half of the year, but comparisons become less difficult in the second half, and we're encouraged that distributors may begin ordering once again in the back half of the year. Foreign exchange has been tracking to where we plan. We all know that this can change at any time. 
The one area that has worsened is Energy, particularly the further decline seen in the price of oil. We've seen several major energy companies announce capital expenditure plans and call for additional 20% plus cuts following similar reductions in 2015. Further the delays in the short-cycle business give us pause. Don't expect any signs of improvement in the first quarter, and we'll watch the second quarter trends closely to see if customers stop deferring their maintenance spending. The other bright spot we have is the improvement in our tax rate. This added structural improvement provides an offset to the further weakening in Energy and gives us increased confidence in maintaining our full year guidance.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

We thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our Valves & Controls business and the further deteriorating conditions that it's faced since issuing our initial 2006 (sic) [2016] guidan",921,"Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #14 titled V&C Update. We thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our Valves & Controls business and the further deteriorating conditions that it's faced since issuing our initial 2006 (sic) [2016] guidance last December. We continue to see pressure on incoming orders and now expect orders to be down as much as 5% for the full year of 2016. The well-publicized decline in oil prices is just one of the factors that leads us to remain cautious about the timing of order stabilization, but even more, we are watching the short-cycle business for signs that customers will begin to accelerate maintenance spending. As a result, we have modestly lowered our full year revenue forecast for 2016. 
We continue to see pricing pressure on the project side of the business, and this shows up as margin compression. While we have aggressively implemented cost-out actions, we expect industry uncertainty to persist, and we plan to remove additional cost from the business. When forecasting where we see sales and orders, coupled with further anticipated margin compression, we now are forecasting return on sales in Valves & Controls to be 100 basis points lower than our original forecast at 10.5%.
Please turn to Slide #15 labeled Noncash Goodwill Impairment. We performed Step 1 of our goodwill impairment analysis as required by the accounting rules and concluded that the fair value of Valves & Controls is below its carrying value. The carrying value was determined when we completed the Flow Control merger in 2012 when oil was over $100 that year. Since 2012, the energy industry has reset significantly, and uncertainty remains around the timing of any recovery. We are finalizing the analysis, but we currently estimate that there will be a noncash impairment charge in the range of $400 million to $600 million to be recorded at the time that our 10-K is published.
Please turn to Slide #16 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet changed significantly with the closing of the ERICO acquisition. We added the -- ended the year with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. While our balance sheet leveraged at 3.75x, higher than our targeted 2.5 leverage ratio, we expect to bring net leverage ratio to around 3.3 by the end of 2016. 
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.9% as our operating income came under pressure with the top line challenges experienced within our Valves & Controls segment. Although free cash flow ended the year at roughly 90% of adjusted net income, this was due exclusively to working capital timing, and we expect a 100% conversion rate in 2016.
Please turn to Slide #17 labeled Q1 2016 Pentair Outlook. For the first quarter, we expect core sales to be up a modest 1% and total sales to grow 7% inclusive of FX headwinds in the ERICO acquisition. On a core sales basis, we expect Valves & Controls to be down roughly 7%, which is a slower rate of decline than we experienced throughout 2015. 
Flow & Filtration systems core sales are expected to be up 4% on an easier year-over-year comparison than project shipment timing. Water Quality Systems core sales are anticipated to increase approximately 5% on continued strength in Aquatics. 
Finally, Technical Solutions core sales are expected to be up 4% as Industrial heat tracing and electronics helped to offset ongoing sluggishness in Enclosures. We have not made any changes to our ERICO forecast or expectations around synergies. We are expecting segment income to decrease modestly and return on sales to contract 110 basis points.
Below the operating line, we expect an improved tax rate of around 20.5%. Net interest and other around $33 million and the share count around 183 million. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.70 to $0.72, which is roughly a 7% year-over-year decline.
We expect historically typical free cash flow usage in the first quarter, but turning positive as the year progresses as we continue to focus on improving our working capital performance.
Please turn to Slide #18 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook or $4.05 to $4.25, although the components have changed some from our initial outlook provided in December. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline approximately 2%. Valves & Controls core sales are now anticipated to be down 8%, which is 3 points worse than our original forecast as I highlighted a few slides ago. We now expect Flow & Filtration core sales to be up modestly for the full year. Water Quality Systems core sales are anticipated to grow approximately 4%, and Technical Solutions core sales are expected to decline 4% for the full year. 
We expect segment income to be up 9%, and return on sales to expand 100 basis points to 16.5% with 3 of our 4 segments delivering full year margin expansion. We expect overall corporate cost to be approximately $90 million; net interest and other to be around $135 million; our full year tax rate to be around 20.5% and the share count for the full year to be around 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 5% at the midpoint of the range. 
Finally, we expect the strong year of free cash flow; expect it to be approximately 100% of adjusted net income with our working capital opportunities providing potential upside. 
Jordan, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

We are pleased with our first quarter results, beating the expectations set at the beginning of the year. The top line was consistent with expectations, and we saw strong execution on all businesses led by 3 segmen",2633,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results, beating the expectations set at the beginning of the year. The top line was consistent with expectations, and we saw strong execution on all businesses led by 3 segments delivering over 100 basis points of margin expansion each. 
We recently announced a new leader for our Valves & Controls segment. We're all glad to have Dennis Cassidy [indiscernible] join us, most recently from Alex Partners. I appreciate John Stauch leaning in and leading Valves & Controls the past few quarters. The Valves & Controls business delivered first quarter results in line with our guidance. 
The Integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations, and we believe we are on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. 
Free cash flow, while seasonally usage during the quarter, was much better than the comparable period last year. Given the stronger start to free cash flow this year, we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash this year. 
We are maintaining our 2016 full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 per share. Execution for cash and earnings remain our key focus and the first quarter gives us a good start to the year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q1 2016 results in more detail. First quarter core sales grew 1%, which was an improvement from the declines we saw the past couple quarters. 3 of our 4 segments met or beat their top line commitments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions being negatively impacted by timing of beverage shipments. ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with our expectations. 
Segment income increased 5%, and return on sales contracted 20 basis points to 13.3%. 3 segments delivered margin expansion greater than 100 basis points, and Valves & Controls met its first quarter income and margin commitments. 
Adjusted EPS was flat at $0.76 per share and was ahead of our guidance of $0.70 to $0.72 per share. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow started much better this year with a small usage in the quarter, and it was over $100 million improvement year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more details on Pentair's Q1 2016 performance. Our sales performance by vertical was mixed with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and in Infrastructure, which helped partially offset continued sluggishness in Energy. We saw some signs of stabilization in our Industrial businesses, and while Food & Beverage was down in the quarter, we continue to believe this vertical will deliver full year growth as shipments in our beverage business can be choppy. 
Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 11% sales growth to start the year, led by double-digit growth in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions and solid growth in Flow & Filtration Solutions. Infrastructure did turn positive on strength in both North American municipal pumps and improved project activity in our Process Filtration business globally. The rate of decline within Industrial moderated for the quarter and we are encouraged by what we believe are signs of stabilization in this, our second largest vertical. 
Food & Beverage started the year slowly, impacting our Flow & Filtration Solution results, but those principal due to result of timing on beverage shipments, as I mentioned, and ongoing weakness in irrigation. 
It's no surprise that energy remains weak, and while we expected this vertical to continue to be down this year, we believe our nonenergy businesses are positioned to more than compensate for this weakness. Energy now represents just over 20% of our sales and even smaller percentage of our profits. We continue to believe the remaining 80% of our portfolio is well-positioned, particularly within Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage verticals. 
As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. Price was a modest positive in the quarter, and ERICO contributed strength to the bottom line on strong underlying performance and synergies.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a review of our segment and major platform structure. We want to remind everyone on the alignment of our businesses, which we introduced at our Investor Day last November. Underneath our 4 segments, we grouped activities into 10 Strategic Business Groups, or SBGs, to better prioritize our resource allocation across the company. We'll discuss the SBG performance within each segment. For a more detailed look at each SBG, please refer to our presentation on our website from the 2015 Investor Day. 
Our Water business is split between 2 segments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions focused around a solutions approach and Water Quality Systems business online by product distribution. Technical Solutions has 3 well-positioned electrical businesses, and we've realigned our Valves & Controls business around 2 key selling motions, aftermarket and projects. The key distinction on all of these SBGs is that we can differentiate investments more clearly between them. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q1. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 9% core sales growth. The Aquatics & Environmental Systems business grew 13% organically as the North American pool season got off to a strong start and aquaculture continue to grow nicely. 
Water Filtration grew core sales 5%, with particular strength continuing in our Residential Filtration business. 
Segment income grew an impressive 19%, and return on sales expanded 170 basis points to 18.6%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter, even as we increased our growth investments to maintain the strong momentum that Water Quality Systems have delivered the past several years.
Now let's move to Slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q1. Flow and Filtration saw revenue declined 4%, with core sales down 2% and negative FX translation of another 2%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the first quarter, and while the Infrastructure growth was as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by the timing of those beverage shipments. We're encouraged with double-digit order growth in beverage, but given this current state of consolidation in the beer industry in particular, choppiness in sales is expected to be a trend quarter-to-quarter in the near term. 
Water Technology saw core sales declined 1% as strength in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure pump shipments more than offset by double-digit declines in irrigation pump shipments. We believe the strength in Residential & Commercial will continue into the seasonally strong second quarter, and the longer cycle infrastructure business will continue to grow based on the solid backlog and a strong quote funnel.
Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 5% due to the previously mentioned delays in beverage shipments, but our precision spray business grew in the quarter. Process Filtration had good core sales growth of 4% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on industrial water reuse solutions and some improvement in Infrastructure, which includes a couple of desalination projects. 
Segment income grew 9%, and return on sale expanded 130 basis points to 11.7%. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, as our execution has improved within the segment. Still, we believe there's a long runway ahead for further margin improvement, particularly when the top line returns to growth. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss our Technical Solutions performance in Q1. Technical Solutions reported 33% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 5% core sales growth, a 2% headwind from FX and a 30% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in Enclosures declined 5% due to the pressure we saw in our short cycle industrial business late last year persisted. While the year-over-year comparisons are expected to remain challenging in the second quarter, we are encouraged to see stabilization in the daily order rate in the quarter and continue to expect easier comparisons in the back half of the year as a result. 
Thermal Management experienced impressive core sales growth of 22% as 2 projects in Canada are nearing completion. Industrial heat tracing business continues to see wins in a smaller project business while its more profitable product business remains weak. The thermal building business also had a strong quarter. 
While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO sales are into commercial end markets, which remained very healthy in the quarter. We believe we are on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business attractive profitability. 
Segment income grew 45% and return on sales expanded an impressive 190 basis points to 21.5%. Despite negative mix in Thermal Management and some price pressures in Enclosures, strong productivity and the positive contribution from ERICO helped drive margin expansion in the quarter.
While core sales are expected to turn negative for the remainder of the year due to the 2 large thermal projects ending, we believe Technical Solutions is well-positioned to deliver strong income growth and margin expansion due in large part to strong execution with the ERICO integration and a strong culture around productivity across the whole segment. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q1. Valves & Controls reported a 10% decline in revenue, with core sales down 7% and a 3% headwind from FX. Most importantly, the top line was in line with our expectations. Backlog was down 2% sequentially which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 11% year-over-year consistent with the double-digit rate of decline that's been experienced the past several quarters. Core sales were down 9% in aftermarket and down 4% in projects as the business continues to shift out of backlog. We expected aftermarket to start the year slowly as customers were finalizing their budgets, and OpEx continues to be constrained right along with the CapEx at many customers. 
In the second quarter, we'll watch closely both aftermarket sales and orders, but we remain very cautious since whether energy markets have found bottom. 
The right half of the page shows first quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecast. It was just under 1 year ago when we saw an acceleration in the rate of decline in the business, and I asked John to step in and lead the business on an interim basis as we search for a new leader of the segment, which of course we just recently filled. I'm very pleased with the entire Valves & Controls leadership team's resilience during these difficult times, and I want to personally thank them for their tenacious leadership. While the business continues watching for signs of stabilization and orders, they have accomplished a lot the past several quarters in rightsizing the business to today's hard reality. We believe for some time that the downturn in energy is more than cyclical, and we've acted accordingly. Over the past 12 months, we've realigned the business to reflect the energy industry declines, resulting in headcount reductions of over 20%. It hasn't been easy, but it was necessary. I would also like to point out that these rightsizing actions were started a year ago and are on top of what we've already accomplished since we acquired the business 3.5 years ago. To put it in perspective, we reduced the number of ERPs, accounting centers and other back office functions by over 40%, and the manufacturing footprint is 30% smaller. While these are steps in the right direction, there are still more opportunity and work to be done. Under Dennis's leadership and with a strong team in place, we believe the Valves & Controls will be well-positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets. While we expect revenue recover to be a couple of years away, we continue to take actions aimed at improving profitability even this year. 
So the 6.5% return on sales in Q1 is not indicative of our current cost structure. We expect improved margins each quarter this year as 2015's higher cost inventory works its way through the income statement in the first half. Our prior communication of $100 million in cost-out benefit in 2016 is on track, and we continue to expect to exit the year with margins in the team and full year margins just north of 10% even on muted sales. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on this slide, short cycle orders were down 5% and long cycle orders declined 18%. The short cycle weakness was more acute in Europe, but the U.S. also was weak as customers continue to defer maintenance. This was not just in oil and gas but also in power and mining. We watch orders closely to see when customers begin to start spending OpEx once again. 
The weakness on the project side was broad-based with CapEx budgets being cut across the board. The quoting funnel appears to be slowly improving, particularly in LNG and petrochem, but we're not expecting a big increase in orders. We continue to believe there's potential for orders to find the bottom in the second half in projects though. Second quarter orders will be instructive and seat the quote funnel begins to bear fruit and we remain cautious and interested to see if there are signs of stabilization in the short cycle business. We'll continue to focus on capitalizing on opportunities, particularly where we can leverage the breadth of the entire Valves & Controls portfolio.
Now let's move to Slide 13 to provide an update on our segment positioning. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, I wanted to provide an update on our segment positioning and comment on the reordering of the segments. While Valves & Controls has received a lot of attention the past 18 months, the business has worked to aggressively reposition itself in the face of a significant reset in the energy industry and now the segment's expected to contribute only 15% of this year's Pentair income. We believe the other 85% of the portfolio is well-positioned and we remain excited about the opportunities in these other 3 segments. 
We have 2 high-performing segments today in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions has made good progress in improving its margin and cash flow wile positioning for return to growth. This chart shows the progress against each segment's priorities. We introduced these priorities at our Investor Day last November and highlighted them once again in our 2016 outlook call last December. Both Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions have continued to perform, and we believe they're well-positioned to build on their momentum. We're encouraged with the improvements in margin and cash flow at Flow & Filtration Solutions. And as the business continues to gain traction and moving to a solutions provider from a manufacturing component, we expect organic growth to not only return but to become more consistent and predictable given their portfolio is well aligned to grow with macro trends, particularly in Food & Beverage.
So 2016 has started off as we expected. We believe our water and electrical businesses are well-positioned to continue delivering strong results, and Valves & Controls has become a smaller piece of the portfolio as a result of the energy reset, and we are making good progress in stabilizing and rightsizing that business. Cash and earnings execution remain the mantra for 2016, and we are focused on delivering our commitments to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

We ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of net debt, inclusive of cash on hand. This is a slight increase from our year-end debt levels due to seasonal working capital build, particularly in our Residential & Commercial businesses. As Randy mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was over $100 million better to start the year versus the comparable period last year. While we did consume minimal cash in the quarter in line with historical patterns, we continue to expect to deliver our free cash flow target of approximately $750 million for the year. 
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our capital expenditure forecast remains unchanged at approximately $150 million as we continue to invest in the businesses that have earned the right to grow, especially Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions, and drive deeper disciplines into our Valves & Controls factories.
Please turn to Slide  15 labeled Q2 2016 Pentair Outlook. For the second quarter, we expect core sales to decline approximately 3% and total sales to increase 4%, inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. On a core sales basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 5% as the segment enters its seasonally strongest period. Flow & Filtration Solutions' core sales are expected to be up modestly as the business continues to reposition itself and comparisons become easier. Technical Solutions is expected to have a core sales decline of roughly 3% as 2 projects in the Thermal Management business are completed. And Enclosures faces another tough year-over-year comparison. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are expected to decline approximately 13% as the project backlog remains weak and we remain cautious in the short-term as to whether the aftermarket business will accelerate after the slow start to the year. We are expecting segment income to increase approximately 5% and return on sales to be roughly flat at 16.5%.
Below the operating income line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest and other to approximately $35 million and shares outstanding to be just over $182 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.11, which is an increase of approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect seasonal ramp-up in free cash flow and further improvement in our working capital performance.
Please turn to Slide 16 labeled Full-year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 with very few changes to our prior forecast. For the full year, we still expect total Pentair core sales to decline approximately 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 5% as both Aquatic and Environmental Systems and water filtration businesses are well-positioned to continue driving the growth rates experienced the last several years. Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales are expected to be up approximately 2% for the full year, led by stabilization in Water Technologies and growth in both Fluid Solutions and Process Filtration. Technical Solutions is expected to see core sales decline roughly 2%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast as the Thermal Management backlog has grown, and we have seen stabilization in Enclosures daily order rates. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are still expected to decline roughly 8%, given our current view of orders for the full year.
We expect segment income to grow roughly 9%, and return on sales to expand approximately 90 basis points to 16.5%, with 3 of our 4 segments delivering full year margin expansion. We continue to anticipate full year corporate cost to be just over $90 million, net interest and other roughly $140 million and the share count to be just over 182 million, all essentially in line with previous expectations. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up approximately 5% at the midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect a strong year of free cash flow at [ph] approximately $750 million, which represents roughly 100% of our adjusted net income.

One area where he will be very focused is on these 2 value streams, aftermarket and projects and tuning, if you will, the business, so that we can really focus on the aftermarket, so that if it comes back, we can gain share there. I think as we've said before, we really didn't differentiate the way we serve the aftermarket versus project.

I think where the big opportunity is and where Dennis is focusing is how do we improve the linearization within a quarter of how we are shipping, how do we reduce the inefficiencies, these are all great tools that lean brings that tool to the table. And I think as far as the distribution and the outside service centers, we have 43 independent service centers that aren't part of a current distribution center or customers factory. I think the customers going to help define that for us over the next 3 to 4 years because moving in-house into their operations is where we see it going because eliminating that brick-and-mortar between us and them seems to be where the industry is heading. So can't give you specifics, but I think there's an opportunities in both of those areas.

We were pleased with our first quarter results, beating the expectations set at the beginning of the year. The top line was consistent with expectations, and we saw strong execution on all businesses, led by 3 segments delivering over 100 basis points of margin expansion each. 
We recently announced a new leader for our Valves & Controls segment. We're all glad to have Dennis Cassidy join us, most recently from AlixPartners. I appreciate John Stauch leaning in and leading Valves & Controls the past few quarters. And Valves & Controls business delivered first quarter results in line with our guidance. 
Integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations, and we believe we're on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. 
Free cash flow, while seasonally usage during the quarter, was much better than the comparable period last year. Given the stronger start to free cash flow this year, we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash this year. 
We're maintaining our 2016 full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 per share. Execution for cash and earnings remain our key focus, and the first quarter gave us a good start to the year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q1 2016 results in more detail. First quarter core sales grew 1%, which was an improvement from the declines we saw in the past couple quarters. 3 of our 4 segments met or beat their top line commitments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions being negatively impacted by timing of beverage shipments. ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with our expectations. 
Segment income increased 5%, and return on sales contracted 20 basis points to 13.3%. Three segments delivered margin expansion greater than 100 basis points, and Valves & Controls met its first quarter income and margin commitments. 
Adjusted EPS was flat at $0.76 per share and was ahead of our guidance of $0.70 to $0.72 per share. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow started much better this year with a small usage in the quarter and was over $100 million improvement year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more details on Pentair's Q1 2016 performance. Our sales performance by vertical was mixed with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and in Infrastructure, which helped partially offset continued sluggishness in Energy. We saw some signs of stabilization in our Industrial businesses, and while Food & Beverage was down in the quarter, we continue to believe this vertical will deliver full year growth as shipments in our beverage business can be choppy. 
Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 11% sales growth to start the year, led by double-digit growth in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions and solid growth in Flow & Filtration Solutions. Infrastructure did turn positive on strength in both North American municipal pumps and improved project activity in our Process Filtration business globally. The rate of decline within Industrial moderated for the quarter and we're encouraged by what we believe are signs of stabilization in this, our second largest vertical. 
Food & Beverage started the year slowly, impacting our Flow & Filtration Solution results, but it's principally the results of timing around beverage shipments, as I mentioned, and ongoing weakness in irrigation. 
It's no surprise that energy remains weak, and while we expected this vertical to continue to be down this year, we believe our nonenergy businesses are positioned to more than compensate for this weakness. Energy now represents just over 20% of our sales and an even smaller percentage of our profits. We continue to believe the remaining 80% of our portfolio is well positioned, particularly within Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage verticals. 
As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. Price was a modest positive in the quarter, and ERICO contributed strength to the bottom line on strong underlying performance and synergies.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a review of our segment and major platform structure. We want to remind everyone on the alignment of our businesses, which we introduced at our Investor Day last November. Underneath our 4 segments, we grouped activities into 10 Strategic Business Groups, or SBGs, to better prioritize our resource allocation across the company. We'll discuss the SBG performance within each segment. For a more detailed look at each SBG, please refer to our presentation on our website from the 2015 Investor Day. 
Our Water business is split between 2 segments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions focused around a solutions approach and Water Quality Systems business aligned by product distribution. Technical Solutions has 3 well-positioned electrical businesses, and we've realigned our Valves & Controls business around 2 key selling motions: aftermarket and projects. The key distinction on all of these SBGs is that we can differentiate the investments more clearly between them. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q1. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 9% core sales growth. The Aquatics & Environmental Systems business grew 13% organically as the North American pool season got off to a strong start and aquaculture continued to grow nicely. 
Water Filtration grew core sales 5%, with particular strength continuing in our Residential Filtration business. 
Segment income grew an impressive 19%, and return on sales expanded 170 basis points to 18.6%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter, even as we increased our growth investments to maintain the strong momentum that Water Quality Systems has delivered the past several years.
Now let's move to Slide 9 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q1. Flow & Filtration saw revenue declined 4%, with core sales down 2% and negative FX translation of another 2%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the first quarter, and while the Infrastructure growth was as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by the timing of those beverage shipments. We're encouraged with double-digit order growth in beverage, but given this current state of consolidation in the beer industry in particular, choppiness in sales is expected to be a trend quarter-to-quarter in the near term. 
Water Technology saw core sales declined 1% as strength in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double-digit declines in irrigation pump shipments. We believe the strength in Residential & Commercial will continue into the seasonally strong second quarter, and the longer-cycle Infrastructure business will continue to grow based on a solid backlog and a strong quote funnel.
Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 5% due to the previously mentioned delays in beverage shipments, but our precision spray business grew in the quarter. Process Filtration had good core sales growth of 4% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on industrial water reuse solutions and some improvement in Infrastructure, which includes a couple of desalination projects. 
Segment income grew 9%, and return on sales expanded 130 basis points to 11.7%. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion as our execution has improved within the segment. Still, we believe there's a long runway ahead for further margin improvement, particularly when the top line returns to growth. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in Q1. Technical Solutions reported 33% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 5% core sales growth, a 2% headwind from FX and a 30% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in Enclosures declined 5% due to the pressure we saw in our short-cycle Industrial business late last year persisted. While the year-over-year comparisons are expected to remain challenging in the second quarter, we were encouraged to see stabilization in the daily order rate in the quarter and continue to expect easier comparisons in the back half of the year as a result. 
Thermal Management experienced impressive core sales growth of 22% as 2 projects in Canada are nearing completion. The Industrial heat tracing business continues to see wins in a smaller project business while its more profitable products business remains weak. The Thermal Building business also had a strong quarter. 
While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO sales are into commercial end markets, which remained very healthy in the quarter. We believe we are on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business attractive profitability. 
Segment income grew 45% and return on sales expanded an impressive 190 basis points to 21.5%. Despite negative mix in Thermal Management and some price pressures in Enclosures, strong productivity and the positive contribution from ERICO helped drive margin expansion in the quarter.
While core sales are expected to turn negative for the remainder of the year due to the 2 large thermal projects ending, we believe Technical Solutions is well positioned to deliver strong income growth and margin expansion due in large part to strong execution with the ERICO integration and a strong culture around productivity across the whole segment. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q1. Valves & Controls reported a 10% decline in revenue, with core sales down 7% and a 3% headwind from FX. Most importantly, the top line was in line with our expectations. Backlog was down 2% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 11% year-over-year, consistent with the double-digit rate of decline that's been experienced the past several quarters. Core sales were down 9% in aftermarket and down 4% in projects as the business continues to shift out of backlog. We expected aftermarket to start the year slowly as customers were finalizing their budgets, and OpEx continues to be constrained right along with the CapEx at many customers. 
In the second quarter, we'll watch closely both aftermarket sales and orders, but we remain very cautious since it is clear whether energy markets have found bottom. 
The right half of the page shows first quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecast. It was just under 1 year ago when we saw an acceleration in the rate of decline in the business, and I asked John to step in and lead the business on an interim basis as we search for a new leader of the segment, which of course we just recently filled. I'm very pleased with the entire Valves & Controls leadership team's resilience during these difficult times, and I want to personally thank them for their tenacious leadership. While the business continues watching for signs of stabilization in orders, they have accomplished a lot the past several quarters in rightsizing the business to today's hard reality. We believe for some time that the downturn in Energy is more than cyclical, and we have acted accordingly. Over the past 12 months, we've realigned the business to reflect the energy industry declines, resulting in headcount reductions of over 20%. This hasn't been easy, but it was necessary. I would also like to point out that these rightsizing actions were started a year ago and are on top of what we've already accomplished since we acquired the business 3.5 years ago. To put it in perspective, we reduced the number of ERPs, accounting centers and other back office functions by over 40%, and the manufacturing footprint is 30% smaller. While these are steps in the right direction, there's still more opportunity and work to be done. Under Dennis's leadership and with a strong team in place, we believe that Valves & Controls will be well positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets. While we expect revenue recover to be a couple of years away, we continue to take actions aimed at improving profitability even this year. 
So the 6.5% return on sales in Q1 is not indicative of our current cost structure. We expect improved margins each quarter this year as 2015's higher cost inventory works its way through the income statement in the first half. Our prior communication of $100 million in cost-out benefit in 2016 is on track, and we continue to expect to exit the year with margins in the teens and full year margins just north of 10%, even on muted sales. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on this slide, short cycle orders were down 5% and long-cycle orders declined 18%. The short-cycle weakness was more acute in Europe, but the U.S. also was weak as customers continue to defer maintenance. This was not just in oil and gas but also in power and mining. We watch orders closely to see when customers begin to start spending OpEx once again. 
The weakness on the project side was broad based with CapEx budgets being cut across the board. The quoting funnel appears to be slowly improving, particularly in LNG and petrochem, but we're not expecting a big increase in orders. We continue to believe there's potential for orders to find the bottom in the second half in projects though. Second quarter orders will be instructive in seeing if the quote funnel begins to bear fruit, and we'll remain cautious and interested to see if there are signs of stabilization in the short-cycle business. We will continue to focus on capitalizing on opportunities, particularly where we can leverage the breadth of the entire Valves & Controls portfolio.
Now let's move to Slide 13 to provide an update on our segment positioning. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, I wanted to provide an update on our segment positioning and comment on the reordering of the segments. While Valves & Controls has received a lot of attention in the past 18 months, the business has worked to aggressively reposition itself in the face of a significant reset in the energy industry and now the segment is expected to contribute only 15% of this year's Pentair income. We believe the other 85% of the portfolio is well positioned, and we remain excited about the opportunities in these other 3 segments. 
We have 2 high-performing segments today in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions has made good progress in improving its margin and cash flow while positioning for a return to growth. This chart shows the progress against each segment's priorities. We introduced these priorities at our Investor Day last November and highlighted them once again in our 2016 outlook call last December. Both Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions have continued to perform, and we believe they're well positioned to build on their momentum. We're encouraged with the improvements in margin and cash flow at Flow & Filtration Solutions. And as the business continues to gain traction and moving to a solutions provider from a manufacturer component, we expect organic growth to not only return but to become more consistent and predictable, given their portfolio is well aligned to grow with macro trends, particularly in Food & Beverage.
So 2016 has started off as we expected. We believe our water and electrical businesses are well positioned to continue delivering strong results, and Valves & Controls has become a smaller piece of the portfolio as a result of the energy reset, and we're making good progress in stabilizing and rightsizing that business. Cash and earnings execution remain the mantra for 2016, and we're focused on delivering our commitments to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

Please turn to Slide #14 titled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of net debt, inclusive of cash on hand.

We ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of net debt, inclusive of cash on hand. This is a slight increase from our year-end debt levels due to seasonal working capital build, particularly in our Residential & Commercial businesses. As Randy mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was over $100 million better to start the year versus the comparable period last year. While we did consume minimal cash in the quarter, in line with historical patterns, we continue to expect to deliver our free cash flow target of approximately $750 million for the year. 
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our capital expenditure forecast remains unchanged at approximately $150 million as we continue to invest in the businesses that have earned the right to grow, especially Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions, and drive deeper disciplines into our Valves & Controls factories.
Please turn to Slide  15 labeled Q2 2016 Pentair Outlook. For the second quarter, we expect core sales to decline approximately 3% and total sales to increase 4%, inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. On a core sales basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 5% as the segment enters its seasonally strongest period. Flow & Filtration Solutions' core sales are expected to be up modestly as the business continues to reposition itself and comparisons become easier. Technical Solutions is expected to have a core sales decline of roughly 3% as 2 projects in the Thermal Management business are completed. And Enclosures faces another tough year-over-year comparison. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are expected to decline approximately 13% as the project backlog remains weak, and we remain cautious in the short term as to whether the aftermarket business will accelerate after the slow start to the year. We are expecting segment income to increase approximately 5% and return on sales to be roughly flat at 16.5%.
Below the operating income line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be just over $182 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.11, which is an increase of approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect a seasonal ramp-up in free cash flow and further improvement in our working capital performance.
Please turn to Slide 16 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 with very few changes to our prior forecast. For the full year, we still expect total Pentair core sales to decline approximately 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 5% as both its Aquatic & Environmental Systems and Water Filtration businesses are well positioned to continue driving the growth rates experienced the last several years. Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales are expected to be up approximately 2% for the full year, led by stabilization in Water Technologies and growth in both Fluid Solutions and Process Filtration. Technical Solutions is expected to see core sales decline roughly 2%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast as the Thermal Management backlog has grown, and we have seen stabilization in Enclosures' daily order rates. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are still expected to decline roughly 8%, given our current view of orders for the full year.
We expect segment income to grow roughly 9% and return on sales to expand approximately 90 basis points to 16.5%, with 3 of our 4 segments delivering full year margin expansion. We continue to anticipate full year corporate cost to be just over $90 million, net interest and other roughly $140 million and the share count to be just over 182 million, all essentially in line with previous expectations. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up approximately 5% at the midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect a strong year of free cash flow at approximately $750 million, which represents roughly 100% of our adjusted net income.

But in the next several years, or at least the longer term for however long we have the debt in place, we don't see any impact to our overall tax rate.

So we would have to take advantage of our operational synergies to get to those tax synergies that we would have.

Customers are always going to retime you. But if you look at that over a period of time, it's always a percentage of the backlog. And what happens as people work deep in the business is they have a lot of hope in their forecast, that everything is going to be good and nothing bad is going to happen.

I think where the big opportunity is and where Dennis is focusing is how do we improve the linearization within a quarter of how we're shipping? How do we reduce the inefficiencies? These are all great tools that -- lean brings that tool to the table. And I think as far as the distribution and the outside service centers, we have 43 independent service centers that aren't part of a current distribution center or a customer's factory. I think the customers are going to help define that for us over the next 3 to 4 years because moving in-house into their operations is where we see it going because eliminating that brick-and-mortar between us and them seems to be where the industry is heading. So can't give you specifics, but I think there's opportunities in both of those areas. But I'd say on the factory side, I wouldn't expect very many closures in the next several years.

So what Karl and his team have done is they're replicating the kind of coverage, the direct dealer coverage, on the other side of distribution in order to drive brand and drive product adoption and get customer intimacy and can voice the customer back to our product. So a lot of the investments are actually on the sales side, and that's global. And we're doing it in the United States, around Europe and Canada, less so in -- it's a different kind of coverage investment in the rest of the emerging markets. But I'm quite excited about the early returns on that. I don't think it's really affected our numbers yet, but it's given us great insight. And I'm expecting great things."

We were pleased with our first quarter results, beating the expectations set at the beginning of the year. The top line was consistent with expectations, and we saw strong execution on all businesses, led by 3 segments delivering over 100 basis points of margin expansion each. 
We recently announced a new leader for our Valves & Controls segment. We're all glad to have Dennis Cassidy join us, most recently from AlixPartners. I appreciate John Stauch leaning in and leading Valves & Controls the past few quarters. And Valves & Controls business delivered first quarter results in line with our guidance. 
Integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations, and we believe we're on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. 
Free cash flow, while seasonally usage during the quarter was much better than the comparable period last year. Given the stronger start to free cash flow this year, we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash this year. 
We're maintaining our 2016 full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 per share. Execution for cash and earnings remain our key focus, and the first quarter gave us a good start to the year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q1 2016 results in more detail. First quarter core sales grew 1%, which was an improvement from the declines we saw in the past couple quarters. 3 of our 4 segments met or beat their top line commitments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions being negatively impacted by timing of beverage shipments. ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with our expectations. 
Segment income increased 5%, and return on sales contracted 20 basis points to 13.3%. Three segments delivered margin expansion greater than 100 basis points, and Valves & Controls met its first quarter income and margin commitments. 
Adjusted EPS was flat at $0.76 per share and was ahead of our guidance of $0.70 to $0.72 per share. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow started much better this year with a small usage in the quarter and was over $100 million improvement year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more details on Pentair's Q1 2016 performance. Our sales performance by vertical was mixed with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and in Infrastructure, which helped partially offset continued sluggishness in Energy. We saw some signs of stabilization in our Industrial businesses, and while Food & Beverage was down in the quarter, we continue to believe this vertical will deliver full year growth as shipments in our beverage business can be choppy. 
Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 11% sales growth to start the year, led by double-digit growth in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions and solid growth in Flow & Filtration Solutions. Infrastructure did turn positive on strength in both North American municipal pumps and improved project activity in our Process Filtration business globally. The rate of decline within Industrial moderated for the quarter and we're encouraged by what we believe are signs of stabilization in this, our second largest vertical. 
Food & Beverage started the year slowly, impacting our Flow & Filtration Solution results, but it's principally the results of timing around beverage shipments, as I mentioned, and ongoing weakness in irrigation. 
It's no surprise that energy remains weak, and while we expected this vertical to continue to be down this year, we believe our nonenergy businesses are positioned to more than compensate for this weakness. Energy now represents just over 20% of our sales and an even smaller percentage of our profits. We continue to believe the remaining 80% of our portfolio is well positioned, particularly within Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage verticals. 
As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. Price was a modest positive in the quarter, and ERICO contributed strength to the bottom line on strong underlying performance and synergies.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a review of our segment and major platform structure. We want to remind everyone on the alignment of our businesses, which we introduced at our Investor Day last November. Underneath our 4 segments we grouped activities into 10 Strategic Business Groups, or SBGs, to better prioritize our resource allocation across the company. We'll discuss the SBG performance within each segment. For a more detailed look at each SBG, please refer to our presentation on our website from the 2015 Investor Day. 
Our Water business is split between 2 segments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions focused around a solutions approach and Water Quality Systems business aligned by product distribution. Technical Solutions has 3 well-positioned electrical businesses, and we've realigned our Valves & Controls business around 2 key selling motions: aftermarket and projects. The key distinction on all of these SBGs is that we can differentiate the investments more clearly between them. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q1. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 9% core sales growth. The Aquatics & Environmental Systems business grew 13% organically as the North American pool season got off to a strong start and aquaculture continued to grow nicely. 
Water Filtration grew core sales 5%, with particular strength continuing in our Residential Filtration business. 
Segment income grew an impressive 19%, and return on sales expanded 170 basis points to 18.6%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter, even as we increased our growth investments to maintain the strong momentum that Water Quality Systems has delivered the past several years.
Now let's move to Slide 9 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q1. Flow & Filtration saw revenue decline 4%, with core sales down 2% and negative FX translation of another 2%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the first quarter, and while the Infrastructure growth was as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by the timing of those beverage shipments. We're encouraged with double-digit order growth in beverage, but given this current state of consolidation in the beer industry in particular, choppiness in sales is expected to be a trend quarter-to-quarter in the near term. 
Water Technology saw core sales decline 1% as strength in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double-digit declines in irrigation pump shipments. We believe the strength in Residential & Commercial will continue into the seasonally strong second quarter, and the longer-cycle Infrastructure business will continue to grow based on a solid backlog and a strong quote funnel.
Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 5% due to the previously mentioned delays in beverage shipments, but our precision spray business grew in the quarter. Process Filtration had good core sales growth of 4% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on industrial water reuse solutions and some improvement in Infrastructure, which includes a couple of desalination projects. 
Segment income grew 9%, and return on sales expanded 130 basis points to 11.7%. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion as our execution has improved within the segment. Still, we believe there's a long runway ahead for further margin improvement, particularly when the top line returns to growth. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in Q1. Technical Solutions reported 33% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 5% core sales growth, a 2% headwind from FX and a 30% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in Enclosures declined 5% due to the pressure we saw in our short-cycle Industrial business late last year persisted. While the year-over-year comparisons are expected to remain challenging in the second quarter, we were encouraged to see stabilization in the daily order rate in the quarter and continue to expect easier comparisons in the back half of the year as a result. 
Thermal Management experienced impressive core sales growth of 22% as 2 projects in Canada are nearing completion. The Industrial heat tracing business continues to see wins in its smaller project business while its more profitable products business remains weak. The Thermal Building business also had a strong quarter. 
While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO sales are in commercial end markets, which remained very healthy in the quarter. We believe we are on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business attractive profitability. 
Segment income grew 45% and return on sales expanded an impressive 190 basis points to 21.5%. Despite negative mix in Thermal Management and some price pressures in Enclosures, strong productivity and the positive contribution from ERICO helped drive margin expansion in the quarter.
While core sales are expected to turn negative for the remainder of the year due to the 2 large thermal projects ending, we believe Technical Solutions is well positioned to deliver strong income growth and margin expansion due in large part to strong execution with the ERICO integration and a strong culture around productivity across the whole segment. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q1. Valves & Controls reported a 10% decline in revenue, with core sales down 7% and a 3% headwind from FX. Most importantly, the top line was in line with our expectations. Backlog was down 2% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 11% year-over-year, consistent with the double-digit rate of decline that's been experienced the past several quarters. Core sales were down 9% in aftermarket and down 4% in projects as the business continues to ship out of backlog. We expected aftermarket to start the year slowly as customers were finalizing their budgets, and OpEx continues to be constrained right along with the CapEx at many customers. 
In the second quarter, we'll watch closely both aftermarket sales and orders, but we remain very cautious since it is not clear whether energy markets have found bottom. 
The right half of the page shows first quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecast. It was just under 1 year ago when we saw an acceleration in the rate of decline in the business, and I asked John to step in and lead the business on an interim basis as we search for a new leader of the segment, which of course we just recently filled. I'm very pleased with the entire Valves & Controls leadership team's resilience during these difficult times, and I want to personally thank them for their tenacious leadership. While the business continues watching for signs of stabilization in orders, they have accomplished a lot the past several quarters in rightsizing the business to today's hard reality. We believe for some time that the downturn in Energy is more than cyclical, and we have acted accordingly. Over the past 12 months, we've realigned the business to reflect the energy industry declines, resulting in headcount reductions of over 20%. This hasn't been easy, but it was necessary. I would also like to point out that these rightsizing actions were started a year ago and are on top of what we've already accomplished since we acquired the business 3.5 years ago. To put it in perspective, we reduced the number of ERPs, accounting centers and other back office functions by over 40%, and the manufacturing footprint is 30% smaller. While these are steps in the right direction, there's still more opportunity and work to be done. Under Dennis's leadership and with a strong team in place, we believe that Valves & Controls will be well positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets. While we expect revenue recover to be a couple of years away, we continue to take actions aimed at improving profitability even this year. 
So the 6.5% return on sales in Q1 is not indicative of our current cost structure. We expect improved margins each quarter this year as 2015's higher cost inventory works its way through the income statement in the first half. Our prior communication of $100 million in cost-out benefit in 2016 is on track, and we continue to expect to exit the year with margins in the teens and full year margins just north of 10%, even on muted sales. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on this slide, short cycle orders were down 5% and long-cycle orders declined 18%. The short-cycle weakness was more acute in Europe, but the U.S. also was weak as customers continue to defer maintenance. This was not just in oil and gas but also in power and mining. We watch orders closely to see when customers begin to start spending OpEx once again. 
The weakness on the project side was broad based with CapEx budgets being cut across the board. The quoting funnel appears to be slowly improving, particularly in LNG and petrochem, but we're not expecting a big increase in orders. We continue to believe there's potential for orders to find the bottom in the second half in projects though. Second quarter orders will be instructive in seeing if the quote funnel begins to bear fruit, and we'll remain cautious and interested to see if there are signs of stabilization in the short-cycle business. We will continue to focus on capitalizing on opportunities, particularly where we can leverage the breadth of the entire Valves & Controls portfolio.
Now let's move to Slide 13 to provide an update on our segment positioning. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, I wanted to provide an update on our segment positioning and comment on the reordering of the segments. While Valves & Controls has received a lot of attention in the past 18 months, the business has worked to aggressively reposition itself in the face of a significant reset in the energy industry and now the segment is expected to contribute only 15% of this year's Pentair income. We believe the other 85% of the portfolio is well positioned, and we remain excited about the opportunities in these other 3 segments. 
We have 2 high-performing segments today in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions has made good progress in improving its margin and cash flow while positioning for a return to growth. This chart shows the progress against each segment's priorities. We introduced these priorities at our Investor Day last November and highlighted them once again in our 2016 outlook call last December. Both Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions have continued to perform, and we believe they're well positioned to build on their momentum. We're encouraged with the improvements in margin and cash flow at Flow & Filtration Solutions. And as the business continues to gain traction and moving to a solutions provider from a manufacturer component, we expect organic growth to not only return but to become more consistent and predictable, given their portfolio is well aligned to grow with macro trends, particularly in Food & Beverage.
So 2016 has started off as we expected. We believe our water and electrical businesses are well positioned to continue delivering strong results, and Valves & Controls has become a smaller piece of the portfolio as a result of the energy reset, and we're making good progress in stabilizing and rightsizing that business. Cash and earnings execution remain the mantra for 2016, and we're focused on delivering our commitments to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

We ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of net debt, inclusive of cash on hand. This is a slight increase from our year-end debt levels due to seasonal working capital build, particularly in our Residential & Commercial businesses. As Randy mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was over $100 million better to start the year versus the comparable period last year. While we did consume minimal cash in the quarter in line with historical patterns, we continue to expect to deliver our free cash flow target of approximately $750 million for the year. 
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our capital expenditure forecast remains unchanged at approximately $150 million as we continue to invest in the businesses that have earned the right to grow, especially Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions, and drive deeper disciplines into our Valves & Controls factories.
Please turn to Slide 15 labeled Q2 2016 Pentair Outlook. For the second quarter, we expect core sales to decline approximately 3% and total sales to increase 4%, inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. On a core sales basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 5% as the segment enters its seasonally strongest period. Flow & Filtration Solutions' core sales are expected to be up modestly as the business continues to reposition itself and comparisons become easier. Technical Solutions is expected to have a core sales decline of roughly 3% as 2 projects in the Thermal Management business are completed. And Enclosures faces another tough year-over-year comparison. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are expected to decline approximately 13% as the project backlog remains weak, and we remain cautious in the short term as to whether the aftermarket business will accelerate after the slow start to the year. We are expecting segment income to increase approximately 5% and return on sales to be roughly flat at 16.5%.
Below the operating income line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be just over $182 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.11, which is an increase of approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect a seasonal ramp-up in free cash flow and further improvement in our working capital performance.
Please turn to Slide 16 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 with very few changes to our prior forecast. For the full year, we still expect total Pentair core sales to decline approximately 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 5% as both its Aquatic & Environmental Systems and Water Filtration businesses are well positioned to continue driving the growth rates experienced the last several years. Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales are expected to be up approximately 2% for the full year, led by stabilization in Water Technologies and growth in both Fluid Solutions and Process Filtration. Technical Solutions is expected to see core sales decline roughly 2%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast as the Thermal Management backlog has grown, and we have seen stabilization in Enclosures' daily order rates. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are still expected to decline roughly 8%, given our current view of orders for the full year.
We expect segment income to grow roughly 9% and return on sales to expand approximately 90 basis points to 16.5%, with 3 of our 4 segments delivering full year margin expansion. We continue to anticipate full year corporate cost to be just over $90 million, net interest and other roughly $140 million and the share count to be just over 182 million, all essentially in line with previous expectations. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up approximately 5% at the midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect a strong year of free cash flow at approximately $750 million, which represents roughly 100% of our adjusted net income.

One area where he will be very focused is on these 2 value streams, aftermarket and projects and tuning, if you will, the business so that we can really focus on the aftermarket so that as it comes back, we can gain share there. I think as we've said before, we really didn't differentiate the way we serve the aftermarket versus projects.

The tweaks to Technical Solutions are really around we continue to build a project backlog in the Industrial heat trace business. We feel really good about that backlog.

I think where the big opportunity is and where Dennis is focusing is how do we improve the linearization within a quarter of how we're shipping? How do we reduce the inefficiencies? These are all great tools that -- lean brings that tool to the table. And I think as far as the distribution and the outside service centers, we have 43 independent service centers that aren't part of a current distribution center or a customer's factory. I think the customers are going to help define that for us over the next 3 to 4 years because moving in-house into their operations is where we see it going because eliminating that brick-and-mortar between us and them seems to be where the industry is heading. So can't give you specifics, but I think there's opportunities in both of those areas. But I'd say on the factory side, I wouldn't expect very many closures in the next several years.

So what Karl and his team have done is they're replicating the kind of coverage, the direct dealer coverage on the other side of distribution in order to drive brand and drive product adoption and get customer intimacy and can voice the customer back to our product. So a lot of the investments are actually on the sales side, and that's global.

We were pleased with our first quarter results, beating the expectations set at the beginning of the year. The top line was consistent with expectations, and we saw strong execution on all businesses, led by 3 segments delivering over 100 basis points of margin expansion each. 
We recently announced a new leader for our Valves & Controls segment. We're all glad to have Dennis Cassidy join us, most recently from AlixPartners. I appreciate John Stauch leaning in and leading Valves & Controls the past few quarters. And Valves & Controls business delivered first quarter results in line with our guidance. 
Integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations, and we believe we're on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. 
Free cash flow, while seasonally usage during the quarter was much better than the comparable period last year. Given the stronger start to free cash flow this year, we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash this year. 
We're maintaining our 2016 full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 per share. Execution for cash and earnings remain our key focus, and the first quarter gave us a good start to the year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q1 2016 results in more detail. First quarter core sales grew 1%, which was an improvement from the declines we saw in the past couple quarters. 3 of our 4 segments met or beat their top line commitments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions being negatively impacted by timing of beverage shipments. ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with our expectations. 
Segment income increased 5%, and return on sales contracted 20 basis points to 13.3%. Three segments delivered margin expansion greater than 100 basis points, and Valves & Controls met its first quarter income and margin commitments. 
Adjusted EPS was flat at $0.76 per share and was ahead of our guidance of $0.70 to $0.72 per share. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow started much better this year with a small usage in the quarter and was over $100 million improvement year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more details on Pentair's Q1 2016 performance. Our sales performance by vertical was mixed with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and in Infrastructure, which helped partially offset continued sluggishness in Energy. We saw some signs of stabilization in our Industrial businesses, and while Food & Beverage was down in the quarter, we continue to believe this vertical will deliver full year growth as shipments in our beverage business can be choppy. 
Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 11% sales growth to start the year, led by double-digit growth in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions and solid growth in Flow & Filtration Solutions. Infrastructure did turn positive on strength in both North American municipal pumps and improved project activity in our Process Filtration business globally. The rate of decline within Industrial moderated for the quarter and we're encouraged by what we believe are signs of stabilization in this, our second largest vertical. 
Food & Beverage started the year slowly, impacting our Flow & Filtration Solution results, but it's principally the results of timing around beverage shipments, as I mentioned, and ongoing weakness in irrigation. 
It's no surprise that energy remains weak, and while we expected this vertical to continue to be down this year, we believe our nonenergy businesses are positioned to more than compensate for this weakness. Energy now represents just over 20% of our sales and an even smaller percentage of our profits. We continue to believe the remaining 80% of our portfolio is well positioned, particularly within Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage verticals. 
As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. Price was a modest positive in the quarter, and ERICO contributed strength to the bottom line on strong underlying performance and synergies.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a review of our segment and major platform structure. We want to remind everyone on the alignment of our businesses, which we introduced at our Investor Day last November. Underneath our 4 segments we grouped activities into 10 Strategic Business Groups, or SBGs, to better prioritize our resource allocation across the company. We'll discuss the SBG performance within each segment. For a more detailed look at each SBG, please refer to our presentation on our website from the 2015 Investor Day. 
Our Water business is split between 2 segments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions focused around a solutions approach and Water Quality Systems business aligned by product distribution. Technical Solutions has 3 well-positioned electrical businesses, and we've realigned our Valves & Controls business around 2 key selling motions: aftermarket and projects. The key distinction on all of these SBGs is that we can differentiate the investments more clearly between them. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q1. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 9% core sales growth. The Aquatics & Environmental Systems business grew 13% organically as the North American pool season got off to a strong start and aquaculture continued to grow nicely. 
Water Filtration grew core sales 5%, with particular strength continuing in our Residential Filtration business. 
Segment income grew an impressive 19%, and return on sales expanded 170 basis points to 18.6%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter, even as we increased our growth investments to maintain the strong momentum that Water Quality Systems has delivered the past several years.
Now let's move to Slide 9 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q1. Flow & Filtration saw revenue decline 4%, with core sales down 2% and negative FX translation of another 2%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the first quarter, and while the Infrastructure growth was as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by the timing of those beverage shipments. We're encouraged with double-digit order growth in beverage, but given this current state of consolidation in the beer industry in particular, choppiness in sales is expected to be a trend quarter-to-quarter in the near term. 
Water Technology saw core sales decline 1% as strength in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double-digit declines in irrigation pump shipments. We believe the strength in Residential & Commercial will continue into the seasonally strong second quarter, and the longer-cycle Infrastructure business will continue to grow based on a solid backlog and a strong quote funnel.
Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 5% due to the previously mentioned delays in beverage shipments, but our precision spray business grew in the quarter. Process Filtration had good core sales growth of 4% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on industrial water reuse solutions and some improvement in Infrastructure, which includes a couple of desalination projects. 
Segment income grew 9%, and return on sales expanded 130 basis points to 11.7%. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion as our execution has improved within the segment. Still, we believe there's a long runway ahead for further margin improvement, particularly when the top line returns to growth. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in Q1. Technical Solutions reported 33% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 5% core sales growth, a 2% headwind from FX and a 30% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in Enclosures declined 5% due to the pressure we saw in our short-cycle Industrial business late last year persisted. While the year-over-year comparisons are expected to remain challenging in the second quarter, we were encouraged to see stabilization in the daily order rate in the quarter and continue to expect easier comparisons in the back half of the year as a result. 
Thermal Management experienced impressive core sales growth of 22% as 2 projects in Canada are nearing completion. The Industrial heat tracing business continues to see wins in its smaller project business while its more profitable products business remains weak. The Thermal Building business also had a strong quarter. 
While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO sales are in commercial end markets, which remained very healthy in the quarter. We believe we are on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business attractive profitability. 
Segment income grew 45% and return on sales expanded an impressive 190 basis points to 21.5%. Despite negative mix in Thermal Management and some price pressures in Enclosures, strong productivity and the positive contribution from ERICO helped drive margin expansion in the quarter.
While core sales are expected to turn negative for the remainder of the year due to the 2 large thermal projects ending, we believe Technical Solutions is well positioned to deliver strong income growth and margin expansion due in large part to strong execution with the ERICO integration and a strong culture around productivity across the whole segment. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q1. Valves & Controls reported a 10% decline in revenue, with core sales down 7% and a 3% headwind from FX. Most importantly, the top line was in line with our expectations. Backlog was down 2% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 11% year-over-year, consistent with the double-digit rate of decline that's been experienced the past several quarters. Core sales were down 9% in aftermarket and down 4% in projects as the business continues to ship out of backlog. We expected aftermarket to start the year slowly as customers were finalizing their budgets, and OpEx continues to be constrained right along with the CapEx at many customers. 
In the second quarter, we'll watch closely both aftermarket sales and orders, but we remain very cautious since it is not clear whether energy markets have found bottom. 
The right half of the page shows first quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecast. It was just under 1 year ago when we saw an acceleration in the rate of decline in the business, and I asked John to step in and lead the business on an interim basis as we search for a new leader of the segment, which of course we just recently filled. I'm very pleased with the entire Valves & Controls leadership team's resilience during these difficult times, and I want to personally thank them for their tenacious leadership. While the business continues watching for signs of stabilization in orders, they have accomplished a lot the past several quarters in rightsizing the business to today's hard reality. We believe for some time that the downturn in Energy is more than cyclical, and we have acted accordingly. Over the past 12 months, we've realigned the business to reflect the energy industry declines, resulting in headcount reductions of over 20%. This hasn't been easy, but it was necessary. I would also like to point out that these rightsizing actions were started a year ago and are on top of what we've already accomplished since we acquired the business 3.5 years ago. To put it in perspective, we reduced the number of ERPs, accounting centers and other back office functions by over 40%, and the manufacturing footprint is 30% smaller. While these are steps in the right direction, there's still more opportunity and work to be done. Under Dennis's leadership and with a strong team in place, we believe that Valves & Controls will be well positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets. While we expect revenue recover to be a couple of years away, we continue to take actions aimed at improving profitability even this year. 
So the 6.5% return on sales in Q1 is not indicative of our current cost structure. We expect improved margins each quarter this year as 2015's higher cost inventory works its way through the income statement in the first half. Our prior communication of $100 million in cost-out benefit in 2016 is on track, and we continue to expect to exit the year with margins in the teens and full year margins just north of 10%, even on muted sales. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on this slide, short cycle orders were down 5% and long-cycle orders declined 18%. The short-cycle weakness was more acute in Europe, but the U.S. also was weak as customers continue to defer maintenance. This was not just in oil and gas but also in power and mining. We watch orders closely to see when customers begin to start spending OpEx once again. 
The weakness on the project side was broad based with CapEx budgets being cut across the board. The quoting funnel appears to be slowly improving, particularly in LNG and petrochem, but we're not expecting a big increase in orders. We continue to believe there's potential for orders to find the bottom in the second half in projects though. Second quarter orders will be instructive in seeing if the quote funnel begins to bear fruit, and we'll remain cautious and interested to see if there are signs of stabilization in the short-cycle business. We will continue to focus on capitalizing on opportunities, particularly where we can leverage the breadth of the entire Valves & Controls portfolio.
Now let's move to Slide 13 to provide an update on our segment positioning. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, I wanted to provide an update on our segment positioning and comment on the reordering of the segments. While Valves & Controls has received a lot of attention in the past 18 months, the business has worked to aggressively reposition itself in the face of a significant reset in the energy industry and now the segment is expected to contribute only 15% of this year's Pentair income. We believe the other 85% of the portfolio is well positioned, and we remain excited about the opportunities in these other 3 segments. 
We have 2 high-performing segments today in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions has made good progress in improving its margin and cash flow while positioning for a return to growth. This chart shows the progress against each segment's priorities. We introduced these priorities at our Investor Day last November and highlighted them once again in our 2016 outlook call last December. Both Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions have continued to perform, and we believe they're well positioned to build on their momentum. We're encouraged with the improvements in margin and cash flow at Flow & Filtration Solutions. And as the business continues to gain traction and moving to a solutions provider from a manufacturer component, we expect organic growth to not only return but to become more consistent and predictable, given their portfolio is well aligned to grow with macro trends, particularly in Food & Beverage.
So 2016 has started off as we expected. We believe our water and electrical businesses are well positioned to continue delivering strong results, and Valves & Controls has become a smaller piece of the portfolio as a result of the energy reset, and we're making good progress in stabilizing and rightsizing that business. Cash and earnings execution remain the mantra for 2016, and we're focused on delivering our commitments to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

Please turn to Slide #14 titled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of net debt, inclusive of cash on hand.

We ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of net debt, inclusive of cash on hand. This is a slight increase from our year-end debt levels due to seasonal working capital build, particularly in our Residential & Commercial businesses. As Randy mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was over $100 million better to start the year versus the comparable period last year. While we did consume minimal cash in the quarter in line with historical patterns, we continue to expect to deliver our free cash flow target of approximately $750 million for the year. 
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our capital expenditure forecast remains unchanged at approximately $150 million as we continue to invest in the businesses that have earned the right to grow, especially Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions, and drive deeper disciplines into our Valves & Controls factories.
Please turn to Slide 15 labeled Q2 2016 Pentair Outlook. For the second quarter, we expect core sales to decline approximately 3% and total sales to increase 4%, inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. On a core sales basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 5% as the segment enters its seasonally strongest period. Flow & Filtration Solutions' core sales are expected to be up modestly as the business continues to reposition itself and comparisons become easier. Technical Solutions is expected to have a core sales decline of roughly 3% as 2 projects in the Thermal Management business are completed. And Enclosures faces another tough year-over-year comparison. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are expected to decline approximately 13% as the project backlog remains weak, and we remain cautious in the short term as to whether the aftermarket business will accelerate after the slow start to the year. We are expecting segment income to increase approximately 5% and return on sales to be roughly flat at 16.5%.
Below the operating income line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be just over $182 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.11, which is an increase of approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect a seasonal ramp-up in free cash flow and further improvement in our working capital performance.
Please turn to Slide 16 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 with very few changes to our prior forecast. For the full year, we still expect total Pentair core sales to decline approximately 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 5% as both its Aquatic & Environmental Systems and Water Filtration businesses are well positioned to continue driving the growth rates experienced the last several years. Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales are expected to be up approximately 2% for the full year, led by stabilization in Water Technologies and growth in both Fluid Solutions and Process Filtration. Technical Solutions is expected to see core sales decline roughly 2%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast as the Thermal Management backlog has grown, and we have seen stabilization in Enclosures' daily order rates. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are still expected to decline roughly 8%, given our current view of orders for the full year.
We expect segment income to grow roughly 9% and return on sales to expand approximately 90 basis points to 16.5%, with 3 of our 4 segments delivering full year margin expansion. We continue to anticipate full year corporate cost to be just over $90 million, net interest and other roughly $140 million and the share count to be just over 182 million, all essentially in line with previous expectations. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up approximately 5% at the midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect a strong year of free cash flow at approximately $750 million, which represents roughly 100% of our adjusted net income.

But in the next several years, or at least the longer term for however long we have the debt in place, we don't see any impact to our overall tax rate.

So we would have to take advantage of our operational synergies to get to those tax synergies that we would have.

Customers are always going to retime you. But if you look at that over a period of time, it's always a percentage of the backlog. And what happens as people work deep in the business is they have a lot of hope in their forecast, that everything is going to be good and nothing bad is going to happen.

I think where the big opportunity is and where Dennis is focusing is how do we improve the linearization within a quarter of how we're shipping? How do we reduce the inefficiencies? These are all great tools that -- lean brings that tool to the table. And I think as far as the distribution and the outside service centers, we have 43 independent service centers that aren't part of a current distribution center or a customer's factory. I think the customers are going to help define that for us over the next 3 to 4 years because moving in-house into their operations is where we see it going because eliminating that brick-and-mortar between us and them seems to be where the industry is heading. So can't give you specifics, but I think there's opportunities in both of those areas. But I'd say on the factory side, I wouldn't expect very many closures in the next several years.

But we don't have the same kind of customer intimacy that we have in the pool business that's turned into such a sweet business for us. We believe that residential might have the same potential for us. So what Karl and his team have done is they're replicating the kind of coverage, the direct dealer coverage on the other side of distribution in order to drive brand and drive product adoption and get customer intimacy and can voice the customer back to our product. So a lot of the investments are actually on the sales side, and that's global. And we're doing it in the United States, around Europe and Canada, less so in -- it's a different kind of coverage investment in the emerging markets. But I'm quite excited about the early returns on that. I don't think it's really affected our numbers yet, but it's given us great insight. And I'm expecting great things."

We were pleased with our second quarter results, which came in at the high end of our expectations. The top line was consistent with our forecast, and incoming margins were slightly better than expectations, driven by strong execution and continued benefit from our cost-out actions. The integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations. We remain on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. Free cash flow was once again a positive story, and we're very pleased with our performance here. For the first half of the year, we generated $304 million in free cash, which is over $150 million better than what we delivered in the first half last year.
We're updating our full year adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $4.05 to $4.20, which is bringing $0.05 off the top end of the range. While Valves & Controls are starting to become more predictable, we're seeing a negative impact of sales mix in both Flow and Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q2 2016 results. Second quarter core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than our previously communicated expectations. Water Quality Systems delivered solid growth once again against the tough comparison, while Flow & Filtration Solutions felt the impact of continued difficult agriculture markets. 
The decline in Valves & Controls sales moderated, and Technical Solutions was flat compared to our expectation for slight decline in the quarter. ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with expectations. Segment income increased 7%, and return on sales expanded 30 basis points to 16.8%. Water Quality Systems saw a 200 basis point expansion, and Valves & Controls slightly beat second quarter income and margin commitments, which were big steps up from the first quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 3% to $1.11 per share and was at the high-end of our guidance of $1.08 to $1.11. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more detail on Pentair's Q2. Our sales performance was mixed by vertical with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure. We saw signs of stabilization in Industrial where the rate of decline continued to moderate, and Energy did not get worse. Food & Beverage was down in the quarter due to ongoing declines in agriculture we believe our beverage business remains healthy. Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 2% sales growth with strength in residential and Water Quality Systems and ongoing strength in commercial in both Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions. While ERICO's performance is not captured in core results yet, a commercial markets remained solid for it, too. Infrastructure was positive once again led by continued growth in both North American municipal pumps and improved project activity in Process filtration globally. We've been looking for Flow & Filtration Solutions as the Infrastructure growth this year, which has played out as expected, and we're encouraged that bidding activity remains healthy as well. 
The rate of decline within Industrial moderated further, and we believe that this, our second largest vertical, appears to have found the bottom. Though we're not looking for a second half rebound, comparisons eased in the second half and should help reported results.
Food & Beverage declined for the second consecutive quarter as Flow & Filtration Solutions continue to feel the impact of agriculture markets that declined in the double-digit rate for us. Energy declined in a low double-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter, though we expect Energy sales to find a bottom in the second half based on the bottoming in sequential orders we've experienced. As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remain strong and more than offset inflation. ERICO contributes strength to the bottom line and strong underlying performance in synergies.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q2. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 3% core sales growth. While the growth rate declined sequentially with a tough comparison as the second quarter last year reflected slightly different timing in the North American Pool season than what we're experiencing this year. While the timing is different to believe the North American Pool season remains very healthy. Water filtration grew core sales 1% as both our Residential Filtration business and our Foodservice business faced tough comps. Segment income grew an impressive 11%, and return on sales expanded 200 basis points to 24.7%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter. Timing of growth investments may mute the rate of margin expansion in the second half, but we anticipate the prospects remain strong for Water Quality Systems.
Now let's move to Slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions.
Flow & Filtration saw core sales declined 1%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the second quarter. And all the Infrastructure growth came through as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by very challenging agriculture sales. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as strength in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double-digit decline in the irrigation pump shipments. This is very similar to what we saw last quarter in this business. While we expect both the Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure businesses to see continued growth, irrigation headwinds will likely persist as comparisons remain challenging, given the drought conditions in the west that helped our sales last year. 
Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 3%, while beverage returned to growth in the quarter and experienced strong orders growth as well. The precision business was negatively impacted by the beleaguered agriculture markets. Process filtration saw core sales growth of 10% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on Industrial water reuse solutions and a return to growth and Infrastructure with some desalination investments. This business has some lumpiness, given the timing of projects, but we believe we continue to gain momentum from our focus on industrial water reuse.
Segment income and return on sales contracted modestly as negative mix weighed on the segment's results. We believe this is just a pause in the margin improvement journey in Flow & Filtration Solutions and still a long runway ahead for further margin growth.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our Technical Solutions performed in the second quarter. Technical Solutions reported 32% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of flat core sales growth and 1% headwind from FX and a 34% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales and enclosures declined 5%. encouraged by the stabilization daily order rate, which reinforces our view to easier comparisons in the back half of the year.
Thermal Management delivered core sales growth of 7%, helped in part by 2 projects in Canada that we previously discussed that are reaching completion. We have talked of this year about our Industrial heat tracing business continuing to win small projects, but unfortunately, we're seeing no sign of downstream MRO spending growth return yet. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO sales are into commercial end markets, which remained very healthy in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business profitability which is performing as expected.
Segment income grew 30%, while return on sales contracted 60 basis points to 20.6%. The margin contraction was isolated to our Thermal Management businesses as the the growth we mentioned in projects versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix. ERICO's performed as we had anticipated and closures are seeing signs of stabilization. The performance of these 2 was not enough in the quarter to offset the impact of the negative mix experienced in the Thermal Management on the ROS.
We're not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound in the second half. We expect this will undoubtedly have an impact on third quarter margins for Technical Solutions. So with ERICO and Enclosures performing as expected, Technical Solutions remain well positioned long term.
Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q2. For the second consecutive quarter, Valves & Controls met or beat its forecast for both sales and margins. Even more, the heavy lifting we've done to rightsize the cost structure of the business read out in the nice gain in margin sequentially, and orders appear to have stabilized. Valves & Controls reported a 13% decline in revenue with core sales down 11% and a 2% headwind from FX. Backlog was down 7% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 27% year-over-year against the tough comparison but as stated, we did see a flattening of orders sequentially.
Core sales were down 6% in aftermarket and down 17% in projects. In line with our expectations, the aftermarket business remained weak as OpEx continue to be constrained along with CapEx at many customers. We believe the order funnel overall is beginning to strengthen, which reinforces our view that orders have bottomed in the second quarter and will begin to expand near double-digit rates sequentially starting in the third quarter. 
The right half of the page shows second quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecasts. Return on sales of 10.1% was slightly ahead of our forecast and up significantly from the first quarter as our cost-out benefit registered in line with our previously communicated expectations.
The Valves & Controls team has done courageous job in realigning the business to reflect a significant Energy industry reset. They've executed in the cost side leading the business with the opportunities that exists today and over the next several years. We continue to believe that Valves & Controls is well positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets beginning in 2017 and will continue to enjoy rising margins sequentially even before that.
Now let's move to Slide 11 for a look at Valves & Controls backlog. Much of the backlog decline we saw has come as a result of the progress we're making in reducing our past dues. Last year, we booked roughly $100 million in orders from projects greater than $5 million. However, we've not booked even 1 order greater than $5 million during the first half of 2016. Yet orders have bottomed out sequentially. And as our customers sort out their spending plans, we expect to see a return of some larger projects. So we believe that the second quarter marks the bottom for orders, and we're expecting orders to improve in the second half of the year from their depressed first half levels. For the past 3 quarters, the business has improved its forecasting capabilities. And with aftermarket now approximating 55% of orders, that should improve the margin mix. We're encouraged with Valves & Controls meeting or beating its forecast on sales, orders and income for the second consecutive quarter. There's been tremendous progress made on rightsizing the cost structure of the business and better alignment between sales and operations has improve the forecasting and executionability of the segment. We believe the order funnel will continue to strengthen. And while the top line will not show it right away, orders bottoming and margin improving show brighter days ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

We ended the second quarter with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash in hand. This was an improvement from where we ended the year as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. As Randy mentioned earlier, free cash flow increased over $150 million during the first half of the year versus the comparable period last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year.
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our forecast for capital expenditures remains $150 million as we continue to invest in businesses that have earned the right to grow and drive standardization of productivity across the enterprise. We remain focused on generating strong cash flow and further debt reduction.
Please turn to Slide 13 labeled Q3 2016 Pentair outlook. For the third quarter, we expect core sales to be flat and total sales to increase 7% inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. As a reminder, we closed on the purchase of ERICO just before the end of Q3 last year. And starting in Q4, ERICO will be included in the core. On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 8%, while Flow & Filtration Solutions is expected to see core sales decline approximately 1%. Technical Solutions is expected to be flat on a core basis, and Valves & Controls is anticipated to see core sales decline 6%. We expect segment income to increase approximately 11% and return on sales to expand roughly 60 basis points to 16.7%. Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around 183 million. We expect free cash flow to continue to be strong during the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 14 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we've taken $0.05 off at the top end of our range, and our full year adjusted EPS outlook is no $4.05 to $4.20. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 6%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to see our core sales decline of 1% versus our prior forecast of modest growth for the full year. Technical Solutions core sales is expected to be flat for the full year, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. Finally, Valves & Controls expected to see core sales decline of approximately 9%. 
We expect segment income to grow roughly 8% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 16.3%. Our revised forecast factors in slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems and Valves & Controls while Technical Solutions of Flow & Filtration Solutions are expected to see margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. We anticipate full year corporate cost to be just under $90 million, net interest and other of roughly $140 million and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 5% in the midpoint of the range. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.

But if you take a look at it over the last few years, it has been growing very, very substantially. I moved that business to Karl and his team a couple of years ago because we're the largest player in that business, but we weren't the best performing in that business. And we made huge progress under Carl's leadership in taking that water filtration. It's in water filtration. Water filtration is made up of that Residential & Commercial, and the Foodservice piece the brand, if you will. And a lot of the margin expansion you saw on is actually because of the momentum we're gaining there. And we'll talk more about it."

And one is it's a business that as the conversation about China and the conversation we talked earlier about in the pool business, it really is a business that is yielding the innovations.

We have discounted the larger projects from the expectation that those would close this year. But what we did when we reorganized the sales force is put a lot more energy around the aftermarket side And one of the things we bring to the table to a lot of the larger customers is the ability to service a vast majority of valves. And the weighted for servicing those right now is on an aggregated buy basis from those customers and also working their factories plants to be able to benefit from that. So that's a big piece of it. The second one is there has been some pent-up demand on the downstream side, especially the MRO downstream. And as we always said, we don't think that that would be different forever, and we started to see that start to come in. So we're not declaring victory yet.

We were pleased with our second quarter results, which came in at the high end of our expectations. The top line was consistent with our forecast, and incoming margins were slightly better than our expectations, driven by strong execution and continued benefit from our cost-out actions. 
The integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations. We remain on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. Free cash flow was once again a positive story, and we're very pleased with our performance here. For the first half of the year, we have generated $304 million in free cash, which is over $150 million better than what we delivered in the first half last year.
We're updating our full year adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $4.05 to $4.20, which is bringing a $0.05 off the top end of the range. While Valves & Controls have started to become more predictable, we're seeing a negative impact of sales mix in both Flow and Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q2 2016 results. Second quarter core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than our previously communicated expectations. Water Quality Systems delivered solid growth once again, against the tough comparison; while Flow & Filtration Solutions felt the impact of continued difficult agriculture markets. The decline in Valves & Controls sales moderated. And Technical Solutions was flat compared to our expectation for a slight decline in the quarter. ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with our expectations. 
Segment income increased 7%, and return on sales expanded 30 basis points to 16.8%. Water Quality Systems saw a 200 basis point expansion, and Valves & Controls slightly beat its second quarter income and margin commitments, which were big steps up from the first quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 3% to $1.11 per share and was at the high end of our guidance of $1.08 to $1.11. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more detail on Pentair's Q2. Our sales performance was mixed by vertical with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure. We saw signs of stabilization in Industrial where the rate of decline continued to moderate, and Energy did not get worse. Food & Beverage was down in the quarter due to ongoing declines in agriculture. We believe our beverage business remains healthy. 
Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 2% sales growth with strength in Residential and Water Quality Systems and ongoing strength in commercial in both Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions. While ERICO's performance is not captured in core results yet, we would point out the commercial markets remained solid for it, too. 
Infrastructure was positive once again led by continued growth in both North American municipal pumps and improved project activity in Process filtration globally. We've been looking for Flow & Filtration Solutions as the Infrastructure growth this year, which has played out as expected. And we're encouraged that bidding activity remains healthy as well. 
The rate of decline within Industrial moderated further. And we believe that this, our second largest vertical, appears to have found the bottom. Though we're not looking for a second half rebound, comparisons eased in the second half and should help reported results.
Food & Beverage declined for the second consecutive quarter as Flow & Filtration Solutions continue to feel the impact of agriculture markets that declined at a double-digit rate for us. Energy declined at a low double-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter, but we expect Energy sales to find the bottom in the second half based on the bottoming in sequential orders we've experienced. As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. ERICO contributes strength to the bottom line and strong underlying performance in synergies.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q2. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 3% core sales growth. While the growth rate declined sequentially with a tough comparison as the second quarter last year reflected slightly different timing in the North American pool season than what we're experiencing this year. While the timing is different to believe the North American pool season remains very healthy. Water filtration grew core sales 1% as both our Residential Filtration business and our Foodservice business faced tough comps. Segment income grew an impressive 11%, and return on sales expanded 200 basis points to 24.7%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter. Timing of growth investments may mute the rate of margin expansion in the second half, but we anticipate the prospects remain strong for Water Quality Systems.
Now let's move to Slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration saw core sales decline 1%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the second quarter. And while the Infrastructure growth came through as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by very challenging agriculture sales. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as strength in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double-digit decline in the irrigation pump shipments. This is very similar to what we saw last quarter in this business. While we expect both the Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure businesses to see continued growth, irrigation headwinds will likely persist as comparisons remain challenging, given the drought conditions in the west that helped our sales last year. 
Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 3%, while beverage returned to growth in the quarter and experienced strong orders growth as well. The precision spray business was negatively impacted by the beleaguered agriculture markets. Process filtration saw core sales growth of 10% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on Industrial water reuse solutions and a return to growth and Infrastructure with some desalination investments. This business has some lumpiness, given the timing of projects, but we believe we continue to gain momentum from our focus on industrial water reuse.
Segment income and return on sales contracted modestly as negative mix weighed on the segment's results. We believe this is just a pause in the margin improvement journey in Flow & Filtration Solutions, and that there's still a long runway ahead for further margin growth.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the second quarter. Technical Solutions reported 32% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of flat core sales growth, a 1% headwind from FX and a 34% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales and enclosures declined 5%, were encouraged by the stabilization in the daily order rate, which reinforces our view to easier comparisons in the back half of the year.
Thermal Management delivered core sales growth of 7%, helped in part by 2 projects in Canada that we previously discussed that are reaching completion. We have talked this year about our Industrial heat tracing business continuing to win small projects, but unfortunately, we're seeing no sign of downstream MRO spending growth return yet. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO sales are into commercial end markets, which remained very healthy in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business profitability, which is performing as expected.
Segment income grew 30%, while return on sales contracted 60 basis points to 20.6%. The margin contraction was isolated to our Thermal Management business as the growth we mentioned in projects versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix. ERICO's performed as we had anticipated. Enclosures are seeing signs of stabilization. The performance of these 2 SPGs was not enough in the quarter to offset the impact of the negative mix experienced in Thermal Management on the ROS.
We're not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound in the second half. We expect this will undoubtedly have an impact on third quarter margins for Technical Solutions. So with ERICO and Enclosures performing as expected, Technical Solutions remain well positioned long term.
Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q2. For the second consecutive quarter, Valves & Controls met or beat its forecast for both sales and margins. Even more, the heavy lifting we've done to rightsize the cost structure of the business read out in the nice gain in margin sequentially, and orders appear to have stabilized. Valves & Controls reported a 13% decline in revenue with core sales down 11% and a 2% headwind from FX. Backlog was down 7% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 27% year-over-year against the tough comparison. But as stated, we did see a flattening of orders sequentially.
Core sales were down 6% in aftermarket and down 17% in projects. In line with our expectations, the aftermarket business remained weak as OpEx continue to be constrained along with CapEx at many customers. We believe the order funnel overall is beginning to strengthen, which reinforces our view that orders have bottomed in the second quarter and will begin to expand near double-digit rates sequentially starting in the third quarter. 
The right half of the page shows second quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecasts. Return on sales of 10.1% was slightly ahead of our forecast and up significantly from the first quarter as our cost-out benefit registered in line with our previously communicated expectations.
The Valves & Controls team has done a courageous job in realigning the business to reflect a significant Energy industry reset. They've executed on the cost side while aligning the business with the opportunities that exists today and over the next several years. We continue to believe that Valves & Controls is well-positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets beginning in 2017 and will continue to enjoy rising margins sequentially even before that.
Now let's move to Slide 11 for a look at Valves & Controls backlog. Much of the backlog decline we saw has come as a result of progress we're making in reducing our past dues. Last year, we booked roughly $100 million in orders from projects greater than $5 million. However, we've not booked even 1 order greater than $5 million during the first half of 2016. Yet orders have bottomed out sequentially. And as our customers sort out their spending plans, we expect to see a return of some larger projects. So we believe that the second quarter marks the bottom for orders, and we're expecting orders to improve in the second half of the year from their depressed first half levels. For the past 3 quarters, the business has improved its forecasting capabilities. And with aftermarket orders now approximating 55% of orders, that should improve the margin mix. 
We're encouraged with Valves & Controls meeting or beating its forecast on sales, orders and income for the second consecutive quarter. There's been tremendous progress made on rightsizing the cost structure of the business and better alignment between sales, and operations has improved the forecasting and executionability of the segment. We believe the order funnel will continue to strengthen. And while the top line will not show it right away, orders bottoming and margin improving show brighter days ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

We ended the second quarter with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This was an improvement from where we ended the year as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. 
As Randy mentioned earlier, free cash flow increased over $150 million during the first half of the year versus the comparable period last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year.
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our forecast for capital expenditures remains $150 million as we continue to invest in businesses that have earned the right to grow and drive standardization of productivity across the enterprise. We remain focused on generating strong cash flow and further debt reduction.
Please turn to Slide 13 labeled Q3 2016 Pentair outlook. For the third quarter, we expect core sales to be flat and total sales to increase 7% inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. As a reminder, we closed on the purchase of ERICO just before the end of Q3 last year. And starting in Q4, ERICO will be included in the core. On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 8%, while Flow & Filtration Solutions is expected to see core sales decline approximately 1%. Technical Solutions is expected to be flat on a core basis, and Valves & Controls is anticipated to see core sales decline 6%. We expect segment income to increase approximately 11% and return on sales to expand roughly 60 basis points to 16.7%. Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around 183 million. We expect free cash flow to continue to be strong during the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 14 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have taken $0.05 off at the top end of our range, and our full year adjusted EPS outlook is now $4.05 to $4.20. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 6%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to see a core sales decline of 1% versus our prior forecast of modest growth for the full year. Technical Solutions core sales is expected to be flat for the full year, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. Finally, Valves & Controls is expected to see core sales decline of approximately 9%. 
We expect segment income to grow roughly 8% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 16.3%. Our revised forecast factors and slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems and Valves & Controls while Technical Solutions of Flow & Filtration Solutions are expected to see margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. We anticipate full year corporate cost to be just under $90 million, net interest and other of roughly $140 million and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 5% in the midpoint of the range. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.

It's not -- the mix we're seeing is not mixed between a customer saying buying a lower margin, lower-performing product for the same application. It's specifically in Flow & Filtration. Our ag business has higher margins than our Residential & Commercial business. And so when ag goes down and residential goes up, we've got a negative mix. So it isn't product substitution in application, it's just a mix of what's a growing and what isn't. And in the thermal business, in Technical Solutions, again products, MRO has high margins; projects doesn't. So we actually expected MRO to come back. Maybe that was Pollyanna-ish, probably was, but it didn't end. And therefore, all the projects that we were happy about winning kind of overwhelmed margins for thermal."

Listen, we've had a fairly sizable frontline for a period of time, and I think as Randy mentioned, we scrubbed it. We have discounted the larger projects from the expectation that those would close this year. But what we did, when we reorganized the sales force, is put a lot more energy enough around the aftermarket side. And one other things we bring to the table to a lot of the larger customers is the ability to service a vast majority of valves. And the way that we're servicing those right now is on an aggregated buy basis from those customers, and in also working inside their factories or their plants to be able to benefit from that. So that's a big piece of it. The second one is that there has been some pent-up demand on the downstream side, especially the MRO downstream. And as we always said, we don't think that, that could be differed forever. And we started to see that start to come in. So but, we're not declaring victory yet.

We were pleased with our second quarter results, which came in at the high end of our expectations. The top line was consistent with our forecast, and incoming margins were slightly better than our expectations, driven by strong execution and continued benefit from our cost-out actions. 
The integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations. We remain on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. Free cash flow was once again a positive story, and we're very pleased with our performance here. For the first half of the year, we have generated $304 million in free cash, which is over $150 million better than what we delivered in the first half last year.
We're updating our full year adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $4.05 to $4.20, which is bringing a $0.05 off the top end of the range. While Valves & Controls have started to become more predictable, we're seeing a negative impact of sales mix in both Flow and Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q2 2016 results. Second quarter core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than our previously communicated expectations. Water Quality Systems delivered solid growth once again, against the tough comparison; while Flow & Filtration Solutions felt the impact of continued difficult agriculture markets. The decline in Valves & Controls sales moderated. And Technical Solutions was flat compared to our expectation for a slight decline in the quarter. ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with our expectations. 
Segment income increased 7%, and return on sales expanded 30 basis points to 16.8%. Water Quality Systems saw a 200 basis point expansion, and Valves & Controls slightly beat its second quarter income and margin commitments, which were big steps up from the first quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 3% to $1.11 per share and was at the high end of our guidance of $1.08 to $1.11. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more detail on Pentair's Q2. Our sales performance was mixed by vertical with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure. We saw signs of stabilization in Industrial where the rate of decline continued to moderate, and Energy did not get worse. Food & Beverage was down in the quarter due to ongoing declines in agriculture. We believe our beverage business remains healthy. 
Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 2% sales growth with strength in Residential and Water Quality Systems and ongoing strength in commercial in both Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions. While ERICO's performance is not captured in core results yet, we would point out the commercial markets remained solid for it, too. 
Infrastructure was positive once again led by continued growth in both North American municipal pumps and improved project activity in Process filtration globally. We've been looking for Flow & Filtration Solutions as the Infrastructure growth this year, which has played out as expected. And we're encouraged that bidding activity remains healthy as well. 
The rate of decline within Industrial moderated further. And we believe that this, our second largest vertical, appears to have found the bottom. Though we're not looking for a second half rebound, comparisons eased in the second half and should help reported results.
Food & Beverage declined for the second consecutive quarter as Flow & Filtration Solutions continue to feel the impact of agriculture markets that declined at a double-digit rate for us. Energy declined at a low double-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter, but we expect Energy sales to find the bottom in the second half based on the bottoming in sequential orders we've experienced. As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. ERICO contributes strength to the bottom line and strong underlying performance in synergies.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q2. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 3% core sales growth. While the growth rate declined sequentially with a tough comparison as the second quarter last year reflected slightly different timing in the North American pool season than what we're experiencing this year. While the timing is different to believe the North American pool season remains very healthy. Water filtration grew core sales 1% as both our Residential Filtration business and our Food service business faced tough comps. Segment income grew an impressive 11%, and return on sales expanded 200 basis points to 24.7%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter. Timing of growth investments may mute the rate of margin expansion in the second half, but we anticipate the prospects remain strong for Water Quality Systems.
Now let's move to Slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration saw core sales decline 1%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the second quarter. And while the Infrastructure growth came through as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by very challenging agriculture sales. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as strength in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double-digit decline in the irrigation pump shipments. This is very similar to what we saw last quarter in this business. While we expect both the Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure businesses to see continued growth, irrigation headwinds will likely persist as comparisons remain challenging, given the drought conditions in the west that helped our sales last year. 
Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 3%, while beverage returned to growth in the quarter and experienced strong orders growth as well. The precision spray business was negatively impacted by the beleaguered agriculture markets. Process filtration saw core sales growth of 10% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on Industrial water reuse solutions and a return to growth and Infrastructure with some desalination investments. This business has some lumpiness, given the timing of projects, but we believe we continue to gain momentum from our focus on industrial water reuse.
Segment income and return on sales contracted modestly as negative mix weighed on the segment's results. We believe this is just a pause in the margin improvement journey in Flow & Filtration Solutions, and that there's still a long runway ahead for further margin growth.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the second quarter. Technical Solutions reported 32% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of flat core sales growth, a 1% headwind from FX and a 34% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales and enclosures declined 5%, were encouraged by the stabilization in the daily order rate, which reinforces our view to easier comparisons in the back half of the year.
Thermal Management delivered core sales growth of 7%, helped in part by 2 projects in Canada that we previously discussed that are reaching completion. We have talked this year about our Industrial heat tracing business continuing to win small projects, but unfortunately, we're seeing no sign of downstream MRO spending growth return yet. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO sales are into commercial end markets, which remained very healthy in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business profitability, which is performing as expected.
Segment income grew 30%, while return on sales contracted 60 basis points to 20.6%. The margin contraction was isolated to our Thermal Management business as the growth we mentioned in projects versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix. ERICO's performed as we had anticipated. Enclosures are seeing signs of stabilization. The performance of these 2 SPGs was not enough in the quarter to offset the impact of the negative mix experienced in Thermal Management on the ROS.
We're not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound in the second half. We expect this will undoubtedly have an impact on third quarter margins for Technical Solutions. So with ERICO and Enclosures performing as expected, Technical Solutions remain well positioned long term.
Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q2. For the second consecutive quarter, Valves & Controls met or beat its forecast for both sales and margins. Even more, the heavy lifting we've done to rightsize the cost structure of the business read out in the nice gain in margin sequentially, and orders appear to have stabilized. Valves & Controls reported a 13% decline in revenue with core sales down 11% and a 2% headwind from FX. Backlog was down 7% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 27% year-over-year against the tough comparison. But as stated, we did see a flattening of orders sequentially.
Core sales were down 6% in aftermarket and down 17% in projects. In line with our expectations, the aftermarket business remained weak as OpEx continue to be constrained along with CapEx at many customers. We believe the order funnel overall is beginning to strengthen, which reinforces our view that orders have bottomed in the second quarter and will begin to expand near double-digit rates sequentially starting in the third quarter. 
The right half of the page shows second quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecasts. Return on sales of 10.1% was slightly ahead of our forecast and up significantly from the first quarter as our cost-out benefit registered in line with our previously communicated expectations.
The Valves & Controls team has done a courageous job in realigning the business to reflect a significant Energy industry reset. They've executed on the cost side while aligning the business with the opportunities that exists today and over the next several years. We continue to believe that Valves & Controls is well-positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets beginning in 2017 and will continue to enjoy rising margins sequentially even before that.
Now let's move to Slide 11 for a look at Valves & Controls backlog. Much of the backlog decline we saw has come as a result of progress we're making in reducing our past dues. Last year, we booked roughly $100 million in orders from projects greater than $5 million. However, we've not booked even 1 order greater than $5 million during the first half of 2016. Yet orders have bottomed out sequentially. And as our customers sort out their spending plans, we expect to see a return of some larger projects. So we believe that the second quarter marks the bottom for orders, and we're expecting orders to improve in the second half of the year from their depressed first half levels. For the past 3 quarters, the business has improved its forecasting capabilities. And with aftermarket orders now approximating 55% of orders, that should improve the margin mix. 
We're encouraged with Valves & Controls meeting or beating its forecast on sales, orders and income for the second consecutive quarter. There's been tremendous progress made on rightsizing the cost structure of the business and better alignment between sales and operations has improved the forecasting and executionability of the segment. We believe the order funnel will continue to strengthen. And while the top line will not show it right away, orders bottoming and margin improving show brighter days ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

We ended the second quarter with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This was an improvement from where we ended the year as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. 
As Randy mentioned earlier, free cash flow increased over $150 million during the first half of the year versus the comparable period last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year.
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our forecast for capital expenditures remains $150 million as we continue to invest in businesses that have earned the right to grow and drive standardization of productivity across the enterprise. We remain focused on generating strong cash flow and further debt reduction.
Please turn to Slide 13 labeled Q3 2016 Pentair outlook. For the third quarter, we expect core sales to be flat and total sales to increase 7% inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. As a reminder, we closed on the purchase of ERICO just before the end of Q3 last year. And starting in Q4, ERICO will be included in the core. On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 8%, while Flow & Filtration Solutions is expected to see core sales decline approximately 1%. Technical Solutions is expected to be flat on a core basis, and Valves & Controls is anticipated to see core sales decline 6%. We expect segment income to increase approximately 11% and return on sales to expand roughly 60 basis points to 16.7%. Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around 183 million. We expect free cash flow to continue to be strong during the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 14 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have taken $0.05 off at the top end of our range, and our full year adjusted EPS outlook is now $4.05 to $4.20. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 6%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to see a core sales decline of 1% versus our prior forecast of modest growth for the full year. Technical Solutions core sales is expected to be flat for the full year, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. Finally, Valves & Controls is expected to see core sales decline of approximately 9%. 
We expect segment income to grow roughly 8% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 16.3%. Our revised forecast factors in slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems and Valves & Controls while Technical Solutions of Flow & Filtration Solutions are expected to see margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. We anticipate full year corporate cost to be just under $90 million, net interest and other of roughly $140 million and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 5% in the midpoint of the range. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.

Listen, we've had a fairly sizable frontline for a period of time, and I think as Randy mentioned, we scrubbed it. We have discounted the larger projects from the expectation that those would close this year. But what we did, when we reorganized the sales force, is put a lot more energy and effort around the aftermarket side. And one other things we bring to the table to a lot of the larger customers is the ability to service a vast majority of valves. And the way that we're servicing those right now is on an aggregated buy basis from those customers, and in also working inside their factories or their plants to be able to benefit from that. So that's a big piece of it. The second one is that there has been some pent-up demand on the downstream side, especially the MRO downstream. And as we always said, we don't think that, that could be deferred forever. And we started to see that start to come in. So but, we're not declaring victory yet. I think what we're saying is that we believe that Q2 represents the bottom of the orders, and we're starting to see the increase from here.

We were pleased with our second quarter results, which came in at the high end of our expectations. The top line was consistent with our forecast, and incoming margins were slightly better than our expectations, driven by strong execution and continued benefit from our cost-out actions. 
The integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations. We remain on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted. Free cash flow was once again a positive story, and we're very pleased with our performance here. For the first half of the year, we have generated $304 million in free cash, which is over $150 million better than what we delivered in the first half last year.
We're updating our full year adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $4.05 to $4.20, which is bringing a $0.05 off the top end of the range. While Valves & Controls have started to become more predictable, we're seeing a negative impact of sales mix in both Flow and Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q2 2016 results. Second quarter core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than our previously communicated expectations. Water Quality Systems delivered solid growth once again, against the tough comparison; while Flow & Filtration Solutions felt the impact of continued difficult agriculture markets. The decline in Valves & Controls sales moderated. And Technical Solutions was flat compared to our expectation for a slight decline in the quarter. ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with our expectations. 
Segment income increased 7%, and return on sales expanded 30 basis points to 16.8%. Water Quality Systems saw a 200 basis point expansion, and Valves & Controls slightly beat its second quarter income and margin commitments, which were big steps up from the first quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 3% to $1.11 per share and was at the high end of our guidance of $1.08 to $1.11. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more detail on Pentair's Q2. Our sales performance was mixed by vertical with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure. We saw signs of stabilization in Industrial where the rate of decline continued to moderate, and Energy did not get worse. Food & Beverage was down in the quarter due to ongoing declines in agriculture. We believe our beverage business remains healthy. 
Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 2% sales growth with strength in Residential and Water Quality Systems and ongoing strength in commercial in both Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions. While ERICO's performance is not captured in core results yet, we would point out the commercial markets remained solid for it, too. 
Infrastructure was positive once again led by continued growth in both North American municipal pumps and improved project activity in Process filtration globally. We've been looking for Flow & Filtration Solutions as the Infrastructure growth this year, which has played out as expected. And we're encouraged that bidding activity remains healthy as well. 
The rate of decline within Industrial moderated further. And we believe that this, our second largest vertical, appears to have found the bottom. Though we're not looking for a second half rebound, comparisons eased in the second half and should help reported results.
Food & Beverage declined for the second consecutive quarter as Flow & Filtration Solutions continue to feel the impact of agriculture markets that declined at a double-digit rate for us. Energy declined at a low double-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter, but we expect Energy sales to find the bottom in the second half based on the bottoming in sequential orders we've experienced. As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. ERICO contributes strength to the bottom line and strong underlying performance in synergies.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q2. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 3% core sales growth. While the growth rate declined sequentially with a tough comparison as the second quarter last year reflected slightly different timing in the North American pool season than what we're experiencing this year. While the timing is different to believe the North American pool season remains very healthy. Water filtration grew core sales 1% as both our Residential Filtration business and our Food service business faced tough comps. Segment income grew an impressive 11%, and return on sales expanded 200 basis points to 24.7%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter. Timing of growth investments may mute the rate of margin expansion in the second half, but we anticipate the prospects remain strong for Water Quality Systems.
Now let's move to Slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration saw core sales decline 1%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the second quarter. And while the Infrastructure growth came through as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by very challenging agriculture sales. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as strength in Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double-digit decline in the irrigation pump shipments. This is very similar to what we saw last quarter in this business. While we expect both the Residential & Commercial and Infrastructure businesses to see continued growth, irrigation headwinds will likely persist as comparisons remain challenging, given the drought conditions in the west that helped our sales last year. 
Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 3%, while beverage returned to growth in the quarter and experienced strong orders growth as well. The precision spray business was negatively impacted by the beleaguered agriculture markets. Process filtration saw core sales growth of 10% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on Industrial water reuse solutions and a return to growth and Infrastructure with some desalination investments. This business has some lumpiness, given the timing of projects, but we believe we continue to gain momentum from our focus on industrial water reuse.
Segment income and return on sales contracted modestly as negative mix weighed on the segment's results. We believe this is just a pause in the margin improvement journey in Flow & Filtration Solutions, and that there's still a long runway ahead for further margin growth.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the second quarter. Technical Solutions reported 32% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of flat core sales growth, a 1% headwind from FX and a 34% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales and enclosures declined 5%, were encouraged by the stabilization in the daily order rate, which reinforces our view to easier comparisons in the back half of the year.
Thermal Management delivered core sales growth of 7%, helped in part by 2 projects in Canada that we previously discussed that are reaching completion. We have talked this year about our Industrial heat tracing business continuing to win small projects, but unfortunately, we're seeing no sign of downstream MRO spending growth return yet. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO sales are into commercial end markets, which remained very healthy in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business profitability, which is performing as expected.
Segment income grew 30%, while return on sales contracted 60 basis points to 20.6%. The margin contraction was isolated to our Thermal Management business as the growth we mentioned in projects versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix. ERICO's performed as we had anticipated. Enclosures are seeing signs of stabilization. The performance of these 2 SPGs was not enough in the quarter to offset the impact of the negative mix experienced in Thermal Management on the ROS.
We're not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound in the second half. We expect this will undoubtedly have an impact on third quarter margins for Technical Solutions. So with ERICO and Enclosures performing as expected, Technical Solutions remain well positioned long term.
Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q2. For the second consecutive quarter, Valves & Controls met or beat its forecast for both sales and margins. Even more, the heavy lifting we've done to rightsize the cost structure of the business read out in the nice gain in margin sequentially, and orders appear to have stabilized. Valves & Controls reported a 13% decline in revenue with core sales down 11% and a 2% headwind from FX. Backlog was down 7% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 27% year-over-year against the tough comparison. But as stated, we did see a flattening of orders sequentially.
Core sales were down 6% in aftermarket and down 17% in projects. In line with our expectations, the aftermarket business remained weak as OpEx continue to be constrained along with CapEx at many customers. We believe the order funnel overall is beginning to strengthen, which reinforces our view that orders have bottomed in the second quarter and will begin to expand near double-digit rates sequentially starting in the third quarter. 
The right half of the page shows second quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecasts. Return on sales of 10.1% was slightly ahead of our forecast and up significantly from the first quarter as our cost-out benefit registered in line with our previously communicated expectations.
The Valves & Controls team has done a courageous job in realigning the business to reflect a significant Energy industry reset. They've executed on the cost side while aligning the business with the opportunities that exists today and over the next several years. We continue to believe that Valves & Controls is well-positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets beginning in 2017 and will continue to enjoy rising margins sequentially even before that.
Now let's move to Slide 11 for a look at Valves & Controls backlog. Much of the backlog decline we saw has come as a result of progress we're making in reducing our past dues. Last year, we booked roughly $100 million in orders from projects greater than $5 million. However, we've not booked even 1 order greater than $5 million during the first half of 2016. Yet orders have bottomed out sequentially. And as our customers sort out their spending plans, we expect to see a return of some larger projects. So we believe that the second quarter marks the bottom for orders, and we're expecting orders to improve in the second half of the year from their depressed first half levels. For the past 3 quarters, the business has improved its forecasting capabilities. And with aftermarket orders now approximating 55% of orders, that should improve the margin mix. 
We're encouraged with Valves & Controls meeting or beating its forecast on sales, orders and income for the second consecutive quarter. There's been tremendous progress made on rightsizing the cost structure of the business and better alignment between sales and operations has improved the forecasting and executionability of the segment. We believe the order funnel will continue to strengthen. And while the top line will not show it right away, orders bottoming and margin improving show brighter days ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

We ended the second quarter with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This was an improvement from where we ended the year as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. 
As Randy mentioned earlier, free cash flow increased over $150 million during the first half of the year versus the comparable period last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year.
Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our forecast for capital expenditures remains $150 million as we continue to invest in businesses that have earned the right to grow and drive standardization of productivity across the enterprise. We remain focused on generating strong cash flow and further debt reduction.
Please turn to Slide 13 labeled Q3 2016 Pentair outlook. For the third quarter, we expect core sales to be flat and total sales to increase 7% inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. As a reminder, we closed on the purchase of ERICO just before the end of Q3 last year. And starting in Q4, ERICO will be included in the core. On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 8%, while Flow & Filtration Solutions is expected to see core sales decline approximately 1%. Technical Solutions is expected to be flat on a core basis, and Valves & Controls is anticipated to see core sales decline 6%. We expect segment income to increase approximately 11% and return on sales to expand roughly 60 basis points to 16.7%. Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around 183 million. We expect free cash flow to continue to be strong during the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 14 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have taken $0.05 off at the top end of our range, and our full year adjusted EPS outlook is now $4.05 to $4.20. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 6%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to see a core sales decline of 1% versus our prior forecast of modest growth for the full year. Technical Solutions core sales is expected to be flat for the full year, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. Finally, Valves & Controls is expected to see core sales decline of approximately 9%. 
We expect segment income to grow roughly 8% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 16.3%. Our revised forecast factors in slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems and Valves & Controls while Technical Solutions of Flow & Filtration Solutions are expected to see margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. We anticipate full year corporate cost to be just under $90 million, net interest and other of roughly $140 million and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 5% in the midpoint of the range. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.

When you take a look at the orders, and what Randy mentioned of not getting any large orders, it means that our conversion ratio is going to be higher. So we feel like as we head into '17, even ending the year at lower orders in '16, we think our conversion ratio is going to get back to historical norms, which is around 51% of orders that are booked in the year shipped in that year. That troughed last year around 43%. So I think, we feel like we're starting to get that mix up, as we mentioned, with more aftermarket standard.

Listen, we've had a fairly sizable frontline for a period of time, and I think as Randy mentioned, we scrubbed it. We have discounted the larger projects from the expectation that those would close this year. But what we did, when we reorganized the sales force, is put a lot more energy and effort around the aftermarket side. And one other things we bring to the table to a lot of the larger customers is the ability to service a vast majority of valves. And the way that we're servicing those right now is on an aggregated buy basis from those customers, and in also working inside their factories or their plants to be able to benefit from that. So that's a big piece of it. The second one is that there has been some pent-up demand on the downstream side, especially the MRO downstream. And as we always said, we don't think that, that could be deferred forever. And we started to see that start to come in. So but, we're not declaring victory yet. I think what we're saying is that we believe that Q2 represents the bottom of the orders, and we're starting to see the increase from here. A double-digit increase off of Q2 is still a modest level of orders that we're -- versus what we're used to. But it's at least a sign that we're going to see that downstream investment start to come back."

We delivered third quarter results that operationally met the high end of our forecast and were slightly above our guidance as the result of anticipated separation costs that did not materialize. While 2 of our 3 segments did not deliver core sales growth as a result of continued slow industrial spending, the margin performance overall is a testament to our strong discipline around cost management. 
We announced in August that we reached an agreement to sell our Valves & Controls business to Emerson. This transaction is on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to regulatory approvals. We're not expecting any recovery in industrial capital or maintenance spending at the end of the year in contrast to the typical year-end lift. Given this muted top line outlook predominantly on industrial-facing businesses, we're lowering our fourth quarter outlook. 
We do not believe the fourth quarter is indicative of a trend, and we expect at some point, maintenance spending will return in a more meaningful way. And longer-cycle projects, particularly in food & beverage and infrastructure, are also likely to break loose. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we believe we are positioned to deliver strong EPS expansion despite this ongoing slower-growth environment. I'll discuss this in more detail later in the call.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q3 2016 results. Third quarter core sales declined 2% as we saw a further slowdown in capital spending throughout the quarter and ongoing deferrals in maintenance spending. Water Quality Systems was our only segment to deliver core growth as the pool business once again finished the season in a strong position. We reached the 1-year anniversary of ERICO acquisition, and the performance has met all of our expectations. 
Segment income grew 15%, and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 17.9%. Water Quality Systems delivered over 300 basis points of margin expansion. And despite the core sales decline in Flow & Filtration Solutions, income and margins were down only modestly as the segment delivered on better internal execution. 
Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $0.78 per share and exceeded our forecast of $0.70 to $0.75 per share, as our core operating results met our income forecast while we did not incur the onetime separation cost we were expecting below the segment income line. Free cash flow continued to be a bright spot, up over $150 million year-to-date compared to last year, and our conversion to adjust the net income remains just north of 100%. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more detail on Pentair's Q3 2016 performance. Once again, the residential & commercial vertical is a bright spot, driven in large part by our strong North American pool performance. While ERICO's performance was not captured in the core, its commercial sales also remained strong. After a good second quarter, we did see overall Infrastructure sales decline modestly in the third quarter. We continue to see strength in engineered pump orders and backlog, but our process filtration business faces difficult second half comparisons as large projects in the comparable period last year are not repeating.
Food & beverage declined, with delays in a number of larger beverage projects being the largest factor this quarter. While we greatly reduced our exposure to energy, our remaining sales for this vertical remain under pressure. Industrial was down in the quarter due in part to ongoing deferrals in short-cycle MRO spending and a global capital spending freeze that shows no sign of thawing. 
The right-hand side of the page shows that price and productivity continue to more than offset inflation as we continue to control costs across the enterprise. ERICO's contribution also helped drive the strong margin performance in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q3. Water Quality Systems delivered core growth of 2%. These results were below our expectations as within our water filtration business, we saw foodservice and commercial market softness in North America and Western Europe as well as shifts in timing of key account program installations. We also experienced a moderation in growth rates in the fast-growth regions as our distributors closely managed inventory levels due to slower growth in China. 
The North American pool market ended its season in a strong note. We continue to view this market favorably longer term. We also believe our water filtration business has good long-term prospects and expect growth to return in 2017 as new product rollouts and key account program installations, particularly in foodservice, return to growth in normal levels. 
Segment income grew an impressive 15%, and return on sales expanded 240 basis points to 21.2%. Robust operating leverage was once again the largest contributor to this strong margin performance with the strong growth in the pool business contributing positively in the second quarter.
Now let's move to Slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q3. Flow & Filtration Solutions saw core sales declining 6%. While we anticipated sales to contract in the quarter, water technologies and fluid solutions were down more than expected as we saw a softening demand in short-cycle pump sales and weaker capital spending in beverage. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as distributors managed inventory levels tightly, and we saw continued declines in irrigation sales albeit in a moderated pace. We experienced a dramatic slowdown in fast-growth regions, particularly in the Middle East and Latin America. The sell-through was soft in the quarter and as a result, distributors are not restocking. In contrast, Western Europe was a bright spot, up double digits in the quarter with good momentum. We continue to see an improvement in infrastructure bid activity, which points to a stronger 2017. 
Fluid solutions core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than the 3% decline we saw last quarter. Sales in agriculture grew modestly in the quarter, and importantly, we expect this momentum to continue. Our biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration businesses remain strong, offsetting partially -- offset partially by our beverage business seeing a number a large project delays globally and softer component sell-through. Core sales in process filtration declined 22%, largely in line with expectations with the key drivers being project timing within infrastructure as well as the declines in oil & gas and industrial filtration. 
Segment income and return on sales declined modestly as the impact of lower volumes were not fully offset by the continued strong productivity and pricing seen for the past several quarters. We remain vigilant on improving the cost structure to offset the impact of lower volumes.
Looking ahead, we expect food & beverage to rebound, with agriculture turning positive along with growth in biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration. As we continue to reduce the complexity in the business and drive better execution in projects, we believe we have a long runway for margin improvement. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the third quarter. Technical Solutions reported 26% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 1% core sales decline and a 27% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in enclosures declined 1% as industrial sales continued to bounce along the bottom, diminishing chances of any order rate growth acceleration for the remainder of 2016. Thermal management core sales declined 5% as downstream energy MRO product sales are not showing any signs of recovery. Our industrial heat tracing business continues to win small projects, but our project growth was challenged as large Canadian projects are nearing completion. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations at the completion of the 1-year deal anniversary. The majority of ERICO sales are into commercial vertical, which continue to deliver growth in the quarter, although the rate of growth is moderating.
Segment income grew 18% as return on sales contracted 140 basis points to 22%. Margin contraction was isolated to our thermal management business as the sales of project versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix, and we faced productivity issues at the end of the large Canadian projects. ERICO has performed as we had anticipated, and enclosures continues to stabilize. The performance of these 2 businesses was not enough in the quarter to offset the margin impact from thermal management. We're now expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound for the remainder of the year, and we also expect the Canadian project margins to pressure thermal margins in Q4 as we substantially complete them before the end of the year. This will undoubtedly have an impact on fourth quarter margins for Technical Solutions. With ERICO and enclosures performing as expected and thermal completing the large Canadian projects, we still believe Technical Solutions remains well positioned longer term.
I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 outlook, and then I'll have a few closing remarks about how we're looking at the world entering 2017."

For the fourth quarter, we expect overall sales",603,"Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #10 titled Q4 2016 Pentair outlook. For the fourth quarter, ERICO is now captured in the core results, so core sales and total sales are currently equal to each other. For the fourth quarter, we expect overall sales to decline approximately 6% as we expect MRO trends in energy and customer capital spending in all verticals to worsen as we head into the end of the year. Motivation for customers to push out projects and commitments shows no signs of stopping by the end of the year. 
On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 2%, while we expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to decline approximately 9%, primarily related to project spending in the food & beverage vertical. Technical Solutions is expected to decline approximately 10%, due in large part to the completion of previously mentioned large Canadian projects and mid-teens declines in year-over-year MRO spending within energy. We expect segment income to be down approximately 10% and return on sales to decline roughly 70 basis points to 17%. 
Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 21.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around $184 million, about flat with Q3 ending levels. We expect free cash flow to end the year on a strong note, greater than continuing operations net income of $550 million and nearly $780 million, inclusive of Valves & Controls.
Please turn to Slide 11 labeled full year 2016 Pentair outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have taken our full year adjusted EPS outlook from continuing operations down to approximately $3 for 2016. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 4%. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales decline of 4% and Technical Solutions core sales to be down 2% for the full year. We expect segment income to grow roughly 11% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 17.1%. Our revised forecast factored is slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems while Technical Solutions and fluid Filtration Solutions are expected to have margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. The pressure on higher-margin short-cycle sales has been felt most acutely within Technical Solutions. We anticipate full year corporate cost to be just under $110 million, net interest and other of roughly $141 million and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 6%. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.
Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow.
We ended the third quarter with $4.4 billion net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This continues to improve as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow increased over $150 million versus the first 9 months last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.6%. When the sale of Valves & Controls close as we expect our balance sheet will look dramatically different for the better with lower debt levels and balance sheet capacity available for tuck-ins and incremental buybacks. I will now turn the call back over to Randy for some closing comments and preliminary thoughts around 2017."

As I mentioned in the beginning of the call, the sale of Valves & Controls remains on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to the regulatory approvals. With the closing of the Valves & Controls separation, we expect the infusion of cash to alter our balance sheet dramatically for the better. As we discussed in August, we know what debt we will retire, mostly within our bank line. We're also exploring other options to restructure our debt reduce interest expense on a higher cost fixed-rate long-term debt. We also continue to build our bolt-on acquisition funnel for businesses that have earned the right to grow, primarily within Water Quality Systems. We're doing what we can to control our debt and while we still see some pockets of growth within residential & commercial and infrastructure, the uncertainty around any type of recovery within Industrial gives us pause. So we're taking a closer look at our cost structure and adjusting it accordingly.
Now let's move to Slide 14 for a look at segment positioning. Water Quality Systems has been a bright spot within the Pentair portfolio for several years. And while we have seen the growth rate moderate some, we continue to believe in the long-term prospects of this high-performing segment. With strong residential demand, dealer intimacy and a steady stream of new products, our outlook for the Aquatics business remains strong. Within Water Filtration, we continue to believe we will benefit from increased awareness around water quality globally, and our investments in a more focused sales effort in North America and Europe are already paying early dividends. Foodservice has been a relatively consistent growth business for us longer term. We continue to believe there are many avenues for growth, including traditional restaurant sales as well as edging out to adjacent products and connected solutions. We believe Flow & Filtration Solutions remains the biggest opportunity for improvement within the Pentair portfolio. Our #1 priority is reducing the complexity of the business, accelerating cost-out action, focusing on the most attractive growth prospects. We continue to see momentum around biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration. It's encouraging that agriculture seems to have bottomed. So we believe we're building some momentum exiting this year after a tough couple of years. As I discussed previously, we're seeing improved orders in backlog in Infrastructure, which is a longer-cycle part of the business positioning for return to growth. Finally, we're placing an increased focus and building out the aftermarket service capabilities to leverage our installed base. Flow & Filtration Solutions has a number of opportunities that our principal focus is to prioritize which opportunity to first and build momentum to restore growth and raise margins. We believe Technical Solutions has an attractive position in profitable areas of the electrical industry. We expect the 2016 headwinds will begin to dissipate as Industrial order rate are near trough levels, inflation returning are on the horizon, large projects in Canada are complete and deferred MRO spending cannot continue forever. While we expect the strong growth in commercial to moderate, growth is likely to continue, progressively right sizing the cost structure with a slower growth environment. This is the piece of our portfolio and we still have energy exposure and while oil prices appear to stabilize, we watch closely for signs of improving thermal MRO spending.
While we still expect some near-term headwinds in parts of our portfolio, we still believe there are many avenues for growth longer term.
Now let's move to Slide 15 for a look at the framework for 2017. Given the portfolio of change and the P&L improvements we are undergoing, I think it's important to provide some framework for thinking about our prospects for next year. As we discussed throughout the call, we expect the slow growth world we are all facing today to continue, and we do not expect the meaningful recovery in 2017. Therefore, it's prudent to focus on having our cost structure aligned with this reality, the result of which should be margin expansion from all 3 segments next year. Upon the closing of the Valves & Controls sales, we expect an opportunity to restructure our debt and to reduce interest expense. Also, we expect other financial flexibility to explore other opportunities to allocate capital in a disciplined manner. By focusing on cost, simplifying the business and improve in the capital structure we expect to be able to deliver EPS growth in excess of 15% next year with minimal top line help while still positioning the company for the longer term.

What we're really saying is these larger projects that were out there for the Q4 cycle are going to be pushed or deferred into next year or maybe deferred permanently. And we don't see the environment that's reflected in Q4 and the pause and concern of our overall customer base being the same cause of concern that we see as we enter 2017. Now we said negative 2 to plus 2 next year clearly not a robust growth environment, but that's flattish, and then we had the operating income cost structure changes that we're driving in the organization to drive margin improvement."

I'll be starting on Slide 4. 
We delivered third quarter results that operationally met the high end of our forecast and were slightly above our guidance as the result of anticipated separation costs that did not materialize. While 2 of our 3 segments did not deliver core sales growth as a result of continued slow industrial spending, the margin performance overall is a testament to our strong discipline around cost management. 
We announced in August that we reached an agreement to sell our Valves & Controls business to Emerson. This transaction is on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to regulatory approvals. We're not expecting any recovery in industrial capital or maintenance spending at the end of the year in contrast to the typical year-end lift. Given this muted top line outlook predominantly on industrial-facing businesses, we're lowering our fourth quarter outlook. 
We do not believe the fourth quarter is indicative of a trend, and we expect at some point, maintenance spending will return in a more meaningful way. And longer-cycle projects, particularly in food & beverage and infrastructure, are also likely to break loose. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we believe we are positioned to deliver strong EPS expansion despite this ongoing slower-growth environment. I'll discuss this in more detail later in the call.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q3 2016 results. Third quarter core sales declined 2% as we saw a further slowdown in capital spending throughout the quarter and ongoing deferrals in maintenance spending. Water Quality Systems was our only segment to deliver core growth as the pool business once again finished the season in a strong position. We reached the 1-year anniversary of ERICO acquisition, and the performance has met all of our expectations. 
Segment income grew 15%, and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 17.9%. Water Quality Systems delivered over 300 basis points of margin expansion. And despite the core sales decline in Flow & Filtration Solutions, income and margins were down only modestly as the segment delivered on better internal execution. 
Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $0.78 per share and exceeded our forecast of $0.70 to $0.75 per share, as our core operating results met our income forecast while we did not incur the onetime separation cost we were expecting below the segment income line. Free cash flow continued to be a bright spot, up over $150 million year-to-date compared to last year, and our conversion to adjust the net income remains just north of 100%. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more detail on Pentair's Q3 2016 performance. Once again, the residential & commercial vertical is a bright spot, driven in large part by our strong North American pool performance. While ERICO's performance was not captured in the core, its commercial sales also remained strong. After a good second quarter, we did see overall Infrastructure sales decline modestly in the third quarter. We continue to see strength in engineered pump orders and backlog, but our process filtration business faces difficult second half comparisons as large projects in the comparable period last year are not repeating.
Food & beverage declined, with delays in a number of larger beverage projects being the largest factor this quarter. While we greatly reduced our exposure to energy, our remaining sales for this vertical remain under pressure. Industrial was down in the quarter due in part to ongoing deferrals in short-cycle MRO spending and a global capital spending freeze that shows no sign of thawing. 
The right-hand side of the page shows that price and productivity continue to more than offset inflation as we continue to control costs across the enterprise. ERICO's contribution also helped drive the strong margin performance in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q3. Water Quality Systems delivered core growth of 2%. These results were below our expectations as within our water filtration business, we saw foodservice and commercial market softness in North America and Western Europe as well as shifts in timing of key account program installations. We also experienced a moderation in growth rates in the fast-growth regions as our distributors closely managed inventory levels due to slower growth in China. 
The North American pool market ended its season in a strong note. We continue to view this market favorably longer term. We also believe our water filtration business has good long-term prospects and expect growth to return in 2017 as new product rollouts and key account program installations, particularly in foodservice, return to growth in normal levels. 
Segment income grew an impressive 15%, and return on sales expanded 240 basis points to 21.2%. Robust operating leverage was once again the largest contributor to this strong margin performance with the strong growth in the pool business contributing positively in the second quarter.
Now let's move to Slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q3. Flow & Filtration Solutions saw core sales declining 6%. While we anticipated sales to contract in the quarter, water technologies and fluid solutions were down more than expected as we saw a softening demand in short-cycle pump sales and weaker capital spending in beverage. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as distributors managed inventory levels tightly, and we saw continued declines in irrigation sales albeit in a moderated pace. We experienced a dramatic slowdown in fast-growth regions, particularly in the Middle East and Latin America. The sell-through was soft in the quarter and as a result, distributors are not restocking. In contrast, Western Europe was a bright spot, up double digits in the quarter with good momentum. We continue to see an improvement in infrastructure bid activity, which points to a stronger 2017. 
Fluid solutions core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than the 3% decline we saw last quarter. Sales in agriculture grew modestly in the quarter, and importantly, we expect this momentum to continue. Our biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration businesses remain strong, offsetting partially -- offset partially by our beverage business seeing a number a large project delays globally and softer component sell-through. Core sales in process filtration declined 22%, largely in line with expectations with the key drivers being project timing within infrastructure as well as the declines in oil & gas and industrial filtration. 
Segment income and return on sales declined modestly as the impact of lower volumes were not fully offset by the continued strong productivity and pricing seen for the past several quarters. We remain vigilant on improving the cost structure to offset the impact of lower volumes.
Looking ahead, we expect food & beverage to rebound, with agriculture turning positive along with growth in biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration. As we continue to reduce the complexity in the business and drive better execution in projects, we believe we have a long runway for margin improvement. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the third quarter. Technical Solutions reported 26% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 1% core sales decline and a 27% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in enclosures declined 1% as industrial sales continued to bounce along the bottom, diminishing chances of any order rate growth acceleration for the remainder of 2016. Thermal management core sales declined 5% as downstream energy MRO product sales are not showing any signs of recovery. Our industrial heat tracing business continues to win small projects, but our project growth was challenged as large Canadian projects are nearing completion. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations at the completion of the 1-year deal anniversary. The majority of ERICO sales are into commercial vertical, which continue to deliver growth in the quarter, although the rate of growth is moderating.
Segment income grew 18% as return on sales contracted 140 basis points to 22%. Margin contraction was isolated to our thermal management business as the sales of project versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix, and we faced productivity issues at the end of the large Canadian projects. ERICO has performed as we had anticipated, and enclosures continues to stabilize. The performance of these 2 businesses was not enough in the quarter to offset the margin impact from thermal management. We're now expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound for the remainder of the year, and we also expect the Canadian project margins to pressure thermal margins in Q4 as we substantially complete them before the end of the year. This will undoubtedly have an impact on fourth quarter margins for Technical Solutions. With ERICO and enclosures performing as expected and thermal completing the large Canadian projects, we still believe Technical Solutions remains well positioned longer term.
I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 outlook, and then I'll have a few closing remarks about how we're looking at the world entering 2017."

For the fourth quarter, ERICO is now captured in the core results, so core sales and total sales are currently equal to each other. For the fourth quarter, we expect overall sales to decline approximately 6% as we expect MRO trends in energy and customer capital spending in all verticals to worsen as we head into the end of the year. Motivation for customers to push out projects and commitments shows no signs of stopping by the end of the year. 
On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 2%, while we expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to decline approximately 9%, primarily related to project spending in the food & beverage vertical. Technical Solutions is expected to decline approximately 10%, due in large part to the completion of previously mentioned large Canadian projects and mid-teens declines in year-over-year MRO spending within energy. We expect segment income to be down approximately 10% and return on sales to decline roughly 70 basis points to 17%. 
Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 21.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around $184 million, about flat with Q3 ending levels. We expect free cash flow to end the year on a strong note, greater than continuing operations net income of $550 million and nearly $780 million, inclusive of Valves & Controls.
Please turn to Slide 11 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we've taken our full year adjusted EPS outlook from continuing operations down to approximately $3 for 2016. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 4%. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales decline of 4% and Technical Solutions core sales to be down 2% for the full year. We expect segment income to grow roughly 11% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 17.1%. Our revised forecast factored in slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems while Technical Solutions and Flow & Filtration Solutions are expected to have margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. The pressure on higher-margin short-cycle sales has been felt most acutely within Technical Solutions. 
We anticipate full year corporate costs to be just under $110 million, net interest and other of roughly $141 million and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 6%. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.
Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We ended the third quarter with $4.4 billion net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This continues to improve as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow has increased over $150 million versus the first 9 months last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.6%. When the sale of Valves & Controls closes, we expect our balance sheet will look dramatically different for the better with lower debt levels and balance sheet capacity available for tuck-ins or incremental buybacks. 
I will now turn the call back over to Randy for some closing comments and preliminary thoughts around 2017."

As I mentioned in the beginning of the call, the sale of Valves & Controls remains on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to the regular regulatory approvals. With the closing of the Valves",794,"I'll wrap up beginning on Slide 13. As I mentioned in the beginning of the call, the sale of Valves & Controls remains on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to the regular regulatory approvals. With the closing of the Valves & Controls separation, we expect the infusion of cash to alter our balance sheet dramatically for the better. As we discussed in August, we know what debt we will retire, mostly within our bank line. We're also exploring other options to restructure our debt, potentially reduce interest expense on our higher-cost fixed-rate long-term debt. We also continue to build our bolt-on acquisition funnel for businesses that have earned the right to grow, primarily within Water Quality Systems. We're doing what we can to control our destiny, and while we still see some pockets of growth within residential & commercial and infrastructure, the uncertainty around any type of recovery within industrial gives us pause. So we're taking a closer look at our cost structure and adjusting it accordingly.
Now let's move to Slide 14 for a look at segment positioning. Water Quality Systems has been a bright spot within the Pentair portfolio for several years. And while we've seen the growth rate moderate some, we continue to believe in the long-term prospects of this high-performing segment. With strong residential demand, dealer intimacy and a steady stream of new products, our outlook for the aquatics business remains strong. Within water filtration, we continue to believe we will benefit from increased awareness around water quality globally, and our investments in a more focused sales effort in North America and Europe are already paying early dividends. Foodservice has been a relatively consistent growth business for us longer term and we continue to believe there are many avenues for growth, including traditional restaurant sales as well as edging out into adjacent products and connected solutions. 
We believe Flow & Filtration Solutions remains the biggest opportunity for improvement within the Pentair portfolio. Our #1 priority is reducing the complexity of the business, accelerating cost-out action and focusing on the most attractive growth prospects. We continue to see momentum around biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration. It is encouraging that agriculture seems to have bottomed. So we believe we're building some momentum exiting this year after our tough couple of years. As I discussed previously, we're seeing improved orders in backlog in infrastructure, which is a longer-cycle part of the business that is positioning for return to growth. Finally, we're placing an increased focus on building our aftermarket service capabilities to leverage our installed base. Flow & Filtration Solutions has a number of opportunities, and our principal focus is to prioritize which opportunities to drive first and build momentum to restore growth and raise margins. 
We believe Technical Solutions has an attractive position in profitable areas of the electrical industry. We expect the 2016 headwinds will begin to dissipate as industrial order rates are near trough levels, [indiscernible] inflation returning are on the horizon, large projects in Canada are complete and deferred MRO spending cannot continue forever. While we expect the strong growth in commercial to moderate, growth is likely to continue, progressively rightsizing the cost structure with the slower growth environment. This is the piece of our portfolio where we still have energy exposure, and while oil prices appear to have stabilize, we'll watch closely for signs of improving thermal MRO spending. While we still expect some near-term headwinds in parts of our portfolio, we still believe there are many avenues for growth longer term.
Now let's move to Slide 15 for a look at the framework for 2017. Given the portfolio change and attendant P&L and balance sheet improvements we are undergoing, we think it's important to provide some framework for thinking about our prospects for next year. As we discussed throughout the call, we expect the slow growth world we are all facing today to continue, and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in 2017. Therefore, it's prudent to focus on having our cost structure aligned with this reality, the result of which should be margin expansion from all 3 segments next year. 
Upon the closing of the Valves & Controls sale, we expect to have an opportunity to restructure our debt, which will reduce interest expense. Also, we expect to have the financial flexibility to explore other opportunities to allocate capital in a disciplined manner. By focusing on cost, simplifying the business and improving the capital structure, we expect to be able to deliver EPS growth in excess of 15% next year with minimal top line help while still positioning the company for the longer term.

I mean, we're getting out from under the overhang of a lot of debt, and we take our lessons from that. Okay? But the place that we have the most opportunity, we are one of the leading players in water. We expanded that with the Tyco merger into the broader flow space, and I think we want to get narrowly focused again in what I'll call the water side of the flow space. So that's why I mentioned water quality. There is some that are sort of in between water quality and FFS, which is really -- I mean, that's really both of them together are our water business. And so we want to continue to build that leading position. And so the -- around water quality and availability, we like the food & beverage business, although we want to be careful about the heavy-capital side of that versus things with annuity, which is why we like the membrane, the beer filtration and also biogas, which is a, we think, a nice growth business. So it will be in areas that expand our reach and deepen our expertise in water, they way we think about it."

I'll be starting on Slide 4. 
We delivered third quarter results that operationally met the high end of our forecast and were slightly above our guidance as the result of anticipated separation costs that did not materialize. While 2 of our 3 segments did not deliver core sales growth as a result of continued slow industrial spending, the margin performance overall is a testament to our strong discipline around cost management. 
We announced in August that we reached an agreement to sell our Valves & Controls business to Emerson. This transaction is on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to regulatory approvals. We're not expecting any recovery in industrial capital or maintenance spending at the end of the year in contrast to the typical year-end lift. Given this muted top line outlook predominantly on industrial-facing businesses we're lowering our fourth quarter outlook.
We do not believe the fourth quarter is indicative of a trend, and we expect at some point, maintenance spending will return in a more meaningful way. And longer-cycle projects, particularly in food & beverage and infrastructure, are also likely to break loose. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we believe we are positioned to deliver strong EPS expansion despite this ongoing slower-growth environment. I'll discuss this in more detail later in the call.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q3 2016 results. Third quarter core sales declined 2% as we saw a further slowdown in capital spending throughout the quarter and ongoing deferrals in maintenance spending. Water Quality Systems was our only segment to deliver core growth as the pool business once again finished the season in a strong position. We reached the 1-year anniversary of ERICO acquisition, and the performance has met all of our expectations. 
Segment income grew 15%, and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 17.9%. Water Quality Systems delivered over 300 basis points of margin expansion. And despite the core sales decline in Flow & Filtration Solutions, income and margins were down only modestly as the segment delivered on better internal execution. 
Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $0.78 per share and exceeded our forecast of $0.70 to $0.75 per share, as our core operating results met our income forecast while we did not incur the onetime separation cost we were expecting below the segment income line. Free cash flow continued to be a bright spot, up over $150 million year-to-date compared to last year, and our conversion to adjust the net income remains just north of 100%. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more detail on Pentair's Q3 2016 performance. Once again, the residential & commercial vertical was a bright spot, driven in large part by our strong North American pool performance. While ERICO's performance was not captured in the core, its commercial sales also remained strong. After a good second quarter, we did see overall Infrastructure sales decline modestly in the third quarter. We continue to see strength in engineered pump orders and backlog, but our process filtration business faces difficult second half comparisons as large projects in the comparable period last year are not repeating.
Food & beverage declined, with delays in a number of larger beverage projects being the largest factor this quarter. While we greatly reduced our exposure to energy, our remaining sales for this vertical remain under pressure. Industrial was down in the quarter due in part to ongoing deferrals in short-cycle MRO spending and a global capital spending freeze that shows no sign of thawing. 
The right-hand side of the page shows that price and productivity continue to more than offset inflation as we continued to control costs across the enterprise. ERICO's contribution also helped drive the strong margin performance in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q3. Water Quality Systems delivered core growth of 2%. These results were below our expectations, as within our water filtration business, we saw foodservice and commercial market softness in North America and Western Europe as well as shifts in timing of key account program installations. We also experienced a moderation in growth rates in the fast-growth regions as our distributors closely managed inventory levels due to slower growth in China. 
The North American pool market ended its season on a strong note. We continue to view this market favorably longer term. We also believe our water filtration business has good long-term prospects and expect growth to return in 2017 as new product rollouts and key account program installations, particularly in foodservice, return to growth in normal levels. 
Segment income grew an impressive 15%, and return on sales expanded 240 basis points to 21.2%. Robust operating leverage was once again the largest contributor to this strong margin performance with the strong growth in the pool business contributing positively in the second quarter.
Now let's move to Slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q3. Flow & Filtration Solutions saw core sales declining 6%. While we anticipated sales to contract in the quarter, water technologies and fluid solutions were down more than expected as we saw a softening demand in short-cycle pump sales and weaker capital spending in beverage. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as distributors managed inventory levels tightly, and we saw continued declines in irrigation sales albeit at a moderated pace. We experienced a dramatic slowdown in fast-growth regions, particularly in the Middle East and Latin America. The sell-through was soft in the quarter and as a result, distributors are not restocking. In contrast, Western Europe was a bright spot, up double digits in the quarter with good momentum. We continue to see an improvement in infrastructure bid activity, which points to a stronger 2017. 
Fluid solutions core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than the 3% decline we saw last quarter. Sales in agriculture grew modestly in the quarter, and importantly, we expect this momentum to continue. Our biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration businesses remain strong, offsetting partially -- offset partially by our beverage business seeing a number a large project delays globally and softer component sell-through. Core sales in process filtration declined 22%, largely in line with expectations with the key drivers being project timing within infrastructure as well as declines in oil & gas and industrial filtration. 
Segment income and return on sales declined modestly as the impact of lower volumes were not fully offset by the continued strong productivity and pricing seen for the past several quarters. We remain vigilant on improving the cost structure to offset the impact of lower volumes.
Looking ahead, we expect food & beverage to rebound, with agriculture turning positive along with growth in biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration. As we continue to reduce the complexity in the business and drive better execution in projects, we believe we have a long runway for margin improvement. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the third quarter. Technical Solutions reported 26% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 1% core sales decline and a 27% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in enclosures declined 1% as industrial sales continued to bounce along the bottom, diminishing chances of any order rate growth acceleration for the remainder of 2016. Thermal management core sales declined 5% as downstream energy MRO product sales are not showing any signs of recovery. Our industrial heat tracing business continues to win small projects, but our project growth was challenged as large Canadian projects are nearing completion. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations at the completion of the 1-year deal anniversary. The majority of ERICO sales are into commercial vertical, which continued to deliver growth in the quarter, although the rate of growth is moderating.
Segment income grew 18% as return on sales contracted 140 basis points to 22%. Margin contraction was isolated to our thermal management business as the sales of project versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix, and we faced productivity issues at the end of the large Canadian projects. ERICO has performed as we had anticipated, and enclosures continues to stabilize. The performance of these 2 businesses was not enough in the quarter to offset the margin impact from thermal management. We're not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound for the remainder of the year, and we also expect the Canadian project margins to pressure thermal margins in Q4 as we substantially complete them before the end of the year. This will undoubtedly have an impact on fourth quarter margins for Technical Solutions. With ERICO and enclosures performing as expected and thermal completing the large Canadian projects, we still believe Technical Solutions remains well positioned longer term.
I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 outlook, and then I'll have a few closing remarks about how we're looking at the world entering 2017."

For the fourth quarter, ERICO is now captured in the core results, so core sales and total sales are currently equal to each other. For the fourth quarter, we expect overall sales to decline approximately 6% as we expect MRO trends in energy and customer capital spending in all verticals to worsen as we head into the end of the year. Motivation for customers to push out projects and commitments shows no signs of stopping by the end of the year. 
On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 2%, while we expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to decline approximately 9%, primarily related to project spending in the food & beverage vertical. Technical Solutions is expected to decline approximately 10%, due in large part to the completion of previously mentioned large Canadian projects and mid-teens declines in year-over-year MRO spending within energy. We expect segment income to be down approximately 10% and return on sales to decline roughly 70 basis points to 17%. 
Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 21.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around $184 million, about flat with Q3 ending levels. We expect free cash flow to end the year on a strong note, greater than continuing operations net income of $550 million and nearly $780 million inclusive of Valves & Controls.
Please turn to Slide 11, labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we've taken our full year adjusted EPS outlook from continuing operations down to approximately $3 for 2016. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 4%. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales decline of 4% and Technical Solutions core sales to be down 2% for the full year. We expect segment income to grow roughly 11% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 17.1%. Our revised forecast factors in slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems while Technical Solutions and Flow & Filtration Solutions are expected to have margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. The pressure on higher-margin short-cycle sales has been felt most acutely within Technical Solutions. 
We anticipate full year corporate costs to be just under $110 million, net interest and other of roughly $141 million and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 6%. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.
Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We ended the third quarter with $4.4 billion net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This continues to improve as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow has increased over $150 million versus the first 9 months last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.6%. When the sale of Valves & Controls closes, we expect our balance sheet will look dramatically different for the better with lower debt levels and balance sheet capacity available for tuck-ins or incremental buybacks. 
I will now turn the call back over to Randy for some closing comments and preliminary thoughts around 2017."

As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the sale of Valves & Controls remains on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to the regular regulatory approvals. With the closing of the Valves",795,"I'll wrap up beginning on Slide 13. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the sale of Valves & Controls remains on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to the regular regulatory approvals. With the closing of the Valves & Controls separation, we expect the infusion of cash to alter our balance sheet dramatically for the better. As we discussed in August, we know what debt we will retire, mostly within our bank line. We're also exploring other options to restructure our debt, potentially reduce interest expense on our higher-cost fixed-rate long-term debt. We also continue to build our bolt-on acquisition funnel for businesses that have earned the right to grow, primarily within Water Quality Systems. We're doing what we can to control our destiny, and while we still see some pockets of growth within residential & commercial and infrastructure, the uncertainty around any type of recovery within industrial gives us pause. So we're taking a closer look at our cost structure and adjusting it accordingly.
Now let's move to Slide 14 for a look at segment positioning. Water Quality Systems has been a bright spot within the Pentair portfolio for several years. And while we've seen the growth rate moderate some, we continue to believe in the long-term prospects of this high-performing segment. With strong residential demand, dealer intimacy and a steady stream of new products, our outlook for the aquatics business remains strong. Within water filtration, we continue to believe we will benefit from increased awareness around water quality globally, and our investments in a more focused sales effort in North America and Europe are already paying early dividends. Foodservice has been a relatively consistent growth business for us longer term and we continue to believe there are many avenues for growth, including traditional restaurant sales as well as edging out into adjacent products and connected solutions. 
We believe Flow & Filtration Solutions remains the biggest opportunity for improvement within the Pentair portfolio. Our #1 priority is reducing the complexity of the business, accelerating cost-out action and focusing on the most attractive growth prospects. We continue to see momentum around biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration. It is encouraging that agriculture seems to have bottomed. So we believe we're building some momentum exiting this year after a tough couple of years. As I discussed previously, we're seeing improved orders in backlog in infrastructure, which is a longer-cycle part of the business that is positioning for return to growth. Finally, we're placing an increased focus on building our aftermarket service capabilities to leverage our installed base. Flow & Filtration Solutions has a number of opportunities, and our principal focus is to prioritize which opportunities to drive first and build momentum to restore growth and raise margins. 
We believe Technical Solutions has an attractive position in profitable areas of the electrical industry. We expect the 2016 headwinds will begin to dissipate as industrial order rates are near trough levels, hints of inflation returning are on the horizon, large projects in Canada are complete and deferred MRO spending cannot continue forever. While we expect the strong growth in commercial to moderate, growth is likely to continue, progressively rightsizing the cost structure with the slower growth environment. This is the piece of our portfolio where we still have energy exposure, so while oil prices appear to have stabilized, we'll watch closely for signs of improving thermal MRO spending. While we still expect some near-term headwinds in parts of our portfolio, we still believe there are many avenues for growth longer term.
Now let's move to Slide 15 for a look at the framework for 2017. Given the portfolio change and attendant P&L and balance sheet improvements we are undergoing, we think it's important to provide some framework for thinking about our prospects for next year. As we discussed throughout the call, we expect the slow growth world we are all facing today to continue, and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in 2017. Therefore, it's prudent to focus on having our cost structure aligned with this reality, the result of which should be margin expansion from all 3 segments next year. 
Upon the closing of the Valves & Controls sale, we expect to have an opportunity to restructure our debt, which will reduce interest expense. Also, we expect to have the financial flexibility to explore other opportunities to allocate capital in a disciplined manner. By focusing on cost, simplifying the business and improving the capital structure, we expect to be able to deliver EPS growth in excess of 15% next year with minimal top line help while still positioning the company for the longer term.

I'll be starting on Slide 4. 
We delivered third quarter results that operationally met the high end of our forecast and were slightly above our guidance as the result of anticipated separation costs that did not materialize. While 2 of our 3 segments did not deliver core sales growth as a result of continued slow industrial spending, the margin performance overall is a testament to our strong discipline around cost management. 
We announced in August that we reached an agreement to sell our Valves & Controls business to Emerson. This transaction is on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to regulatory approvals. We're not expecting any recovery in industrial capital or maintenance spending at the end of the year in contrast to the typical year-end lift. Given this muted top line outlook predominantly on industrial-facing businesses we're lowering our fourth quarter outlook.
We do not believe the fourth quarter is indicative of a trend, and we expect at some point, maintenance spending will return in a more meaningful way. And longer-cycle projects, particularly in food & beverage and infrastructure, are also likely to break loose. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we believe we are positioned to deliver strong EPS expansion despite this ongoing slower-growth environment. I'll discuss this in more detail later in the call.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our Q3 2016 results. Third quarter core sales declined 2% as we saw a further slowdown in capital spending throughout the quarter and ongoing deferrals in maintenance spending. Water Quality Systems was our only segment to deliver core growth as the pool business once again finished the season in a strong position. We reached the 1-year anniversary of ERICO acquisition, and the performance has met all of our expectations. 
Segment income grew 15%, and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 17.9%. Water Quality Systems delivered over 300 basis points of margin expansion. And despite the core sales decline in Flow & Filtration Solutions, income and margins were down only modestly as the segment delivered on better internal execution. 
Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $0.78 per share and exceeded our forecast of $0.70 to $0.75 per share, as our core operating results met our income forecast while we did not incur the onetime separation cost we were expecting below the segment income line. Free cash flow continued to be a bright spot, up over $150 million year-to-date compared to last year, and our conversion to adjust the net income remains just north of 100%. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for more detail on Pentair's Q3 2016 performance. Once again, the residential & commercial vertical was a bright spot, driven in large part by our strong North American pool performance. While ERICO's performance was not captured in the core, its commercial sales also remained strong. After a good second quarter, we did see overall Infrastructure sales decline modestly in the third quarter. We continue to see strength in engineered pump orders and backlog, but our process filtration business faces difficult second half comparisons as large projects in the comparable period last year are not repeating.
Food & beverage declined, with delays in a number of larger beverage projects being the largest factor this quarter. While we greatly reduced our exposure to energy, our remaining sales for this vertical remain under pressure. Industrial was down in the quarter due in part to ongoing deferrals in short-cycle MRO spending and a global capital spending freeze that shows no sign of thawing. 
The right-hand side of the page shows that price and productivity continue to more than offset inflation as we continued to control costs across the enterprise. ERICO's contribution also helped drive the strong margin performance in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q3. Water Quality Systems delivered core growth of 2%. These results were below our expectations, as within our water filtration business, we saw foodservice and commercial market softness in North America and Western Europe as well as shifts in timing of key account program installations. We also experienced a moderation in growth rates in the fast-growth regions as our distributors closely managed inventory levels due to slower growth in China. 
The North American pool market ended its season on a strong note. We continue to view this market favorably longer term. We also believe our water filtration business has good long-term prospects and expect growth to return in 2017 as new product rollouts and key account program installations, particularly in foodservice, return to growth in normal levels. 
Segment income grew an impressive 15%, and return on sales expanded 240 basis points to 21.2%. Robust operating leverage was once again the largest contributor to this strong margin performance with the strong growth in the pool business contributing positively in the second quarter.
Now let's move to Slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q3. Flow & Filtration Solutions saw core sales declining 6%. While we anticipated sales to contract in the quarter, water technologies and fluid solutions were down more than expected as we saw a softening demand in short-cycle pump sales and weaker capital spending in beverage. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as distributors managed inventory levels tightly, and we saw continued declines in irrigation sales albeit at a moderated pace. We experienced a dramatic slowdown in fast-growth regions, particularly in the Middle East and Latin America. The sell-through was soft in the quarter and as a result, distributors are not restocking. In contrast, Western Europe was a bright spot, up double digits in the quarter with good momentum. We continue to see an improvement in infrastructure bid activity, which points to a stronger 2017. 
Fluid solutions core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than the 3% decline we saw last quarter. Sales in agriculture grew modestly in the quarter, and importantly, we expect this momentum to continue. Our biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration businesses remain strong, offsetting partially -- offset partially by our beverage business seeing a number a large project delays globally and softer component sell-through. Core sales in process filtration declined 22%, largely in line with expectations with the key drivers being project timing within infrastructure as well as declines in oil & gas and industrial filtration. 
Segment income and return on sales declined modestly as the impact of lower volumes were not fully offset by the continued strong productivity and pricing seen for the past several quarters. We remain vigilant on improving the cost structure to offset the impact of lower volumes.
Looking ahead, we expect food & beverage to rebound, with agriculture turning positive along with growth in biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration. As we continue to reduce the complexity in the business and drive better execution in projects, we believe we have a long runway for margin improvement. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the third quarter. Technical Solutions reported 26% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 1% core sales decline and a 27% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in enclosures declined 1% as industrial sales continued to bounce along the bottom, diminishing chances of any order rate growth acceleration for the remainder of 2016. Thermal management core sales declined 5% as downstream energy MRO product sales are not showing any signs of recovery. Our industrial heat tracing business continues to win small projects, but our project growth was challenged as large Canadian projects are nearing completion. While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations at the completion of the 1-year deal anniversary. The majority of ERICO sales are into commercial vertical, which continued to deliver growth in the quarter, although the rate of growth is moderating.
Segment income grew 18% as return on sales contracted 140 basis points to 22%. Margin contraction was isolated to our thermal management business as the sales of project versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix, and we faced productivity issues at the end of the large Canadian projects. ERICO has performed as we had anticipated, and enclosures continues to stabilize. The performance of these 2 businesses was not enough in the quarter to offset the margin impact from thermal management. We're not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound for the remainder of the year, and we also expect the Canadian project margins to pressure thermal margins in Q4 as we substantially complete them before the end of the year. This will undoubtedly have an impact on fourth quarter margins for Technical Solutions. With ERICO and enclosures performing as expected and thermal completing the large Canadian projects, we still believe Technical Solutions remains well positioned longer term.
I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 outlook, and then I'll have a few closing remarks about how we're looking at the world entering 2017."

For the fourth quarter, we expect overall sales",603,"Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #10, titled Q4 2016 Pentair Outlook. For the fourth quarter, ERICO is now captured in the core results, so core sales and total sales are currently equal to each other. For the fourth quarter, we expect overall sales to decline approximately 6% as we expect MRO trends in energy and customer capital spending in all verticals to worsen as we head into the end of the year. Motivation for customers to push out projects and commitments shows no signs of stopping by the end of the year. 
On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 2%, while we expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to decline approximately 9%, primarily related to project spending in the food & beverage vertical. Technical Solutions is expected to decline approximately 10%, due in large part to the completion of previously mentioned large Canadian projects and mid-teens declines in year-over-year MRO spending within energy. We expect segment income to be down approximately 10% and return on sales to decline roughly 70 basis points to 17%. 
Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 21.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around $184 million, about flat with Q3 ending levels. We expect free cash flow to end the year on a strong note, greater than continuing operations net income of $550 million and nearly $780 million inclusive of Valves & Controls.
Please turn to Slide 11, labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we've taken our full year adjusted EPS outlook from continuing operations down to approximately $3 for 2016. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 4%. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales decline of 4% and Technical Solutions core sales to be down 2% for the full year. We expect segment income to grow roughly 11% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 17.1%. Our revised forecast factors in slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems while Technical Solutions and Flow & Filtration Solutions are expected to have margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions. The pressure on higher-margin short-cycle sales has been felt most acutely within Technical Solutions. 
We anticipate full year corporate costs to be just under $110 million, net interest and other of roughly $141 million and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 6%. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.
Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We ended the third quarter with $4.4 billion net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This continues to improve as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow has increased over $150 million versus the first 9 months last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.6%. When the sale of Valves & Controls closes, we expect our balance sheet will look dramatically different for the better with lower debt levels and balance sheet capacity available for tuck-ins or incremental buybacks. 
I will now turn the call back over to Randy for some closing comments and preliminary thoughts around 2017."

As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the sale of Valves & Controls remains on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to the regular regulatory approvals. With the closing of the Valves",795,"I'll wrap up beginning on Slide 13. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the sale of Valves & Controls remains on track to close at the end of this year or early next year subject to the regular regulatory approvals. With the closing of the Valves & Controls separation, we expect the infusion of cash to alter our balance sheet dramatically for the better. As we discussed in August, we know what debt we will retire, mostly within our bank line. We're also exploring other options to restructure our debt, potentially reduce interest expense on our higher-cost fixed-rate long-term debt. We also continue to build our bolt-on acquisition funnel for businesses that have earned the right to grow, primarily within Water Quality Systems. We're doing what we can to control our destiny, and while we still see some pockets of growth within residential & commercial and infrastructure, the uncertainty around any type of recovery within industrial gives us pause. So we're taking a closer look at our cost structure and adjusting it accordingly.
Now let's move to Slide 14 for a look at segment positioning. Water Quality Systems has been a bright spot within the Pentair portfolio for several years. And while we've seen the growth rate moderate some, we continue to believe in the long-term prospects of this high-performing segment. With strong residential demand, dealer intimacy and a steady stream of new products, our outlook for the aquatics business remains strong. Within water filtration, we continue to believe we will benefit from increased awareness around water quality globally, and our investments in a more focused sales effort in North America and Europe are already paying early dividends. Foodservice has been a relatively consistent growth business for us longer term and we continue to believe there are many avenues for growth, including traditional restaurant sales as well as edging out into adjacent products and connected solutions. 
We believe Flow & Filtration Solutions remains the biggest opportunity for improvement within the Pentair portfolio. Our #1 priority is reducing the complexity of the business, accelerating cost-out action and focusing on the most attractive growth prospects. We continue to see momentum around biogas and Beer Membrane Filtration. It is encouraging that agriculture seems to have bottomed. So we believe we're building some momentum exiting this year after a tough couple of years. As I discussed previously, we're seeing improved orders in backlog in infrastructure, which is a longer-cycle part of the business that is positioning for return to growth. Finally, we're placing an increased focus on building our aftermarket service capabilities to leverage our installed base. Flow & Filtration Solutions has a number of opportunities, and our principal focus is to prioritize which opportunities to drive first and build momentum to restore growth and raise margins. 
We believe Technical Solutions has an attractive position in profitable areas of the electrical industry. We expect the 2016 headwinds will begin to dissipate as industrial order rates are near trough levels, hints of inflation returning are on the horizon, large projects in Canada are complete and deferred MRO spending cannot continue forever. While we expect the strong growth in commercial to moderate, growth is likely to continue, progressively rightsizing the cost structure with the slower growth environment. This is the piece of our portfolio where we still have energy exposure, so while oil prices appear to have stabilized, we'll watch closely for signs of improving thermal MRO spending. While we still expect some near-term headwinds in parts of our portfolio, we still believe there are many avenues for growth longer term.
Now let's move to Slide 15 for a look at the framework for 2017. Given the portfolio change and attendant P&L and balance sheet improvements we are undergoing, we think it's important to provide some framework for thinking about our prospects for next year. As we discussed throughout the call, we expect the slow growth world we are all facing today to continue, and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in 2017. Therefore, it's prudent to focus on having our cost structure aligned with this reality, the result of which should be margin expansion from all 3 segments next year. 
Upon the closing of the Valves & Controls sale, we expect to have an opportunity to restructure our debt, which will reduce interest expense. Also, we expect to have the financial flexibility to explore other opportunities to allocate capital in a disciplined manner. By focusing on cost, simplifying the business and improving the capital structure, we expect to be able to deliver EPS growth in excess of 15% next year with minimal top line help while still positioning the company for the longer term.
