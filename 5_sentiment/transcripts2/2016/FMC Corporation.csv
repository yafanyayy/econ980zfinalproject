Good morning, everyone. 2015 marked the completion of FMC's transformation to a technology-driven specialty company with leading market positions across agricultural, nutrition, pharmaceutical and specialty lithium applications. In Ag",2766,"Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone. 2015 marked the completion of FMC's transformation to a technology-driven specialty company with leading market positions across agricultural, nutrition, pharmaceutical and specialty lithium applications. 
In Ag solutions, the acquisition of Cheminova strengthened our technology pipeline, brought greater regional balance, broadened our market access and expanded our portfolio. The integration of Cheminova continues to go well. Our success to date reinforces our confidence in achieving the run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 [ph] million by the middle of 2017. The acquisition and integration of Cheminova combines with the actions we have taken to restructure our Ag solutions operations in Brazil have positioned FMC to better address current market conditions. 
In Health and Nutrition, we focused on driving higher margin -- margins by capturing high-value commercial opportunities across our portfolio and by implementation of manufacturing actions program and process technology improvements. And in lithium, we continued to execute on our strategy of growing FMC's differentiated downstream specialty business to take advantage of favorable end market demand. 
2015, however, was also a year marked by significant foreign exchange headwinds and difficult conditions across the global agricultural market. We took decisive actions throughout the year to address these challenges, accelerating the integration of Cheminova, restructuring our Ag solutions operations in Brazil, exercising discipline on pricing and aggressively controlling costs across the company. As we enter 2016, we remain focused on the continued execution of our strategy to drive improved performance. Despite challenging macroeconomic and Ag market conditions, we believe the actions we have taken will enable FMC to deliver higher earnings growth across each of our business in 2016. 
I will provide further details regarding our 2016 outlook shortly. But first, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance. 
Starting with FMC's full year results on Slide 1. FMC reported revenue of approximately $3.3 billion in 2015, roughly flat to reported revenue for 2014 and adjusted EPS of $2.47, a decline of 22% compared to last year.
For the fourth quarter, FMC reported revenue of $899 million, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 were $0.77, 9% below the fourth quarter of 2014.
Turning to Ag solutions on Slide 2. For the fourth quarter, Ag Solutions delivered revenue of $657 million and segment earnings of $101 million, a decline of 23% and 8% respectively from the pro forma results of the same period of 2014. The negative impact of foreign exchange and lower sales volume more than offset price increase and lower operating cost in the quarter. About 75% of the decline in sales volume during the fourth quarter was the results of deliberate actions to eliminate lower-margin, third-party product sales. Excluding these sales, volume declined by less than 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as we continued to see demand for FMC's proprietary products across all regions. 
In Europe, we saw healthy demand, as mild weather conditions allowed for a late application of cereal herbicides. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to recall our first direct sales of FMC products into Western Europe as we transition to direct market access provided by the Cheminova acquisition. 
Across the Americas, however, market conditions were significantly more challenging. In North America, consecutive years with low pest pressure have resulted in elevated channel inventory levels, [indiscernible] the channel inventory issues is the deterioration in farmer income levels in the U.S., resulting in a more cautious mindset of distributors and growers. While we continue to see strong support for customers for our proprietary products, we expect challenging market conditions to persist through 2016.
In Brazil, we saw improving conditions in certain crop markets, including sugarcane and cotton, as well as niche crops such as coffee and citrus. However, channel inventories, especially in insecticide and unfavorable weather conditions, negatively impacted sales volume. As we have discussed previously, we expect channel inventory levels to remain elevated through 2016. 
In the rest of Latin America, we continue to see strong demand for FMC's product, including pre-emergent herbicides in Argentina and products for niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. Sales in Argentina, however, continues to be impacted by delay in receiving import licenses for formulated products.
In Asia, weather conditions in India, Pakistan, Australia and parts of Southeast Asia related to reduced demand and higher channel inventory.
The negative impact of foreign exchange was the single largest driver of our 2015 performance. In the quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollars -- of the U.S. dollar, reduced Ag Solutions segment earnings by about $60 [ph] million compared to last year. However, the combination of price increases and cost reductions more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange.
In Brazil, we continued to implement significant price increases to maintain U.S. dollar-based pricing in that country. This price increases recovered more than 70% [ph] of the currency impact on segment earnings in the fourth quarter. In addition, FMC continued to aggressively reduce operating costs through the faster integration of Cheminova and further restructuring of Ag Solutions operations in Brazil.
As a result, and despite the challenging demand environment, segment earnings margin improved by 250 basis points to 15.4% in the quarter. I will provide further details regarding cost savings activities shortly.
But first, I will comment on the full year performance for Ag Solutions. As shown on Slide 3, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $2.6 billion [ph] for 2015 compared to pro forma revenue of $3.4 billion for 2014, a decline of 23%, as lower sales volume and foreign exchange headwinds more than offset price increases during the year. Lower sales volumes accounted for about 16% of the decline in revenue. However, more than half of these volume decline is the result of actions we took throughout the year to eliminate lower-margin, third-party product sales. Excluding this, sales volumes declined about 7% compared to 2014. 
In 2015, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in FX headwinds of about $300 million, erasing over 50% [ph] of Ag Solutions pro forma 2014 segment earnings. To be clear, these reduced reported sales by about $380 [ph] million and lowered our reported cost by about $80 [ph] million. We offset about 60% of the currency impact on sales in Brazil by raising prices throughout the year, and we expect to continue to offset future FX impacts in Brazil through price increases. 
Early in the year, we began to aggressively reduce operating costs. For the full year, operating costs were lower by about $100 million. This include savings from the Cheminova integration, lower spending on discretionary items and lower energy and material costs.
Despite the challenging market conditions in 2015, we continued to invest in innovation and our technology pipeline of new synthetic and biological active ingredients. Product introduced in 2015 were well received in the market and we expect further traction from new product introductions in 2016.
I will now turn to the 2016 cost savings we expect to realize from the Cheminova integration and related actions. As you can se eon Slide 4, in 2015, FMC realized about $40 million in cost savings as a direct result of the Cheminova integration and the restructuring of operations in Brazil.
For 2016, we expect to deliver additional cost savings over 2015 of between $60 million and $70 million, reflecting the full year benefit of previously announced headcount reduction and savings associated with various procurement and SAR cost-reduction for ramps.
As discussed, during our third quarter earnings call, FMC targeted total headcount reductions of 800 to 850 positions. As of December 31, 2015, over 700 positions have been eliminated, and we expect to implement the remaining reductions during the second half of 2016.
The success we have achieved to date in delivering these -- the headcount reduction plus the further cost reduction initiatives currently underway, gives us the high degree of confidence that we will deliver the 2016 cost savings target and achieve the $140 million to $160 million in run rate cost savings by the middle of 2017.
Turning now to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. Q4 represented another quarter of solid earnings performance. As a result, the business delivered its 11th consecutive year of record earnings in 2015. Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $172 million, a decline of 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 mainly due to lower sales volume and the weaker euro. We saw lower MCC banner and carrageenan sales in the quarter, partially offset by higher sales of MCC-based product for food application and increased sales of Omega-3 for the nutraceutical market.
Segment earnings for Health and Nutrition increased 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 to $46 million. Lower operating cost more than offset the negative impact of lower sales volume. 
The benefits of ongoing Manufacturing Excellence and process technology improvements increased segment earnings margin in the quarter to 26.9%, an increase of almost 400 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
As a result of the actions taken over the past year, Health and Nutrition is well-positioned to deliver continued earnings growth in 2016. 
Turning next to lithium on Slide 6. Lithium delivered a strong quarter. Revenue of $70 million was up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as higher prices were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.
The fourth quarter of 2015 represents the fourth consecutive quarter in which FMC realized higher pricing in the Lithium business, as demand growth across end markets application, coupled with tight supply supported price increases, especially for FMC's carbonate and hydroxide products.
Sales volumes were essentially flat to last year as higher volumes for FMC's butyllithium and specialty organics were offset by lower volumes resulting from the scheduled maintenance downtime in our hydroxide unit and less third-party supply of carbonate.
Demand for FMC's downstream specialty lithium products remained strong. Hydroxide sales volume were up significantly on a full year basis, as demand for energy storage applications continue to grow at double-digit rates and as we continue to increase throughput from our existing assets.
Segment earnings increased 42% to $11 million in the quarter. The combination of higher pricing, improved sales mix and lower operating cost more than offset the impact of FX on FMC's reported results, pushing segment earnings margin to 15.9% [ph], an increase over 450 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now moving on to our 2016 outlook on Slide 7. Last night, we published our outlook statements for the first quarter and full year 2016. I will take a few minutes now to briefly discuss the outlook for each of FMC's business segments.
In Ag Solutions, full year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and full year segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $380 million to $420 million, with first quarter segment earnings in the range of $70 million to $90 million. I will discuss Ag in more detail in a moment. 
In Health and Nutrition, we are anticipating full year segment revenue of $775 million to $825 million. We continue to see stable low to mid-single-digit demand growth in the majority of our end markets. Segment revenue growth is expected to be slightly below this level as we do not expect certain omega-3 sales to the pharmaceutical API market majoring the first quarter 2015 to happen in 2016. 
Excluding these sales, we expect underlying sales growth in the middle -- in the mid-single digit range driven by increased demand for health excipients and nutraceutical ingredients across emerging markets. 
Health and Nutrition segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $198 million to $208 million in 2016. The business made significant strides to improve its cost structure and operating efficiency over the past 12 months. We expect these efforts to drive further margin expansion in 2016 which will allow Health and Nutrition to grow earnings accordingly. 
We expect first quarter segment earnings for Health and Nutrition to be in the range of $46 million to $51 million. We have little similarity in this segment earnings for Health and Nutrition. However, as I mentioned previously, we do not expect certain omega-3 sales from the first quarter of 2015 to recur this year. As a result, reported first quarter segment earnings will be lower compared to 2015. 
In lithium, we see strong demand in a favorable pricing environment. We will continue to optimize our sales mix to drive higher volume of FMC's downstream specialty products.
As we enter 2016, FMC is sold out across most products. Higher pricing, improved mix and lower operating cost will drive earnings growth in 2016. In addition, the reduction in operating cost, as a result of the devaluation of the Argentine peso, will provide a tailwind for segment earnings over the next 12 to 18 months.
For the full year, we expect lithium segment revenue to be between $240 million and $260 million, and segment earnings to be in the range of $33 million and $43 million. We expect first quarter segment earnings of $8 million to $12 million. 
On a consolidated basis, we expect FMC's 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.80. We expect first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings to be between $0.48 and $0.60 per share.
I will now discuss the outlook for Ag Solutions business in more detail starting with a few comments regarding the market on Slide 8.
In Europe, we expect our key markets to be broadly flat compared to last year, although we expect to see higher growth across Eastern Europe. 
In North America, we expect the challenging market conditions will continue in 2016 given elevated channel inventory levels and projected lower farm incomes. As a result, we expect the market in North America to be down in 2016. 
Across Asia, we expect the market to be mixed depending on the countries, however, overall we expect region to be up slightly in 2016 assuming more normal past pressures and weather conditions. 
Turning to Latin America. Market conditions in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia are expected to remain favorable, with growth in weed resistant acres and increasing acreage for niche crops. We expect the market in Brazil to be down again in 2016. Channel inventory levels are expected to remain elevated in 2016. However, we expect to see an improvement in market fundamentals for sugarcane and cotton.
While the factors impacting market growth vary across growing regions, we are broadly seeing a more cautious approach to purchasing decision throughout the value chain as a result of the protracted downturn in the Ag cycle.
Based on the factors I just described, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to decline by a mid-to-high single digit percentage in 2016 under U.S. dollar basis. However, it is important to remember that these factors are dynamic and will change throughout the year. In particular, changes in planting decisions and past pressures, and of course weather conditions will significantly impact demand over the course of the growing season. We will get more clarity on these exceptional factors as the year progresses and we will update our views on market condition as some of these uncertainties become clear.
Turning next to Slide 9, where we summarize the critical earnings driver for 2016. A number of factors will contribute to the year-over-year increase in Ag Solutions segment earnings. First, we expect a positive $20 million impact from the full year of Cheminova. Next, we are targeting incremental cost savings of $90 million, including $60 million to $70 million from Cheminova related synergies. Third, we expect that our pricing actions in Brazil and overall mix improvement will contribute approximately $90 million.
New product introductions scheduled for 2016 and revenue synergies in Europe and North America from the Cheminova acquisition will positively impact our mix and volumes for the year. 
Continued FX headwinds, the broader market decline and our decision to exit certain low-margin third-party product sales will partially offset incremental earnings from the items I just described.
In Health and Nutrition, higher sales of excipient and nutritional products in emerging markets and the full year benefit of continued operational improvements are expected to deliver approximately $8 million in earnings growth.
Lithium is expected to contribute about $15 million to our growth in earnings in 2016, given primarily from higher pricing improved mix and lower operating costs.
I will now turn the call over to Paul who will discuss corporate expenses, the impact of foreign currencies on our results and cash flow."

Our corporate expense line represents both centrally held expenses that are not charged back to the businesses. 2015 came in lower than 2014 for the full year as we saw various items such as insuranc",885,"Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with the income statement. Our corporate expense line represents both centrally held expenses that are not charged back to the businesses. 2015 came in lower than 2014 for the full year as we saw various items such as insurance expenses, pension charges, year-end LIFO adjustments to inventory and various incidental FX-related expenses all come in below last year. We do not expect these to repeat in 2016 leading to our guidance for the corporate expense line of $70 million to $80 million. 
Looking at the tax rate, our full year rate benefited from the 2 drivers relative to our previous expectations. First, those legislative items passed after the end-of-the-year primarily related to R&D deductions resulted in a reduction in our overall rate. Second, the geographical mix of our earnings changed, away from the U.S. and Brazil and towards Europe and Asia. Since the latter regions typically have lower tax rates than the U.S. and Brazil, our overall tax rate benefited.
Together, these 2 items lowered our full year 2015 tax rate by approximately 300 basis points. Looking forward, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the 24% to 26% range. 
I'd like to spend a few moments on Slide 10 revisiting the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our business during the year.
As Pierre has already described, our 2015 performance faced a significant challenge from the impact of the strengthening dollar in our earnings. Across all of FMC and before any pricing actions, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have reduced our 2014 operating earnings by approximately $310 million. Of this reduction, approximately $293 million would have directly impacted Agricultural Solutions. On Slide 10, you can see the drivers of this hit to the Ag Solutions segment earnings.
The cumulative effect of weakening local currencies on revenue was approximately $380 [ph] million average, of which the Brazilian real was easily the largest followed by the euro. Offsetting this revenue impact was the positive effect on our local cost base, again, maybe the real and the euro or euro-linked currencies, which reduced our cost in the U.S. dollar terms by $85 million. 
Our response to this was to raise prices. Pierre has already noted that for the full year in 2015, these price increases offset approximately 60% of the currency impact in Brazil. This was possible in large part because market practice in Brazil is to price in reais, but to do so relative to U.S. dollar impacts. In the rest of the work, pricing is generally not dollar indexed, creating a bigger challenge to raising prices, especially when market conditions are soft. 
In aggregate, globally, we recovered more than half of the $293 million earnings headwind through raising prices. Looking into 2016, we expect the FX headwinds to be more modest than in 2015. The forecast currency moves in major currency such as the euro are far smaller in 2016 than we saw a year ago. And while there remains uncertainty around various Asian and Eastern European currencies, movements in these currencies have a far smaller impact on our profitability. 
The key region that drives the guidance regarding both currency and pricing, as Pierre just described on Slide 9, is Brazil. First of all, our guidance assumes that there will be a less volatile depreciation of the Brazilian reais, with no rapid devaluation right in the middle of the key selling period as we saw in Q3 2015. Although we are not expecting stronger market conditions in Brazil, our guidance also assumes that local price actions already in place, plus additional price increases which will be introduced later in the year to reflect the actual depreciation of the Brazilian reais will largely offset the forecast year-over-year impact of currency depreciation.
Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow on Slide 11. Our year-end net debt was approximately $2.1 billion, with the small increase over the Q3 net debt being entirely due to the final tax payment related to the Alkali sale. The fourth quarter is typically a flat to negative operating cash flow quarter for us given the seasonality of sales in Brazil. However, strong performance in Health and Nutrition and lithium, as well as continued cost in capital spending controls, ensured that we kept our net cash outflows to a minimum. 
For the full year, our adjusted cash from operations adjusted to remove the one-off impact of Cheminova and Alkali-related items, saw a 16% increase over 2014 despite a decline in EBITDA of around $100 million. We benefited from a positive year-on-year swing from working capital as all businesses improved their working capital performance compared to 2014. 
Our cost control programs included cash spending discipline. We saw lower cash outflows for capital expenditures, which was our third lower than in 2014, offset by slightly higher restructuring spending. 
In addition, our cash taxes related to ongoing operations was significantly lower than 2014, reflecting lower profitability in both the U.S. and Brazil.
Looking into 2016, we expect continued improvement in cash generation performance. In aggregate, we expect adjusted cash from operations to increase by approximately 25% in 2016 driven by higher earnings, continued working capital improvements and lower restructuring spending, offset by higher cash taxes.
With that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

Actually in North America, for us, is as much of a concern as Brazil is. So we are highly focused on executing our strategy in a market we believe will be down mid-single to high single-digit in 2016. There is still the possibility of a cycle turn in 2017, but you have to see how 2016 will go. It is highly dependent upon how the industry behaves, making sure that we don't oversell, don't undersell. And there is a normal weather and pest pressure. That is going to be very critical. Any additional negative weather from an Ag industry standpoint or a no pest pressure would lead to resulting in less of primary inventory. So 2016 will be a difficult year. And as we go into 2016, we should be able to see if 2017 remained the year where you will have a turn of the cycle. Mark I don't know, if you have any additional comments."

That was unprecedented, more than actually the overall devaluation of the reais. So we're not expecting that situation. In a less impact situation from currency, the price increase we need, going into 2016, is less than the last year because a big part is a recovery of currency issues from price increase which are already in place.

We believe our technology strategy is even better today than it used to be. And our formulation strength has not changed. So it is, right now, the earnings potential of FMC Ag Solution has not changed. The problem is, we are in a situation where demand is very low. Decisions from growers are pushed to the last minute. And in a currency situation, which as you can see the biggest problem. So 2016 is going to be focused for us on earnings growth. There isn't much we can do around volume demand. We're also going to be highly, highly disciplined. We are not -- I can tell you one thing and we have not done that in 2015 and we're going to stick with that strategy in 2016. We are not going to run after market share. We are working our way from low profit sales and we are increasing price to recover the currency impact. That should position us as soon as the cycle turn to a very strong performance. So to expect the business going into the mid- to high-teens growth as soon as the market turn around, I have no doubt about it. The more we'll be seen intact. Right now, it is inventory.

The country managers, the sales force from Cheminova have embraced the portfolio from FMC, and are now gearing up to put those products into the marketplace. So from my perspective, Europe is exactly where we thought it would be. And obviously, there's going to be growth for us, going forward.

And then secondly, we're looking at expanding our supply chain in Argentina to more reflect what we do around the rest of the world in terms of tool manufacturing. We're actually going to be importing more active ingredients and formulating in country. That helps us two ways. First of all, it allows us to formulate projects for Argentina on the ground, gives us more flexibility. And then secondly, helps with our cost base, which is in local currency.

It is more difficult to increase pricing in locations like Europe or even Asia where there is no indexation on the currency on the dollar, because there is clearly a supply, demand and negotiation.

First of all, we know we've been working very hard in fixing operational issues, and we think we're there. Most of our plant, there are few somewhere, but most of our plant are operating much better than it used to. And also the currency, the peso in Argentina, has been helping us from a cost standpoint and is going to be the tailwind in 2016. Additionally, there is the price and mix. We have a very strong product line and technology for lithium hydroxide. We are one of the critical and leading supplier. And that market has increased in a tight supply situation, which allow us to right price the product. So all in all, pricing, mix, better operation and currency will be the driver in 2016. Around capacity, I think our capacity decisions will be in line with our strategy. First of all, we are working very hard at debottlenecking our plants special lithium hydroxide to make sure we can supply our customers with the growth they need. From a capital investment standpoint, we believe our key competitors today have made decisions to increase lithium carbonate in a significant way. So we do not believe volume of lithium carbonate from FMC will be required to serve the market. There will be plenty of products and we will be able to have supply agreement on lithium carbonate from other companies. So we do not believe -- even with an improving situation in Argentina, we do not believe we need going into 2017 to increase capacity in lithium carbonate, keep on debottlenecking the plant. Where we are looking at capital spending to improve our sales is in the downstream specialty business and mostly lithium hydroxide. This is where most of the capital spending will go in the next 2 or 3 years."

You first need to have the time to get the approval from Dao and DuPont to merge as a single company. And once that is done, they need integration. And then from integration they need to break up the company as they stated into 3 companies and merge together the Ag business. So I believe it's an interesting decision, which creates a very good company. But the impact on the market on the competitive landscape is still a couple of years away. So not a short-term concern for us. The Syngenta Cheminova, the [indiscernible] in China, my view is that it doesn't change much the competitive landscape. Because if I understand well, through what I've read and what I've heard, Syngenta will be operating as a stand-alone company instead of a publicly traded company. They will have a single shareholder, which is Chem China. So unless Chem China has a very fundamental push or very fundamentally different strategy, which I don't think so with Syngenta, we will be facing the same type of competition than we've been facing in the past.

So if you look, there is much more product on the ground, product which are put on the ground than product which are sold by the chemical industry into the market, and that differential is what is decreasing the level of inventory. You just need a strong weather or strong pest pressure combined with more product on the ground than industry selling, and you can see a turn in 2017.

So when you put those 2 [ph] together, you have the dramatic situation from a business performance we've heard about. Obviously, North America doesn't have the piece which is the currency impact, so we talk less about it. But we come quickly to realize that purely from an inventory standpoint, about the same sentiment we've seen in Brazil is happening in North America. Community prices being low, growers were very cautious in terms of planting decisions and processing decision. As their colleague worry in Brazil. The crop protection industry kept on selling products. And there was a point where there was more product going into the channel than product going on the ground. And that created in Brazil a very elevated currency situation. Additionally, insect pressure was not great in the previous year, which has been creating even more of [indiscernible] So all of that has been compiling a situation, which from us from an inventory and supply chain standpoint, is very close to what we see in Brazil, less the currency effect."

So from a registration standpoint, we think we're well-placed. And then you allay that to the fact that our innovation platform is still obviously delivering on our formulation capabilities. We probably have somewhere close to 60 products we're launching around the world in 2016. Obviously, you don't get a tremendous amount of revenue in the first year of the launch of a formulated product. But it goes to show that what we're doing on a formulation standpoint is continuing through these times in the Ag space. We believe that innovation is going to be supercritical for us as we go forward.

The way we restructure and what we restructured was done very carefully, so it does not at all impact our ability to collect. The factor that's driving our ability to collect are really driven more by market conditions. And I don't necessarily just mean Ag market conditions, but as much as the finance market conditions down in Brazil where we're seeing a continued cautiousness on the part of the Brazilian growr to hold on to its liquid resources. A lack of confidence that financing will be there for them in the next round of the growing season, is essentially across the board creating challenges to collection. Compounding on top of that of course, as we discussed the fact that most leverage you have is when you have -- when the grower have to buy new product, when you have pest pressures down and you have excess inventory in the channel. It just makes that collection process even more difficult for us. I would say 2016 and folded in the way we describe, we talked at length about it will be a multiyear program to reduce the receivables balance in Brazil. And '15 played out really exactly as we had expected. The next couple of quarters will be the next key benchmarks for us as we look at collection in the first half of the year.

Good morning, everyone. 2015 marked the completion of FMC's transformation to a technology-driven specialty company with leading market positions across agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceutical and specialty lithium applications. In Ag S",2746,"Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone. 2015 marked the completion of FMC's transformation to a technology-driven specialty company with leading market positions across agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceutical and specialty lithium applications. 
In Ag Solutions, the acquisition of Cheminova strengthened our technology pipeline, brought greater regional balance, broadened our market access and expanded our portfolio. The integration of Cheminova continues to go well. Our success to date reinforces our confidence in achieving the run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of 2017. The acquisition and integration of Cheminova, combined with the actions we have taken to restructure our Ag Solutions operation in Brazil, have positioned FMC to better address current market conditions. 
In Health and Nutrition, we focused on driving higher margins by capturing high-value commercial opportunities across our portfolio and by implementation of manufacturing actions program and process technology improvements. And in lithium, we continued to execute on our strategy of growing FMC's differentiated downstream specialty business to take advantage of favorable end market demand. 
2015, however, was also a year marked by significant foreign exchange headwinds and difficult conditions across the global agricultural market. We took decisive actions throughout the year to address these challenges, accelerating the integration of Cheminova, restructuring our Ag Solutions operations in Brazil, exercising discipline on pricing and aggressively controlling costs across the company. As we enter 2016, we remain focused on the continued execution of our strategy to drive improved performance. Despite challenging macroeconomic and ag market conditions, we believe the actions we have taken will enable FMC to deliver higher earnings growth across each of our business in 2016. 
I will provide further details regarding our 2016 outlook shortly. But first, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance. 
Starting with FMC's full year results on Slide 1. FMC reported revenue of approximately $3.3 billion in 2015, roughly flat to reported revenue for 2014 and adjusted EPS of $2.47, a decline of 22% compared to last year.
For the fourth quarter, FMC reported revenue of $899 million, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 were $0.77, 9% below the fourth quarter of 2014.
Turning to Ag Solutions on Slide 2. For the fourth quarter, Ag Solutions delivered revenue of $657 million and segment earnings of $101 million, a decline of 23% and 8%, respectively, from the pro forma results of the same period of 2014. The negative impact of foreign exchange and lower sales volume more than offset price increase and lower operating cost in the quarter. About 75% of the decline in sales volume during the fourth quarter was the result of deliberate actions to eliminate lower-margin, third-party product sales. Excluding these sales, volume declined by less than 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, as we continue to see demand for FMC's proprietary products across all regions. 
In Europe, we saw healthy demand, as mild weather conditions allowed for late application of cereal herbicides. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to recall our first direct sales of FMC products into Western Europe as we transition to direct market access provided by the Cheminova acquisition. 
Across the Americas, however, market conditions were significantly more challenging. In North America, consecutive years with low pest pressure have resulted in elevated channel inventory levels. Coupling the channel inventory issues is the deterioration in farmer income levels in the U.S., resulting in a more cautious mindset of distributors and growers. While we continue to see strong support for customers for our proprietary products, we expect challenging market conditions to persist through 2016.
In Brazil, we saw improving conditions in certain crop markets, including sugarcane and cotton, as well as niche crops such as coffee and citrus. However, channel inventories, especially in insecticide and unfavorable weather conditions, negatively impacted sales volume. As we have discussed previously, we expect channel inventory levels to remain elevated through 2016. 
In the rest of Latin America, we continue to see strong demand for FMC's product, including pre-emergent herbicides in Argentina and products for niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. Sales in Argentina, however, continues to be impacted by delay in receiving import licenses for formulated products.
In Asia, weather conditions in India, Pakistan, Australia and parts of Southeast Asia relate to reduce demand in higher channel inventories.
The negative impact of foreign exchange was the single largest driver of our 2015 performance. In the quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduced Ag Solutions segment earnings by about $60 million compared to last year. However, the combination of price increases and cost reductions more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange.
In Brazil, we continued to implement significant price increases to maintain U.S. dollar-based pricing in that country. This price increases recovered more than 70% of the currency impact on segment earnings in the fourth quarter. In addition, FMC continued to aggressively reduce operating costs through the faster integration of Cheminova and further restructuring of Ag Solutions operations in Brazil.
As a result, and despite the challenging demand environment, segment earnings margin improved by 250 basis points to 15.4% in the quarter. I will provide further details regarding cost savings activities shortly.
But first, I will comment on the full year performance for Ag Solution. As shown on Slide 3, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $2.6 billion for 2015 compared to pro forma revenue of $3.4 billion for 2014, a decline of 23%, as lower sales volume and foreign exchange headwind more than offset price increases during the year. Lower sales volumes accounted for about 16% of the decline in revenue. However, more than half of this volume decline is the result of actions we took throughout the year to eliminate lower-margin, third-party product sales. Excluding this, sales volumes declined about 7% compared to 2014. 
In 2015, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in FX headwind of about $300 million, erasing over 50% of Ag Solutions pro forma 2014 segment earnings. To be clear, this reduced reported sales by about $380 million and lowered our reported cost by about $80 million. We offset about 60% of the currency impact on sales in Brazil by raising prices throughout the year, and we expect to continue to offset future FX impacts in Brazil through price increases. 
Early in the year, we began to aggressively reduce operating costs. For the full year, operating costs were lower by about $100 million. This include savings from the Cheminova integration, lower spending on discretionary items and lower energy and raw material costs.
Despite the challenging market conditions in 2015, we continued to invest in innovation and our technology pipeline of new synthetic and biological active ingredients. Product introduced in 2015 were well received by the market, and we expect further traction from new product introductions in 2016.
I will now turn to the 2016 cost savings we expect to realize from the Cheminova integration and related actions. As you can see on Slide 4, in 2015, FMC realized about $40 million in cost savings as a direct result of the Cheminova integration and the restructuring of operations in Brazil.
For 2016, we expect to deliver additional cost savings over 2015 of between $60 million and $70 million, reflecting the full year benefit of previously announced headcount reduction and savings associated with various procurement and SAR cost-reduction programs.
As discussed, during our third quarter earnings call, FMC targeted total headcount reductions of 800 to 850 positions. As of December 31, 2015, over 700 positions have been eliminated, and we expect to implement the remaining reductions during the second half of 2016.
The success we have achieved to date in delivering the headcount reduction, plus the further cost reduction initiatives currently underway, gives us the high degree of confidence that we will deliver the 2016 cost savings target and achieve the $140 million to $160 million in run rate cost savings by the middle of 2017.
Turning now to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. Q4 represented another quarter of solid earnings performance. As a result, the business delivered its 11th consecutive year of record earnings in 2015. Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $172 million, a decline of 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, mainly due to lower sales volume and the weaker euro. We saw lower MCC banner and carrageenan sales in the quarter, partially offset by higher sales of MCC-based product for food application and increased sales of omega-3 for the nutraceutical market.
Segment earnings for Health and Nutrition increased 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 to $46 million. Lower operating cost more than offset the negative impact of lower sales volume. 
The benefits of ongoing Manufacturing Excellence and process technology improvement increased segment earnings margin in the quarter to 26.9%, an increase of almost 400 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
As a result of the actions taken over the past year, Health and Nutrition is well-positioned to deliver continued earnings growth in 2016. 
Turning next to Lithium on Slide 6. Lithium delivered a strong quarter. Revenue of $70 million was up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, as higher prices were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.
The fourth quarter of 2015 represents the fourth consecutive quarter in which FMC realized higher pricing in the Lithium business as demand growth across end markets application, coupled with tight supply, supported price increases, especially for FMC's carbonate and hydroxide products.
Sales volumes were essentially flat to last year as higher volumes for FMC's butyllithium and specialty organics were offset by lower volumes resulting from scheduled maintenance downtime in our hydroxide unit and less third-party supply of carbonate.
Demand for FMC's downstream specialty lithium products remains strong. Hydroxide sales volume were up significantly on a full year basis, as demand for energy storage applications continue to grow at double-digit rates and as we continue to increase throughput from our existing assets.
Segment earnings increased 42% to $11 million in the quarter. The combination of higher pricing, improved sales mix and lower operating cost more than offset the impact of FX on FMC's reported results, pushing segment earnings margin to 15.9%, an increase of 450 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now moving on to our 2016 outlook on Slide 7. Last night, we published our outlook statements for the first quarter and full year 2016. I will take a few minutes now to briefly discuss the outlook for each of FMC's business segments.
In Ag Solutions, full year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. And full year segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $380 million to $420 million, with first quarter segment earnings in the range of $70 million to $90 million. I will discuss Ag in more detail in a moment. 
In Health and Nutrition, we are anticipating full year segment revenue of $775 million to $825 million. We continue to see stable low to mid-single-digit demand growth in the majority of our end markets. Segment revenue growth is expected to be slightly below this level, as we do not expect certain omega-3 sales to the pharmaceutical API market majoring the first quarter of 2015 to happen in 2016. 
Excluding these sales, we expect underlying sales growth in the middle -- in the mid-single-digit range driven by increased demand for health excipients and nutraceutical ingredients across emerging markets. 
Health and Nutrition segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $198 million to $208 million in 2016. The business made significant strides to improve its cost structure and operating efficiency over the past 12 months. We expect these efforts to drive further margin expansion in 2016, which will allow Health and Nutrition to grow earnings accordingly. 
We expect first quarter segment earnings for Health and Nutrition to be in the range of $46 million to $51 million. We have little similarity in this segment earnings for Health and Nutrition. However, as I mentioned previously, we do not expect certain omega-3 sales from the first quarter of 2015 to recur this year. As a result, reported first quarter segment earnings will be lower compared to 2015. 
In Lithium, we see strong demand in a favorable pricing environment. We will continue to optimize our sales mix to drive higher volume of FMC's downstream specialty products.
As we enter 2016, FMC is sold out across most products. Higher pricing, improved mix and lower operating cost will drive earnings growth in 2016. In addition, the reduction in operating cost as a result of the devaluation of the Argentine peso will provide a tailwind for segment earnings over the next 12 to 18 months.
For the full year, we expect Lithium segment revenue to be between $240 million and $260 million and segment earnings to be in the range of $33 million and $43 million. We expect first quarter segment earnings of $8 million to $12 million. 
On a consolidated basis, we expect FMC's 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.80. We expect first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings to be between $0.48 and $0.60 per share.
I will now discuss the outlook for Ag Solutions business in more detail starting with a few comments regarding the market on Slide 8.
In Europe, we expect our key markets to be broadly flat compared to last year, although we expect to see higher growth across Eastern Europe. 
In North America, we expect the challenging market conditions will continue in 2016 given elevated channel inventory levels and projected lower farm incomes. As a result, we expect the market in North America to be down in 2016. 
Across Asia, we expect the market to be mixed depending on the countries. However, overall, we expect the region to be up slightly in 2016 assuming more normal pest pressures and weather conditions. 
Turning to Latin America. Market conditions in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia are expected to remain favorable with growth in weed-resistant acres and increasing acreage for niche crops. We expect the market in Brazil to be down again in 2016. Channel inventory levels are expected to remain elevated in 2016. However, we expect to see an improvement in market fundamentals for sugarcane and cotton.
While the factors impacting market growth vary across growing regions, we are broadly seeing a more cautious approach to purchasing decision throughout the value chain as a result of the protracted downturn in the Ag cycle.
Based on the factors I just described, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to decline by a mid to-high-single-digit percentage in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis. However, it is important to remember that these factors are dynamic and will change throughout the year. In particular, changes in planting decisions and pest pressures, and of course weather conditions, will significantly impact demand over the course of the growing season. We will get more clarity on these external factors as the year progresses, and we will update our views on market condition as some of these uncertainties become clear.
Turning next to Slide 9, where we summarize the critical earnings driver for 2016. A number of factors will contribute to the year-over-year increase in Ag Solutions segment earnings. First, we expect a positive $20 million impact from the full year of Cheminova. Next, we are targeting incremental cost savings of $90 million, including $60 million to $70 million from Cheminova-related synergies. Third, we expect that our pricing actions in Brazil and overall mix improvement will contribute approximately $90 million.
New product introductions scheduled for 2016 and revenue synergies in Europe and North America from the Cheminova acquisition will positively impact our mix and volumes for the year. 
Continued FX headwinds, the broader market decline and our decision to exit certain low-margin, third-party product sales will partially offset incremental earnings from the items I just described.
In Health and Nutrition, higher sales of excipient and nutritional products in emerging markets and the full year benefit of continued operational improvements are expected to deliver approximately $8 million in earnings growth.
Lithium is expected to contribute about $15 million to a growth in earnings in 2016, given primarily from higher pricing improved mix and lower operating costs.
I will now turn the call over to Paul, who will discuss corporate expenses, the impact of foreign currencies on our results and cash flow."

Our corporate expense line represents both centrally held expenses that are not charged back to the businesses. 2015 came in lower than 2014 for the full year, as we saw various items such as insuran",881,"Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with the income statement. Our corporate expense line represents both centrally held expenses that are not charged back to the businesses. 2015 came in lower than 2014 for the full year, as we saw various items such as insurance expenses, pension charges, year-end LIFO adjustments to inventory and various incidental FX-related expenses all come in below last year. We do not expect these to repeat in 2016 leading to our guidance for the corporate expense line of $70 million to $80 million. 
Looking at the tax rate, our full year rate benefited from 2 drivers relative to our previous expectations. First, those legislative items passed at the end of the year, primarily related to R&D deductions, resulted in a reduction in our overall rate. Second, the geographic mix of our earnings changed, away from the U.S. and Brazil and towards Europe and Asia. Since the latter regions typically have lower tax rates than the U.S. and Brazil, our overall tax rate benefited.
Together, these 2 items lowered our full year 2015 tax rate by approximately 300 basis points. Looking forward, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the 24% to 26% range. 
I'd like to spend a few moments on Slide 10 revisiting the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our business during the year.
As Pierre has already described, our 2015 performance faced a significant challenge from the impact of the strengthening dollar in our earnings. Across all of FMC and before any pricing actions, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have reduced our 2014 operating earnings by approximately $310 million. Of this reduction, approximately $293 million would have directly impacted Agricultural Solutions. On Slide 10, you can see the drivers of this hit to the Ag Solutions segment earnings.
The cumulative effect of weakening local currencies on revenue was approximately $380 million, of which the Brazilian real was easily the largest followed by the euro. Offsetting this revenue impact was the positive effect on our local cost base, again, mainly the real and euro or euro-linked currencies, which reduced our costs in U.S. dollar terms by $85 million. 
Our response to this was to raise prices. Pierre has already noted that for the full year in 2015, these price increases offset approximately 60% of the currency impact in Brazil. This was possible in large part because market practice in Brazil is to price in real, but to do so relative to U.S. dollar impacts. In the rest of the world, pricing is generally not dollar-indexed, creating a bigger challenge to raising prices, especially when market conditions are soft. 
In aggregate, globally, we recovered more than half of the $293 million earnings headwind through raising prices. Looking into 2016, we expect the FX headwind to be more modest than in 2015. The forecast currency moves in major currency, such as the euro, are far smaller in 2016 than we saw a year ago. And while there remains uncertainty around various Asian and Eastern European currencies, movements in these currencies have a far smaller impact on our profitability. 
The key region that drives the guidance regarding both currency and pricing, as Pierre just described on Slide 9, is Brazil. First of all, our guidance assumes that there will be a less volatile depreciation of the real, with no rapid devaluation right in the middle of the key selling period, as we saw in Q3 2015. Although we are not expecting stronger market conditions in Brazil, our guidance also assumes that local price actions already in place, plus additional price increases, which will be introduced later in the year to reflect the actual depreciation of the real will, largely offset the forecast year-over-year impact of currency depreciation.
Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow on Slide 11. Our year-end net debt was approximately $2.1 billion, with the small increase over the Q3 net debt being entirely due to the final tax payment related to the Alkali sale. The fourth quarter is typically a flat to negative operating cash flow quarter for us given the seasonality of sales in Brazil. However, strong performance in Health and Nutrition and Lithium, as well as continued cost and capital spending controls, ensured that we kept our net cash outflows to a minimum. 
For the full year, our adjusted cash from operations adjusted to remove the one-off impact of Cheminova and Alkali-related items saw a 16% increase over 2014 despite a decline in EBITDA of around $100 million. We benefited from a positive year-on-year swing from working capital, as all businesses improved their working capital performance compared to 2014. 
Our cost control programs included cash spending discipline. We saw lower cash outflows for capital expenditures, which was our third lower than in 2014, offset by slightly higher restructuring spending. 
In addition, our cash taxes related to ongoing operations was significantly lower than 2014, reflecting lower profitability in both the U.S. and Brazil.
Looking into 2016, we expect a continued improvement in cash generation performance. In aggregate, we expect adjusted cash from operations to increase by approximately 25% in 2016 driven by higher earnings, continued working capital improvements and lower restructuring spending, offset by higher cash taxes.
With that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

Actually, in North America, for us, is as much of a concern as Brazil is. So we are highly focused on executing our strategy in a market we believe will be down mid-single to high-single digit in 2016. There is still the possibility of a cycle turn in 2017, but you have to see how 2016 will go. It is highly dependent upon how the industry behaves, making sure that we don't oversell, don't presell, and that there is a normal weather and pest pressure. That is going to be very critical. Any additional negative weather from an Ag industry standpoint or a no pest pressure would lead to -- resulting less the prime of inventory. So 2016 will be a difficult year. And as we go into 2016, we should be able to see if 2017 remained the year where you will have a turn of the cycle. Mark, I don't know, if you have any additional comments."

That was unprecedented, more than actually the overall devaluation of the real. So we're not expecting that situation. In a less impact situation from currency, the price increase we need going into 2016 is less than the last year because a big part is a recovery of currency issues from price increase, which are already in place. So I would say we are entering 2016 with about 60% of the price actions already in place to recover the currency impact. And the rest is to happen during the year."

Decisions from growers are pushed to the last minute and in a currency situation, which has been, as you can see, the biggest problem. So 2016 is going to be focused for us on earnings growth. There isn't much we can do around volume demand. We're also going to be highly, highly disciplined. We are not -- I can tell you one thing and we have not done that in 2015, and we're going to stick with that strategy in 2016, we are not going to run after market share. We are working our way from low profit sales and we are increasing price to recover the currency impact. That should position us as soon as the cycle turn to a very strong performance.

So if it's a mid- to high single digit, call it a 7%, few volume driven by market demand, that's where we are forecasting our performance. Now our decline in sales is going to be higher because we are -- and I'm talking about volume here, okay? Because we are working the way still from third party. The run rate at which we closed 2015 is leading to a number which is higher than 2015 because we started this process during the year. And I think it's about an incremental $100 million of third-party sales we are working our way in 2016, which make our performance from a revenue standpoint a bit worse than market. So 2 things, we market from a demand standpoint, first, third-party sales, $100 million, we'll work our way. Where we're going to outperform the market, as we show in one of the slides, I think it's Slide 9, the one where we have the earnings driver, is because of the work is done around integration, around the cost and also 2 drivers of growth, which are synergies from Cheminova and also the new product introduction."

We're already seeing that, as Pierre alluded to, in the earlier part of this call. We're seeing now primarily our herbicides from FMC getting pushed through the Cheminova pipeline. So we've gone direct in the U.K. now and we're also expanding into Spain. So we're seeing that geographic growth for herbicides that we wanted. Obviously, we're introducing new fungicides across the region. So everything we thought of in Europe is coming true. The country managers, the sales force from Cheminova have embraced the portfolio from FMC and are now gearing up to put those products into the marketplace. So from my perspective, Europe is exactly where we thought it would be. And obviously, there's going to be growth for us going forward. The second part of your question on the insecticides, obviously we've had, especially in North America, probably 3 years of extremely low pest pressures across the U.S. One could say that a warm winter would allow the pests to come back. But frankly, we don't know. We're not forecasting a strong pest season. We tend to forecast an average season and see where that takes us.

We're actually doing a couple of things to expand our presence in Argentina at the moment. First of all is the consolidation of our market access with Cheminova. And then secondly, we're looking at expanding our supply chain in Argentina to more reflect what we do around the rest of the world in terms of toll manufacturing. We're actually going to be importing more active ingredients and formulating in country. That helps us 2 ways. First of all, it allows us to formulate products for Argentina on the ground, gives us more flexibility. And secondly, it helps with our cost base, which is in local currency. So we do see Argentina growing. It has been a good market for us over the last couple of years. And we think our portfolio is ideally suited to where they're going.

So the $15 million of earnings increase we are forecasting is driven by multiple factors. First of all, you know that we've been working very hard at fixing our operational issues, and I think we're there. Most of our plants, there are issues somewhere, but most of our plants are operating much better than they used to. And also the currency, the peso in Argentina, has been helping us from a cost standpoint and is going to be a tailwind in 2016. Additionally, there is the price and mix. We have a very strong product line and technology for lithium hydroxide. We are one of the critical and leading suppliers. And that market has increased in a tight supply situation, which allow us to right-price the product. So all in all, pricing, mix, better operation and currency will be the drivers in 2016. Around capacity, I think our capacity decisions will be in line with our strategy. First of all, we are working very hard at debottlenecking our plants, especially lithium hydroxide, to make sure we can supply our customers with the growth they need. From a capital investment standpoint, we believe our key competitors today have made decisions to increase lithium carbonate in a significant way. So we do not believe volume of lithium carbonate from FMC will be required to serve the market. There will be plenty of products, and we will be able to have supply agreements on lithium carbonate from other companies. So we do not believe -- even with an improving situation in Argentina, we do not believe we need going into 2017 to increase capacity in lithium carbonate, keep on debottlenecking the plant. Where we are looking at capital spending to improve our sales is in the downstream specialty business and mostly lithium hydroxide. This is where most of the capital spending will go in the next 2 or 3 years."

The consolidation of these 2 companies together will certainly create a very strong company with a very solid seed and chemicals portfolio. But honestly, this is 2 years away. You first need to have the time to get the approval from Dow and DuPont to merge as a single company. And once that is done, they need to do the integration. And then from the integration, they need to break up the company, as they stated, into 3 companies and merge together the 2 ag business. So I believe it's an interesting decision, which creates a very good company. But their impact on the market or the competitive landscape is still a couple of years away, so not a short-term concern for us. The Syngenta, Cheminova, my view -- or ChemChina. The Syngenta, ChemChina, my view is that it doesn't change much the competitive landscape because if I understand well, through what I've read and what I've heard, Syngenta will be operating as a stand-alone company. And instead of being a publicly traded company, they would have a single shareowner, which is ChemChina. So unless ChemChina has a very fundamental -- or push a very fundamentally different strategy, which I don't think so, into Syngenta, we would be facing the same type of competition that we've been facing in the past. So my point of view at this stage, it's pretty much no change to the landscape for the next couple of years. And we'll see what will happen 2 years down the road."

So the fact that we have a different profile in the first half of the year is purely due to North America.

So if you look, there is much more product on the ground, product which are put on the ground, than product which are sold by the chemical industry into the market. And that differential is what is decreasing the level of inventory. You just need strong weather or strong pest pressure, combined with more product on the ground than the industry is selling, and you could see a turn in 2017. But we are not at all operating under the assumption that there will be any turn in 2016. I think that's where we are focused and we are not assuming anything."

Obviously, North America doesn't have the piece, which is the currency impact, so we've talked less about it. But we come quickly to realize that purely from an inventory standpoint, about the same phenomenon we've seen in Brazil is happening in North America, commodity prices being low, growers were very cautious in terms of planting decisions and processing decisions as their colleague were in Brazil. The crop protection industry kept on selling products. And there was a point where there was more product going into the channel than product going on the ground. And that created, as in Brazil, a very elevated situation. Additionally, insect pressure was not great in the previous year, which has been creating even more of a problem.

The way we restructure and what we restructured was done very carefully, so it does not at all impact our ability to collect. The factors that are driving our ability to collect are really driven more by market conditions. And I don't necessarily just mean Ag market conditions but as much as the financing market conditions down in Brazil, where we're seeing a continued cautiousness on the part of the Brazilian grower to hold on to its liquid resources. A lack of confidence that financing will be there for them as they head into the next growing season is essentially across the board creating challenges to collection. Compounding on top of that, of course, as we've discussed, is the fact that the most leverage you have is when you have to -- when the grower has to buy a new product, when you have pest pressures down and you have excess inventory in the channel, it just makes that collection process even more difficult for us. I would say 2015 unfolded very much in the way we described, and we've talked at length about it being a multiyear program to reduce the receivables balance in Brazil. And '15 played out really exactly as we had expected. The next couple of quarters will be the next key benchmarks for us as we look at collection in the first half of the year. And [indiscernible] at least, we think heading through the back end of '16 is the first time we'll be able to show real measurable progress down there in Brazil."

In Ag S",2748,"Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone. 2015 marked the completion of FMC's transformation to a technology-driven specialty company with leading market positions across agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceutical and specialty lithium applications. 
In Ag Solutions, the acquisition of Cheminova strengthened our technology pipeline, brought greater regional balance, broadened our market access and expanded our portfolio. The integration of Cheminova continues to go well. Our success to date reinforces our confidence in achieving the run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of 2017. The acquisition and integration of Cheminova, combined with the actions we have taken to restructure our Ag Solutions operation in Brazil, have positioned FMC to better address current market conditions. 
In Health and Nutrition, we focused on driving higher margins by capturing high-value commercial opportunities across our portfolio and by implementation of manufacturing actions program and process technology improvements. And in lithium, we continued to execute on our strategy of growing FMC's differentiated downstream specialty business to take advantage of favorable end market demand. 
2015, however, was also a year marked by significant foreign exchange headwinds and difficult conditions across the global agriculture market. We took decisive actions throughout the year to address these challenges, accelerating the integration of Cheminova, restructuring our Ag Solutions operations in Brazil, exercising discipline on pricing and aggressively controlling costs across the company. As we enter 2016, we remain focused on the continued execution of our strategy to drive improved performance. Despite challenging macroeconomic and ag market conditions, we believe the actions we have taken will enable FMC to deliver higher earnings growth across each of our business in 2016. 
I will provide further details regarding our 2016 outlook shortly. But first, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance. 
Starting with FMC's full year results on Slide 1. FMC reported revenue of approximately $3.3 billion in 2015, roughly flat to reported revenue for 2014 and adjusted EPS of $2.47, a decline of 22% compared to last year.
For the fourth quarter, FMC reported revenue of $899 million, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 were $0.77, 9% below the fourth quarter of 2014.
Turning to Ag Solutions on Slide 2. For the fourth quarter, Ag Solutions delivered revenue of $657 million and segment earnings of $101 million, a decline of 23% and 8%, respectively, from the pro forma results of the same period of 2014. The negative impact of foreign exchange and lower sales volume more than offset price increase and lower operating cost in the quarter. About 75% of the decline in sales volume during the fourth quarter was the result of deliberate actions to eliminate lower-margin, third-party product sales. Excluding these sales, volume declined by less than 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, as we continued to see demand for FMC's proprietary products across all regions. 
In Europe, we saw healthy demand, as mild weather conditions allowed for late application of cereal herbicides. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to record our first direct sales of FMC products into Western Europe as we transitioned to direct market access provided by the Cheminova acquisition. 
Across the Americas, however, market conditions were significantly more challenging. In North America, consecutive years with low pest pressure have resulted in elevated channel inventory levels. Compounding the channel inventory issues is the deterioration in farmer income levels in the U.S., resulting in a more cautious mindset of distributors and growers. While we continued to see strong support for customers for our proprietary products, we expect challenging market conditions to persist through 2016.
In Brazil, we saw improving conditions in certain crop markets, including sugarcane and cotton, as well as niche crops such as coffee and citrus. However, channel inventories, especially in insecticide, and unfavorable weather conditions negatively impacted sales volume. As we have discussed previously, we expect channel inventory levels to remain elevated through 2016. 
In the rest of Latin America, we continue to see strong demand for FMC's product, including pre-emergent herbicides in Argentina and products for niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. Sales in Argentina, however, continues to be impacted by delay in receiving import licenses for formulated products.
In Asia, weather conditions in India, Pakistan, Australia and parts of Southeast Asia related to reduced demand and higher channel inventories.
The negative impact of foreign exchange was the single largest driver of our 2015 performance. In the quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduced Ag Solutions segment earnings by about $60 million compared to last year. However, the combination of price increases and cost reductions more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange.
In Brazil, we continued to implement significant price increases to maintain U.S. dollar-based pricing in that country. This price increases recovered more than 70% of the currency impact on segment earnings in the fourth quarter. In addition, FMC continued to aggressively reduce operating costs through the faster integration of Cheminova and further restructuring of Ag Solutions operations in Brazil.
As a result, and despite the challenging demand environment, segment earnings margin improved by 250 basis points to 15.4% in the quarter. I will provide further details regarding cost savings activities shortly.
But first, I will comment on the full year performance for Ag Solution. As shown on Slide 3, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $2.6 billion for 2015 compared to pro forma revenue of $3.4 billion for 2014, a decline of 23%, as lower sales volume and foreign exchange headwind more than offset price increases during the year. Lower sales volumes accounted for about 16% of the decline in revenue. However, more than half of this volume decline is the result of actions we took throughout the year to eliminate lower-margin, third-party product sales. Excluding this, sales volumes declined about 7% compared to 2014. 
In 2015, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in FX headwind of about $300 million, erasing over 50% of Ag Solutions pro forma 2014 segment earnings. To be clear, this reduced reported sales by about $380 million and lowered our reported cost by about $80 million. We offset about 60% of the currency impact on sales in Brazil by raising prices throughout the year, and we expect to continue to offset future FX impacts in Brazil through price increases. 
Early in the year, we began to aggressively reduce operating costs. For the full year, operating costs were lower by about $100 million. This include savings from the Cheminova integration, lower spending on discretionary items and lower energy and raw material costs.
Despite the challenging market conditions in 2015, we continued to invest in innovation and our technology pipeline of new synthetic and biological active ingredients. Product introduced in 2015 were well received by the market, and we expect further traction from new product introductions in 2016.
I will now turn to the 2016 cost savings we expect to realize from the Cheminova integration and related actions. As you can see on Slide 4, in 2015, FMC realized about $40 million in cost savings as a direct result of the Cheminova integration and the restructuring of operations in Brazil.
For 2016, we expect to deliver additional cost savings over 2015 of between $60 million and $70 million, reflecting the full year benefit of previously announced headcount reduction and savings associated with various procurement and SAR cost-reduction programs.
As discussed, during our third quarter earnings call, FMC targeted total headcount reductions of 800 to 850 positions. As of December 31, 2015, over 700 positions have been eliminated, and we expect to implement the remaining reductions during the second half of 2016.
The success we have achieved to date in delivering the headcount reduction, plus the further cost reduction initiatives currently underway, gives us a high degree of confidence that we will deliver the 2016 cost savings target and achieve the $140 million to $160 million in run rate cost savings by the middle of 2017.
Turning now to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. Q4 represented another quarter of solid earnings performance. As a result, the business delivered its 11th consecutive year of record earnings in 2015. Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $172 million, a decline of 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, mainly due to lower sales volume and the weaker euro. We saw lower MCC banner and carrageenan sales in the quarter, partially offset by higher sales of MCC-based product for food application and increased sales of omega-3 for the nutraceutical market.
Segment earnings for Health and Nutrition increased 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 to $46 million. Lower operating cost more than offset the negative impact of lower sales volume. 
The benefits of ongoing Manufacturing Excellence and process technology improvement increased segment earnings margin in the quarter to 26.9%, an increase of almost 400 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
As a result of the actions taken over the past year, Health and Nutrition is well positioned to deliver continued earnings growth in 2016. 
Turning next to Lithium on Slide 6. Lithium delivered a strong quarter. Revenue of $70 million was up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, as higher prices were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.
The fourth quarter of 2015 represents the fourth consecutive quarter in which FMC realized higher pricing in the Lithium business as demand growth across end markets application, coupled with tight supply, supported price increases, especially for FMC's carbonate and hydroxide products.
Sales volumes were essentially flat to last year as higher volumes for FMC's butyllithium and specialty organics were offset by lower volumes resulting from scheduled maintenance downtime in our hydroxide unit and less third-party supply of carbonate. 
Demand for FMC's downstream specialty lithium products remains strong. Hydroxide sales volume were up significantly on a full year basis, as demand for energy storage applications continued to grow at double-digit rates and as we continued to increase throughput from our existing assets.
Segment earnings increased 42% to $11 million in the quarter. The combination of higher pricing, improved sales mix and lower operating cost more than offset the impact of FX on FMC's reported results, pushing segment earnings margin to 15.9%, an increase of 450 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now moving on to our 2016 outlook on Slide 7. Last night, we published our outlook statements for the first quarter and full year 2016. I will take a few minutes now to briefly discuss the outlook for each of FMC's business segments.
In Ag Solutions, full year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. And full year segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $380 million to $420 million, with first quarter segment earnings in the range of $70 million to $90 million. I will discuss Ag in more detail in a moment. 
In Health and Nutrition, we are anticipating full year segment revenue of $775 million to $825 million. We continue to see stable low to mid-single-digit demand growth in the majority of our end markets. Segment revenue growth is expected to be slightly below this level, as we do not expect certain omega-3 sales to the pharmaceutical API market made during the first quarter of 2015 to happen in 2016. 
Excluding these sales, we expect underlying sales growth in the middle -- in the mid-single-digit range driven by increased demand for health excipients and nutraceutical ingredients across emerging markets. 
Health and Nutrition segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $198 million to $208 million in 2016. The business made significant strides to improve its cost structure and operating efficiency over the past 12 months. We expect these efforts to drive further margin expansion in 2016, which will allow Health and Nutrition to grow earnings accordingly. 
We expect first quarter segment earnings for Health and Nutrition to be in the range of $46 million to $51 million. We have little similarity in this segment earnings for Health and Nutrition. However, as I mentioned previously, we do not expect certain omega-3 sales from the first quarter of 2015 to reoccur this year. As a result, reported first quarter segment earnings will be lower compared to 2015. 
In Lithium, we see strong demand and a favorable pricing environment. We will continue to optimize our sales mix to drive higher volume of FMC's downstream specialty products.
As we enter 2016, FMC is sold out across most products. Higher pricing, improved mix and lower operating cost will drive earnings growth in 2016. In addition, the reduction in operating cost as a result of the devaluation of the Argentine peso will provide a tailwind for segment earnings over the next 12 to 18 months.
For the full year, we expect Lithium segment revenue to be between $240 million and $260 million and segment earnings to be in the range of $33 million and $43 million. We expect first quarter segment earnings of $8 million to $12 million. 
On a consolidated basis, we expect FMC's 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.80. We expect first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings to be between $0.48 and $0.60 per share.
I will now discuss the outlook for Ag Solutions business in more detail starting with a few comments regarding the market on Slide 8.
In Europe, we expect our key markets to be broadly flat compared to last year, although we expect to see higher growth across Eastern Europe. 
In North America, we expect the challenging market conditions will continue in 2016 given elevated channel inventory levels and projected lower farm incomes. As a result, we expect the market in North America to be down in 2016. 
Across Asia, we expect the market to be mixed depending on the countries. However, overall, we expect the region to be up slightly in 2016 assuming more normal pest pressures and weather conditions. 
Turning to Latin America. Market conditions in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia are expected to remain favorable with growth in weed-resistant acres and increasing acreage for niche crops. We expect the market in Brazil to be down again in 2016. Channel inventory levels are expected to remain elevated in 2016. However, we expect to see an improvement in market fundamentals for sugarcane and cotton.
While the factors impacting market growth vary across growing regions, we are broadly seeing a more cautious approach to purchasing decision throughout the value chain as a result of the protracted downturn in the Ag cycle.
Based on the factors I just described, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to decline by a mid to high-single-digit percentage in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis. However, it is important to remember that these factors are dynamic and will change throughout the year. In particular, changes in planting decisions and pest pressures, and of course weather conditions, will significantly impact demand over the course of the growing season. We will get more clarity on these external factors as the year progresses, and we will update our views on market condition as some of these uncertainties become clear.
Turning next to Slide 9, where we summarize the critical earnings driver for 2016. A number of factors will contribute to the year-over-year increase in Ag Solutions segment earnings. First, we expect a positive $20 million impact from the full year of Cheminova. Next, we are targeting incremental cost savings of $90 million, including $60 million to $70 million from Cheminova-related synergies. Third, we expect that our pricing actions in Brazil and overall mix improvement will contribute approximately $90 million.
New product introductions scheduled for 2016 and revenue synergies in Europe and North America from the Cheminova acquisition will positively impact our mix and volumes for the year. 
Continued FX headwinds, the broader market decline and our decision to exit certain low-margin, third-party product sales will partially offset incremental earnings from the items I just described.
In Health and Nutrition, higher sales of excipient and nutritional products in emerging markets and the full year benefit of continued operational improvements are expected to deliver approximately $8 million in earnings growth.
Lithium is expected to contribute about $15 million to growth in earnings in 2016, driven primarily from higher pricing, improved mix and lower operating costs.
I will now turn the call over to Paul, who will discuss corporate expenses, the impact of foreign currencies on our results and cash flow."

Our corporate expense line represents those centrally held expenses that are not charged back to the businesses. 2015 came in lower than 2014 for the full year, as we saw various items such as insura",881,"Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with the income statement. Our corporate expense line represents those centrally held expenses that are not charged back to the businesses. 2015 came in lower than 2014 for the full year, as we saw various items such as insurance expenses, pension charges, year-end LIFO adjustments to inventory and various incidental FX-related expenses all come in below last year. We do not expect these to repeat in 2016, leading to our guidance for the corporate expense line of $70 million to $80 million. 
Looking at the tax rate, our full year rate benefited from 2 drivers relative to our previous expectations. First, various legislative items passed at the end of the year, primarily related to R&D deductions, resulted in a reduction in our overall rate. Second, the geographic mix of our earnings changed, away from the U.S. and Brazil and towards Europe and Asia. Since the latter regions typically have lower tax rates than the U.S. and Brazil, our overall tax rate benefited.
Together, these 2 items lowered our full year 2015 tax rate by approximately 300 basis points. Looking forward, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the 24% to 26% range. 
I'd like to spend a few moments on Slide 10 revisiting the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our business during the year.
As Pierre has already described, our 2015 performance faced a significant challenge from the impact of the strengthening dollar on our earnings. Across all of FMC and before any pricing actions, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have reduced our 2014 operating earnings by approximately $310 million. Of this reduction, approximately $293 million would have directly impacted Agricultural Solutions. On Slide 10, you can see the drivers of this hit to the Ag Solutions segment earnings.
The cumulative effect of weakening local currencies on revenue was approximately $380 million, of which the Brazilian real was easily the largest followed by the euro. Offsetting this revenue impact was the positive effect on our local cost base, again, mainly the real and euro or euro-linked currencies, which reduced our costs in U.S. dollar terms by $85 million. 
Our response to this was to raise prices. Pierre has already noted that for the full year in 2015, these price increases offset approximately 60% of the currency impact in Brazil. This was possible in large part because market practice in Brazil is to price in real, but to do so relative to a U.S. dollar index. In the rest of the world, pricing is generally not dollar-indexed, creating a bigger challenge to raising prices, especially when market conditions are soft. 
In aggregate, globally, we recovered more than half of the $293 million earnings headwind through raising prices. Looking into 2016, we expect the FX headwind to be more modest than in 2015. The forecast currency moves in major currencies, such as the euro, are far smaller in 2016 than we saw a year ago. And while there remains uncertainty around various Asian and Eastern European currencies, movements in these currencies have a far smaller impact on our profitability. 
The key region that drives the guidance regarding both currency and pricing, as Pierre just described on Slide 9, is Brazil. First of all, our guidance assumes that there will be a less volatile depreciation of the real, with no rapid devaluation right in the middle of the key selling period, as we saw in Q3 2015. Although we are not expecting stronger market conditions in Brazil, our guidance also assumes that local price actions already in place, plus additional price increases, which will be introduced later in the year to reflect the actual depreciation of the real, will largely offset the forecast year-over-year impact of currency depreciation.
Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow on Slide 11. Our year-end net debt was approximately $2.1 billion, with the small increase over the Q3 net debt being entirely due to the final tax payment related to the Alkali sale. The fourth quarter is typically a flat to negative operating cash flow quarter for us, given the seasonality of sales in Brazil. However, strong performance in Health and Nutrition and Lithium, as well as continued cost and capital spending controls, ensured that we kept our net cash outflows to a minimum. 
For the full year, our adjusted cash from operations, adjusted to remove the one-off impact of Cheminova and Alkali-related items, saw a 16% increase over 2014 despite a decline in EBITDA of around $100 million. We benefited from a positive year-on-year swing from working capital, as all businesses improved their working capital performance compared to 2014. 
Our cost-control programs included cash spending discipline. We saw lower cash outflows for capital expenditures, which was a third lower than in 2014, offset by slightly higher restructuring spending. 
In addition, our cash taxes related to ongoing operations were significantly lower than 2014, reflecting lower profitability in both the U.S. and Brazil.
Looking into 2016, we expect a continued improvement in cash generation performance. In aggregate, we expect adjusted cash from operations to increase by approximately 25% in 2016, driven by higher earnings, continued working capital improvements and lower restructuring spending, offset by higher cash taxes.
With that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

Actually, North America, for us, is as much of a concern as Brazil is. So we are highly focused on executing our strategy in a market we believe will be down mid-single to high-single digit in 2016. There is still the possibility of a cycle turn in 2017, but you have to see how 2016 will go. It is highly dependent upon how the industry behaves, making sure that we don't oversell, don't presell, and that there is a normal weather and pest pressure. That is going to be very critical. Any additional negative weather from an Ag industry standpoint or a no pest pressure would lead to -- resulting less the prime of inventory. So 2016 will be a difficult year. And as we go into 2016, we should be able to see if 2017 remained the year where you will have a turn of the cycle. Mark, I don't know if you have any additional comments."

Remember that the biggest problem in 2015 was the high volatility and rapid devaluation of the real in the third quarter. That was unprecedented, more than actually the overall devaluation of the real. So we're not expecting that situation. In a less impact situation from currency, the price increase we need going into 2016 is less than the last year because a big part is a recovery of currency issues from price increase, which are already in place. So I would say we are entering 2016 with about 60% of the price actions already in place to recover the currency impact. And the rest is to happen during the year."

So it is, right now, the earnings potential of FMC Ag Solution has not changed. The problem is we are in a situation where demand is very low. Decisions from growers are pushed to the last minute and in a currency situation, which has been, as you can see, the biggest problem. So 2016 is going to be focused for us on earnings growth. There isn't much we can do around volume demand. We're also going to be highly, highly disciplined. We are not -- I can tell you one thing and we have not done that in 2015, and we're going to stick with that strategy in 2016, we are not going to run after market share. We are walking away from low profit sales, and we are increasing price to recover the currency impact. That should position us as soon as the cycle turn to a very strong performance. So to expect the business going into the mid- to high-teens growth as soon as the market turn around, I have no doubt about it, the model seem intact. Right now, it is inventory.

So if it's a mid- to high single digit, call it a 7%, pure volume driven by market demand, that's where we are forecasting our performance. Now our decline in sales is going to be higher because we are -- and I'm talking volume here, okay? Because we are walking away still from third party. The run rate at which we closed 2015 is leading to a number which is higher than 2015 because we started this process during the year. And I think it's about an incremental $100 million of third-party sales we are walking away in 2016, which make our performance from a revenue standpoint a bit worse than market. So 2 things, we market from a demand standpoint, plus third-party sales, $100 million, we walk away.

So we do see Argentina growing. It has been a good market for us over the last couple of years. And we think our portfolio is ideally suited to where they're going. We are seeing weed-resistant acres continue to increase, just like we do in the U.S. So I'm very bullish on Argentina."

And I also believe that today, protecting the profitability of the business is critical, especially when the cycle will turn because the cycle will turn. And we believe we'll be in a much stronger position that time. It is more difficult to increase pricing in locations like Europe or even Asia, where there is no indexation on the currency on the dollar because there, it's purely a supply-demand and negotiations. So I would say most of our pricing recovery comes from Brazil rather than the other region. And yes, you are correct. I don't think we are ahead of the market because as you can see, we only partially recovered the currency negative impact with price increase.

So the $15 million of earnings increase we are forecasting is driven by multiple factors. First of all, you know that we've been working very hard at fixing our operational issues, and I think we're there. Most of our plants -- there is still some work, but most of our plants are operating much better than they used to. And also the currency, the peso in Argentina, has been helping us from a cost standpoint and is going to be a tailwind in 2016. Additionally, there is the price and mix. We have a very strong product line and technology for lithium hydroxide. We are one of the critical and leading suppliers. And that market has increased in a tight supply situation, which allow us to right-price the product. So all in all, pricing, mix, better operation and currency will be the drivers in 2016. Around capacity, I think our capacity decisions will be in line with our strategy. First of all, we are working very hard at debottlenecking our plants, especially lithium hydroxide, to make sure we can supply our customers with the growth they need. From a capital investment standpoint, we believe our key competitors today have made decisions to increase lithium carbonate in a significant way. So we do not believe volume of lithium carbonate from FMC will be required to serve the market. There will be plenty of products, and we will be able to have supply agreements on lithium carbonate from other companies. So we do not believe -- even with an improving situation in Argentina, we do not believe we need going into 2017 to increase capacity in lithium carbonate, keep on debottlenecking the plant. Where we are looking at capital spending to improve our sales is in the downstream specialty business and mostly lithium hydroxide. This is where most of our capital spending will go in the next 2 or 3 years."

The consolidation of these 2 companies together will certainly create a very strong company with a very solid seed and chemicals portfolio. But honestly, this is 2 years away. You first need to have the time to get the approval from Dow and DuPont to merge as a single company. And once that is done, they need to do the integration. And then from the integration, they need to break up the company, as they stated, into 3 companies and merge together the 2 ag business. So I believe it's an interesting decision, which creates a very good company. But their impact on the market or the competitive landscape is still a couple of years away, so not a short-term concern for us. The Syngenta, Cheminova, my view -- or ChemChina, sorry. The Syngenta, ChemChina, my view is that it doesn't change much to the competitive landscape because if I understand well, through what I've read and what I've heard, Syngenta will be operating as a stand-alone company. And instead of being a publicly traded company, they will have a single shareowner, which is ChemChina. So unless ChemChina has a very fundamental -- or push a very fundamentally different strategy, which I don't think so, into Syngenta, we would be facing the same type of competition that we've been facing in the past. So my point of view at this stage, it's pretty much no change to the landscape for the next couple of years. And we'll see what will happen 2 years down the road."

So we're going to have sales in North America much more spread over a Q1, Q2 and Q3 period than we used to have, where people who would really buy very strongly in advance in the fourth quarter. So the fact that we have a different profile in the first half of the year is purely due to North America.

So if you look, there is much more product on the ground, product which are put on the ground, than product which are sold by the chemical industry into the market.

You just need strong weather or strong pest pressure, combined with more product on the ground than the industry is selling, and you could see a turn in 2017.

Obviously, North America doesn't have the piece which is the currency impact, so we've talked less about it. But we've come quickly to realize that purely from an inventory standpoint, about the same phenomenon we've seen in Brazil is happening in North America, commodity prices being low, growers who are very cautious in terms of planting decisions and purchasing decisions as their colleague were in Brazil. The crop protection industry kept on selling products. And there was a point where there was more product going into the channel than product going on the ground. And that created, as in Brazil, a very elevated situation. Additionally, insect pressure was not great in the previous year, which has been creating even more of a problem.

The way we restructure and what we restructured was done very carefully so it does not at all impact on our ability to collect. The factors that are driving our ability to collect are really driven more by market conditions. And I don't necessarily just mean Ag market conditions but as much the financing market conditions down in Brazil, where we're seeing a continued cautiousness on the part of the Brazilian grower to hold on to his liquid resources. A lack of confidence that financing will be there for them as they head into the next growing season is essentially across the board creating challenges to collection. Compounding on top of that, of course, as we've discussed, is the fact that the most leverage you have is when you have to -- when the grower has to buy a new product, when you have pest pressures down and when you have excess inventory in the channel, it just makes that collection process even more difficult for us. I would say 2015 unfolded very much in the way we described. I think we talked at length about it being a multiyear program to reduce the receivables balance in Brazil. And '15 played out really exactly as we had expected. The next couple of quarters will be the next key benchmarks for us as we look at the collection in the first half of the year. And to us at least, we think heading through the back end of '16 is the first time we'll be able to show real measurable progress down there in Brazil."

Today, FMC is a more focused and streamlined company. Our businesses operate in attractive end markets namely Agriculture, Nutrition, Pharmaceuticals and Lithium.",2757,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. 2016 marks the beginning of a new era for FMC. Today, FMC is a more focused and streamlined company. Our businesses operate in attractive end markets namely Agriculture, Nutrition, Pharmaceuticals and Lithium. The actions we have taken over the past 18 months have aligned our operation with regional market demand and positioned each of our businesses to better capitalize on market opportunities. With our transformation complete, we are now solely focused on the execution of our strategy to drive pro forma in 2016 and beyond.
In Agricultural Solutions, we continue to see the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Ag Solutions was very much an American business. In 2014, more than 3 quarters of its revenues were generated in North and South America. Cheminova significantly increased the size of Ag Solutions operations in Europe and Asia, bringing greater scale and market access to Ag Solutions operations across our region. The increased global sale of operations, combined with actions we have taken in North and South America, will bring greater original bounds to Ag Solutions, aligning our operations with the global crop protection chemical market and limit Ag Solutions' reliance on any one region or market to drive performance.
For example, in 2014 almost 40% of Ag Solutions' revenue was generated in Brazil alone. In 2016, we expect Brazil to account for less than 20% of segment revenue and only 15% of total company revenue. 
Across the global ag market, conditions in the Americas remain the most challenging. With greater scale and regional balance, FMC is able to better manage our business in the Americas to address market conditions. Specifically, we researched an operation in Brazil to align the size of our business with market conditions and rationalize our product offering to increase our focus on higher margin, proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products. While these actions reduce our revenues in Brazil, they improved the quality of our operations and enhanced the potential to deliver higher earnings and return on capital.
In North America, we are supporting customer inventory draw downs to more closely match our sales with underlying grow our demand, an important step to further strengthen FMC's position from which to protect price and terms. Cheminova also expanded our product portfolio and technology pipeline and provided the opportunity to realize meaningful cost savings. We are already seeing the benefits of our expanded product portfolio in North America and Europe and the integration of Cheminova is progressing well. We remain on track to deliver the full run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of 2017.
In Health and Nutrition, global demand for FMC's naturally derived ingredients product lines continue to be robust and we remain focused on maintaining the business' high margins through the implementation of manufacturing excellence program, process technology improvements and product differentiation.
In Lithium, we are seeing the benefits of our strategy to focus and grow FMC's business in the technology-driven specialty end market where demand continues to climb and pricing trends across FMC's portfolio remain favorable. I will discuss the performance of each of our businesses shortly and provide an update on our outlook for Q2 and the full year.
First, I will start with a brief review of FMC's consolidated reported results on Slide 2. FMC reported first quarter revenue of approximately $799 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.58 [ph] for the quarter was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015 but was towards the top end of our organic range as a solid performance in Ag Solutions and a very strong quarter for Lithium drove the results.
Turning now to Ag Solutions on Slide 3. Ag Solutions reported revenue of $546 million, a decline of 22% compared to pro forma results for the first quarter of 2015 has lower sales volume in North America and Brazil due to high channel inventories, planned product rationalization and currency headwinds more than offset the impact of price increases, revenue synergies and new product introductions in the quarter.
As I mentioned previously, we are focused on executing our strategy to drive improved performance. This includes completing the process of rationalizing the Ag Solutions product portfolio that began in 2014. The actions we took to eliminate certain products from our portfolio reduced revenue by approximately $30 million or 4% compared to pro forma revenue for Q1 2015.
However, as discussed in prior quarters, this product rationalization has a limited impact on segment earnings. We also remain focused on pricing discipline. At the operating earnings level, price increases implemented in Brazil more than offset the year-over-year impact of the weaker real. However, the broad-based strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in headwinds in Europe and Asia that are only partially offset by price increases.
Despite challenging market conditions, the Ag Solution business delivered segment earnings of $82 million, ahead of the midpoint of organic and maintain operating margins year-over-year on a pro forma basis. 
I will make a few additional comments regarding regional market conditions and Ag Solutions' performance now on Slide 4. Overall market conditions and our performance in the quarter were very much as expected. In North America, as we discussed on our Q4 earnings call back in February, the deterioration in farm incomes over the past year, combined with elevated channel inventory levels led distributors and growers to delay purchases of agricultural foods, including crop protection chemicals. We determined it was critical to maintain price and payment terms in North America this season. And as part of our strategy to achieve these, we believe it was important to allow the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel to reduce. Our decision to allow FMC product inventory in the sales channel to be drawn down was the main factor behind the 35% decline in revenue in North America in the quarter compared to pro forma revenue for the first quarter 2015.
However, we anticipate full year revenue performance for Ag Solutions in North America will be largely in line with the broader North America crop protection market as the action we are taking today will facilitate increased sales in the second half of the year. In fact, the dollar we are seeing give us increased confidence that our approach to managing Ag Solutions business in North America will help protect price and terms in 2016.
Despite lower sales into the channel, FMC continues to gain market share when looking at growers' use of products. Based on independent data, application of FMC products or products on the ground rose 7% in the quarter compared to Q1 2015. In particular, we continue to see strength in FMC's authority brand pre-emergent herbicides, which address a growing number of soybean acres which exhibit glyphosate resistance. As a result, we are confident the reduction in revenue in Q1 is due more to a decision as went-to-sell than it is in any change in underlying demand for FMC products. And it is this strong good demand for FMC's portfolio of technical products which will ultimately provide the support of pricing and terms that we are focused on.
In addition, we continue to see demand by growers for new innovative and differentiated products that provide high-value end use. Recent product launches in FMC and the introduction of our expanded fungicide product offering as a result of the Cheminova acquisition received strong support from growers and distributors in the quarter. We also saw strong acceptance of our new biological and seed [ph] product combinations, including brand such as capturing VGR and [indiscernible]. 
In Latin America, revenue declined approximately 25% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Lower demand and planned product rationalizations in Brazil more than offset increased sales volume in the rest of Latin America.
Excluding this portfolio rationalization, sales in Latin America declined approximately 15% in line with the overall market. Market conditions in Brazil were a little changed from the fourth quarter of 2015. Channel inventory levels have improved but remain elevated, most notably in soybean insecticide in the northern states. However, we are seeing an increase in demand in the north for insecticide, such as FMC's Talisman [ph] to address pressure in soybean. 
In Southern Brazil, market conditions are improved, especially in sugarcane and certain niche crops such as coffee and [indiscernible]
We continue to remain disciplined on pricing in Brazil. As we have explained previously, greater stability in the Brazilian real to U.S. dollar exchange rate supports price increase to offset FX headwinds. Paul will comment further on the impact of foreign currencies later in the call. 
Outside of Brazil, we continue to see increasing demand for pre-emergent herbicides in Argentina and products for niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. In Argentina, we see improved conditions with far fewer restrictions on imports and with the leasing of export taxes for key crops. 
In Europe, sales declined approximately 11% as foreign exchange headwinds and lower market volume more than offset commercial synergies from the Cheminova transaction and new product launches in the quarter. A cold snap at the end of the winter impacted the season in certain Western European markets, and we have seen some tightening of demand by growers in an attempt to control costs in the face of persistently below grain prices. Strong demand in Central and Eastern Europe and FMC's transition to Cheminova's direct market access model in Europe partially offset the pullback in market activity in the quarter.
Sales volumes across Europe increased for FMC's legal portfolio, including herbicides and insecticides for [indiscernible]. With the benefits of a broader combined portfolio, we believe the business is well-positioned to address market demand in key crops, including [indiscernible] and all [indiscernible].
Profitability in the region improved meaningfully year-over-year as the move to direct market access, combined with other cost savings from the Cheminova integration, increased operating margins in Europe by about 200 basis points. 
In Asia, we saw increased demand in China and Australia. However, the stronger U.S. dollar combined with planned product rationalization and poor weather in India and Southeast Asia resulted in a 13% decline in pro forma revenue compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of currency and planned product rationalization, revenue decreased about 3% driven largely by lower sales volume in India.
Globally, we expect the challenging market conditions to persist for the remainder of the year. As previously stated, we believe the global crop protection chemicals market will decline by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis driven largely by market conditions in North America and Brazil.
We remain highly focused on decreasing FMC product inventory levels in the channel, holding on price in turn and increasing collections of accounts receivable. 
Our full year guidance for Ag Solutions remains unchanged. We continue to forecast full year revenue of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion and full year segment earnings in the range of $380 million to $420 million. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver segment earnings in the range of $90 million to $110 million, along with sequential margin improvement as we move toward the main selling season in North America and Europe. 
Turning next to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. First quarter performance for Health and Nutrition was broadly in line with expectations. The business reported revenue of $192 million and segment earnings of $47 million. First quarter 2016 revenue declined approximately $19 million compared to the first quarter of last year. 
As discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, last year's first quarter revenue included certain omega-3 sales which were not expected to occur in 2016. These sales relate principally to pharmaceutical API products and account for a decline in the revenue compared to the prior year period.
Excluding these sales volume and impact of currency, revenue was essentially flat compared to last year. 
Global demand for FMC's Health excipient products continues to grow, resulting in higher sales volume of minor and [indiscernible] products in the quarter. However, lower sales in functional health due to timing and a more competitive omega-3 pricing environment broadly offset the increase in health excipient revenue. 
For the first quarter 2016, Health and Nutrition reported segment earnings of $47 million while lower operating costs resulted in an increase in segment earnings margin to 24.6%. Looking forward, we continue to expect full year revenue in the range of $775 million and $825 million, and segment earnings of between $198 million and $208 million, driven principally by continued growth and demand for MCC-based health excipients and nutritional ingredients in North America and Asia and lower operating cost from ongoing manufacturing excellence program and process technology improvement. 
We expect Health and Nutrition second quarter segment earnings of between $49 million and $53 million with a sequential improvement in segment earnings margin in the quarter.
Turning to Lithium on Slide 6. Lithium delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, revenue increased 8% to $60 [ph] million and segment earnings almost threefold to $14.9 million. Segment's operating margin climbed from under 10% last year in Q1 to almost 25% this quarter. These results reflect the impact of our strategy to focus on the downstream specialty markets. 
As a result of our advantaged process technology and ability to manage sales mix, FMC is uniquely positioned to serve the higher growth and higher-value specialty segments while maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate and chloride.
Demand trends across specialty end markets remain strong. Demand for lithium hydroxide for energy storage and electric vehicle, or EV applications, continues to grow at double-digit rates. Our success in increasing throughput from our existing hydroxide asset allow FMC to deliver higher sales volume in the quarter. In addition, we managed our production mix in order to optimize our sales of butyllithium and high-purity lithium minerals. 
Favorable market conditions supported price increases across the FMC portfolio. We continue to realize price increases for lithium hydroxide while our approach to the carbonate and chloride markets is allowing us to achieve meaningful price increases from the limited sales volume. The extent to which carbonate and chloride prices remain elevated will depend on how quickly new supply comes online. We expect market supply of all product to remain tight in the near to midterm.
Lower operating cost coupled with higher specialty sales volume and price increases resulted in significant increases in segment earnings and margins in the quarter. Manufacturing efficiencies from ongoing process improvement initiatives and lower cost associated with the natural gas pipeline installed in 2015 reduced operating costs by more than $5 million year-over-year, helping to drive the increased operating margin in the quarter. 
We expect the second quarter to be another strong period for the Lithium business. We continue to shift our sales mix to grow our specialty product line, serving markets such as [indiscernible] and polymers while capitalizing on favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate. However, we expect to have slightly lower available carbonate volumes in Q2 compared to Q1, as a result of lower seasonal production in Argentina.
Consequently, we expect quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $10 million to $14 million and segment earnings margin in the range of 19% to 20%. Based on Lithium performance to date and our expectation for the remainder of 2016, we are raising our full year outlook for the Lithium business. We now expect full year revenue to be between $245 million and $265 [ph] million and segment earnings to be in the range of $43 million to $53 million, up $10 million from the prior range. 
Moving next to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 7. I previously commented on the outlook for each business for both Q2 and the full year. As I mentioned, we are maintaining segment earnings guidance for the full year for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition. Segment earnings guidance for the second quarter reflect normal earnings level for these businesses based on our expectation for 2016. We are increasing the full year segment earnings guidance for Lithium as stated earlier. 
On a consolidated basis, we are increasing full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 versus previous guidance to a range of $2.55 to $2.85, and we expect second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings to be between $0.62 and $0.72 per share.

As usual, I'll start with the income statement and specifically the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate fell from 27.5% in the first quarter 2015 to 26% in Q1 '16. Part of this was the continued change in the mix of our",737,"Thank you very much, Pierre. As usual, I'll start with the income statement and specifically the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate fell from 27.5% in the first quarter 2015 to 26% in Q1 '16. Part of this was the continued change in the mix of our earnings away from the U.S. and Brazil and towards Europe and Asia where rates are typically lowered. We continue to take steps to increase our tax efficiency and expect that the full year rate will come in somewhere in the 24% to 26% range. 
A theme in our earnings in recent quarters has been the impact of foreign currency movements, and the movement in the Brazilian real has been a particular area of focus. In the first quarter, the average rate of the reais the dollar was 3.9 [ph], significantly weaker than 2.87 [ph] average the same quarter a year ago. However, the total impact on our earnings was far less than we have seen in prior quarters for 2 main reasons. First, as you know, Q1 is not a large selling quarter for us in Brazil, reducing the impact of currency movement. Also, since we have not seen particularly volatile movements in the currency, our price list has been able to reflect the new currency levels for the entire quarter. As a result, the $13 million headwinds created by the weaker reais year-on-year was completely offset by price increases. In fact, the positive impact of the weaker real on our cost base and of the change in the real was actually enough positive driving constraint in Q1. 
Looking to the rest of the work, although a number of Asian currencies collectively reduced earnings, the only major currency we faced headwind in the quarter was the euro, which devalued by 2% versus the same period last year. The net hit for operating earnings from currency movements in the quarter was approximately $14 [ph] million. 
A second common theme of our earnings has also been the challenges of operating in Argentina, including areas such as import licenses restrictions, negative impacts of export duties and the headwind created by the disconnect between cost inflation and the pace of devaluation of peso against the dollar. Since the election of [indiscernible] as President, we have seen a rapid shift in all of these areas, to the benefits of our operations in Ag Solutions and especially Lithium. The devaluation of the peso had a relatively limited impact in our earnings in the quarter in Lithium since the lower cost of operations takes 1 to 2 quarters to work its way out of inventory and into the income statement. And our earnings guidance for 2016 reflect this lower cost of operations. We remain cautiously optimistic that the business environment in Argentina will remain positive and will continue to create opportunities for FMC. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 8. Q1 is historically the period in which we consumed the most cash given the seasonal nature of our Ag business. However, discipline around spending, the increased focus last year on sales terms, and of course the ongoing collection measures globally resulted in an improvement of operating cash flow of over $100 million compared to the same quarter last year. Cash flow was helped by higher EBITDA and a better performance around working capital, most notably from collection of receivables. This improvement was seen in all regions. 
With certain cash outflows, particularly capital spending and pension expenses also lower than last year, we were able to hold net debt flat during the quarter. As noted in our filing of March 28, we elected to amend the debt covenants for our term loan and revolver, defering the timing of step downs of our leverage ratios such that we retained the covenant limit of 4.5x for Q1. Our actual leverage ratio under the covenant calculation was 4.0x given the half turn of headwind that we considered to be prudent. 
Looking to the rest of the year, adjusted cash from operations is forecasted in the range of $450 million to $550 million, an improvement over last year of over a third at the midpoint of the range. This is driven by improvements in both EBITDA and working capital performance. Capital expenditure will remain broadly flat to 2015 in the $120 million to $140 million range.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

First, let me talk about the ag market as we see it for this year. I think we are not changing our view for 2016. We still believe it's a mid-to-high single digit downmarket, mostly driven by North America and Brazil in the high teens, and maybe Asia and Europe -- in the high single-digit, while Europe and Asia would be in the low to mid-single-digit decrease. So we are not changing our view. It could be maybe trending more toward the high single-digit overall global market. The way -- and why do I feel better about the way we are operating in the ag market? It is not because we are seeing a fundamental change in the market in the short-term. But what I think we are doing at FMC, I think the key difference is that we know better how to operate in this type of market. I can tell you, we see it on our number, we are not fighting to keep market share on sales of product. We are much more looking at 3 types of objectives. First, it's very important for us and focusing only on FMC project is to decrease FMC product in the channels. The second aspect is we want to be able by doing that to focus more on the quality of the sales, which is more term, price and collection. And then, looking at all of that, the objective is to align more sales with a normal demand pattern. You see that on the numbers in Q1 in North America. Sales down 35%, I think, on Slide 4, while product on the ground were up above market, 7%. So the way we are operating in the market today, I believe we have more control over our selling process than we might have had in the past when we got hit by the downturn. Beyond that, I would say -- I would not exclude the market to turnaround in 2017, but I have no indicators telling me that it will be the case. I think we are much more focused, Mike, on operating under the current conditions with very high control on term, price, managing very closely with -- in partnership with the customers, our inventory, to create much more predictability in our sales. So that's why the developed level of confidence for me is increasing at this stage. Market turnaround, I think we'll have to wait a little bit more to go into Q3, Q4 to have more visibility."

And again it isn't so much the level -- we've shown that in Q1 where with an average rate of 3.9 [ph] today is closer to 3.5 [ph] we were able to still capture pricing on a limited number of sales we have in Q1. The question will come in Q3, how stable, how predictable is the real? In the rest of the world when you look at the forward curve of the currency, it does not feel like a strengthening dollar is what the market is expecting. And so that, generally speaking, is what's factored into our numbers relative predictability, not a big strengthening of the dollar around the world. Q1 feels like when you look at where the dollar is today compared to a year ago, Q1 compared to the last of the quarters that we had those tough FX comps. So subject to any changes away from where the market expects today doesn't feel like currency will be quite the high-level that it was last year."

We clearly have an increased expectation around EBITDA. But the truth is it's largely around working capital. And you have to bear in mind, if you look over the last few years, 2 years ago, we had a terrible performance with working capital with largely cash outflow. Last year, we turned out the corner and sort of stopped the bleeding and improved it a bit slightly. But this year, we expect that trend to continue so the working capital becomes a positive generator of cash flows. Our biggest focus is always going to be the Brazil receivables balance and getting that receivable balance down. We will also be very, very focused on inventory levels, our own inventory levels, and making sure we are very efficient and very thoughtful about what inventory we will, where we hold it, how much of it we hold. So it's coming in multiple different areas, but you should look at working capital the primary driver of increase in cash flow for 2016."

Our businesses operate in attractive end markets namely agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceuticals and lithium.",2763,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. 2016 marks the beginning of a new era for FMC. Today, FMC is a more focused and streamlined company. Our businesses operate in attractive end markets namely agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceuticals and lithium. The actions we have taken over the past 18 months have aligned our operation with regional market demand and positioned each of our businesses to better capitalize on market opportunities. With our transformation complete, we are now solely focused on the execution of our strategy to drive performance in 2016 and beyond.
In Agricultural Solutions, we continue to see the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Ag Solutions was very much an American business. In 2014, more than 3 quarters of its revenues were generated in North and South America. Cheminova significantly increased the size of Ag Solutions operations in Europe and Asia, bringing greater scale and market access to Ag Solutions operations across our region. The increased global scale of operations, combined with actions we have taken in North and South America, will bring greater regional balance to Ag Solutions, aligning our operations with the global crop protection chemical market and limit Ag Solutions' reliance on any one region or market to drive performance.
For example, in 2014, almost 40% of Ag Solutions' revenue was generated in Brazil alone. In 2016, we expect Brazil to account for less than 20% of segment revenue and only 15% of total company revenue. 
Across the global ag market, conditions in the Americas remain the most challenging. With greater scale and regional balance, FMC is able to better manage our business in the Americas to address market conditions. Specifically, we restructured our operation in Brazil to align the size of our business with market conditions and rationalize our product offering to increase our focus on higher-margin, proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products. While these actions reduced our revenues in Brazil, they improved the quality of our operations and enhanced the potential to deliver higher earnings and return on capital.
In North America, we are supporting customer inventory drawdowns to more closely match our sales with underlying grower demand, an important step to further strengthen FMC's position from which to protect price and terms. Cheminova also expanded our product portfolio and technology pipeline and provided the opportunity to realize meaningful cost savings. We are already seeing the benefits of our expanded product portfolio in North America and Europe and the integration of Cheminova is progressing well. We remain on track to deliver the full run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of 2017.
In Health and Nutrition, global demand for FMC's naturally derived ingredients product lines continue to be robust and we remain focused on maintaining the business' high margins through the implementation of manufacturing excellence program, process technology improvements and product differentiation.
In Lithium, we are seeing the benefits of our strategy to focus and grow FMC's business in the technology-driven specialty end market where demand continues to climb and pricing trends across FMC's portfolio remain favorable. I will discuss the performance of each of our businesses shortly and provide an update on our outlook for Q2 and the full year.
First, I will start with a brief review of FMC's consolidated reported results on Slide 2. FMC reported first quarter revenue of approximately $799 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.58 for the quarter was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015 but was towards the top end of our guidance range as a solid performance in Ag Solutions and a very strong quarter from Lithium drove the results.
Turning now to Ag Solutions on Slide 3. Ag Solutions reported revenue of $546 million, a decline of 22% compared to pro forma results for the first quarter of 2015 as lower sales volume in North America and Brazil due to high channel inventories, planned product rationalization and currency headwinds more than offset the impact of price increases, revenue synergies and new product introductions in the quarter.  
As I mentioned previously, we are focused on executing our strategy to drive improved performance. This includes completing the process of rationalizing the Ag Solutions product portfolio that began in 2014. The actions we took to eliminate certain products from our portfolio reduced revenue by approximately $30 million or 4% compared to pro forma revenue for Q1 2015.  However, as discussed in prior quarters, this product rationalization has a limited impact on segment earnings. 
We also remain focused on pricing discipline. At the operating earnings level, price increases implemented in Brazil more than offset the year-over-year impact of the weaker real. However, the broad-based strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in headwinds in Europe and Asia that were only partially offset by price increases.
Despite challenging market conditions, the Ag Solutions business delivered segment earnings of $82 million, ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, and maintained operating margins year-over-year on a pro forma basis. 
I will make a few additional comments regarding regional market condition and Ag Solutions performance now on Slide 4. 
Overall market conditions and our performance in the quarter were very much as expected. In North America, as we discussed on our Q4 earnings call back in February, the deterioration in farm incomes over the past year, combined with elevated channel inventory levels, led distributors and growers to delay purchases of agriculture in foods, including crop protection chemicals. We determined it was critical to maintain price and payment terms in North America this season. And as part of our strategy to achieve these, we believe it was important to allow the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel to reduce. Our decision to allow FMC product inventory in the sales channel to be drawn down was the main factor behind the 35% decline in revenue in North America in the quarter compared to pro forma revenue for the first quarter 2015.
However, we anticipate full year revenue performance for Ag Solutions in North America will be largely in line with the broader North America crop protection market as the action we are taking today will facilitate increased sales in the second half of the year. In fact, the dollar we are seeing give us increased confidence that our approach to managing Ag Solutions business in North America will help protect price and terms in 2016.
Despite lower sales into the channel, FMC continues to gain market share when looking at growers' use of products. Based on independent data, application of FMC products or products on the ground rose 7% in the quarter compared to Q1 2015. In particular, we continue to see strength in FMC's Authority brand pre-emergent herbicide which address the growing number of soybean acres which exhibit glyphosate resistance. 
As a result, we are confident the reduction in revenue  in Q1 is due more to a decision as when to sell than it is to any change in underlying demand for FMC products. And it is this strong, good demand for FMC's portfolio of technical products which will ultimately provide the support for pricing and terms as we are -- that we are focused on.
In addition, we continue to see demand by growers for new innovative and differentiated products that provide high-value and use. Recent product launches in FMC in core herbicide and the introduction of our expanded fungicide product offering as a result of the Cheminova acquisition received strong support from growers and distributors in the quarter. We also saw strong acceptance of our new biological and [indiscernible] product combinations, including brand such as Capture, VGR and Ethos XB.
In Latin America, revenue declined approximately 25% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Lower demand and planned product rationalizations in Brazil more than offset increased sales volume in the rest of Latin America.  Excluding this portfolio rationalization, sales in Latin America declined approximately 15%, in line with the overall market. 
Market conditions in Brazil were a little changed from the fourth quarter of 2015. Channel inventory levels have improved but remain elevated, most notably in soybean insecticide in the northern states. However, we are seeing an increase in demand in the north for insecticide, such as FMC's Talisman to address secondary pest pressure in soybeans. 
In Southern Brazil, market conditions are improved, especially in sugarcane and certain niche crops such as coffee and citrus. We continue to remain disciplined on pricing in Brazil. As we have explained previously, greater stability in the Brazilian real to U.S. dollar exchange rate supports price increase to offset FX headwinds. Paul will comment further on the impact of foreign currencies later in the call. 
Outside of Brazil, we continue to see increasing demand for pre-emergent herbicides in Argentina and products for niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. In Argentina, we see improved conditions with far fewer restrictions on imports and with the leasing of export taxes for key crops. 
In Europe, sales declined approximately 11% as foreign exchange headwinds and lower market volume more than offset commercial synergies from the Cheminova transaction and new product launches in the quarter. A cold snap at the end of the winter impacted the season in certain Western European markets, and we have seen some tightening of demand by growers in an attempt to control costs in the face of persistently low grain prices. Strong demand in Central and Eastern Europe and FMC's transition to Cheminova's direct market access model in Europe partially offset the pullback in market activity in the quarter.
Sales volumes across Europe increased for FMC's legal portfolio, including herbicide and insecticide for cereals. With the benefit of a broader combined portfolio, we believe the business is well-positioned to address market demand in key crops, including cereals and all [indiscernible].
Profitability in the region improved meaningfully year-over-year as the move to direct market access, combined with other cost savings from the Cheminova integration, increased operating margins in Europe by about 200 basis points. 
In Asia, we saw increased demand in China and Australia. However, the stronger U.S. dollar, combined with planned product rationalization and poor weather in India and Southeast Asia resulted in a 13% decline in pro forma revenue compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of currency and planned product rationalization, revenue decreased about 3% driven largely by lower sales volume in India.
Globally, we expect the challenging market conditions to persist for the remainder of the year. As previously stated, we believe the global crop protection chemicals market will decline by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis, driven largely by market conditions in North America and Brazil.  We remain highly focused on decreasing FMC product inventory levels in the channel, holding on price and term and increasing collections of accounts receivable. 
Our full year guidance for Ag Solutions remains unchanged. We continue to forecast full year revenue of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion and full year segment earnings in the range of $380 million to $420 million. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver segment earnings in the range of $90 million to $110 million, along with sequential margin improvement as we move toward the main selling season in North America and Europe. 
Turning next to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. First quarter performance for Health and Nutrition was broadly in line with expectation. The business reported revenue of $192 million and segment earnings of $47 million. First quarter 2016 revenue declined approximately $19 million compared to the first quarter of last year. 
As discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, last year's first quarter revenue included certain omega-3 sales which were not expected to occur in 2016. These sales relate principally to pharmaceutical API products and account for a decline in the revenue compared to the prior year period.  Excluding these sales volume and the impact of currency, revenue was essentially flat compared to last year. 
Global demand for FMC's health excipient products continues to grow, resulting in higher sales volume of minor and [indiscernible] products in the quarter. However, lower sales in functional health due to timing and the more competitive omega-3 pricing environment broadly offset the increase in health excipient revenue. 
For the first quarter 2016, Health and Nutrition reported segment earnings of $47 million while lower operating costs resulted in an increase in segment earnings margin to 24.6%. 
Looking forward, we continue to expect full year revenue in the range of $775 million and $825 million, and segment earnings of between $198 million and $208 million, driven principally by continued growth and demand for MCC-based health excipients and nutritional ingredients in North America and Asia and lower operating cost from ongoing manufacturing excellence program and process technology improvement. 
We expect Health and Nutrition second quarter segment earnings of between $49 million and $53 million with a sequential improvement in segment earnings margin in the quarter.
Turning to Lithium on Slide 6. Lithium delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, revenue increased 8% to $60 million and segment earnings almost threefold to $14.9 million. Segment's operating margin climbed from under 10% last year in Q1 to almost 25% this quarter. These results reflect the impact of our strategy to focus on the downstream specialty markets.  As a result of our advantaged process technology and ability to manage sales mix, FMC is uniquely positioned to serve the higher growth and higher-value specialty segments while maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate and chloride.
Demand trends across specialty end markets remain strong. Demand for lithium hydroxide for energy storage and electric vehicle, or EV applications, continues to grow at double-digit rates. Our success in increasing throughput from our existing hydroxide asset allow FMC to deliver higher sales volume in the quarter. In addition, we managed our production mix in order to optimize our sales of butyllithium and high-purity lithium minerals. 
Favorable market conditions supported price increases across the FMC portfolio. We continue to realize price increases for lithium hydroxide, while our approach to the carbonate and chloride market is allowing us to achieve meaningful price increases from this limited sales volume. The extent to which carbonate and chloride prices remain elevated will depend on how quickly new supply comes online. We expect market supply of all product to remain tight in the near to midterm.
Lower operating cost, coupled with higher specialty sales volume and price increases, resulted in significant increases in segment earnings and margins in the quarter. Manufacturing efficiencies from ongoing process improvement initiatives and lower cost associated with the natural gas pipeline installed in 2015 reduced operating cost by more than $5 million year-over-year, helping to drive the increased operating margin in the quarter. 
We expect the second quarter to be another strong period for the Lithium business. We continue to shift our sales mix to grow our specialty product line, serving markets such as indiscernible] and polymers while capitalizing on favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate. However, we expect to have slightly lower available carbonate volumes in Q2 compared to Q1, as a result of lower seasonal production in Argentina.
Consequently, we expect quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $10 million to $14 million and segment earnings margin in the range of 19% to 20%. Based on Lithium performance to date and our expectation for the remainder of 2016, we are raising our full year outlook for the Lithium business. We now expect full year revenue to be between $245 million and $265 million and segment earnings to be in the range of $43 million to $53 million, up $10 million from the prior range. 
Moving next to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 7. I previously commented on the outlook for each business for both Q2 and the full year. As I mentioned, we are maintaining segment earnings guidance for the full year for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition. Segment earnings guidance for the second quarter reflect normal earnings level for these businesses based on our expectation for 2016. We are increasing the full year segment earnings guidance for Lithium, as stated earlier. 
On a consolidated basis, we are increasing full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 versus previous guidance to a range of $2.55 to $2.85, and we expect second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings to be between $0.62 and $0.72 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results, including taxes, foreign exchange and cash flow."

Our adjusted effective tax rate fell from 27.5% in the first quarter 2015 to 26% in Q1 '16. Part of this was the continued change in the mix of our earnings, away from the U.S. and Brazil and towards Europe and Asia where rates are typically lower. We continue to take steps to increase our tax efficiency and expect that the full year rate will come in somewhere in the 24% to 26% range. 
A theme in our earnings in recent quarters has been the impact of foreign currency movements, and the movement in the Brazilian real has been a particular area of focus. In the first quarter, the average rate of the real to the dollar was 3.9, significantly weaker than the 2.87 average of the same quarter a year ago. However, the total impact on our earnings was far less than we have seen in prior quarters for 2 main reasons. First, as you know, Q1 is not a large selling quarter for us in Brazil, reducing the impact of currency move. Also, since we have not seen particularly volatile movements in the currency, our price list has been able to reflect the new currency levels for the entire quarter. As a result, the $13 million headwind created by the weaker real year-on-year was completely offset by price increases. In fact, the positive impact of the weaker real on our cost base and that the change in the real was actually a net positive to our income statement in Q1. 
Looking to the rest of the world, although a number of Asian currencies collectively reduced earnings, the only major currency in which we faced a headwind in the quarter was the euro, which devalued by 2% versus the same period last year. The net hit to operating earnings from currency movements in the quarter was approximately $14 million. 
A second common theme on our earnings has also been the challenges of operating in Argentina, including areas such as import license restrictions, negative impacts of export duties and the headwind created by the disconnect between cost inflation and the pace of devaluation of the peso against the dollar. Since the election of Macri as President, we've seen a rapid shift in all of these areas to the benefits of our operations in Ag Solutions and especially Lithium. The devaluation of the peso had a relatively limited impact on our earnings in the quarter in Lithium since the lower cost of operations takes 1 to 2 quarters to work its way out of inventory and into the income statement. And our earnings guidance for 2016 reflects this lower cost of operations. We remain cautiously optimistic that the business environment in Argentina will remain positive and will continue to create opportunities for FMC. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 8. Q1 is historically the period in which we consume the most cash given the seasonal nature of our Ag business. However, discipline around spending, the increased focus last year on sales terms, and of course the ongoing collection measures globally resulted in an improvement of operating cash flow of over $100 million compared to the same quarter last year. Cash flow was helped by higher EBITDA and a better performance around working capital, most notably from collection of receivables. This improvement was seen in all regions.  With certain cash outflows, particularly capital spending and pension expenses also lower than last year, we were able to hold net debt flat during the quarter. 
As noted in our filing of March 28, we elected to amend the debt covenants for our term loan and revolver, deferring the timing of step downs of our leverage ratios such that we retained the covenant limit of 4.5x for Q1. Our actual leverage ratio under the covenant calculation was 4.0x giving the half a turn of headwind that we consider to be prudent. 
Looking to the rest of the year, adjusted cash from operations is forecasted in the range of $450 million to $550 million, an improvement over last year of over 1/3 of the midpoint of the range. This is driven by improvements in both EBITDA and working capital performance. Capital expenditure will remain broadly flat to 2015 in the $120 million to $140 million range.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

So we are not facing significant price increase in carbonate. if it plays the way we expect it to play, and once again, it's going to have to be confirmed. But the way we look at it is, for now, we are producing enough carbonates and buying enough to run our strategy around chloride, butyllithium, metal and hydroxide. And as time will go, we're going to have to sell more hydroxide. We're going to have to increase our capacity in hydroxide. And we'll have to buy more of carbonate on the external  market, which should be at a time when our peer companies will be increasing capacity and making the product more available in the market.

First, let me talk about the ag market as we see it for this year. I think we are not changing our view for 2016. We still believe it's a mid-to-high single digit downmarket, mostly driven by North America and Brazil within -- in the high-teens, and maybe Asia and Europe to the low -- sorry, in the high-single digits, while Europe and Asia would be in the low- to mid-single-digit decrease. So we are not changing our view. It could be maybe trending more toward the high-single digit overall global market. The way -- and why do I feel better about the way we are operating in the ag market? It is not because we are seeing a fundamental change in the market in the short-term. But what I think we are doing at FMC, I think the key difference is that we know better how to operate in this type of market. I can tell you, you see it on our numbers, we are not fighting to keep market share on sales of product. We are much more looking at 3 types of objectives. First, it's very important for us and focusing only on FMC product is to decrease FMC product in the channels. The second aspect is we want to be able, by doing that, to focus more on the quality of the sales, which is more term, price and collection. And then, looking at all of that, the objective is to align more sales with a normal demand pattern. You see that on the numbers in Q1 in North America. Sales down 35%, I think, on page -- on Slide 4, while product on the ground were up above market, 7%. So the way we are operating in the market today, I believe we have more control over our selling process than we might have had in the past when we got hit by the downturn. Beyond that, I would say -- I would not exclude the market to turn around in 2017, but I have no indicators telling me that it will be the case. So I think we are much more focused, Mike, on operating under the current conditions with very high control on term, price, managing very closely with -- in partnership with the customers, our inventory, to create much more predictability in our sales. So that's where the level of confidence, for me, is increasing at this stage. Market turnaround, I think we'll have to wait a little bit more and certainly to go into Q3, Q4 to have more visibility."

I mean, the truth is that the stability or the predictability in the movement in the real is really what matters to us . We've talked about it in the past with regard to the timing of changes and the pace of changes. Q1 and Q2 just aren't really periods in which we have a lot of commercial activity going on in Brazil. So it's really what it does in Q3.  And again, it isn't so much the level -- we've shown that in Q1, where with an average rate of 3.9, today, it's closer to 3.5. We were able to still capture pricing on a limited number of sales that we have in Q1. The question will come in Q3, how stable, how predictable is the real? In the rest of the world, I mean, you look at the forward curves of the currency, it does not feel like a strengthening dollar is what the market is expecting. And so that, generally speaking, is what's factored into our numbers, relative predictability, not a big strengthening of the dollar around the world. Q1 feels like -- when you look at where the dollar is today compared to a year ago, Q1 feels like the last of the quarters that we had those tough FX comps. So subject to any changes away from where the market expects today doesn't feel like currency will be quite the high-level story that it was last year."

Last year, we turned that to corner and sort of stopped the bleeding and improved it a slightly. But this year, we expect that trend to continue so that working capital becomes a positive generator of cash flows. Our biggest focus is always going to be the Brazil receivables balance and getting that receivables balance down. But we're also be very, very focused on inventory levels, our own inventory levels, and making sure that we are very efficient and very thoughtful about what inventory we, where we hold it and how much of it we hold. So it's coming in multiple different areas, but you really should be looking at working capital as the primary driver of the increase in cash flow for 2016."

We're not being willing to do anything to push product in the market if there is not a complete need from this product -- for this product by the market. Space shelves is a word we use a lot. But when you have technical product to be sold, both production know they are needed, and then you have commercial contract with customers. So it is not a situation where because we are aligning ourselves with the market demand that we are taking an enormous risk to see somebody taking our shelf space by the end of the year and not -- us not being able to sell our product.

Today, FMC is a more focused and streamlined company. Our businesses operate in attractive end markets namely agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceuticals and lithium. The actions we have taken over the past 18 months have aligned our operation with regional market demand and positioned each of our businesses to better capitalize on market opportunities. With our transformation complete, we are now solely focused on the execution of our strategy to drive performance in 2016 and beyond.
In Agricultural Solutions, we continue to see the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Ag Solutions was very much an American business. In 2014, more than 3 quarters of its revenues were generated in North and South America. Cheminova significantly increased the size of Ag Solutions operations in Europe and Asia, bringing greater scale and market access to Ag Solutions operations across our region. The increased global scale of operations, combined with actions we have taken in North and South America, will bring greater regional balance to Ag Solutions, aligning our operations with the global crop protection chemical market and limit Ag Solutions' reliance on any one region or market to drive performance.
For example, in 2014, almost 40% of Ag Solutions' revenue was generated in Brazil alone. In 2016, we expect Brazil to account for less than 20% of segment revenue and only 15% of total company revenue. 
Across the global ag market, conditions in the Americas remain the most challenging. With greater scale and regional balance, FMC is able to better manage our business in the Americas to address market conditions. Specifically, we restructured our operation in Brazil to align the size of our business with market conditions and rationalize our product offering to increase our focus on higher-margin, proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products. While these actions reduced our revenues in Brazil, they improved the quality of our operations and enhanced the potential to deliver higher earnings and return on capital.
In North America, we are supporting customer inventory drawdowns to more closely match our sales with underlying grower demand, an important step to further strengthen FMC's position from which to protect price and terms. Cheminova also expanded our product portfolio and technology pipeline and provided the opportunity to realize meaningful cost savings. We are already seeing the benefits of our expanded product portfolio in North America and Europe and the integration of Cheminova is progressing well. We remain on track to deliver the full run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of 2017.
In Health and Nutrition, global demand for FMC's naturally derived ingredients product lines continue to be robust and we remain focused on maintaining the business' high margins through the implementation of manufacturing excellence program, process technology improvements and product differentiation.
In Lithium, we are seeing the benefits of our strategy to focus and grow FMC's business in the technology-driven specialty end market where demand continues to climb and pricing trends across FMC's portfolio remain favorable. I will discuss the performance of each of our businesses shortly and provide an update on our outlook for Q2 and the full year.
First, I will start with a brief review of FMC's consolidated reported results on Slide 2. FMC reported first quarter revenue of approximately $799 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.58 for the quarter was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015 but was towards the top end of our guidance range as a solid performance in Ag Solutions and a very strong quarter from Lithium drove the results.
Turning now to Ag Solutions on Slide 3. Ag Solutions reported revenue of $546 million, a decline of 22% compared to pro forma results for the first quarter of 2015 as lower sales volume in North America and Brazil due to high channel inventories, planned product rationalization and currency headwinds more than offset the impact of price increases, revenue synergies and new product introductions in the quarter.  
As I mentioned previously, we are focused on executing our strategy to drive improved performance. This includes completing the process of rationalizing the Ag Solutions product portfolio that began in 2014. The actions we took to eliminate certain products from our portfolio reduced revenue by approximately $30 million or 4% compared to pro forma revenue for Q1 2015.  However, as discussed in prior quarters, this product rationalization has a limited impact on segment earnings. 
We also remain focused on pricing discipline. At the operating earnings level, price increases implemented in Brazil more than offset the year-over-year impact of the weaker real. However, the broad-based strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in headwinds in Europe and Asia that were only partially offset by price increases.
Despite challenging market conditions, the Ag Solutions business delivered segment earnings of $82 million, ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, and maintained operating margins year-over-year on a pro forma basis. 
I will make a few additional comments regarding regional market condition and Ag Solutions performance now on Slide 4. 
Overall market conditions and our performance in the quarter were very much as expected. In North America, as we discussed on our Q4 earnings call back in February, the deterioration in farm incomes over the past year, combined with elevated channel inventory levels, led distributors and growers to delay purchases of agriculture in foods, including crop protection chemicals. We determined it was critical to maintain price and payment terms in North America this season. And as part of our strategy to achieve these, we believe it was important to allow the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel to reduce. Our decision to allow FMC product inventory in the sales channel to be drawn down was the main factor behind the 35% decline in revenue in North America in the quarter compared to pro forma revenue for the first quarter 2015.
However, we anticipate full year revenue performance for Ag Solutions in North America will be largely in line with the broader North America crop protection market as the action we are taking today will facilitate increased sales in the second half of the year. In fact, the dollar we are seeing give us increased confidence that our approach to managing Ag Solutions business in North America will help protect price and terms in 2016.
Despite lower sales into the channel, FMC continues to gain market share when looking at growers' use of products. Based on independent data, application of FMC products or products on the ground rose 7% in the quarter compared to Q1 2015. In particular, we continue to see strength in FMC's Authority brand pre-emergent herbicide which address the growing number of soybean acres which exhibit glyphosate resistance. 
As a result, we are confident the reduction in revenue  in Q1 is due more to a decision as when to sell than it is to any change in underlying demand for FMC products. And it is this strong, grower demand for FMC's portfolio of technical products which will ultimately provide the support for pricing and terms as we are -- that we are focused on.
In addition, we continue to see demand by growers for new innovative and differentiated products that provide high-value end use. Recent product launches in FMC in core herbicide and the introduction of our expanded fungicide product offering as a result of the Cheminova acquisition received strong support from growers and distributors in the quarter. We also saw strong acceptance of our new biological and [indiscernible] product combinations, including brand such as Capture, VGR and Ethos XB.
In Latin America, revenue declined approximately 25% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Lower demand and planned product rationalizations in Brazil more than offset increased sales volume in the rest of Latin America.  Excluding this portfolio rationalization, sales in Latin America declined approximately 15%, in line with the overall market. 
Market conditions in Brazil were a little changed from the fourth quarter of 2015. Channel inventory levels have improved but remain elevated, most notably in soybean insecticide in the northern states. However, we are seeing an increase in demand in the north for insecticide, such as FMC's Talisman to address secondary pest pressure in soybeans. 
In Southern Brazil, market conditions are improved, especially in sugarcane and certain niche crops such as coffee and citrus. We continue to remain disciplined on pricing in Brazil. As we have explained previously, greater stability in the Brazilian real to U.S. dollar exchange rate supports price increase to offset FX headwinds. Paul will comment further on the impact of foreign currencies later in the call. 
Outside of Brazil, we continue to see increasing demand for pre-emergent herbicides in Argentina and products for niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. In Argentina, we see improved conditions with far fewer restrictions on imports and with the leasing of export taxes for key crops. 
In Europe, sales declined approximately 11% as foreign exchange headwinds and lower market volume more than offset commercial synergies from the Cheminova transaction and new product launches in the quarter. A cold snap at the end of the winter impacted the season in certain Western European markets, and we have seen some tightening of demand by growers in an attempt to control costs in the face of persistently low grain prices. Strong demand in Central and Eastern Europe and FMC's transition to Cheminova's direct market access model in Europe partially offset the pullback in market activity in the quarter.
Sales volumes across Europe increased for FMC's legal portfolio, including herbicide and insecticide for cereals. With the benefit of a broader combined portfolio, we believe the business is well-positioned to address market demand in key crops, including cereals and all alginate [ph]. 
Profitability in the region improved meaningfully year-over-year as the move to direct market access, combined with other cost savings from the Cheminova integration, increased operating margins in Europe by about 200 basis points. 
In Asia, we saw increased demand in China and Australia. However, the stronger U.S. dollar, combined with planned product rationalization and poor weather in India and Southeast Asia resulted in a 13% decline in pro forma revenue compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of currency and planned product rationalization, revenue decreased about 3% driven largely by lower sales volume in India.
Globally, we expect the challenging market conditions to persist for the remainder of the year. As previously stated, we believe the global crop protection chemicals market will decline by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis, driven largely by market conditions in North America and Brazil.  We remain highly focused on decreasing FMC product inventory levels in the channel, holding on price and term and increasing collections of accounts receivable. 
Our full year guidance for Ag Solutions remains unchanged. We continue to forecast full year revenue of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion and full year segment earnings in the range of $380 million to $420 million. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver segment earnings in the range of $90 million to $110 million, along with sequential margin improvement as we move toward the main selling season in North America and Europe. 
Turning next to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. First quarter performance for Health and Nutrition was broadly in line with expectation. The business reported revenue of $192 million and segment earnings of $47 million. First quarter 2016 revenue declined approximately $19 million compared to the first quarter of last year. 
As discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, last year's first quarter revenue included certain omega-3 sales which were not expected to occur in 2016. These sales relate principally to pharmaceutical API products and account for a decline in the revenue compared to the prior year period.  Excluding these sales volume and the impact of currency, revenue was essentially flat compared to last year. 
Global demand for FMC's health excipient products continues to grow, resulting in higher sales volume of minor and [indiscernible] products in the quarter. However, lower sales in functional health due to timing and the more competitive omega-3 pricing environment broadly offset the increase in health excipient revenue. 
For the first quarter 2016, Health and Nutrition reported segment earnings of $47 million while lower operating costs resulted in an increase in segment earnings margin to 24.6%. 
Looking forward, we continue to expect full year revenue in the range of $775 million and $825 million, and segment earnings of between $198 million and $208 million, driven principally by continued growth in demand for MCC-based health excipients and nutritional ingredients in North America and Asia and lower operating cost from ongoing manufacturing excellence program and process technology improvement. 
We expect Health and Nutrition second quarter segment earnings of between $49 million and $53 million with a sequential improvement in segment earnings margin in the quarter.
Turning to Lithium on Slide 6. Lithium delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, revenue increased 8% to $60 million and segment earnings almost threefold to $14.9 million. Segment's operating margin climbed from under 10% last year in Q1 to almost 25% this quarter. These results reflect the impact of our strategy to focus on the downstream specialty markets.  As a result of our advantaged process technology and ability to manage sales mix, FMC is uniquely positioned to serve the higher growth and higher-value specialty segments while maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate and chloride.
Demand trends across specialty end markets remain strong. Demand for lithium hydroxide for energy storage and electric vehicle, or EV applications, continues to grow at double-digit rates. Our success in increasing throughput from our existing hydroxide asset allow FMC to deliver higher sales volume in the quarter. In addition, we managed our production mix in order to optimize our sales of butyllithium and high-purity lithium minerals. 
Favorable market conditions supported price increases across the FMC portfolio. We continue to realize price increases for lithium hydroxide, while our approach to the carbonate and chloride market is allowing us to achieve meaningful price increases from this limited sales volume. The extent to which carbonate and chloride prices remain elevated will depend on how quickly new supply comes online. We expect market supply of all product to remain tight in the near to midterm.
Lower operating cost, coupled with higher specialty sales volume and price increases, resulted in significant increases in segment earnings and margins in the quarter. Manufacturing efficiencies from ongoing process improvement initiatives and lower cost associated with the natural gas pipeline installed in 2015 reduced operating cost by more than $5 million year-over-year, helping to drive the increased operating margin in the quarter. 
We expect the second quarter to be another strong period for the Lithium business. We continue to shift our sales mix to grow our specialty product line, serving markets such as UVs [ph] and polymers while capitalizing on favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate. However, we expect to have slightly lower available carbonate volumes in Q2 compared to Q1, as a result of lower seasonal production in Argentina.
Consequently, we expect quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $10 million to $14 million and segment earnings margin in the range of 19% to 20%. Based on Lithium performance to date and our expectation for the remainder of 2016, we are raising our full year outlook for the Lithium business. We now expect full year revenue to be between $245 million and $265 million and segment earnings to be in the range of $43 million to $53 million, up $10 million from the prior range. 
Moving next to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 7. I previously commented on the outlook for each business for both Q2 and the full year. As I mentioned, we are maintaining segment earnings guidance for the full year for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition. Segment earnings guidance for the second quarter reflect normal earnings level for these businesses based on our expectation for 2016. We are increasing the full year segment earnings guidance for Lithium, as stated earlier. 
On a consolidated basis, we are increasing full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 versus previous guidance to a range of $2.55 to $2.85, and we expect second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings to be between $0.62 and $0.72 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results, including taxes, foreign exchange and cash flow."

Our adjusted effective tax rate fell from 27.5% in the first quarter 2015 to 26% in Q1 '16. Part of this was the continued change in the mix of our earnings, away from the U.S. and Brazil and towards Europe and Asia where rates are typically lower. We continue to take steps to increase our tax efficiency and expect that the full year rate will come in somewhere in the 24% to 26% range. 
A theme in our earnings in recent quarters has been the impact of foreign currency movements, and the movement in the Brazilian real has been a particular area of focus. In the first quarter, the average rate of the real to the dollar was 3.9, significantly weaker than the 2.87 average of the same quarter a year ago. However, the total impact on our earnings was far less than we have seen in prior quarters for 2 main reasons. First, as you know, Q1 is not a large selling quarter for us in Brazil, reducing the impact of currency move. Also, since we have not seen particularly volatile movements in the currency, our price list has been able to reflect the new currency levels for the entire quarter. As a result, the $13 million headwind created by the weaker real year-on-year was completely offset by price increases. In fact, the positive impact of the weaker real on our cost base meant the change in the real was actually a net positive to our income statement in Q1. 
Looking to the rest of the world, although a number of Asian currencies collectively reduced earnings, the only major currency in which we faced a headwind in the quarter was the euro, which devalued by 2% versus the same period last year. The net hit to operating earnings from currency movements in the quarter was approximately $14 million. 
A second common theme on our earnings has also been the challenges of operating in Argentina, including areas such as import license restrictions, negative impacts of export duties and the headwind created by the disconnect between cost inflation and the pace of devaluation of the peso against the dollar. Since the election of Macri as President, we've seen a rapid shift in all of these areas to the benefits of our operations in Ag Solutions and especially Lithium. The devaluation of the peso had a relatively limited impact on our earnings in the quarter in Lithium since the lower cost of operations takes 1 to 2 quarters to work its way out of inventory and into the income statement. And our earnings guidance for 2016 reflects this lower cost of operations. We remain cautiously optimistic that the business environment in Argentina will remain positive and will continue to create opportunities for FMC. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 8. Q1 is historically the period in which we consume the most cash given the seasonal nature of our Ag business. However, discipline around spending, the increased focus last year on sales terms, and of course the ongoing collection measures globally resulted in an improvement of operating cash flow of over $100 million compared to the same quarter last year. Cash flow was helped by higher EBITDA and a better performance around working capital, most notably from collection of receivables. This improvement was seen in all regions.  With certain cash outflows, particularly capital spending and pension expenses also lower than last year, we were able to hold net debt flat during the quarter. 
As noted in our filing of March 28, we elected to amend the debt covenants for our term loan and revolver, deferring the timing of step downs of our leverage ratios such that we retained the covenant limit of 4.5x for Q1. Our actual leverage ratio under the covenant calculation was 4.0x giving the half a turn of headwind that we consider to be prudent. 
Looking to the rest of the year, adjusted cash from operations is forecasted in the range of $450 million to $550 million, an improvement over last year of over 1/3 of the midpoint of the range. This is driven by improvements in both EBITDA and working capital performance. Capital expenditure will remain broadly flat to 2015 in the $120 million to $140 million range.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

But the way we look at it is, for now, we are producing enough carbonates and buying enough to run our strategy around chloride, butyllithium, metal and hydroxide. And as time will go, we're going to have to sell more hydroxide. We're going to have to increase our capacity in hydroxide.

First, let me talk about the ag market as we see it for this year. I think we are not changing our view for 2016. We still believe it's a mid-to-high single digit downmarket, mostly driven by North America and Brazil within -- in the high-teens, and maybe Asia and Europe to the low -- sorry, in the high-single digits, while Europe and Asia would be in the low- to mid-single-digit decrease. So we are not changing our view. It could be maybe trending more toward the high-single digit overall global market. The way -- and why do I feel better about the way we are operating in the ag market? It is not because we are seeing a fundamental change in the market in the short-term. But what I think we are doing at FMC, I think the key difference is that we know better how to operate in this type of market. I can tell you, you see it on our numbers, we are not fighting to keep market share on sales of product. We are much more looking at 3 types of objectives. First, it's very important for us and focusing only on FMC product is to decrease FMC product in the channels. The second aspect is we want to be able, by doing that, to focus more on the quality of the sales, which is more term, price and collection. And then, looking at all of that, the objective is to align more sales with a normal demand pattern. You see that on the numbers in Q1 in North America. Sales down 35%, I think, on page -- on Slide 4, while product on the ground were up above market, 7%. So the way we are operating in the market today, I believe we have more control over our selling process than we might have had in the past when we got hit by the downturn. Beyond that, I would say -- I would not exclude the market to turn around in 2017, but I have no indicators telling me that it will be the case. So I think we are much more focused, Mike, on operating under the current conditions with very high control on term, price, managing very closely with -- in partnership with the customers, our inventory, to create much more predictability in our sales. So that's where the level of confidence, for me, is increasing at this stage. Market turnaround, I think we'll have to wait a little bit more and certainly to go into Q3, Q4 to have more visibility."

I mean, the truth is that the stability or the predictability in the movement in the real is really what matters to us . We've talked about it in the past with regard to the timing of changes and the pace of changes. Q1 and Q2 just aren't really periods in which we have a lot of commercial activity going on in Brazil. So it's really what it does in Q3.  And again, it isn't so much the level -- we've shown that in Q1, where with an average rate of 3.9, today, it's closer to 3.5. We were able to still capture pricing on a limited number of sales that we have in Q1. The question will come in Q3, how stable, how predictable is the real? In the rest of the world, I mean, you look at the forward curves of the currency, it does not feel like a strengthening dollar is what the market is expecting. And so that, generally speaking, is what's factored into our numbers, relative predictability, not a big strengthening of the dollar around the world. Q1 feels like -- when you look at where the dollar is today compared to a year ago, Q1 feels like the last of the quarters that we had those tough FX comps. So subject to any changes away from where the market expects today doesn't feel like currency will be quite the high-level story that it was last year."

Our biggest focus is always going to be the Brazil receivables balance and getting that receivables balance down. But we're also be very, very focused on inventory levels, our own inventory levels, and making sure that we are very efficient and very thoughtful about what inventory we hold, where we hold it and how much of it we hold.

As you can see on the first slide, for the second quarter of 2016, FMC reported revenue of $810 million and adjusted operating profit of $143 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.69 was $0.01 below the second quarter of 2015, but above the mid-point of our guidance range. 
Ag Solutions delivered another solid quarter and it continues to realize the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Lithium outperformed on higher sales volumes and higher realized prices across the portfolio with lower operating cost from ongoing Manufacturing Excellence program.
Earnings in Health and Nutrition were below expectations as results in omega-3 were significantly weaker than anticipated. Based on our performance to date and the outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. I will provide more detail on how that breaks down across each of the businesses shortly. But first, I will discuss second quarter results for each of our 3 segments, starting with Ag Solutions on Slide 2.
Overall, market conditions and our performance in the quarter were in line with our prior expectations. We remained focus on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel and on maintaining discipline on price and terms. We also took actions needed to complete the product rationalization that began in late 2014. 
For the second quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $515 million and segment earnings of $101 million, slightly ahead of the mid-point of our guidance range. Revenue declined 19% compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely due to lower sales volume, unfavorable weather conditions in Europe and Asia, the drawdown of channel inventory by customers in most regions and planned product rationalization all contributed to the decline in volume in the quarter.
Excluding planned product rationalization, revenue declined broadly in line with the crop protection market as a whole. Segment earnings declined 14% compared to 2015, as the impact of lower sales volumes, less favorable product mix in Asia and North America and the stronger U.S. dollar were partially offset by lower operating cost. Compared to pro forma results from Q2 last year, operating margin increased 100 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, the elimination of sales of low-margin products due to portfolio rationalization and cost savings from the Cheminova integration.
As we move to Slide 3, I will first need a few comments on the global crop protection market, then I will move to review FMC's performance by region and discuss the outlook for Q3 and the full year. So first, the market.
Overall, conditions in the global crop protection market were as expected and it will change from Q1. In North America, soft commodity prices continue to put pressure on some incomes resulting in more cautious bang behavior by growers and elevated inventory levels across the channel. 
In Europe, unfavorable weather conditions early in the quarter, most notably in Central and Western Europe, reduced market demand, leading to lower volumes and increased channel inventory in certain countries. In Brazil, channel inventory across the market remained elevated, especially for insecticide. And while foreign exchange rate have been more stable, growers continue to be negatively impacted by a lack of credit availability.
In Asia, weather conditions were poor across most of the region resulting in weaker market demand. We believe these challenging market conditions will persist for the remainder of the year and we still forecast that the global crop protection chemical market will decline by mid to high single-digit percent in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis. I will now discuss FMC's performance in light of these market conditions.
First, let me address the lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter. Market in Asia and Europe were weaker than expected, but the main driver of the lower revenue is a more successful and aggressive product rationalization. 
We continue to manage the quality of our sales in order to protect margins, earnings and working capital. In North America, our strategy remained one of the standing price and terms, allowing the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel to reduce. Although we see point of view that inventory of FMC products in the channel is declining. Reflecting the benefits of the actions we took early in the season to reduce inventory of FMC product in the channel, sales in Q2 increased 5%. We saw strong demand for FMC's authority brand of pre-emergent soybean herbicide and independent data show that the authority brand has taken market share this year. We also saw grower support for the extended fungicide products we can now offer as a result of the Cheminova acquisition.
In Europe, revenue declined by 19%, driven largely by poor weather conditions and reduced volume due to the planned product rationalization, as well as the impact of transitioning to a direct market access model. However, the product rationalization and move to direct market access have resulted in improved operating margins in the region.
In Latin America, revenue declined 43%, primarily as a result of steps we took to reduce the level of FMC product inventory in the South channel in Brazil. We were great by our ability to recover U.S. dollar pricing in the quarter. While not matching to overall segment performance, given the seasonally lower sales volume, realized price increased in Brazil more than offset the negative impact of FX on a reported revenue.
In Asia, the combination of poor weather condition, further portfolio rationalization and the stronger U.S. dollar caused revenue to decline 22% compared to the second quarter last year. Moving on to the outlook for Ag Solutions. 
Our full year segment earnings guidance remains unchanged at $380 million to $420 million. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $80 million and $90 million. At the mid-point of guidance, second half segment earnings will increase by approximately 35% compared to 2015, driven by improved performance in Brazil and Latin America and additional cost savings from the Cheminova integration. The steps we have already taken to rationalize our product portfolio and reduce the level of FMC inventory in the channel, in the sales channel, leave us well-positioned as we enter the 2016, 2017 crop season in the Americas.
The relative stability of the Brazilian real over the past few months gives us increased confidence in our ability to recapture price despite tightening credit condition from growers and weak market demand as channel inventory levels decline. We expect full year segment earnings margin to be between 17% and 18%, which at the mid-point, represents more than 250 basis points of improvement compared to 2015 driven by more favorable mix, improved pricing in Brazil and realization of cost savings. We remain on track to deliver the incremental cost savings target of $60 million to $70 million in 2016 and the full run rate cost saving of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of next year.
Moving on to Health and Nutrition on Slide 4. The business reported second quarter segment revenue of $195 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined approximately 6% and earnings declined approximately 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by worse-than-expected performance of omega-3. The headwinds we saw in omega-3 over the past year increased in the second quarter. Specifically, prices and volumes were much lower than anticipated. There is significant overcapacity in the industry, which, combined with lower demand for higher products, acceptance even greater pressure on prices than we saw earlier in the year. 
We have seen new entrants with business at prices that are close to cash cost of production, resulting in considerably lower volume for our products in several key area. We have aggressively taken costs out of this business with 6 cost falling by almost 40%. We continue to pursue new opportunities for high-end cost alteration products, but do not expect to recover these lost volumes this year and do not anticipate the change in pricing levels any time soon.
Excluding omega-3, results were in line with expectations. In nutritional ingredients, volumes in the quarter were slightly below Q2 2015, largely due to timing as orders shifted to the second half of the year. In health excipients, sales volumes increased in all key pharmaceutical market.
Given performance to date in omega-3 and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are lowering our guidance for Health and Nutrition. We now expect full year segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $196 million, roughly flat with 2015, and third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $44 million to $48 million. We continue to expect operating margins of approximately 25% for the full year. helped by lower operating cost and improved production yields.
Turning next to retail on Slide 5.  Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $63 million and segment earnings more than tripled to $16.5 million. Lithium's performance reflect a success of FMC strategy of constructing lithium carbonate into higher value downstream specialty product supported by strong pressure performance especially in Argentina in our hydroxide facility.
Higher sales volume, higher average prices in all major product categories, improved mix and lower operating costs, all contributed to deliver segment earnings above the top end of our prior guidance range and push segment earnings margin to over 26% in the quarter.
We expect supply/demand conditions to remain tight for the remainder of the year as previously announced capacity expansions across industry have been slow to come online. This reinforces our confidence in favorable pricing conditions to the remainder of 2016. 
For the full year, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $58 million to $66 million, an increase at the mid-point of approximately 30% compared to prior guidance and nearly 3x segment earnings in 2015. Higher prices and lower operating costs compared to last year will support operating margins in the range of 24% to 25% for the year.
We expect third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $13 million to $17 million as the benefit of higher prices will be partially offset by seasonally lower production at our operations in Argentina. FMC's Lithium business is positioned to deliver significant earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In May, we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30,000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our customers starting with a 4,000 metric ton expansion scheduled to come online in 2017.
Last week, we announced we will accelerate that capacity expansion and we now expect 8,000 metric tons to come online by the middle of 2017. We continue to evaluate the turning or further capacity expansion and expect the entire 20,000 metric ton of additional capacity to be online by 2017. We believe we will more than double the revenue and earnings of our Lithium business between 2016 and 2020, resulting in over 20% per year growth through the rest of this decade.
We recognize that our hydroxide investment plans require us to have cost-effective access to sufficient lithium carbonate. Our current carbonate capacity is sufficient to support the expansion in FMC's hydroxide production to at least 2018. 
Beyond this, we are actively pursuing multiple task to ensure we are not carbonate constrained. First, we have several low options to debottleneck our Argentina operations, potentially adding 20% capacity. Second, we are in ongoing discussions with multiple carbonate producers. We have announced plans to add capacity in the coming years and are exploring mutually beneficial long-term supply agreement or trouble partnerships. And of course, we retained the option to add significant capacity at our operation, our existing operation in Argentina beyond the debottlenecking I just mentioned. Consequently, we are highly confident that access to lithium carbonate will not be a constrain in our ability to extend our hydroxide business in the coming years.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 6. As I mentioned, we are maintaining full year segment earnings for Ag Solutions and adjusting our full year earnings expectation for both Health and Nutrition and lithium. As a result, on a consolidated basis, we are increasing full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 at the mid-point to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.63. I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results."

As usual, I'll start with the income statement and specifically, the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, giving us a small benefit this quarter compared to Q2 last year.
This lowered late is largely due to the continued change in the mix of our earnings away from high tax jurisdictions, such as the U.S, towards regions were tax rates are lower. Foreign exchange was not a major factor in our results this quarter with the stronger dollar mainly impacting the Ag Solutions segment. 
Various Asian currencies,  plus the Mexican peso, was due the drivers of the FX headwinds in the quarter. The second quarter is not a period of significant activity in Brazil. And therefore, the recent strengthening of the year are have a limited impact in our financials in the quarter. However, with an FX rate in the quarter that was weaker than the same period of last year and with the price list that largely reflective of current spot rate, the combined effect of price and currency in Brazil was a net positive to our second quarter earnings.
Looking into the second half of the year. The recent stability in the real U.S. dollar exchange rate means that the assumptions regarding the future exchange rate that has underpinned our guidance is unchanged. To remind you, our guidance has assumed that we have a real to U.S. the dollar rate that is relatively stable with no major short-term swings in the FX rate, combined with a price list that largely reflects the prevailing spots exchange rate. 
Sitting here today, both of those assumptions remain unchanged. And therefore, we do not expect is very positive or negative impact on our second half performance from the real-FX rate compared to our previous guidance provided these conditions hold.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. We continue to make progress in increasing our cash generation while maintaining discipline on capital spending. For the first half of the year, our adjusted cash from operations was 40% higher than the first half of last year, driven primarily by stronger working capital performance. 
We remain on target to meet our outlook for the full year of $450 million to $550 million of adjusted cash from operations. Net debt fell by $90 million compared to the first quarter and by over $120 million since the start of the year. 
The second quarter is important period for us in terms of cash collections in Brazil. We remain very focused on the credit capacity of our customers, particularly given the constrained access to third-party financing for Brazilian growers. This has an impact on both our ability to collect cash from customers and our willingness to continue to extend credit in the form of new sales. 
On the first point, we were pleased with our performance in collecting in Brazil, with net cash collections slightly ahead of our expectations and particularly good progress in collecting from our past due balances. As a result, we saw meaningful reduction in our Brazil receivables balance. However, it is still significantly higher than we would like and we will remain focused on reducing our exposure in the coming quarters.
The credit tightness in Brazil has been an important factor for us for several quarters now, but our willingness to extend credit to certain segments of the market reduced. As we head into the key second half selling season in Brazil, our guidance reflects the disciplined approach to credit exposure. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

And before I continue with my remarks, let me correct a statement I made. The 20,000 ton of additional lithium hydroxide capacity is to be online by 2019, not as I say 2017.
So to continue and to conclude. I am very pleased with the overall execution of our strategy and improved outlook for the year. Despite ongoing challenges facing the agricultural industry, our strategy and the actions we have taken in the back half of 2015 and the first half of 2016 give us strong confidence in the performance for the remainder of the year. 
We have remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel, maintain discipline on price and term, aggressively manage our mix by rationalizing our product line leading to stronger margins. This strategy, combined with a successful integration of Cheminova and the more benign FX situation, have increased the predictability of our business and will drive the second half performance of Ag Solutions with earnings up 35% compared to pro forma results for 2015.
We are investing in our technology roadmap in order to offer unique value-added solutions to our customers. We see higher acceptance rates for our new products launches, including our theological platform, and remain on track to introduce our new active ingredients pipeline starting in 2017.
Lithium continues to deliver strong performance altering its product mix and increasing output to meet growing market demand. FMC's focused strategy has enabled the business to take advantage of favorable market conditions to rely significant earnings growth in 2016. Our announced capacity expansion strengthens FMC's leadership position in lithium hydroxide and specialty lithium application and will deliver further growth in the years to come.
Health and Nutrition had a weaker-than-expected quarter. However, the business continues to generate high margins and return and demand across key nutritional and pharmaceutical market will support growth over the second half of the year.
Finally, we are generating increased operating cash flow to improve our balance sheet. We are on track to increase adjusted cash from operations by approximately 40% in 2016. 
I thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions."

So we've seen part of it and we're going to keep on seeing it. It's usually due to the fact that it is winter. There is more rainy season right now in Argentina where we're operating. So it's not only a Q2 phenomenon, it's a back of Q2, early Q3. I think the visibility we have today due to our production is quite, quite correct that the earnings level. Mainly, there is multiple reasons, which have been leading the improve of earnings. First of all, the mix. We are moving more business to all of lithium hydroxide, where we've been able to operate our plants quite, quite well and where there is a healthy demand and pricing situation. Second of all, our plants have been operating also very well for carbonate production and we have been -- and we are continuing to do that for the second half, selling more product made within the company than third-party product we would resell. And then there is some volume. So if I look at the second half of the year, I think our earnings is quite in line with our expectation. I don't think there is a light of upside. Most likely what you will see is we decided not to change the revenue range because we are a little bit below the middle point of the range initially. Looking to demand for back half of the year, it's most likely to lead us to where they higher range from a revenue standpoint. But I believe we have forecasted in lithium for Q3, Q4 are correct, unless, less, I'd say the only place where I could see upside but it is not possible for us to predict that today is pricing. Pricing is always something, depending upon demand, and how capacity, come on stream. So that one, we've made some assumption, you never know."

Cheminova, this is segment to a different difference. Cheminova did not have a different approach to working capital than anybody else in the industry. They did have a different approach to heavily finance that working capital. And to be blunt, as a weak balance sheet company with very unsophisticated treasury operations, they used to be some very, very expensive local financing a result, which can you the present are there to reducing the working capital.

So today, we have an improved view and more certain view of what lithium hydroxide is doing. But on the work we've done in the last 2 years was to develop a manufacturing process allowing us to follow the demand growth. Which means that if the growth is not as we're expecting, we can stop 1 or 2 of these modules manufacturing and slowdown the capacity increase we have planned. If the demand becomes more aggressive, very easy for us to speed up the building of those modules. So first, your question, yes, we have increased confidence.

As you can see on the first slide for the second quarter of 2016, FMC reported revenue of $810 million and adjusted operating profit of $143 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.69 was $0.01 below the second quarter of",2115,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the first slide for the second quarter of 2016, FMC reported revenue of $810 million and adjusted operating profit of $143 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.69 was $0.01 below the second quarter of 2015, but above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Ag Solutions delivered another solid quarter and it continues to realize the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Lithium outperformed on higher sales and volumes, and higher realized prices across the portfolio with lower operating cost from ongoing manufacturing excellence program.
Earnings in Health and Nutrition were below expectation as results in omega-3 were significantly weaker than anticipated. Based on our performance to date and the outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. I will provide more details on how that breaks down across each of the businesses shortly. But first, I will discuss second quarter results for each of our 3 segments, starting with Ag Solutions on Slide 2.
Overall, market condition and our performance in the quarter were in line with our prior expectations. We remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel and on maintaining discipline on price and terms. We also took actions needed to complete the product rationalization that began in late 2014.
For the second quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $515 million and segment earnings of $101 million, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue declined 19% compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely due to lower sales volume, unfavorable weather conditions in Europe and Asia, the drawdown of channel inventory by customers in most regions and planned product rationalization all contributed to the decline in volume in the quarter.
Excluding planned product rationalization, revenue declined broadly in line with the crop protection market as a whole. Segment earnings declined 14% compared to 2015 as the impact of lower sales volumes, less favorable product mix in Asia and North America and the stronger U.S. dollar were partially offset by lower operating cost. Compared to pro forma results from Q2 last year, operating margin increased 100 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, the elimination of sales of low-margin products due to portfolio rationalization and cost savings from the Cheminova integration.
As we move to Slide 3, I will first give a few comments on the global crop protection market then I will move on to review FMC's performance by region and discuss the outlook for Q3 and the full year. So first, the market.
Overall, conditions in the global crop protection market were as expected little changed from Q1. In North America, soft commodity prices continue to put pressure on some incomes resulting in more cautious buying behavior by growers and elevated inventory levels across the channel.
In Europe, unfavorable weather conditions early in the quarter, most notably in Central and Western Europe, reduced market demand, leading to lower volumes and increased channel inventory in certain countries. In Brazil, channel inventory across the market remained elevated, especially for insecticides. And while foreign exchange rates have been more stable, growers continue to be negatively impacted by a lack of credit availability.
In Asia, weather conditions were poor across most of the region resulting in weaker market demand. We believe these challenging market conditions will persist for the remainder of the year and we still forecast that the global crop protection chemical market will decline by mid- to high single-digit percent in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis. I will now discuss FMC's performance in light of these market conditions.
First, let me address the lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter. Markets in Asia and Europe were weaker than expected, but the main driver of the lower revenue is a more successful and aggressive product rationalization.
We continue to manage the quality of our sales in order to protect margins, earnings and working capital. In North America, our strategy remained one of the standing price and terms, allowing the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel to reduce. All the data we see support our view that inventory of FMC products in the channel is declining. Reflecting the benefits of the actions we took early in the season, to reduce inventory of FMC product in the channel, sales in Q2 increased 5%. We saw strong demand for FMC's Authority brand of pre-emergent soybean herbicide and independent data show that the Authority brand has taken market share this year. We also saw grower support for the extended fungicide products we can now offer as a result of the Cheminova acquisition.
In Europe, revenue declined by 19%, driven largely by poor weather conditions and reduced volume due to the planned product rationalization as well as the impact of transitioning to a direct market access model. However, the product rationalization and move to direct market access have resulted in improved operating margins in the region.
In Latin America, revenue declined 43%, primarily as a result of steps we took to reduce the level of FMC product inventory in the south channel in Brazil. We were encouraged by our ability to recover U.S. dollar pricing in the quarter. While not matching to overall segment performance, given the seasonally lower sales volume, realized price increase in Brazil more than offset the negative impact of FX on a reported revenue.
In Asia, the combination of poor weather condition, further portfolio rationalization and a stronger U.S. dollar caused revenue to decline 22% compared to the second quarter last year. Moving on to the outlook for Ag Solutions.
Our full year segment earnings guidance remains unchanged at $380 million to $420 million. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $80 million and $90 million. At the midpoint of guidance, second half segment earnings will increase by approximately 35% compared to 2015, driven by improved performance in Brazil and Latin America and additional cost savings from the Cheminova integration. The steps we have already taken to rationalize our product portfolio and reduce the level of FMC inventory in the channel, in the sales channel, leave us well positioned as we enter the 2016, 2017 crop season in the Americas.
The relative stability of the Brazilian real over the past few months gives us increased confidence in our ability to recapture price despite tightening credit condition from growers and weak market demand as channel inventory levels decline. We expect full year segment earnings margin to be between 17% and 18%, which at the midpoint represents more than 250 basis points of improvement compared to 2015 driven by more favorable mix, improved pricing in Brazil and realization of cost savings. We remain on track to deliver the incremental cost savings target of $60 million to $70 million in 2016 and the full run rate cost saving of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of next year.
Moving on to Health and Nutrition on Slide 4. The business reported second quarter segment revenue of $195 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined approximately 6% and earnings declined approximately 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by worse-than-expected performance of omega-3. The headwinds we saw in omega-3 over the past year increased in the second quarter. Specifically, prices and volumes were much lower than anticipated. There is significant overcapacity in the industry, which, combined with lower demand for higher concentration products has exerted even greater pressure on prices than we saw earlier in the year. 
We have seen new entrants with business at prices that are close to cash cost of production, resulting in considerably lower volume for our products in certain key areas. We have aggressively taken costs out of this business with fixed cost falling by almost 40%. We continue to pursue new opportunities for high-end cost alteration products, but do not expect to recover these lost volumes this year and do not anticipate the change in pricing levels any time soon.
Excluding omega-3, results were in line with expectations. In nutritional ingredients, volumes in the quarter were slightly below Q2 2015, largely due to timing as orders shifted to the second half of the year. In health excipients, sales volumes increased in all key pharmaceutical markets.
Given performance to date in omega-3 and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are lowering our guidance for Health and Nutrition. We now expect full year segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $196 million, roughly flat with 2015, and third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $44 million to $48 million. We continue to expect operating margins of approximately 25% for the full year helped by lower operating cost and improved production yields.
Turning next to retail on Slide 5.  Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $63 million and segment earnings more than tripled to $16.5 million. Lithium's performance reflect a success of FMC strategy of converting lithium carbonate into higher value downstream specialty product supported by strong manufacturing performance, especially in Argentina in our Bessemer City Hydroxide Facility.
Higher sales volume, higher average prices in all major product categories, improved mix and lower operating costs, all contributed to deliver segment earnings above the top end of our prior guidance range and push segment earnings margin to over 26% in the quarter.
We expect supply/demand conditions to remain tight for the remainder of the year as previously announced capacity expansions across industry have been slow to come online. This reinforces our confidence in favorable pricing conditions through the remainder of 2016.
For the full year, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $58 million to $66 million, an increase at the midpoint of approximately 30% compared to prior guidance and nearly 3x segment earnings in 2015. Higher prices and lower operating costs compared to last year will support operating margins in the range of 24% to 25% for the year.
We expect third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $13 million to $17 million as the benefit of higher prices will be partially offset by seasonally lower production at our operations in Argentina. 
FMC's Lithium business is positioned to deliver significant earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In May, we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30,000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our customers starting with a 4,000 metric ton expansion scheduled to come online in 2017.
Last week, we announced we will accelerate that capacity expansion and we now expect 8,000 metric tons to come online by the middle of 2017. We continue to evaluate the turning or further capacity expansion and expect the entire 20,000 metric ton of additional capacity to be online by 2017. We believe, we will more than double the revenue and earnings of our Lithium business between 2016 and 2020, resulting in over 20% per year growth through the rest of this decade.
We recognize that our hydroxide investment plans require us to have cost-effective access to sufficient lithium carbonate. Our current carbonate capacity is sufficient to support the expansion in FMC's hydroxide production to at least 2018.
Beyond this, we are actively pursuing multiple tasks to ensure we are not carbonate constrained. First, we have several low capital options to debottleneck our Argentina operations, potentially adding 20% capacity. Second, we are in ongoing discussions with multiple carbonate producers. We have announced plans to add capacity in the coming years and are exploring mutually beneficial long-term supply agreement or strategic partnerships. And of course, we retained the option to add significant capacity at our operation, our existing operation in Argentina beyond the debottlenecking I just mentioned. Consequently, we are highly confident that access to lithium carbonate will not be a constrain in our ability to extend our hydroxide business in the coming years.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 6. As I mentioned, we are maintaining full year segment earnings for Ag Solutions and adjusting our full year earnings expectation for both Health and Nutrition and lithium. As a result, on a consolidated basis, we are increasing full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.63. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results."

Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, giving us a small benefit this quarter compared to Q2 l",611,"Thank you, Pierre. As usual, I'll start with the income statement and specifically of the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, giving us a small benefit this quarter compared to Q2 last year.
This lowered rate is largely due to the continued change in the mix of our earnings away from high tax jurisdictions, such as the U.S., towards regions where tax rates are lower. Foreign exchange was not a major factor in our results this quarter with the stronger dollar, mainly impacting the Ag Solutions segment.
Various Asian currencies plus the Mexican peso were the drivers of the FX headwind in the quarter. The second quarter is not a period of significant activity in Brazil. And therefore, the recent strengthening of the reais had a limited impact on our financials in the quarter. However, with an FX rate in the quarter that was weaker than the same period of last year, and with the price list that largely reflect to the current spot rate, the combined effect of price and currency in Brazil was a net positive to our second quarter earnings.
Looking into the second half of the year. The recent stability in the reais-U.S. dollar exchange rate means that the assumptions regarding the future exchange rate that has underpinned our guidance is unchanged. To remind you, our guidance has assumed that we have a reais to U.S. dollar rate that is relatively stable with no major short-term swings in the FX rate, combined with a price list that largely reflects the prevailing spot exchange rate.
Sitting here today, both of those assumptions remain unchanged. And therefore, we do not expect either a positive or negative impact on our second half performance from the reais-FX rate compared to our previous guidance, provided these conditions hold.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. We continue to make progress in increasing our cash generation while maintaining discipline on capital spending. For the first half of the year, our adjusted cash from operations was 40% higher than the first half of last year, driven primarily by stronger working capital performance.
We remain on target to meet our outlook for the full year of $450 million to $550 million of adjusted cash from operations. Net debt fell by $90 million compared to the first quarter and by over $120 million since the start of the year.
The second quarter is an important period for us in terms of cash collections in Brazil. We remain very focused on the credit capacity of our customers, particularly given the constrained access to third-party financing for Brazilian growers. This has an impact on both our ability to collect cash from customers and our willingness to continue to extend credit in the form of new sales. 
On the first point, we were pleased with our performance in collecting in Brazil. With net cash collections slightly ahead of our expectations and particularly good progress in collecting from our past due balances. As a result, we saw a meaningful reduction in our Brazil receivables balance. However, it is still significantly higher than we would like and we will remain focused on reducing our exposure in the coming quarters.
The credit tightness in Brazil has been an important factor for us for several quarters now, but our willingness to extend credit to certain segments of the market reduced. As we head into the key second half selling season in Brazil, our guidance reflects the disciplined approach to credit exposure.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

And before I continue with my remarks, let me correct a statement I made. The 20,000 ton of additional lithium hydroxide capacity is to be online by 2019, not as I said 2017.
So to continue and to conclude. I am very pleased with the overall execution of our strategies and improved outlook for the year. Despite ongoing challenges facing the agricultural industry, our strategy and the actions we have taken in the back end of 2015 and the first half of 2016 give us strong confidence in our performance for the remainder of the year.
We have remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel, maintain discipline on price and term, aggressively manage our mix by rationalizing our product line, leading to stronger margins. This strategy, combined with a successful integration of Cheminova and the more benign FX situation in Brazil have increased the credit abilities of our business and will drive the second half performance of Ag Solutions with earnings up 35% compared to pro forma results for 2015
We are investing in our technology roadmap in order to offer unique, value-added solutions to our customers. We see high acceptance rates for our new products launches, including our biological platform, and remain on track to introduce our new active ingredients pipeline starting in 2017.
Lithium continues to deliver strong performance altering its product mix and increasing output to meet growing market demand. FMC's focused strategy has enabled the business to take advantage of favorable market conditions to rely significant earnings growth in 2016. Our announced capacity expansion strengthens FMC's leadership position in lithium hydroxide and specialty lithium application and will deliver further growth in the years to come.
Health and Nutrition had a weaker-than-expected quarter. However, the business continues to generate high margins and return and demand across key nutritional and pharmaceutical markets will support growth over the second half of the year.
Finally, we are generating increased operating cash flow to improve our balance sheet. We are on track to increase adjusted cash from operations by approximately 40% in 2016.

So we've seen part of it and we're going to keep on seeing it. It's usually due to the fact that it is winter. There is more rainy season right now in Argentina, where we're operating. So it's not only a Q2 phenomenon, it's a back of Q2, early Q3. I think the visibility we have today due to our production is quite, quite correct at the earnings level. Mainly, there is multiple reasons, which have been leading to the improved earnings. First of all, the mix. We are moving more business to all of lithium hydroxide, where we've been able to operate our plants quite, quite well and where there is a healthy demand and pricing situation. Second of all, our plants have been operating also very well for carbonate production and we have been -- and we are continuing to do that for the second half, selling more products made within the company than third-party products we would resell. And then there is some volume. So if I look at the second half of the year, I think our earnings is quite in line with our expectation. I don't think there is a lot of upside. Most likely what you will see is, we decided not to change the revenue range because we are a little bit below the middle point of the range initially. Looking at the demand for the back end of the year, it's most likely going to lend us to where the higher end of the range from a revenue standpoint. But I believe, the earnings we have forecasted in lithium for Q3, Q4 are correct, unless. Unless, I'd say the only place where I could see upside, but it is not possible for us to predict that today is pricing. Pricing is always something, depending upon demand, and how capacity come on stream. So that one, we've made some assumptions, you never know."

But it is important to understand that the earnings growth, especially in the fourth quarter, is maybe more predictable because it is due to a cost situation. We always work our cost and decrease our cost. But the way costs flows into operations depend upon the speed at which you turn your product. And I think, we call that capitalized variance. But the main reason for the bump in earnings in the backend of the year is due to the fact that we would be operating at a lower cost than we have been operating via the quarters in previous year. That is why you will see such a jump. So it is not due to a major turn in demand for any of our products, but it's much more the benefit of prior activity we've done on operational costs and manufacturing excellence."

Cheminova, this is to separate the two important differences. Cheminova did not have a different approach to working capital than anybody else in the industry. They did have a different approach to have the finance that working capital. And to be blunt, as a weak balance sheet company with very unsophisticated treasury operations, they used to use some very, very expensive local financing in Brazil, which can give the impression that they are reducing their working capital.

As you know, we tend to have a rule in Brazil, where we index price on currency. Last year, we were with a pricing running after the currency and trying to move up our price. This year, the same process of adjusting pricing to currency is going the other way, which mean it is not any longer us asking the customers to take higher price, but the customer asking us to lower the price more towards the currency. So needless to say that for all of us, regardless of what behavior individual companies would take, it is an easier conversation from the predictability of the pricing. And this FX situation give us a much better position to talk about pricing, more control in term of understanding pricing in the next 2 quarters. And I think, it's got to apply to every company.

Today, we believe this market is getting more and more solid. I have to say that we are still prudent. But the big breakthrough for us is the technology we're able to develop from a manufacturing standpoint, allowing us to add very low capital spend and decision cost of operations, ability to create 4,000 to 8,000 tons modules for lithium hydroxide instead of having to build in one shot, a 20,000 or 30,000 tons. So today, we do have an improved view and more certain view of what lithium hydroxide is doing. But on the work we've done in the last 2 years, was to develop a manufacturing process, allowing us to follow the demand growth. Which means that if the growth is not as we're expecting, we can stop 1 or 2 of these modules manufacturing and slowdown the capacity increase we have planned. If the demand becomes more aggressive, very easy for us to speed up the building of those modules. So first, your question, yes, we have increased confidence. Our strategy is very highly focused on the downstream product, where we have the highest profitability. Third, we have a safety net around demand by these manufacturing process we have in place, allowing to match the demand. Where are we on our forecast? We are taking pretty much a middle of the range. We are far in the process and predictability for the numbers I gave to you, to take the highest prediction from EV companies.

As you can see on the first slide for the second quarter of 2016, FMC reported revenue of $810 million and adjusted operating profit of $143 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.69 was $0.01 below the second quarter of 2015, but above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Ag Solutions delivered another solid quarter and it continues to realize the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Lithium outperformed on higher sales volumes, and higher realized prices across the portfolio with lower operating cost from ongoing manufacturing excellence program.
Earnings in Health and Nutrition were below expectation as results in omega-3 were significantly weaker than anticipated. Based on our performance to date and the outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. I will provide more details on how that breaks down across each of the businesses shortly. But first, I will discuss second quarter results for each of our 3 segments, starting with Ag Solutions on Slide 2.
Overall, market condition and our performance in the quarter were in line with our prior expectations. We remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel and on maintaining discipline on price and terms. We also took actions needed to complete the product rationalization that began in late 2014.
For the second quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $515 million and segment earnings of $101 million, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue declined 19% compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely due to lower sales volume, unfavorable weather conditions in Europe and Asia, the drawdown of channel inventory by customers in most regions and planned product rationalization all contributed to the decline in volume in the quarter.
Excluding planned product rationalization, revenue declined broadly in line with the crop protection market as a whole. Segment earnings declined 14% compared to 2015 as the impact of lower sales volumes, less favorable product mix in Asia and North America and the stronger U.S. dollar were partially offset by lower operating cost. Compared to pro forma results from Q2 last year, operating margin increased 100 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, the elimination of sales of low-margin products due to portfolio rationalization and cost savings from the Cheminova integration.
As we move to Slide 3, I will first give a few comments on the global crop protection market then I will move on to review FMC's performance by region and discuss the outlook for Q3 and the full year. So first, the market.
Overall, conditions in the global crop protection market were as expected, little changed from Q1. In North America, soft commodity prices continue to put pressure on farm incomes resulting in more cautious buying behavior by growers and elevated inventory levels across the channel.
In Europe, unfavorable weather conditions early in the quarter, most notably in Central and Western Europe, reduced market demand, leading to lower volumes and increased channel inventory in certain countries. In Brazil, channel inventory across the market remained elevated, especially for insecticides. And while foreign exchange rates have been more stable, growers continue to be negatively impacted by a lack of credit availability.
In Asia, weather conditions were poor across most of the region resulting in weaker market demand. We believe these challenging market conditions will persist for the remainder of the year and we still forecast that the global crop protection chemical market will decline by mid- to high single-digit percent in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis. I will now discuss FMC's performance in light of these market conditions.
First, let me address the lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter. Markets in Asia and Europe were weaker than expected, but the main driver of the lower revenue is a more successful and aggressive product rationalization.
We continue to manage the quality of our sales in order to protect margins, earnings and working capital. In North America, our strategy remained one of defending price and terms, allowing the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel to reduce. All the data we see support our view that inventory of FMC products in the channel is declining. Reflecting the benefits of the actions we took early in the season, to reduce inventory of FMC product in the channel, sales in Q2 increased 5%. We saw strong demand for FMC's Authority brand of pre-emergent soybean herbicide and independent data show that the Authority brand has taken market share this year. We also saw grower support for the extended fungicide products we can now offer as a result of the Cheminova acquisition.
In Europe, revenue declined by 19%, driven largely by poor weather conditions and reduced volume due to the planned product rationalization as well as the impact of transitioning to a direct market access model. However, the product rationalization and move to direct market access have resulted in improved operating margins in the region.
In Latin America, revenue declined 43%, primarily as a result of steps we took to reduce the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel in Brazil. We were encouraged by our ability to recover U.S. dollar pricing in the quarter. While not material to overall segment performance, given the seasonally lower sales volume, realized price increase in Brazil more than offset the negative impact of FX on a reported revenue.
In Asia, the combination of poor weather condition, further portfolio rationalization and a stronger U.S. dollar caused revenue to decline 22% compared to the second quarter last year. Moving on to the outlook for Ag Solutions.
Our full year segment earnings guidance remains unchanged at $380 million to $420 million. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $80 million and $90 million. At the midpoint of guidance, second half segment earnings will increase by approximately 35% compared to 2015, driven by improved performance in Brazil and Latin America and additional cost savings from the Cheminova integration. The steps we have already taken to rationalize our product portfolio and reduce the level of FMC inventory in the channel, in the sales channel, leave us well positioned as we enter the 2016, 2017 crop season in the Americas.
The relative stability of the Brazilian real over the past few months gives us increased confidence in our ability to recapture price despite tightening credit condition from growers and weak market demand as channel inventory levels decline. We expect full year segment earnings margin to be between 17% and 18%, which at the midpoint represents more than 250 basis points of improvement compared to 2015 driven by more favorable mix, improved pricing in Brazil and realization of cost savings. We remain on track to deliver the incremental cost savings target of $60 million to $70 million in 2016 and the full run rate cost saving of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of next year.
Moving on to Health and Nutrition on Slide 4. The business reported second quarter segment revenue of $195 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined approximately 6% and earnings declined approximately 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by worse-than-expected performance of omega-3. The headwinds we saw in omega-3 over the past year increased in the second quarter. Specifically, prices and volumes were much lower than anticipated. There is significant overcapacity in the industry, which, combined with lower demand for higher concentration products has exerted even greater pressure on prices than we saw earlier in the year. 
We have seen new entrants with business at prices that are close to cash cost of production, resulting in considerably lower volume for our products in certain key areas. We have aggressively taken costs out of this business with fixed cost falling by almost 40%. We continue to pursue new opportunities for high-end cost alteration products, but do not expect to recover these lost volumes this year and do not anticipate the change in pricing levels any time soon.
Excluding omega-3, results were in line with expectations. In nutritional ingredients, volumes in the quarter were slightly below Q2 2015, largely due to timing as orders shifted to the second half of the year. In health excipients, sales volumes increased in all key pharmaceutical markets.
Given performance to date in omega-3 and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are lowering our guidance for Health and Nutrition. We now expect full year segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $196 million, roughly flat with 2015, and third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $44 million to $48 million. We continue to expect operating margins of approximately 25% for the full year helped by lower operating cost and improved production yields.
Turning next to Lithium on Slide 5.  Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $63 million and segment earnings more than tripled to $16.5 million. Lithium's performance reflect a success of FMC strategy of converting lithium carbonate into higher value downstream specialty product supported by strong manufacturing performance, especially in Argentina in our Bessemer City Hydroxide Facility.
Higher sales volume, higher average prices in all major product categories, improved mix and lower operating costs, all contributed to deliver segment earnings above the top end of our prior guidance range and pushed segment earnings margin to over 26% in the quarter.
We expect supply/demand conditions to remain tight for the remainder of the year as previously announced capacity expansions across industry have been slow to come online. This reinforces our confidence in favorable pricing conditions through the remainder of 2016.
For the full year, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $58 million to $66 million, an increase at the midpoint of approximately 30% compared to prior guidance and nearly 3x segment earnings in 2015. Higher prices and lower operating costs compared to last year will support operating margins in the range of 24% to 25% for the year.
We expect third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $13 million to $17 million as the benefit of higher prices will be partially offset by seasonally lower production at our operations in Argentina. 
FMC's Lithium business is positioned to deliver significant earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In May, we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30,000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our customers starting with a 4,000 metric ton expansion scheduled to come online in 2017.
Last week, we announced we will accelerate that capacity expansion and we now expect 8,000 metric tons to come online by the middle of 2017. We continue to evaluate the turning or further capacity expansion and expect the entire 20,000 metric ton of additional capacity to be online by 2017. We believe, we will more than double the revenue and earnings of our Lithium business between 2016 and 2020, resulting in over 20% per year growth through the rest of this decade.
We recognize that our hydroxide investment plans require us to have cost-effective access to sufficient lithium carbonate. Our current carbonate capacity is sufficient to support the expansion in FMC's hydroxide production through at least 2018.
Beyond this, we are actively pursuing multiple tasks to ensure we are not carbonate constrained. First, we have several low capital options to debottleneck our Argentina operations, potentially adding 20% capacity. Second, we are in ongoing discussions with multiple carbonate producers. We have announced plans to add capacity in the coming years and are exploring mutually beneficial long-term supply agreement or strategic partnerships. And of course, we retained the option to add significant capacity at our operation, our existing operation in Argentina beyond the debottlenecking I just mentioned. Consequently, we are highly confident that access to lithium carbonate will not be a constrain in our ability to extend our hydroxide business in the coming years.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 6. As I mentioned, we are maintaining full year segment earnings for Ag Solutions and adjusting our full year earnings expectation for both Health and Nutrition and lithium. As a result, on a consolidated basis, we are increasing full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.63. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results."

Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, giving us a small benefit this quarter compared to Q2 l",611,"Thank you, Pierre. As usual, I'll start with the income statement and specifically of the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, giving us a small benefit this quarter compared to Q2 last year.
This lowered rate is largely due to the continued change in the mix of our earnings away from high tax jurisdictions, such as the U.S., towards regions where tax rates are lower. Foreign exchange was not a major factor in our results this quarter with the stronger dollar, mainly impacting the Ag Solutions segment.
Various Asian currencies plus the Mexican peso were the drivers of the FX headwind in the quarter. The second quarter is not a period of significant activity in Brazil. And therefore, the recent strengthening of the reais had a limited impact on our financials in the quarter. However, with an FX rate in the quarter that was weaker than the same period of last year, and with the price list that largely reflect to the current spot rate, the combined effect of price and currency in Brazil was a net positive to our second quarter earnings.
Looking into the second half of the year. The recent stability in the reais-U.S. dollar exchange rate means that the assumptions regarding the future exchange rate that has underpinned our guidance is unchanged. To remind you, our guidance has assumed that we have a reais to U.S. dollar rate that is relatively stable with no major short-term swings in the FX rate, combined with a price list that largely reflects the prevailing spot exchange rate.
Sitting here today, both of those assumptions remain unchanged. And therefore, we do not expect either a positive or negative impact on our second half performance from the reais-FX rate compared to our previous guidance, provided these conditions hold.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. We continue to make progress in increasing our cash generation while maintaining discipline on capital spending. For the first half of the year, our adjusted cash from operations was 40% higher than the first half of last year, driven primarily by stronger working capital performance.
We remain on target to meet our outlook for the full year of $450 million to $550 million of adjusted cash from operations. Net debt fell by $90 million compared to the first quarter and by over $120 million since the start of the year.
The second quarter is an important period for us in terms of cash collections in Brazil. We remain very focused on the credit capacity of our customers, particularly given the constrained access to third-party financing for Brazilian growers. This has an impact on both our ability to collect cash from customers and our willingness to continue to extend credit in the form of new sales. 
On the first point, we were pleased with our performance in collecting in Brazil. With net cash collections slightly ahead of our expectations and particularly good progress in collecting from our past due balances. As a result, we saw a meaningful reduction in our Brazil receivables balance. However, it is still significantly higher than we would like and we will remain focused on reducing our exposure in the coming quarters.
The credit tightness in Brazil has been an important factor for us for several quarters now, but our willingness to extend credit to certain segments of the market reduced. As we head into the key second half selling season in Brazil, our guidance reflects the disciplined approach to credit exposure.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

And before I continue with my remarks, let me correct a statement I made. The 20,000 ton of additional lithium hydroxide capacity is to be online by 2019, not as I said 2017.
So to continue and to conclude. I am very pleased with the overall execution of our strategies and improved outlook for the year. Despite ongoing challenges facing the agricultural industry, our strategy and the actions we have taken in the back end of 2015 and the first half of 2016 give us strong confidence in our performance for the remainder of the year.
We have remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel, maintain discipline on price and term, aggressively manage our mix by rationalizing our product line, leading to stronger margins. This strategy, combined with a successful integration of Cheminova and the more benign FX situation in Brazil have increased the credit abilities of our business and will drive the second half performance of Ag Solutions with earnings up 35% compared to pro forma results for 2015.
We are investing in our technology roadmap in order to offer unique, value-added solutions to our customers. We see high acceptance rates for our new products launches, including our biological platform, and remain on track to introduce our new active ingredients pipeline starting in 2017.
Lithium continues to deliver strong performance altering its product mix and increasing output to meet growing market demand. FMC's focused strategy has enabled the business to take advantage of favorable market conditions to realize significant earnings growth in 2016. Our announced capacity expansion strengthens FMC's leadership position in lithium hydroxide and specialty lithium application and will deliver further growth in the years to come.
Health and Nutrition had a weaker-than-expected quarter. However, the business continues to generate high margins and return and demand across key nutritional and pharmaceutical markets will support growth over the second half of the year.
Finally, we are generating increased operating cash flow to improve our balance sheet. We are on track to increase adjusted cash from operations by approximately 40% in 2016. 
I thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We think about the ability of the customer to repay us, the stability of the customer and their access to finance.  There are natural differences by crop and by region in Brazil. And we obviously factor all of that in the way that we go-to-market.

So we've seen part of it and we're going to keep on seeing it. It's usually due to the fact that it is winter. There is more rainy season right now in Argentina, where we're operating. So it's not only a Q2 phenomenon, it's a back of Q2, early Q3. I think the visibility we have today due to our production is quite, quite correct at the earnings level. Mainly, there is multiple reasons, which have been leading to the improved earnings. First of all, the mix. We are moving more business towards our lithium hydroxide, where we've been able to operate our plants quite, quite well and where there is a healthy demand and pricing situation. Second of all, our plants have been operating also very well for carbonate production and we have been -- and we are continuing to do that for the second half, selling more products made within the company than third-party products we would resell. And then there is some volume. So if I look at the second half of the year, I think our earnings is quite in line with our expectation. I don't think there is a lot of upside. Most likely what you will see is, we decided not to change the revenue range because we are a little bit below the middle point of the range initially. Looking at the demand for the back end of the year, it's most likely going to lend us to where the higher end of the range from a revenue standpoint. But I believe, the earnings we have forecasted in lithium for Q3, Q4 are correct, unless. Unless, I'd say the only place where I could see upside, but it is not possible for us to predict that today is pricing. Pricing is always something, depending upon demand, and how capacity come on stream. So that one, we've made some assumptions, you never know."

But it is important to understand that the earnings growth, especially in the fourth quarter, is maybe more predictable because it is due to a cost situation. We always work our cost and decrease our cost. But the way costs flows into operations depend upon the speed at which you turn your product. And I think, we call that capitalized variance. But the main reason for the bump in earnings in the back end of the year is due to the fact that we would be operating at a lower cost than we have been operating via the quarters in previous year.

Sugarcane and cotton can have very, very different terms, cotton tends to be longer term, sugarcane tends to be much shorter term, although that does vary depending on the nature of the planting cycles and on the financial health of the sugarcane guidance.

I would not though expect that you're going about to track that through our working capital balance as you look at it. It's definitely a factor that helps, but it's not so large that you're going to really see a major move in our numbers. In terms of how Cheminova approached it. Cheminova, this is to separate the 2 important differences. Cheminova did not have a different approach to working capital than anybody else in the industry. They did have a different approach to how they finance that working capital. And to be blunt, as a weak balance sheet company with very unsophisticated treasury operations, they used to use some very, very expensive local financing in Brazil, which can give the impression that they are reducing their working capital. It was appropriate for non-U.S. GAAP reporting, it was appropriate for a sub-investment grade company, it was incredibly expensive and we'll certainly factor in why their overall profitability was so low and it's certainly not something we intend to do."

Today, we believe this market is getting more and more solid. I have to say that we are still prudent.

So today, we do have an improved view and more certain view of what lithium hydroxide is doing. But on the work we've done in the last 2 years, was to develop a manufacturing process, allowing us to follow the demand growth. Which means that if the growth is not as we're expecting, we can stop 1 or 2 of these modules manufacturing and slowdown the capacity increase we have planned. If the demand becomes more aggressive, very easy for us to speed up the building of those modules. So first, your question, yes, we have increased confidence. Our strategy is very highly focused on the downstream product, where we have the highest profitability.

I think we went through those 2 quarters, very highly focused on delivering what we promised to do. Everything we've done in the 2 quarters have done a few things for us. First of all, I believe from an Ag standpoint, even if the markets are not yet returning to the level of growth, this kind of market could expect to see one day. We have improved highly controlled visibility and predictability of our own business. I think from the lithium standpoint, it is a bright spot for us. We have refined our strategy. And I have to say the breakthrough we had in technology around lithium hydroxide manufacturing are an enormous win for us looking at the future. And our penetration, the business is solid. The business is highly profitable. But we also understand the challenges we have on omega-3 and it's something we'll be focusing on in the quarters to come.

As you can see on the first slide for the second quarter of 2016, FMC reported revenue of $810 million and adjusted operating profit of $143 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.69 was $0.01 below the second quarter of 2015, but above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Ag Solutions delivered another solid quarter and it continues to realize the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Lithium outperformed on higher sales volumes, and higher realized prices across the portfolio with lower operating cost from ongoing manufacturing excellence program.
Earnings in Health and Nutrition were below expectation as results in omega-3 were significantly weaker than anticipated. Based on our performance to date and the outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. I will provide more details on how that breaks down across each of the businesses shortly. But first, I will discuss second quarter results for each of our 3 segments, starting with Ag Solutions on Slide 2.
Overall, market condition and our performance in the quarter were in line with our prior expectations. We remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel and on maintaining discipline on price and terms. We also took actions needed to complete the product rationalization that began in late 2014.
For the second quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $515 million and segment earnings of $101 million, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue declined 19% compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely due to lower sales volume, unfavorable weather conditions in Europe and Asia, the drawdown of channel inventory by customers in most regions and planned product rationalization all contributed to the decline in volume in the quarter.
Excluding planned product rationalization, revenue declined broadly in line with the crop protection market as a whole. Segment earnings declined 14% compared to 2015 as the impact of lower sales volumes, less favorable product mix in Asia and North America and the stronger U.S. dollar were partially offset by lower operating cost. Compared to pro forma results from Q2 last year, operating margin increased 100 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, the elimination of sales of low-margin products due to portfolio rationalization and cost savings from the Cheminova integration.
As we move to Slide 3, I will first give a few comments on the global crop protection market then I will move on to review FMC's performance by region and discuss the outlook for Q3 and the full year. So first, the market.
Overall, conditions in the global crop protection market were as expected, little changed from Q1. In North America, soft commodity prices continue to put pressure on farm incomes resulting in more cautious buying behavior by growers and elevated inventory levels across the channel.
In Europe, unfavorable weather conditions early in the quarter, most notably in Central and Western Europe, reduced market demand, leading to lower volumes and increased channel inventory in certain countries. In Brazil, channel inventory across the market remained elevated, especially for insecticides. And while foreign exchange rates have been more stable, growers continue to be negatively impacted by a lack of credit availability.
In Asia, weather conditions were poor across most of the region resulting in weaker market demand. We believe these challenging market conditions will persist for the remainder of the year and we still forecast that the global crop protection chemical market will decline by mid- to high single-digit percent in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis. I will now discuss FMC's performance in light of these market conditions.
First, let me address the lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter. Markets in Asia and Europe were weaker than expected, but the main driver of the lower revenue is a more successful and aggressive product rationalization.
We continue to manage the quality of our sales in order to protect margins, earnings and working capital. In North America, our strategy remained one of defending price and terms, allowing the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel to reduce. All the data we see support our view that inventory of FMC products in the channel is declining. Reflecting the benefits of the actions we took early in the season, to reduce inventory of FMC product in the channel, sales in Q2 increased 5%. We saw strong demand for FMC's Authority brand of pre-emergent soybean herbicide and independent data show that the Authority brand has taken market share this year. We also saw grower support for the extended fungicide products we can now offer as a result of the Cheminova acquisition.
In Europe, revenue declined by 19%, driven largely by poor weather conditions and reduced volume due to the planned product rationalization as well as the impact of transitioning to a direct market access model. However, the product rationalization and move to direct market access have resulted in improved operating margins in the region.
In Latin America, revenue declined 43%, primarily as a result of steps we took to reduce the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel in Brazil. We were encouraged by our ability to recover U.S. dollar pricing in the quarter. While not material to overall segment performance, given the seasonally lower sales volume, realized price increase in Brazil more than offset the negative impact of FX on a reported revenue.
In Asia, the combination of poor weather condition, further portfolio rationalization and a stronger U.S. dollar caused revenue to decline 22% compared to the second quarter last year. Moving on to the outlook for Ag Solutions.
Our full year segment earnings guidance remains unchanged at $380 million to $420 million. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $80 million and $90 million. At the midpoint of guidance, second half segment earnings will increase by approximately 35% compared to 2015, driven by improved performance in Brazil and Latin America and additional cost savings from the Cheminova integration. The steps we have already taken to rationalize our product portfolio and reduce the level of FMC inventory in the channel, in the sales channel, leave us well positioned as we enter the 2016, 2017 crop season in the Americas.
The relative stability of the Brazilian real over the past few months gives us increased confidence in our ability to recapture price despite tightening credit condition from growers and weak market demand as channel inventory levels decline. We expect full year segment earnings margin to be between 17% and 18%, which at the midpoint represents more than 250 basis points of improvement compared to 2015 driven by more favorable mix, improved pricing in Brazil and realization of cost savings. We remain on track to deliver the incremental cost savings target of $60 million to $70 million in 2016 and the full run rate cost saving of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of next year.
Moving on to Health and Nutrition on Slide 4. The business reported second quarter segment revenue of $195 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined approximately 6% and earnings declined approximately 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by worse-than-expected performance of omega-3. The headwinds we saw in omega-3 over the past year increased in the second quarter. Specifically, prices and volumes were much lower than anticipated. There is significant overcapacity in the industry, which, combined with lower demand for higher concentration products has exerted even greater pressure on prices than we saw earlier in the year. 
We have seen new entrants with business at prices that are close to cash cost of production, resulting in considerably lower volume for our products in certain key areas. We have aggressively taken costs out of this business with fixed cost falling by almost 40%. We continue to pursue new opportunities for high-end cost alteration products, but do not expect to recover these lost volumes this year and do not anticipate the change in pricing levels any time soon.
Excluding omega-3, results were in line with expectations. In nutritional ingredients, volumes in the quarter were slightly below Q2 2015, largely due to timing as orders shifted to the second half of the year. In health excipients, sales volumes increased in all key pharmaceutical markets.
Given performance to date in omega-3 and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are lowering our guidance for Health and Nutrition. We now expect full year segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $196 million, roughly flat with 2015, and third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $44 million to $48 million. We continue to expect operating margins of approximately 25% for the full year helped by lower operating cost and improved production yields.
Turning next to Lithium on Slide 5.  Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $63 million and segment earnings more than tripled to $16.5 million. Lithium's performance reflect a success of FMC strategy of converting lithium carbonate into higher value downstream specialty product supported by strong manufacturing performance, especially in Argentina in our Bessemer City Hydroxide Facility.
Higher sales volume, higher average prices in all major product categories, improved mix and lower operating costs, all contributed to deliver segment earnings above the top end of our prior guidance range and pushed segment earnings margin to over 26% in the quarter.
We expect supply/demand conditions to remain tight for the remainder of the year as previously announced capacity expansions across industry have been slow to come online. This reinforces our confidence in favorable pricing conditions through the remainder of 2016.
For the full year, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $58 million to $66 million, an increase at the midpoint of approximately 30% compared to prior guidance and nearly 3x segment earnings in 2015. Higher prices and lower operating costs compared to last year will support operating margins in the range of 24% to 25% for the year.
We expect third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $13 million to $17 million as the benefit of higher prices will be partially offset by seasonally lower production at our operations in Argentina. 
FMC's Lithium business is positioned to deliver significant earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In May, we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30,000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our customers starting with a 4,000 metric ton expansion scheduled to come online in 2017.
Last week, we announced we will accelerate that capacity expansion and we now expect 8,000 metric tons to come online by the middle of 2017. We continue to evaluate the turning or further capacity expansion and expect the entire 20,000 metric ton of additional capacity to be online by 2017. We believe, we will more than double the revenue and earnings of our Lithium business between 2016 and 2020, resulting in over 20% per year growth through the rest of this decade.
We recognize that our hydroxide investment plans require us to have cost-effective access to sufficient lithium carbonate. Our current carbonate capacity is sufficient to support the expansion in FMC's hydroxide production through at least 2018.
Beyond this, we are actively pursuing multiple tasks to ensure we are not carbonate constrained. First, we have several low capital options to debottleneck our Argentina operations, potentially adding 20% capacity. Second, we are in ongoing discussions with multiple carbonate producers. We have announced plans to add capacity in the coming years and are exploring mutually beneficial long-term supply agreement or strategic partnerships. And of course, we retained the option to add significant capacity at our operation, our existing operation in Argentina beyond the debottlenecking I just mentioned. Consequently, we are highly confident that access to lithium carbonate will not be a constrain in our ability to extend our hydroxide business in the coming years.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 6. As I mentioned, we are maintaining full year segment earnings for Ag Solutions and adjusting our full year earnings expectation for both Health and Nutrition and lithium. As a result, on a consolidated basis, we are increasing full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.63. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results."

Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, giving us a small benefit this quarter compared to Q2 l",611,"Thank you, Pierre. As usual, I'll start with the income statement and specifically of the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, giving us a small benefit this quarter compared to Q2 last year.
This lowered rate is largely due to the continued change in the mix of our earnings away from high tax jurisdictions, such as the U.S., towards regions where tax rates are lower. Foreign exchange was not a major factor in our results this quarter with the stronger dollar, mainly impacting the Ag Solutions segment.
Various Asian currencies plus the Mexican peso were the drivers of the FX headwind in the quarter. The second quarter is not a period of significant activity in Brazil. And therefore, the recent strengthening of the reais had a limited impact on our financials in the quarter. However, with an FX rate in the quarter that was weaker than the same period of last year, and with the price list that largely reflect to the current spot rate, the combined effect of price and currency in Brazil was a net positive to our second quarter earnings.
Looking into the second half of the year. The recent stability in the reais-U.S. dollar exchange rate means that the assumptions regarding the future exchange rate that has underpinned our guidance is unchanged. To remind you, our guidance has assumed that we have a reais to U.S. dollar rate that is relatively stable with no major short-term swings in the FX rate, combined with a price list that largely reflects the prevailing spot exchange rate.
Sitting here today, both of those assumptions remain unchanged. And therefore, we do not expect either a positive or negative impact on our second half performance from the reais-FX rate compared to our previous guidance, provided these conditions hold.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. We continue to make progress in increasing our cash generation while maintaining discipline on capital spending. For the first half of the year, our adjusted cash from operations was 40% higher than the first half of last year, driven primarily by stronger working capital performance.
We remain on target to meet our outlook for the full year of $450 million to $550 million of adjusted cash from operations. Net debt fell by $90 million compared to the first quarter and by over $120 million since the start of the year.
The second quarter is an important period for us in terms of cash collections in Brazil. We remain very focused on the credit capacity of our customers, particularly given the constrained access to third-party financing for Brazilian growers. This has an impact on both our ability to collect cash from customers and our willingness to continue to extend credit in the form of new sales. 
On the first point, we were pleased with our performance in collecting in Brazil. With net cash collections slightly ahead of our expectations and particularly good progress in collecting from our past due balances. As a result, we saw a meaningful reduction in our Brazil receivables balance. However, it is still significantly higher than we would like and we will remain focused on reducing our exposure in the coming quarters.
The credit tightness in Brazil has been an important factor for us for several quarters now, but our willingness to extend credit to certain segments of the market reduced. As we head into the key second half selling season in Brazil, our guidance reflects the disciplined approach to credit exposure.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

And before I continue with my remarks, let me correct a statement I made. The 20,000 ton of additional lithium hydroxide capacity is to be online by 2019, not as I said 2017.
So to continue and to conclude. I am very pleased with the overall execution of our strategies and improved outlook for the year. Despite ongoing challenges facing the agricultural industry, our strategy and the actions we have taken in the back end of 2015 and the first half of 2016 give us strong confidence in our performance for the remainder of the year.
We have remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel, maintain discipline on price and term, aggressively manage our mix by rationalizing our product line, leading to stronger margins. This strategy, combined with a successful integration of Cheminova and the more benign FX situation in Brazil have increased the credit abilities of our business and will drive the second half performance of Ag Solutions with earnings up 35% compared to pro forma results for 2015.
We are investing in our technology roadmap in order to offer unique, value-added solutions to our customers. We see high acceptance rates for our new products launches, including our biological platform, and remain on track to introduce our new active ingredients pipeline starting in 2017.
Lithium continues to deliver strong performance altering its product mix and increasing output to meet growing market demand. FMC's focused strategy has enabled the business to take advantage of favorable market conditions to realize significant earnings growth in 2016. Our announced capacity expansion strengthens FMC's leadership position in lithium hydroxide and specialty lithium application and will deliver further growth in the years to come.
Health and Nutrition had a weaker-than-expected quarter. However, the business continues to generate high margins and return and demand across key nutritional and pharmaceutical markets will support growth over the second half of the year.
Finally, we are generating increased operating cash flow to improve our balance sheet. We are on track to increase adjusted cash from operations by approximately 40% in 2016.

We -- our actions to walk away from low margin, third party more generic products is working very well. So we are increasing the margins of our products through mix. Second of all, we have been pretty successful over the last 3 or 4 quarters in moving a price. So with a situation looking at the importance of Brazil and Latin America in Q3 and Q4 and taking into account the pricing versus FX situation, we are in a stronger position. So blend of stronger volume we're going to see in the second half of the year, a better mix because we are moving away from third-party products and the pricing FX situation will lead to, first of all, to more predictable business. We have a much better visibility going in the second half of the year than we had in a long time and with stronger margins for the business."

So we've seen part of it and we're going to keep on seeing it. It's usually due to the fact that it is winter. There is more rainy season right now in Argentina, where we're operating. So it's not only a Q2 phenomenon, it's a back of Q2, early Q3. I think the visibility we have today due to our production is quite, quite correct at the earnings level. Mainly, there is multiple reasons, which have been leading to the improved earnings. First of all, the mix. We are moving more business towards our lithium hydroxide, where we've been able to operate our plants quite, quite well and where there is a healthy demand and pricing situation. Second of all, our plants have been operating also very well for carbonate production and we have been -- and we are continuing to do that for the second half, selling more products made within the company than third-party products we would resell. And then there is some volume. So if I look at the second half of the year, I think our earnings is quite in line with our expectation. I don't think there is a lot of upside. Most likely what you will see is, we decided not to change the revenue range because we are a little bit below the middle point of the range initially. Looking at the demand for the back end of the year, it's most likely going to lend us to where the higher end of the range from a revenue standpoint. But I believe, the earnings we have forecasted in lithium for Q3, Q4 are correct, unless. Unless, I'd say the only place where I could see upside, but it is not possible for us to predict that today is pricing. Pricing is always something, depending upon demand, and how capacity come on stream. So that one, we've made some assumptions, you never know."

But it is important to understand that the earnings growth, especially in the fourth quarter, is maybe more predictable because it is due to a cost situation. We always work our cost and decrease our cost. But the way costs flows into operations depend upon the speed at which you turn your product. And I think, we call that capitalized variance. But the main reason for the bump in earnings in the back end of the year is due to the fact that we would be operating at a lower cost than we have been operating via the quarters in previous year.

Those are big plants. But you know in the big scheme of things, the production capacity versus what we do with total network is fairly small. So it is our fundamental departure to what we used to be in the past."

Sugarcane and cotton can have very, very different terms, cotton tends to be longer term, sugarcane tends to be much shorter term, although that does vary depending on the nature of the planting cycles and on the financial health of the sugarcane guidance. But as a rule, as we shifted away from cotton, we'll expect to see our working capital terms come in and to what sugarcane also does the same thing. I would not though expect that you're going about to track that through our working capital balance as you look at it. It's definitely a factor that helps, but it's not so large that you're going to really see a major move in our numbers. In terms of how Cheminova approached it. Cheminova, this is to separate the 2 important differences. Cheminova did not have a different approach to working capital than anybody else in the industry. They did have a different approach to how they finance that working capital. And to be blunt, as a weak balance sheet company with very unsophisticated treasury operations, they used to use some very, very expensive local financing in Brazil, which can give the impression that they are reducing their working capital. It was appropriate for non-U.S. GAAP reporting, it was appropriate for a sub-investment grade company, it was incredibly expensive and we'll certainly factor in why their overall profitability was so low and it's certainly not something we intend to do."

This year, the same process of adjusting pricing to currency is going the other way, which mean it is not any longer us asking the customers to take higher price, but the customer asking us to lower the price more towards the currency. So needless to say that for all of us, regardless of what behavior individual companies would take, it is an easier conversation from the predictability of the pricing. And this FX situation give us a much better position to talk about pricing, more control in term of understanding pricing in the next 2 quarters. And I think, it's got to apply to every company.

Today, we believe this market is getting more and more solid. I have to say that we are still prudent. But the big breakthrough for us is the technology we're able to develop from a manufacturing standpoint, allowing us to add very low capital spend and efficient cost of operations, ability to create 4,000 to 8,000 tons modules for lithium hydroxide instead of having to build in one shot, a 20,000 or 30,000 tons. So today, we do have an improved view and more certain view of what lithium hydroxide is doing. But on the work we've done in the last 2 years, was to develop a manufacturing process, allowing us to follow the demand growth. Which means that if the growth is not as we're expecting, we can stop 1 or 2 of these modules manufacturing and slowdown the capacity increase we have planned. If the demand becomes more aggressive, very easy for us to speed up the building of those modules. So first, your question, yes, we have increased confidence. Our strategy is very highly focused on the downstream product, where we have the highest profitability. Third, we have a safety net around demand by these manufacturing process we have in place, allowing to match the demand. Where are we on our forecast? We are taking pretty much a middle of the range.

Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS i",1474,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS increased approximately 60% compared to the third quarter of 2015, exceeding the top end of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.63.
Our performance for the quarter. For [indiscernible], best results of Ag Solutions and Lithium, both of which reported a significant year-over-year increase in segment earnings.
In Ag Solutions, compared to last year, we saw an improved start of the season in Latin America, especially in Brazil, a stronger performance in both Asia and North America. Lithium continued to benefit from higher prices, improved mix and lower operating costs. Third quarter segment earnings in Health and Nutrition [ph] were slightly below 2015 but in line with our expectations.
The lower tax rate in the quarter contributed approximately $0.03 to adjusted EPS. As noted in our outlook statement, and as Paul will discuss later in the call, we expect to continue to report a lower tax rate for the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Based on our performance in the third quarter and on our outlook for Q4, we are revising the range of our full-range adjusted EPS guidance to $2.76 to $2.86 per share at the mid-point. This represents an increase of $0.06 per share compared to the prior period [ph] and an increase of $0.14 compared to adjusted EPS for 2015. I will provide more detail on the outlook for Q4 shortly. But first, I will discuss third quarter results for each of our 3 segments, starting with Ag Solutions on Slide 2.
For the third quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $559 million and segment earnings at the top of organic [ph] range of $90 million. Compared to the third quarter 2015, revenue declined 3% as lower sales volume in Brazil more than offset the benefit of higher prices in that country and volume growth in other regions.
Year-over-year price increases were [ph] just in Brazil, where we continue to recover pricing in U.S. dollar terms. Segment earnings increased over 50%, and margin improved 600 basis points, as higher realized [ph] prices, improved mix and favorable foreign exchange more than offset the impact of lower volumes and slightly higher costs in the quarter.
Costs were higher, principally as a result of the timing between quarters [ph] of certain expenses. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our integration cost savings targets.
Turning to Slide 3. I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance and discuss the outlook for Q4, starting with Latin America.
Revenue in the region declined 18% in the quarter, driven largely by lower sales volumes in Brazil. General market weakness, ongoing product rationalization efforts and our decision to allow channel inventory levels to reduce each contributed to the decline in sales volume in Brazil. The elimination of low-margin third-party products accounted for over 50% of the volume decline in the quarter.
Revenue in the rest of Latin America was roughly flat compared to 2015. In Argentina, we continued to see increasing demand for FMC's [ph] authority herbicides. In Mexico, our focus on high-value crops is helping to offset the impact of a broader market decline.
The actions we have taken throughout the past year in Brazil enabled us to realize significant increases in U.S. dollar-based prices, improve operating margin and drive collections in the quarter. Price actions increased operating earnings in Brazil by about 30% year-over-year, which, combined with lower operating costs, reached our  [ph] operating margins to 2014 levels.
Our actions in Brazil also enabled the business to reduce accounts receivables in the country and generate cash collections of over $200 million, a significant improvement over our performance in the same quarter last year.
Moving on to Asia. Revenue in the region grew by 9% in the quarter compared to 2015, driven mainly by increased sales [ph] volume throughout the region. Improving weather conditions in Australia created strong demand for [ph] herbicide and for our fungicide portfolio. A return to a more normal monsoon season in India and Southeast Asia supported increased demand for insecticide and fungicide, with strong growth in Indonesia for rice applications.
In Europe, revenue increased 6% in the quarter. Increased sales [ph] synergies and higher volume in Eastern Europe as we expand our direct market access, coupled with strong herbicide sales in the U.K, more than offset challenging conditions in Northwest Europe.
In North America, revenue in the quarter increased 46% to 2015. We saw higher sales volumes related to new product introduction for winter and spring week and increased demand for herbicide.
Looking ahead to Q4, we expect market conditions to remain largely unchanged. We are cautiously optimistic regarding Q4 in Latin America given the start of the selling season in Brazil and strong demand for FMC product elsewhere in the region. However, we are more cautious on market conditions in North America, where we expect weak market conditions into 2016/2017 crop season.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings to be between $117 million and $137 million. At the midpoint, leasing pipe [ph] segment earnings growth of approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Improved U.S. dollar pricing in Brazil and lower costs year-over-year are expected to drive a meaningful increase in segment earnings margin in the quarter from 15% in 2016 to closer to 20%. 
We are pleased with the progress made in Ag Solutions to drive margin improvements in the business. Prior to the acquisition of Cheminova, Ag Solutions consistently delivered consolidated operating margins between 20% and 25%, and we are well on our way to returning margins to that level. We are tightening our full year segment earnings guidance to $390 million to $410 million with the midpoint of our range unchanged and continue to forecast full year revenue of about $2.3 billion at the midpoint.
Turning next to Health and Nutrition on Slide 4. For the third quarter, Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $179 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined 9% year-over-year, largely as a result of lower volume. Timing of sales to certain pharma customers in Asia and Europe and headwinds from omega-3 each contributed to the volume decline.
Segment earnings of $45 million declined 4% compared to 2015. However, operating margin improved 120 basis points to over 25% in the quarter. The negative impact of lower volumes and product mix was largely offset by lower operating costs as a result of ongoing operating excellence programs.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $53 million and $57 million and for the full year forecast statement earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $194 million. At the midpoint, Q4 segment earnings are expected to increase almost 20% compared to Q4 2015. The bulk of the increase in segment earnings is due to the timing of certain favorable cost variances from prior period, which will drive segment earnings margins to between 29% and 30% in the quarter. For the full year, we expect margins of about 25% to 26%.
Moving on to Lithium on Slide 5. Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 22% to $70 million on the back of increased price and more favorable mix. Segment earnings rose to $18 million from just $2 million last year. Market conditions remained favorable, with demand increasing ahead of supply. As a result, prices across the portfolio were higher compared to the last year. These price increases, combined with most favorable sales mix, lower costs and benefit from foreign currency, drove the improvement in segment earnings and margin in the quarter.
We expect the positive momentum in Lithium to continue with fourth quarter segment earnings between $16 million and $20 million, approximately 60% higher year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. Based on Lithium's performance to date and our expectation for Q4, we are increasing full year guidance for segment earnings by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $65 million to $69 million. Full year segment earnings margin should be about 25% compared to 10% in 2015.
Before turning the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 6. We are tightening full year segment earnings guidance for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition and increasing guidance for Lithium. Based on this segment guidance and lower tax rate, which Paul will discuss in a moment, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.92 and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $2.76 to $2.86.
I will now turn the call over to Paul."
28606,403765323,1071739,"FMC Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pierre. I'll start with the tax rate and the noncontrolling interest on the income statements before I move on to the impact of currency, cash flow and the balance sheet.So first, tax. Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 2",721,"Thank you, Pierre. I'll start with the tax rate and the noncontrolling interest on the income statements before I move on to the impact of currency, cash flow and the balance sheet.
So first, tax. Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 23.5%, which is slightly lower than we initially expected. This is driven by an increase in the contribution of earnings from our foreign entities compared to prior years. And while this trend is most apparent in Ag Solutions, we're actually seeing it in all of our businesses. We expect the adjusted effective rates to be in the 23% to 24% range for the fourth quarter. And looking into 2017, we expect that rate will made for [ph] by as much as 3 percentage points, resulting in a full year adjusted effective tax rate closer to 21%. This further reduction is mainly the result of the operational integration of Cheminova, which will impact our supply chain and our earnings mix globally.
Our noncontrolling interest line continues to shrink as part of the integration of Cheminova. We've been taking advantage of opportunities to simplify the ownership structure of some of our international entities and have taken steps to consolidate ownership in places like Argentina, China and Eastern Europe. Largely as a result of these steps, we expect the noncontrolling interest line to [indiscernible] to approximately $5 million this year and remain near this level next year.
Tapping on currency. This quarter saw none of the rapid movements in major currencies that we saw last year. And as a result, FX had a far smaller impact on our results. Across all businesses and regions, currency was a tailwind to earnings, with a large favorable movement in Brazil, the biggest factor. The other major currencies towards FMC is exposed, namely the euro and RMB, had no meaningful impact on our earnings last quarter. For the year-to-date, currency has been good and [ph] neutral to earnings.
Moving on to cash flow on Slide 7. The first thing I want to point out is our increasing cash flow guidance for full year from a range of $450 million to $550 million to a range of $550 million to $600 million. The midpoint of this revised guidance reflects an increasing cash generation of almost 60% compared to 2015. Higher earnings, stronger working capital performance and tight spending discipline will all contribute to the year-over-year increase and give us confidence that the higher level of cash generation we've seen through the first 3 quarters will continue through Q4.
Underpinning our confidence in cash generation is our success in reducing our Brazil exposure. Through September, we collected over $500 million of receivables in Brazil, reducing the outstanding receivable balance by over $200 million. By the end of 2016, we expect to have collected over $700 million of outstanding receivables in Brazil alone. Equally importantly, a significant proportion of the collections are coming from those accounts that were past due at the start of the year, improving the quality of the remaining receivables balance.
Our receivables balance in Brazil, however, remains higher than we believe it should be. And we expect to continue to reduce it over the coming seasons. Based on our current visibility, we believe that we have the ability to reduce the current balance by approximately $400 million. We will deliver this reduction over the next 18 to 24 months.
Our strong cash generation has helped us reduce our net debt by over $200 million so far this year, and we expect this to fall further by year-end. Combined with higher trailing EBITDA, our adjusted net debt-to-LTM EBITDA ratio both fall into the 2.5 to 3x range as we enter 2017. We will continue to manage our debt to a level consistent with our current credit rating.
And looking into 2017, we expect our capital expenditure to remain similar to '16, at or just ahead of depreciation, leaving allowance for our planned expansions in lithium hydroxide. We will continue to seek out opportunities to invest in technologies and products for our Ag Solutions business. And at an appropriate time in 2017, we would expect to revisit our ability to engage in share repurchases while maintaining our other net debt, credit rating and investment objectives.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solu",909,"Before closing, I would like to share a few initial thoughts regarding 2017 on Slide 8. Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solutions.
Market demand in Europe and Asia continues to grow, and more normal weather conditions should lead to an improved demand environment in those regions next year. While it remains very early to predict the market crop protection chemical in Latin America, we are [ph] confident that we will enter 2017 with better market fundamentals that either of the previous 2 seasons.
In contrast, we expect market conditions in North America to remain challenging as we do not believe that the market-wide stalking [ph] process has run its course and that elevated levels of channel inventory, combined with low commodity prices, will dampen grower demand across the region.
In a flat market and assuming stable currencies, we believe Ag Solutions is well positioned to deliver another year of growth in segment earnings. Revenue synergy opportunities in Europe and North America, planned new product introductions and continued cost savings will more than offset cost inflation. Our preliminary view is that Ag Solutions segment earnings will grow by high single-digit percent in 2017.
In Health and Nutrition. Next year, we expect growth rate for revenue and segment earnings to return to historical levels below [ph] to mid-single-digit percent.
In Lithium, the combination of higher price, increased lithium hydroxide volume and continued cost discipline should increase segment earnings by about 40% in 2017. We expect to realize higher prices in all major downstream products next year, with the most significant increase in lithium hydroxide.
The majority of our lithium hydroxide contracts are negotiated in the fourth quarter. And based on the status of customer negotiations to date, we expect the average realized price to be significantly higher in 2017. We also expect to see a meaningful increase in the production of lithium hydroxide next year as a result of our previously announced capacity expansion. Construction of our hydroxide unit is ahead of schedule. Based on the current construction headlines, we expect production of lithium hydroxide to increase by 4,000 metric tons in 2017, with total production capacity decreasing -- increasing to 18,000 metric tons per year by the middle of next year.
Hitting [ph] the growth in demand for FMC's downstream lithium product requires access to increasing volume of lithium carbonate. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Nemaska Lithium to show [ph] 8,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate per year beginning in mid-2018. This agreement represents only one element of our sourcing strategy, and we are actively pursuing multiple paths to diversify our carbonate source.
In the near term, we will increase capacity at our Argentina operations by approximately 20% through [ph] low capital cost actions. We continue to evaluate long-term supply agreements and partnership with other producers of lithium carbonate, and we retain the option of expanding our carbonate production operation in Argentina in order to ensure we have a secure, reliable and cost-competitive supply of lithium carbonate.
At the corporate level, we expect costs to remain roughly flat and to continue to reduce debt. Combined with the lower tax rate for 2017, as Paul mentioned earlier, we expect to grow EPS at a faster rate than we grow operating earnings.
Consistent with prior years, we will provide more details and specific guidance for 2017 in February when we report our Q4 and full year 2016 results as we first need to see how the year ends and assess business and market conditions at that time.
To conclude, I am very pleased with our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In volatile markets, FMC has continued to execute its strategy and deliver substantial growth in earnings. I believe we are positioned to continue this in Q4 and beyond. We continue to invest in our technology pipeline in Ag Solutions and are launching new products that bring greater value to the grower.
Last month, we announced that FMC has begun the registration process in North America of our Bixafen fungicide, 1 of the 9 active ingredients in our R&D pipeline. With our unique, high-return R&D model for active ingredient innovation and strong regional [ph] formulation capabilities, FMC is well positioned to deliver the technology and service that growers demand. We will provide additional information regarding our technology pipeline in the coming months.
Health and Nutrition continues to generate high margins and strong cash flow, and demand across our core nutrition and health market continues to grow.  We are in the process of commissioning our new MCC production facility in Thailand, which will serve the growing nutrition market in Asia. Demand for a downstream retail products continues to increase. FMC is well positioned to maintain its leading position in lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and lithium metals, and we continue to pursue multiple paths to diversify our sources of lithium carbonate to fill [ph] the expected growth in the business.
Our agreement with Nemaska is just trusted, [ph] and we look forward to announcing more action in 2017.
In closing, the actions we are taking will continue to drive performance across our businesses and position FMC to deliver increasing value to our shareholders into 2017 and beyond. I thank you for your attention this morning.
With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We do have new products coming next year and the year after that are based upon our chromosome [ph] franchise for herbicides. So we expect to see significant growth in herbicides as we move forward.

So we believe there are actions, which are being taken for insecticide and another product to decrease the level of inventory in the channel. The discussions with growers are better. There is -- they are easier on pricing. They are easier on term, and our volumes are more predictable . So we do believe it is decreasing. We don't believe it's decreasing fast enough to create a very rubbish 2017 number.

I would say the cotton growers have faced a very tough time in the north due to the drought. So liquidity is important for them, and we're watching that situation very carefully. Acres are expected to be flat to slightly down in Brazil as we go forward into the next season. Switching to sugarcane, you're right, sugar prices are at least double where they were last year. Ethanol prices were up in Brazil. So the fundamentals for the business is good. The one thing they are lacking right now is liquidity given all the debts they've incurred over the last few years. We're ideally positioned. We have strong market shares in insecticides and herbicides. Planting is down right now probably about 30% due to that liquidity. But I think as the business unwinds next year, I'm very confident that our sugarcane business will grow next year and be a good buffer for some of the other downsides we might see in cotton."

And sort of your margins have been in the past, very differentiated between sort of 25% level in the first half of the year and kind of 20% level in the second half of the year, given where the region said to get your sales from. This year, obviously, has been distorted by everything that's going on. So it's going to be more like first half and second half be more or less even in terms of margins. As the business gets back to sort of normal execution, how do we think about 2017 margin cadence? Should we expect sort of 3 to 4-point margin difference between the first half and the second half of the year? Or is it going to be more like this year were margins are a little bit more even between the quarters?"

But yes, the profile of the margin and the business is going to change versus historical FMC just because we have a very different regional profile. I mean, remember, we are very small in Europe. We want to be much bigger in Europe where there is good marginal business. So I would say that directionally, we should have less variation in our quarterly margins than we had in the past. Now there is 2 things happening today, is there is the market situation. There is a different approach we are taking to the Latin America market and there is in the cost synergies, which are growing quarter after quarter. So that is taking us to improve margin and taking us to the 20% range. But I would say in the future, you'll have more stable margin quarter-over-quarter."

Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS i",1470,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS increased approximately 60% compared to the third quarter of 2015, exceeding the top end of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.63.
Our performance for the quarter was driven largely by the results of Ag Solutions and Lithium, both of which reported a significant year-over-year increase in segment earnings.
In Ag Solutions, compared to last year, we saw an improved start of the season in Latin America, especially in Brazil, a stronger performance in both Asia and North America. Lithium continued to benefit from higher prices, improved mix and lower operating costs. Third quarter segment earnings in Health and Nutrition, there is -- were slightly below 2015 but in line with our expectation.
The lower tax rate in the quarter contributed approximately $0.03 to adjusted EPS. As noted in our outlook statement, and as Paul will discuss later in the call, we expect to continue to report a lower tax rate for the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Based on our performance in the third quarter and on our outlook for Q4, we are revising the range of our full-range adjusted EPS guidance to $2.76 to $2.86 per share. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of $0.06 per share compared to the prior period and an increase of $0.14 compared to adjusted EPS for 2015. I will provide more detail on the outlook for Q4 shortly. But first, I will discuss third quarter results for each of our 3 segments, starting with Ag Solutions on Slide 2.
For the third quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $559 million and segment earnings at the top of the guidance range of $90 million. Compared to the third quarter 2015, revenue declined 3% as lower sales volume in Brazil more than offset the benefit of higher prices in that country and volume growth in other regions.
Year-over-year price increases were largest in Brazil, where we continue to recover pricing in U.S. dollar terms. Segment earnings increased over 50%, and margin improved 600 basis points, as higher realized prices, improved mix and favorable foreign exchange more than offset the impact of lower volumes and slightly higher costs in the quarter.
Costs were higher, principally as the result of the timing between quarters of certain expenses. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our integration cost savings target.
Turning to Slide 3. I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance and discuss the outlook for Q4, starting with Latin America.
Revenue in the region declined 18% in the quarter, driven largely by lower sales volumes in Brazil. General market weakness, ongoing product rationalization efforts and our decision to allow channel inventory levels to reduce each contributed to the decline in sales volume in Brazil. The elimination of low-margin third-party products accounted for over 50% of the volume decline in the quarter.
Revenue in the rest of Latin America was roughly flat compared to 2015. In Argentina, we continued to see increasing demand for FMC's Authority herbicides. In Mexico, our focus on high-value crops is helping to offset the impact of a broader market decline.
The actions we have taken throughout the past year in Brazil enabled us to realize significant increases in U.S. dollar-based prices, improve operating margin and drive collections in the quarter. Price actions increased operating earnings in Brazil by about 30% year-over-year, which, combined with lower operating costs, returned operating margins to 2014 levels.
Our actions in Brazil also enabled the business to reduce accounts receivables in the country and generate cash collections of over $200 million, a significant improvement over our performance in the same quarter last year.
Moving on to Asia. Revenue in the region grew by 9% in the quarter compared to 2015, driven mainly by increased sales volume throughout the region. Improving weather conditions in Australia created strong demand for all-grade herbicide and for our fungicide portfolio. A return to a more normal monsoon season in India and Southeast Asia supported increased demand for insecticide and fungicide, with strong growth in Indonesia for rice applications.
In Europe, revenue increased 6% in the quarter. Increased sales synergies and higher volume in Eastern Europe as we expand our direct market access, coupled with strong herbicide sales in the U.K, more than offset challenging conditions in Northwest Europe.
In North America, revenue in the quarter increased 46% to 2015. We saw higher sales volumes related to new product introduction for winter and spring week and increased demand for herbicide.
Looking ahead to Q4, we expect market conditions to remain largely unchanged. We are cautiously optimistic regarding Q4 in Latin America given the start of the selling season in Brazil and strong demand for FMC product elsewhere in the region. However, we are more cautious on market conditions in North America, where we expect weak market conditions into 2016/2017 crop season.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings to be between $117 million and $137 million. At the midpoint, this implies segment earnings growth of approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Improved U.S. dollar pricing in Brazil and lower costs year-over-year are expected to drive a meaningful increase in segment earnings margin in the quarter from 15% in 2016 to closer to 20%. 
We are pleased with the progress made in Ag Solutions to drive margin improvements in the business. Prior to the acquisition of Cheminova, Ag Solutions consistently delivered consolidated operating margins between 20% and 25%, and we are well on our way to returning margins to that level. We are tightening our full year segment earnings guidance to $390 million to $410 million with the midpoint of our range unchanged and continue to forecast full year revenue of about $2.3 billion at the midpoint.
Turning next to Health and Nutrition on Slide 4. For the third quarter, Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $179 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined 9% year-over-year, largely as a result of lower volume. Timing of sales to certain pharma customers in Asia and Europe and headwinds from omega-3 each contributed to the volume decline.
Segment earnings of $45 million declined 4% compared to 2015. However, operating margin improved 120 basis points to over 25% in the quarter. The negative impact of lower volumes and product mix was largely offset by lower operating costs as a result of ongoing operating excellence programs.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $53 million and $57 million and for the full year forecast segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $194 million. At the midpoint, Q4 segment earnings are expected to increase almost 20% compared to Q4 2015. The bulk of the increase in segment earnings is due to the timing of certain favorable cost variances from prior period, which will drive segment earnings margin to between 29% and 30% in the quarter. For the full year, we expect margin of about 25% to 26%.
Moving on to Lithium on Slide 5. Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 22% to $70 million on the back of increased price and more favorable mix. Segment earnings rose to $18 million from just $2 million last year. Market conditions remained favorable, with demand increasing ahead of supply. As a result, prices across the portfolio were higher compared to the last year. These price increases, combined with most favorable sales mix, lower costs and the benefit from foreign currency, drove the improvement in segment earnings and margin in the quarter.
We expect the positive momentum in Lithium to continue with fourth quarter segment earnings between $16 million and $20 million, approximately 60% higher year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. Based on Lithium's performance to date and our expectation for Q4, we are increasing full year guidance for segment earnings by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $65 million to $69 million. Full year segment earnings margin should be about 25% compared to 10% in 2015.
Before turning the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 6. We are tightening full year segment earnings guidance for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition and increasing guidance for Lithium. Based on this segment guidance and the lower tax rate, which Paul will discuss in a moment, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.92 and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $2.76 to $2.86.
I will now turn the call over to Paul."
28606,403765323,1072124,"FMC Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pierre. I'll start with the tax rate and the noncontrolling interest on the income statements before I move on to the impact of currency, cash flow and the balance sheet.So first, tax. Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 2",725,"Thank you, Pierre. I'll start with the tax rate and the noncontrolling interest on the income statements before I move on to the impact of currency, cash flow and the balance sheet.
So first, tax. Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 23.5%, which is slightly lower than we initially expected. This is driven by an increase in the contribution of earnings from our foreign entities compared to prior years. And while this trend is most apparent in Ag Solutions, we're actually seeing it in all of our businesses. We expect the adjusted effective rate to be in the 23% to 24% range for the fourth quarter. And looking into 2017, we expect that rate may fall by as much as 3 percentage points, resulting in a full year adjusted effective tax rate closer to 21%. This further reduction is mainly the result of the operational integration of Cheminova, which will impact our supply chain and our earnings mix globally.
Our noncontrolling interest line continues to shrink as part of the integration of Cheminova. We've been taking advantage of opportunities to simplify the ownership structure of some of our international entities and are taking -- or have taken steps to consolidate ownership in places such as Argentina, China and Eastern Europe. Largely as a result of these steps, we expect the noncontrolling interest line to fall through approximately $5 million this year and remain near this level next year.
Tapping on currency. This quarter saw none of the rapid movements in major currencies that we saw last year. And as a result, FX had a far smaller impact on our results. Across all businesses and regions, currency was a tailwind to earnings with a large favorable movement in Brazil, the biggest factor. The other major currencies for which FMC is exposed, namely the euro and RMB, had no meaningful impact on our earnings in the quarter. For the year-to-date, currency has been good and neutral to earnings.
Moving on to cash flow on Slide 7. The first thing I want to point out is our increasing cash flow guidance for full year from a range of $450 million to $550 million to a range of $550 million to $600 million. The midpoint of this revised guidance reflects an increasing cash generation of almost 60% compared to 2015. Higher earnings, stronger working capital performance and tight spending discipline will all contribute to the year-over-year increase and give us confidence that the higher level of cash generation we've seen through the first 3 quarters will continue through Q4.
Underpinning our confidence in cash generation is our success in reducing our Brazil exposure. Through September, we collected over $500 million of receivables in Brazil, reducing the outstanding receivable balance by over $200 million. By the end of 2016, we expect to have collected over $700 million of outstanding receivables in Brazil alone. Equally importantly, a significant proportion of the collections are coming from those accounts that were past due at the start of the year, improving the quality of the remaining receivables balance.
Our receivables balance in Brazil, however, remains higher than we believe it should be. And we expect to continue to reduce it over the coming seasons. Based on our current visibility, we believe that we have the ability to reduce the current balance by approximately $400 million. We will deliver this reduction over the next 18 to 24 months.
Our strong cash generation has helped us reduce our net debt by over $200 million so far this year, and we expect this to fall further by year-end. Combined with higher trailing EBITDA, our adjusted net debt-to-LTM EBITDA ratio will fall into the 2.5 to 3x range as we enter 2017. We will continue to manage our debt to a level consistent with our current credit rating.
And looking into 2017, we expect our capital expenditure to remain similar to '16, at or just ahead of depreciation, leaving allowance for our planned expansions in lithium hydroxide. We will continue to seek out opportunities to invest in technologies and products for our Ag Solutions business. And at an appropriate time in 2017, we would expect to revisit our ability to engage in share repurchases while maintaining our other net debt, credit rating and investment objectives.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solu",902,"Before closing, I would like to share a few initial thoughts regarding 2017 on Slide 8. Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solutions.
Market demand in Europe and Asia continues to grow, and more normal weather conditions should lead to an improved demand environment in those regions next year. While it remains very early to predict the market crop protection chemical in Latin America, we are quietly confident that we will enter 2017 with better market fundamentals than either of the previous 2 seasons.
In contrast, we expect market conditions in North America to remain challenging as we do not believe that the market-wide destocking process has run its course and that elevated levels of channel inventory, combined with low commodity prices, will dampen grower demand across the region.
In a flat market and assuming stable currencies, we believe Ag Solutions is well positioned to deliver another year of growth in segment earnings. Revenue synergy opportunities in Europe and North America, planned new product introductions and continued cost savings will more than offset cost inflation. Our preliminary view is that Ag Solutions segment earnings will grow by high single-digit percent in 2017.
In Health and Nutrition. Next year, we expect growth rate for revenue and segment earnings to return to historical levels of low to mid-single-digit percent.
In Lithium, the combination of higher price, increased lithium hydroxide volume and continued cost discipline should increase segment earnings by about 40% in 2017. We expect to realize higher prices in all major downstream products next year, with the most significant increase in lithium hydroxide.
The majority of our lithium hydroxide contracts are negotiated in the fourth quarter. And based on the status of customer negotiations to date, we expect the average realized price to be significantly higher in 2017. We also expect to see a meaningful increase in the production of lithium hydroxide next year as a result of our previously announced capacity expansion. Construction of our hydroxide unit is ahead of schedule. Based on the current construction headlines, we expect production of lithium hydroxide to increase by 4,000 metric tons in 2017, with total production capacity decreasing -- increasing to 18,000 metric tons per year by the middle of next year.
Hitting the growth in demand for FMC's downstream lithium product requires access to increasing volume of lithium carbonate. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Nemaska Lithium to show us 8,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate per year beginning in mid-2018. This agreement represents only one element of the sourcing strategy, and we are actively pursuing multiple path to diversify our carbonate source.
In the near term, we will increase capacity at our Argentina operations by approximately 20% through low-capital cost actions. We continue to evaluate long-term supply agreements and partnerships with other producers of lithium carbonate, and we retain the option of expanding our carbonate production operation in Argentina in order to ensure we have a secure, reliable and cost-competitive supply of lithium carbonate.
At the corporate level, we expect costs to remain roughly flat and to continue to reduce debt. Combined with the lower tax rate for 2017, as Paul mentioned earlier, we expect to grow EPS at a faster rate than we grow operating earnings.
Consistent with prior years, we will provide more details and specific guidance for 2017 in February when we report our Q4 and full year 2016 results as we first need to see how the year ends and assess business and market conditions at that time.
To conclude, I am very pleased with our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In volatile markets, FMC has continued to execute its strategy and deliver substantial growth in earnings. I believe we are positioned to continue this in Q4 and beyond. We continue to invest in our technology pipeline in Ag Solutions and are launching new products that bring greater value to the grower.
Last month, we announced that FMC has begun the registration process in North America of our Bixafen fungicide, 1 of the 9 active ingredients in our R&D pipeline. With our unique, high-return R&D model for active ingredient innovation and strong regional formulation capabilities, FMC is well positioned to deliver the technology and service that growers demand. We will provide additional information regarding our technology pipeline in the coming months.
Health and Nutrition continues to generate high margins and strong cash flow, and demand across our core nutrition and health market continues to grow.  We are in the process of commissioning our new MCC production facility in Thailand, which will serve the growing nutrition market in Asia. Demand for our downstream retail products continues to increase. FMC is well positioned to maintain its leading position in lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and lithium metals, and we continue to pursue multiple path to diversify our sources of lithium carbonate to feed the expected growth in the business. Our agreement with Nemaska is just trusted, and we look forward to announcing more action in 2017.
In closing, the actions we are taking will continue to drive performance across our businesses and position FMC to deliver increasing value to our shareholders into 2017 and beyond. I thank you for your attention this morning.
With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions."

I think for us going forward in the next few years, it's very much what we've just said in terms of direct market access. We're very pleased with what we see in Eastern Europe, but we're working off of a pretty small base. And we have just purchased the JV that we had in Czechoslovakia, Poland. It's important for us to expand in that area. But we shouldn't forget that France, Germany, the U.K, Spain, Italy, they're all important markets where we intend to put new products into the pipeline. We do have new products coming next year and the year after that are based upon our clomazone franchise for herbicides. So we expect to see significant growth in herbicides as we move forward. And in addition, with the acquisition of Cheminova, we've also, as we've said, expanded our fungicide portfolio. So you'll see us grow our European fungicide business substantially over the next 3 to 5 years. That's mainly the growth for us."

But the situation in Brazil, including for insecticide, is right now feeling, I would say, more stable. As you can see, year-on-year numbers show a decrease in sales in addition to the progress utilization. So we believe there are actions which are being taken for insecticide and other product to decrease the level of inventory in the channel. The discussions with growers are better. There is -- they are easier on pricing. They are easier on term, and our volumes are more predictable . So we do believe it is decreasing. We don't believe it's decreasing fast enough to create a very rubbish 2017 number.

Chris, when you mentioned cotton and sugarcane, obviously, important crops for FMC down in Brazil. I'm more confident in sugarcane than I am in cotton. As we've talked about and Paul alluded to in terms of collections, we've been very prudent in our exposure to certain areas of Brazil and, certainly, in crops. I would say the cotton growers have faced a very tough time in the north due to the drought. So liquidity is important for them, and we're watching that situation very carefully. Acres are expected to be flat to slightly down in Brazil as we go forward into the next season. Switching to sugarcane, you're right, sugar prices are at least double where they were last year. Ethanol prices were up in Brazil. So the fundamentals for the business is good. The one thing they are lacking right now is liquidity given all the debts they've incurred over the last few years. We're ideally positioned. We have strong market shares in insecticides and herbicides. Planting is down right now, probably about 30% due to that liquidity. But I think as the business unwinds next year, I'm very confident that our sugarcane business will grow next year and be a good buffer for some of the other downsides we might see in cotton."

We are very cautious in not selling for the sake of selling. We are selling when we know we can get normal terms for the region and we will be able to collect.

And we had a plan to bring those margins through cost saving, pricing and new product introduction to the east to recall level of FMC. And that's the road we are on. I have to say that despite the market conditions, 1.5 years after closing on the Cheminova acquisition, we have brought back those margins to 20%, which is well -- for the fourth quarter, which is well in line, even ahead of our schedule. We still have work to do. We still have remember. We still have additional costs to extract from the business from the acquisition in the next 6 to 9 months. So we still have work.

I think if you can get those things coming together, you're going to see somewhat of a rebound in the marketplace. The pest pressures, obviously, nobody knows where the pest pressures are going to lie. Commodity prices are going to take some change in over yields in North America and Latin America. So we've said what we feel the market will be next year. Those will be the 2 items, in Brazil, in particular; and potentially, Argentina that would change that picture."

So to answer your question, I'm quite confident around that business for the next 2 to 3 years. We do have interesting new ideas based on the current product we have for new technology, for some of the changing market needs around health and other applications. The question for me is more 3 years and beyond. And really, where do we want to take that franchise? We have great product today. We have great margin and good cash generation. The first attempt to do that was omega-3. I think we didn't do a good job there. The question is what we want the business to be, not in next 2, 3 years but beyond that.

We do not expect to be in a meaningfully different place in terms of terms, in terms of structure, in terms of credit that we extend to customers, to either history or the rest of the market. But we will be much more and we are being much more disciplined about where we're willing to take exposure. It's really a function of multiple factors. It's a function of the movement in commodity prices. It's a function of the weaker access to credit for the growers down there in the market. And it is, to an extent, a function of our ability to integrate the Cheminova portfolio and have a higher margin, more technical portfolio really across all regions and all crops.

Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.
Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre."

Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS i",1470,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS increased approximately 60% compared to the third quarter of 2015, exceeding the top end of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.63.
Our performance for the quarter was driven largely by the results of Ag Solutions and Lithium, both of which reported a significant year-over-year increase in segment earnings.
In Ag Solutions, compared to last year, we saw an improved start of the season in Latin America, especially in Brazil, a stronger performance in both Asia and North America. Lithium continued to benefit from higher prices, improved mix and lower operating costs. Third quarter segment earnings in Health and Nutrition varied -- were slightly below 2015 but in line with our expectations.
The lower tax rate in the quarter contributed approximately $0.03 to adjusted EPS. As noted in our outlook statement, and as Paul will discuss later in the call, we expect to continue to report a lower tax rate for the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Based on our performance in the third quarter and on our outlook for Q4, we are revising the range of our full-range adjusted EPS guidance to $2.76 to $2.86 per share. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of $0.06 per share compared to the prior period and an increase of $0.14 compared to adjusted EPS for 2015. I will provide more detail on the outlook for Q4 shortly. But first, I will discuss third quarter results for each of our 3 segments, starting with Ag Solutions on Slide 2.
For the third quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $559 million and segment earnings at the top of our guidance range of $90 million. Compared to the third quarter 2015, revenue declined 3%, as lower sales volume in Brazil more than offset the benefit of higher prices in that country and volume growth in other regions.
Year-over-year price increases were largest in Brazil, where we continue to recover pricing in U.S. dollar terms. Segment earnings increased over 50%, and margin improved 600 basis points, as higher realized prices, improved mix and favorable foreign exchange more than offset the impact of lower volumes and slightly higher costs in the quarter.
Costs were higher, principally as the result of the timing between quarters of certain expenses. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our integration cost savings target.
Turning to Slide 3. I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance and discuss the outlook for Q4, starting with Latin America.
Revenue in the region declined 18% in the quarter, driven largely by lower sales volumes in Brazil. General market weakness, ongoing product rationalization efforts and our decision to allow channel inventory levels to reduce each contributed to the decline in sales volume in Brazil. The elimination of low-margin third-party products accounted for over 50% of the volume decline in the quarter.
Revenue in the rest of Latin America was roughly flat compared to 2015. In Argentina, we continued to see increasing demand for FMC's Authority herbicides. In Mexico, our focus on high-value crops is helping to offset the impact of a broader market decline.
The actions we have taken throughout the past year in Brazil enabled us to realize significant increases in U.S. dollar-based prices, improve operating margin and drive collections in the quarter. Price actions increased operating earnings in Brazil by about 30% year-over-year, which, combined with lower operating costs, returned operating margins to 2014 levels.
Our actions in Brazil also enabled the business to reduce accounts receivables in the country and generate cash collections of over $200 million, a significant improvement over our performance in the same quarter last year.
Moving on to Asia. Revenue in the region grew by 9% in the quarter compared to 2015, driven mainly by increased sales volume throughout the region. Improving weather conditions in Australia created strong demand for all-grade herbicide and for our fungicide portfolio. A return to a more normal monsoon season in India and Southeast Asia supported increased demand for insecticide and fungicide, with strong growth in Indonesia for rice applications.
In Europe, revenue increased 6% in the quarter. Increased sales synergies and higher volume in Eastern Europe as we expand our direct market access, coupled with strong herbicide sales in the U.K., more than offset challenging conditions in Northwest Europe.
In North America, revenue in the quarter increased 46% to 2015. We saw higher sales volumes related to new product introductions for winter and spring wheat and increased demand for herbicide.
Looking ahead to Q4, we expect market conditions to remain largely unchanged. We are cautiously optimistic regarding Q4 in Latin America given the start of the selling season in Brazil and strong demand for FMC product elsewhere in the region. However, we are more cautious on market conditions in North America, where we expect weak market conditions into 2016/2017 crop season.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings to be between $117 million and $137 million. At the midpoint, this implies segment earnings growth of approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Improved U.S. dollar pricing in Brazil and lower costs year-over-year are expected to drive a meaningful increase in segment earnings margin in the quarter from 15% in 2016 to closer to 20%. 
We are pleased with the progress made in Ag Solutions to drive margin improvements in the business. Prior to the acquisition of Cheminova, Ag Solutions consistently delivered consolidated operating margins between 20% and 25%, and we are well on our way to returning margins to that level. We are tightening our full year segment earnings guidance to $390 million to $410 million, with the midpoint of our range unchanged, and continue to forecast full year revenue of about $2.3 billion at the midpoint.
Turning next to Health and Nutrition on Slide 4. For the third quarter, Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $179 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined 9% year-over-year, largely as a result of lower volume. Timing of sales to certain pharma customers in Asia and Europe and headwinds from omega-3 each contributed to the volume declines.
Segment earnings of $45 million declined 4% compared to 2015. However, operating margin improved 120 basis points to over 25% in the quarter. The negative impact of lower volumes and product mix was largely offset by lower operating costs as a result of ongoing operating excellence programs.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $53 million and $57 million and for the full year forecast segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $194 million. At the midpoint, Q4 segment earnings are expected to increase almost 20% compared to Q4 2015. The bulk of the increase in segment earnings is due to the timing of certain favorable cost variances from prior period, which will drive segment earnings margin to between 29% and 30% in the quarter. For the full year, we expect margins of about 25% to 26%.
Moving on to Lithium on Slide 5. Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 22% to $70 million on the back of increased price and more favorable mix. Segment earnings rose to $18 million from just $2 million last year. Market conditions remained favorable, with demand increasing ahead of supply. As a result, prices across the portfolio were higher compared to the last year. These price increases, combined with the most favorable sales mix, lower costs and the benefit from foreign currency, drove the improvement in segment earnings and margin in the quarter.
We expect the positive momentum in Lithium to continue, with fourth quarter segment earnings between $16 million and $20 million, approximately 60% higher year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. Based on Lithium's performance to date and our expectation for Q4, we are increasing full year guidance for segment earnings by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $65 million to $69 million. Full year segment earnings margin should be about 25% compared to 10% in 2015.
Before turning the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 6. We are tightening full year segment earnings guidance for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition and increasing guidance for Lithium. Based on this segment's guidance and the lower tax rate, which Paul will discuss in a moment, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.92 and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $2.76 to $2.86.
I will now turn the call over to Paul."
28606,403765323,1072490,"FMC Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pierre. I'll start with the tax rate and the noncontrolling interest on the income statements before I move on to the impact of currency, cash flow and the balance sheet.So first, tax. Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 2",724,"Thank you, Pierre. I'll start with the tax rate and the noncontrolling interest on the income statements before I move on to the impact of currency, cash flow and the balance sheet.
So first, tax. Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 23.5%, which is slightly lower than we initially expected. This is driven by an increase in the contribution of earnings from our foreign entities compared to prior years. And while this trend is most apparent in Ag Solutions, we're actually seeing it in all of our businesses. We expect the adjusted effective rate to be in the 23% to 24% range for the fourth quarter. And looking into 2017, we expect that rate may fall by as much as 3 percentage points, resulting in a full year adjusted effective tax rate closer to 21%. This further reduction is mainly the result of the operational integration of Cheminova, which will impact our supply chain and our earnings mix globally.
Our noncontrolling interest line continues to shrink as part of the integration of Cheminova. We've been taking advantage of opportunities to simplify the ownership structure of some of our international entities and are taking or have taken steps to consolidate ownership in places such as Argentina, China and Eastern Europe. Largely as a result of these steps, we expect the noncontrolling interest line to fall to approximately $5 million this year and remain near this level next year.
Talking on currency. This quarter saw none of the rapid movements in major currencies that we saw last year. And as a result, FX had a far smaller impact on our results. Across all businesses and regions, currency was a tailwind to earnings, with a large favorable movement in Brazil the biggest factor. The other major currencies for which FMC is exposed, namely the euro and RMB, had no meaningful impact on our earnings in the quarter. For the year-to-date, currency has been good and neutral to earnings.
Moving on to cash flow on Slide 7. The first thing I want to point out is our increasing cash flow guidance for full year from a range of $450 million to $550 million to a range of $550 million to $600 million. The midpoint of this revised guidance reflects an increasing cash generation of almost 60% compared to 2015. Higher earnings, stronger working capital performance and tight spending discipline were all contributors to the year-over-year increase and give us confidence that the higher level of cash generation we've seen through the first 3 quarters will continue through Q4.
Underpinning our confidence in cash generation is our success in reducing our Brazil exposure. Through September, we collected over $500 million of receivables in Brazil, reducing the outstanding receivable balance by over $200 million. By the end of 2016, we expect to have collected over $700 million of outstanding receivables in Brazil alone. Equally importantly, a significant proportion of the collections are coming from those accounts that were past due at the start of the year, improving the quality of the remaining receivables balance.
Our receivables balance in Brazil, however, remains higher than we believe it should be. And we expect to continue to reduce it over the coming seasons. Based on our current visibility, we believe that we have the ability to reduce the current balance by approximately $400 million. We will deliver this reduction over the next 18 to 24 months.
Our strong cash generation has helped us reduce our net debt by over $200 million so far this year, and we expect this to fall further by year-end. Combined with higher trailing EBITDA, our adjusted net debt-to-LTM EBITDA ratio will fall into the 2.5 to 3x range as we enter 2017. We will continue to manage our debt to a level consistent with our current credit rating.
And looking into 2017, we expect our capital expenditure to remain similar to '16, at or just ahead of depreciation, leaving allowance for our planned expansions in lithium hydroxide. We will continue to seek out opportunities to invest in technologies and products for our Ag Solutions business. And at an appropriate time in 2017, we would expect to revisit our ability to engage in share repurchases while maintaining our other net debt, credit rating and investment objectives.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solu",901,"Before closing, I would like to share a few initial thoughts regarding 2017 on Slide 8. Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solutions.
Market demand in Europe and Asia continues to grow, and more normal weather conditions should lead to an improved demand environment in those regions next year. While it remains very early to predict the market crop protection chemical in Latin America, we are quietly confident that we will enter 2017 with better market fundamentals than either of the previous 2 seasons.
In contrast, we expect market conditions in North America to remain challenging as we do not believe that the market-wide destocking process has run its course and that elevated levels of channel inventory, combined with low commodity prices, will dampen grower demand across the region.
In a flat market and assuming stable currencies, we believe Ag Solutions is well positioned to deliver another year of growth in segment earnings. Revenue synergy opportunities in Europe and North America, planned new product introductions and continued cost savings will more than offset cost inflation. Our preliminary view is that Ag Solutions' segment earnings will grow by high single-digit percent in 2017.
In Health and Nutrition. Next year, we expect growth rate for revenue and segment earnings to return to historical levels of low to mid-single-digit percent.
In Lithium, the combination of higher price, increased lithium hydroxide volume and continued cost discipline should increase segment earnings by about 40% in 2017. We expect to realize higher prices in all major downstream products next year, with the most significant increase in lithium hydroxide.
The majority of our lithium hydroxide contracts are negotiated in the fourth quarter. And based on the status of customer negotiations to date, we expect the average realized price to be significantly higher in 2017. We also expect to see a meaningful increase in the production of lithium hydroxide next year as a result of our previously announced capacity expansion. Construction of our hydroxide unit is ahead of schedule. Based on the current construction headlines, we expect production of lithium hydroxide to increase by 4,000 metric tons in 2017, with total production capacity decreasing -- increasing to 18,000 metric tons per year by the middle of next year.
Hitting the growth in demand for FMC's downstream lithium product requires access to increasing volume of lithium carbonate. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Nemaska Lithium to source 8,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate per year beginning in mid-2018. This agreement represents only one element of the sourcing strategy, and we are actively pursuing multiple path to diversify our carbonate source.
In the near term, we will increase capacity at our Argentina operations by approximately 20% through low-capital cost actions. We continue to evaluate long-term supply agreements and partnerships with other producers of lithium carbonate, and we retain the option of expanding our carbonate production operation in Argentina in order to ensure we have a secure, reliable and cost-competitive supply of lithium carbonate.
At the corporate level, we expect costs to remain roughly flat and to continue to reduce debt. Combined with the lower tax rate for 2017, as Paul mentioned earlier, we expect to grow EPS at a faster rate than we grow operating earnings.
Consistent with prior years, we will provide more details and specific guidance for 2017 in February when we report our Q4 and full year 2016 results as we first need to see how the year ends and assess business and market conditions at that time.
To conclude, I am very pleased with our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In volatile markets, FMC has continued to execute its strategy and deliver substantial growth in earnings. I believe we are positioned to continue this in Q4 and beyond. We continue to invest in our technology pipeline in Ag Solutions and are launching new products that bring greater value to the grower.
Last month, we announced that FMC has begun the registration process in North America of our Bixafen fungicide, 1 of the 9 active ingredients in our R&D pipeline. With our unique, high-return R&D model for active ingredient innovation and strong regional formulation capabilities, FMC is well positioned to deliver the technology and service that growers demand. We will provide additional information regarding our technology pipeline in the coming months.
Health and Nutrition continues to generate high margins and strong cash flow, and demand across our core nutrition and health market continues to grow.  We are in the process of commissioning our new MCC production facility in Thailand, which will serve the growing nutrition market in Asia. Demand for our downstream lithium products continues to increase. FMC is well positioned to maintain its leading position in lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and lithium metals, and we continue to pursue multiple paths to diversify our sources of lithium carbonate to feed the expected growth in the business. Our agreement with Nemaska is just trusted, and we look forward to announcing more actions in 2017.
In closing, the actions we are taking will continue to drive performance across our businesses and position FMC to deliver increasing value to our shareholders into 2017 and beyond. I thank you for your attention this morning.
With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions."

But the situation in Brazil, including for insecticide, is right now feeling, I would say, more stable.

So we believe there are actions which are being taken for insecticides and other product to decrease the level of inventory in the channel. The discussions with growers are better. There is -- they are easier on pricing. They are easier on term, and our volumes are more predictable. So we do believe it is decreasing. We don't believe it's decreasing fast enough to create a very robust 2017 number.

Chris, when you mentioned cotton and sugarcane, obviously, important crops for FMC down in Brazil. I'm more confident in sugarcane than I am in cotton. As we've talked about and Paul alluded to in terms of collections, we've been very prudent in our exposure to certain areas of Brazil and, certainly, in crops. I would say the cotton growers have faced a very tough time in the north due to the drought. So liquidity is important for them, and we're watching that situation very carefully. Acres are expected to be flat to slightly down in Brazil as we go forward into the next season. Switching to sugarcane, you're right, sugar prices are at least double where they were last year. Ethanol prices were up in Brazil. So the fundamentals for the business is good. The one thing they are lacking right now is liquidity, given all the debts they've incurred over the last few years. We're ideally positioned. We have strong market shares in insecticides and herbicides. Planting is down right now, probably about 30% due to that liquidity. But I think as the business unwinds next year, I'm very confident that our sugarcane business will grow next year and be a good buffer for some of the other downsides we might see in cotton."

But we also realized that the margins Cheminova was realizing were not at the level of what we're expecting. And we had a plan to bring those margins through cost saving, pricing and new product introduction due to at least the recall level of FMC. And that's the road we are on. I have to say that despite the market conditions, 1.5 years after closing on the Cheminova acquisition, we have brought back those margins to 20%, which is well -- for the fourth quarter, which is well in line, even ahead, of our schedule. We still have work to do. We still have remember. We still have additional costs to extract from the business from the acquisition in the next 6 to 9 months. So we still have work. But we are well on our way to margin north of 20%. It is just the integration of Cheminova, the pricing of the technology and the new product introduction, but we are well on that road map right now."

There are times of the year, particularly off the coast of Norway, where we get a higher-quality seaweed, we have more access to the waters because of the favorable weather, what have you, that drive one-off opportunities in costs, and that -- and where our variances work, that flows through.

So we're going to be maybe on the lower end of the risk taking without fundamentally changing the way we look at other receivables."

Now there is 2 things happening today is, there is the market situation. There is a different approach we are taking to the Latin America market, and there is the cost synergies, which are growing quarter-after-quarter.

Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS i",1470,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS increased approximately 60% compared to the third quarter of 2015, exceeding the top end of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.63.
Our performance for the quarter was driven largely by the results of Ag Solutions and Lithium, both of which reported a significant year-over-year increase in segment earnings.
In Ag Solutions, compared to last year, we saw an improved start of the season in Latin America, especially in Brazil, a stronger performance in both Asia and North America. Lithium continued to benefit from higher prices, improved mix and lower operating costs. Third quarter segment earnings in Health and Nutrition varied -- were slightly below 2015 but in line with our expectations.
The lower tax rate in the quarter contributed approximately $0.03 to adjusted EPS. As noted in our outlook statement, and as Paul will discuss later in the call, we expect to continue to report a lower tax rate for the remainder of the year and into 2017.
Based on our performance in the third quarter and on our outlook for Q4, we are revising the range of our full-range adjusted EPS guidance to $2.76 to $2.86 per share. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of $0.06 per share compared to the prior period and an increase of $0.14 compared to adjusted EPS for 2015. I will provide more detail on the outlook for Q4 shortly. But first, I will discuss third quarter results for each of our 3 segments, starting with Ag Solutions on Slide 2.
For the third quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $559 million and segment earnings at the top of our guidance range of $90 million. Compared to the third quarter 2015, revenue declined 3%, as lower sales volume in Brazil more than offset the benefit of higher prices in that country and volume growth in other regions.
Year-over-year price increases were largest in Brazil, where we continue to recover pricing in U.S. dollar terms. Segment earnings increased over 50%, and margin improved 600 basis points, as higher realized prices, improved mix and favorable foreign exchange more than offset the impact of lower volumes and slightly higher costs in the quarter.
Costs were higher, principally as the result of the timing between quarters of certain expenses. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our integration cost savings target.
Turning to Slide 3. I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance and discuss the outlook for Q4, starting with Latin America.
Revenue in the region declined 18% in the quarter, driven largely by lower sales volumes in Brazil. General market weakness, ongoing product rationalization efforts and our decision to allow channel inventory levels to reduce each contributed to the decline in sales volume in Brazil. The elimination of low-margin third-party products accounted for over 50% of the volume decline in the quarter.
Revenue in the rest of Latin America was roughly flat compared to 2015. In Argentina, we continued to see increasing demand for FMC's Authority herbicides. In Mexico, our focus on high-value crops is helping to offset the impact of a broader market decline.
The actions we have taken throughout the past year in Brazil enabled us to realize significant increases in U.S. dollar-based prices, improve operating margin and drive collections in the quarter. Price actions increased operating earnings in Brazil by about 30% year-over-year, which, combined with lower operating costs, returned operating margins to 2014 levels.
Our actions in Brazil also enabled the business to reduce accounts receivables in the country and generate cash collections of over $200 million, a significant improvement over our performance in the same quarter last year.
Moving on to Asia. Revenue in the region grew by 9% in the quarter compared to 2015, driven mainly by increased sales volume throughout the region. Improving weather conditions in Australia created strong demand for all-grade herbicide and for our fungicide portfolio. A return to a more normal monsoon season in India and Southeast Asia supported increased demand for insecticide and fungicide, with strong growth in Indonesia for rice applications.
In Europe, revenue increased 6% in the quarter. Increased sales synergies and higher volume in Eastern Europe as we expand our direct market access, coupled with strong herbicide sales in the U.K., more than offset challenging conditions in Northwest Europe.
In North America, revenue in the quarter increased 46% to 2015. We saw higher sales volumes related to new product introductions for winter and spring wheat and increased demand for herbicide.
Looking ahead to Q4, we expect market conditions to remain largely unchanged. We are cautiously optimistic regarding Q4 in Latin America given the start of the selling season in Brazil and strong demand for FMC product elsewhere in the region. However, we are more cautious on market conditions in North America, where we expect weak market conditions into 2016/2017 crop season.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings to be between $117 million and $137 million. At the midpoint, this implies segment earnings growth of approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Improved U.S. dollar pricing in Brazil and lower costs year-over-year are expected to drive a meaningful increase in segment earnings margin in the quarter from 15% in 2016 to closer to 20%. 
We are pleased with the progress made in Ag Solutions to drive margin improvements in the business. Prior to the acquisition of Cheminova, Ag Solutions consistently delivered consolidated operating margins between 20% and 25%, and we are well on our way to returning margins to that level. We are tightening our full year segment earnings guidance to $390 million to $410 million, with the midpoint of our range unchanged, and continue to forecast full year revenue of about $2.3 billion at the midpoint.
Turning next to Health and Nutrition on Slide 4. For the third quarter, Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $179 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined 9% year-over-year, largely as a result of lower volume. Timing of sales to certain pharma customers in Asia and Europe and headwinds from omega-3 each contributed to the volume declines.
Segment earnings of $45 million declined 4% compared to 2015. However, operating margin improved 120 basis points to over 25% in the quarter. The negative impact of lower volumes and product mix was largely offset by lower operating costs as a result of ongoing operating excellence programs.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $53 million and $57 million and for the full year forecast segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $194 million. At the midpoint, Q4 segment earnings are expected to increase almost 20% compared to Q4 2015. The bulk of the increase in segment earnings is due to the timing of certain favorable cost variances from prior period, which will drive segment earnings margin to between 29% and 30% in the quarter. For the full year, we expect margins of about 25% to 26%.
Moving on to Lithium on Slide 5. Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 22% to $70 million on the back of increased price and more favorable mix. Segment earnings rose to $18 million from just $2 million last year. Market conditions remained favorable, with demand increasing ahead of supply. As a result, prices across the portfolio were higher compared to the last year. These price increases, combined with the most favorable sales mix, lower costs and the benefit from foreign currency, drove the improvement in segment earnings and margin in the quarter.
We expect the positive momentum in Lithium to continue, with fourth quarter segment earnings between $16 million and $20 million, approximately 60% higher year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. Based on Lithium's performance to date and our expectation for Q4, we are increasing full year guidance for segment earnings by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $65 million to $69 million. Full year segment earnings margin should be about 25% compared to 10% in 2015.
Before turning the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on Slide 6. We are tightening full year segment earnings guidance for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition and increasing guidance for Lithium. Based on this segment's guidance and the lower tax rate, which Paul will discuss in a moment, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.92 and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $2.76 to $2.86.
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 2",724,"Thank you, Pierre. I'll start with the tax rate and the noncontrolling interest on the income statements before I move on to the impact of currency, cash flow and the balance sheet.
So first, tax. Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 23.5%, which is slightly lower than we initially expected. This is driven by an increase in the contribution of earnings from our foreign entities compared to prior years. And while this trend is most apparent in Ag Solutions, we're actually seeing it in all of our businesses. We expect the adjusted effective rate to be in the 23% to 24% range for the fourth quarter. And looking into 2017, we expect that rate may fall by as much as 3 percentage points, resulting in a full year adjusted effective tax rate closer to 21%. This further reduction is mainly the result of the operational integration of Cheminova, which will impact our supply chain and our earnings mix globally.
Our noncontrolling interest line continues to shrink as part of the integration of Cheminova. We've been taking advantage of opportunities to simplify the ownership structure of some of our international entities and are taking or have taken steps to consolidate ownership in places such as Argentina, China and Eastern Europe. Largely as a result of these steps, we expect the noncontrolling interest line to fall to approximately $5 million this year and remain near this level next year.
Talking on currency. This quarter saw none of the rapid movements in major currencies that we saw last year. And as a result, FX had a far smaller impact on our results. Across all businesses and regions, currency was a tailwind to earnings, with a large favorable movement in Brazil the biggest factor. The other major currencies for which FMC is exposed, namely the euro and RMB, had no meaningful impact on our earnings in the quarter. For the year-to-date, currency has been good and neutral to earnings.
Moving on to cash flow on Slide 7. The first thing I want to point out is our increasing cash flow guidance for full year from a range of $450 million to $550 million to a range of $550 million to $600 million. The midpoint of this revised guidance reflects an increasing cash generation of almost 60% compared to 2015. Higher earnings, stronger working capital performance and tight spending discipline were all contributors to the year-over-year increase and give us confidence that the higher level of cash generation we've seen through the first 3 quarters will continue through Q4.
Underpinning our confidence in cash generation is our success in reducing our Brazil exposure. Through September, we collected over $500 million of receivables in Brazil, reducing the outstanding receivable balance by over $200 million. By the end of 2016, we expect to have collected over $700 million of outstanding receivables in Brazil alone. Equally importantly, a significant proportion of the collections are coming from those accounts that were past due at the start of the year, improving the quality of the remaining receivables balance.
Our receivables balance in Brazil, however, remains higher than we believe it should be. And we expect to continue to reduce it over the coming seasons. Based on our current visibility, we believe that we have the ability to reduce the current balance by approximately $400 million. We will deliver this reduction over the next 18 to 24 months.
Our strong cash generation has helped us reduce our net debt by over $200 million so far this year, and we expect this to fall further by year-end. Combined with higher trailing EBITDA, our adjusted net debt-to-LTM EBITDA ratio will fall into the 2.5 to 3x range as we enter 2017. We will continue to manage our debt to a level consistent with our current credit rating.
And looking into 2017, we expect our capital expenditure to remain similar to '16, at or just ahead of depreciation, leaving allowance for our planned expansions in lithium hydroxide. We will continue to seek out opportunities to invest in technologies and products for our Ag Solutions business. And at an appropriate time in 2017, we would expect to revisit our ability to engage in share repurchases while maintaining our other net debt, credit rating and investment objectives.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre."

Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solu",901,"Before closing, I would like to share a few initial thoughts regarding 2017 on Slide 8. Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solutions.
Market demand in Europe and Asia continues to grow, and more normal weather conditions should lead to an improved demand environment in those regions next year. While it remains very early to predict the market crop protection chemical in Latin America, we are quietly confident that we will enter 2017 with better market fundamentals than either of the previous 2 seasons.
In contrast, we expect market conditions in North America to remain challenging as we do not believe that the market-wide destocking process has run its course and that elevated levels of channel inventory, combined with low commodity prices, will dampen grower demand across the region.
In a flat market and assuming stable currencies, we believe Ag Solutions is well positioned to deliver another year of growth in segment earnings. Revenue synergy opportunities in Europe and North America, planned new product introductions and continued cost savings will more than offset cost inflation. Our preliminary view is that Ag Solutions' segment earnings will grow by high single-digit percent in 2017.
In Health and Nutrition. Next year, we expect growth rate for revenue and segment earnings to return to historical levels of low to mid-single-digit percent.
In Lithium, the combination of higher price, increased lithium hydroxide volume and continued cost discipline should increase segment earnings by about 40% in 2017. We expect to realize higher prices in all major downstream products next year, with the most significant increase in lithium hydroxide.
The majority of our lithium hydroxide contracts are negotiated in the fourth quarter. And based on the status of customer negotiations to date, we expect the average realized price to be significantly higher in 2017. We also expect to see a meaningful increase in the production of lithium hydroxide next year as a result of our previously announced capacity expansion. Construction of our hydroxide unit is ahead of schedule. Based on the current construction headlines, we expect production of lithium hydroxide to increase by 4,000 metric tons in 2017, with total production capacity decreasing -- increasing to 18,000 metric tons per year by the middle of next year.
Hitting the growth in demand for FMC's downstream lithium product requires access to increasing volume of lithium carbonate. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Nemaska Lithium to source 8,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate per year beginning in mid-2018. This agreement represents only one element of the sourcing strategy, and we are actively pursuing multiple path to diversify our carbonate source.
In the near term, we will increase capacity at our Argentina operations by approximately 20% through low-capital cost actions. We continue to evaluate long-term supply agreements and partnerships with other producers of lithium carbonate, and we retain the option of expanding our carbonate production operation in Argentina in order to ensure we have a secure, reliable and cost-competitive supply of lithium carbonate.
At the corporate level, we expect costs to remain roughly flat and to continue to reduce debt. Combined with the lower tax rate for 2017, as Paul mentioned earlier, we expect to grow EPS at a faster rate than we grow operating earnings.
Consistent with prior years, we will provide more details and specific guidance for 2017 in February when we report our Q4 and full year 2016 results as we first need to see how the year ends and assess business and market conditions at that time.
To conclude, I am very pleased with our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In volatile markets, FMC has continued to execute its strategy and deliver substantial growth in earnings. I believe we are positioned to continue this in Q4 and beyond. We continue to invest in our technology pipeline in Ag Solutions and are launching new products that bring greater value to the grower.
Last month, we announced that FMC has begun the registration process in North America of our Bixafen fungicide, 1 of the 9 active ingredients in our R&D pipeline. With our unique, high-return R&D model for active ingredient innovation and strong regional formulation capabilities, FMC is well positioned to deliver the technology and service that growers demand. We will provide additional information regarding our technology pipeline in the coming months.
Health and Nutrition continues to generate high margins and strong cash flow, and demand across our core nutrition and health market continues to grow.  We are in the process of commissioning our new MCC production facility in Thailand, which will serve the growing nutrition market in Asia. Demand for our downstream lithium products continues to increase. FMC is well positioned to maintain its leading position in lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and lithium metals, and we continue to pursue multiple paths to diversify our sources of lithium carbonate to feed the expected growth in the business. Our agreement with Nemaska is just trusted, and we look forward to announcing more actions in 2017.
In closing, the actions we are taking will continue to drive performance across our businesses and position FMC to deliver increasing value to our shareholders into 2017 and beyond. I thank you for your attention this morning.
With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions."

But the situation in Brazil, including for insecticide, is right now feeling, I would say, more stable. As you can see, year-on-year numbers show a decrease in sales in addition to the progress utilization. So we believe there are actions which are being taken for insecticides and other product to decrease the level of inventory in the channel. The discussions with growers are better. There is -- they are easier on pricing. They are easier on term, and our volumes are more predictable. So we do believe it is decreasing. We don't believe it's decreasing fast enough to create a very robust 2017 number.

Chris, when you mentioned cotton and sugarcane, obviously, important crops for FMC down in Brazil. I'm more confident in sugarcane than I am in cotton. As we've talked about and Paul alluded to in terms of collections, we've been very prudent in our exposure to certain areas of Brazil and, certainly, in crops. I would say the cotton growers have faced a very tough time in the north due to the drought. So liquidity is important for them, and we're watching that situation very carefully. Acres are expected to be flat to slightly down in Brazil as we go forward into the next season. Switching to sugarcane, you're right, sugar prices are at least double where they were last year. Ethanol prices were up in Brazil. So the fundamentals for the business is good. The one thing they are lacking right now is liquidity, given all the debts they've incurred over the last few years. We're ideally positioned. We have strong market shares in insecticides and herbicides. Planting is down right now, probably about 30% due to that liquidity. But I think as the business unwinds next year, I'm very confident that our sugarcane business will grow next year and be a good buffer for some of the other downsides we might see in cotton."

But we also realized that the margins Cheminova was realizing were not at the level of what we're expecting. And we had a plan to bring those margins through cost saving, pricing and new product introduction due to at least the recall level of FMC. And that's the road we are on. I have to say that despite the market conditions, 1.5 years after closing on the Cheminova acquisition, we have brought back those margins to 20%, which is well -- for the fourth quarter, which is well in line, even ahead, of our schedule. We still have work to do. We still have remember. We still have additional costs to extract from the business from the acquisition in the next 6 to 9 months. So we still have work.

We're going to be able to start to add products coming out of the plants in the first quarter, and then we're going to start to enter the customer qualifications of the products. So we believe we'll be in a commercial situation where the products are produced by the plant, by the expansion and qualifying the customer by the middle of the year.

And once again, it's a bit early for us to break down by quarter. We've given a directional number. But yes, the profile of the margins and the business is going to change versus historical FMC just because we have a very different regional profile. I mean, remember, we are very small in Europe. We want to be much bigger in Europe where there is good marginal business. So I would say that directionally, we should have less variation in our quarterly margins than we had in the past. Now there is 2 things happening today is, there is the market situation. There is a different approach we are taking to the Latin America market, and there is the cost synergies, which are growing quarter-after-quarter. So that is taking us to improved margin and taking us to the 20% range. But I would say, in the future, you'll have more stable margin quarter-over-quarter."

So we're going to be even more dependent upon the price, the downstream business. We are expecting, I would say, little benefit from carbonate chloride pricing knowing that it's only a small percentage of our business, and we believe this pricing is going to level off in 2017. So you would consider the 40% improvement is going to mostly come from 2 things, pricing in lithium hydroxide and volume in lithium hydroxide. You will understand that I'm going to be a bit careful on what I'm expecting in terms of lithium hydroxide price increase because we are in the middle of the bunch of contract negotiations. So I'll -- we will give you more detail around pricing when we get to the February earnings call, because those negotiations will be behind us."

So we will not -- having a strategy to supply carbonate into our business based only or mostly on new entrants in this market. Nemaska, we believe, is one of the most solid today, with one of the best sources of lithium. So we believe it's a fairly certain supply we're going to get from them. But we will do 2 things. One is supply from existing suppliers, and not to forget that some of them are already supplying to us carbonate. And a similar goal, to repeat, we can also increase our own capacity of carbonate, which is something if we decide to do it, there will be a short supply."
