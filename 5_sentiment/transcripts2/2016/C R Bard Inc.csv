I would like to thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. I'd expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 40 minutes. You may note we have also placed a few slides on the Investor Relations page of our website to help you understand some of the moving pieces on our results and guidance to give you a little more clarity. Our discussions today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the fourth quarter; John Whalen, our President and COO, will cover fourth quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development pipeline; and then Chris Holland, our SVP and CFO, will cover the fourth quarter income statement, balance sheet and provide our financial guidance for 2016, and then we'll close with Q&A.
Fourth quarter 2015 net sales totaled $878.8 million. That's essentially flat on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant-currency basis over the fourth quarter of last year. Currency impact for the quarter versus prior year was unfavorable by about 300 basis points. Other nonoperating adjustments also negatively impacted revenue growth by about 200 basis points in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for these items are organic growth rate for Q4 2015 was 5.5%, which exceeded our guidance from 3 months earlier. We've provided a summary reconciliation of these quarterly revenue results on Slide 3 of the deck provided on the website that I just referenced.
Net sales for the full year were $3.4 billion. That's up 3% as reported and up 6% on a constant-currency basis. That correlates to approximately 6.8% organic growth for the year compared with our original guidance for the year of 4% to 5%. 
The U.S. launch of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon exceeded our expectations, and we're also pleased to see the acceleration of the rest of the portfolio in 2015. It's notable that every business was at the top or above the revenue guidance ranges we provided a year ago. 
Net income for the fourth quarter was $136.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.79. That's up 2% and 4%, respectively. Excluding items that affect the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, fourth quarter 2015 net income and diluted cash earnings per share, which exclude amortization of intangibles, were $164.6 million and $2.43. That's up 4% and 6%, respectively. 
Full year 2015 net income was $135.4 million and diluted EPS was $1.77. Excluding items that affect comparability between periods, full year 2015 net income was $615.8 million, and diluted cash EPS was $9.08. That's up 5% and 8%, respectively. These results exceeded our original guidance for the year despite an estimated additional $0.15 of headwind during the year from a combination of additional FX headwinds and dilution from acquisitions during the year.
Looking at the fourth quarter revenue growth geographically compared to the prior year on a constant-currency basis, net sales in the U.S. grew 2%. Internationally, we grew 5%, with Europe up 7%, Japan down 22%, and our other international geographies up 16%. 
To refresh your memory, the decline in Japan is due to the work down of inventory that was recorded as revenue when we sold into our Japanese joint venture prior to the acquisition of the joint venture. This issue should be substantially behind us after the first quarter of this year. As anticipated in our strategic investment plan, our emerging market sales continued to increase nicely and represented about 10% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at overall results with some historical context. 3 years ago, we announced our strategic investment plan to invest in advance of the receive of the Gore royalty. At that time, our organic revenue growth profile was essentially flat. We increased our annual spending in SG&A and R&D by combined $70 million. We designed the investment plan to return the revenue growth of our portfolio to above-market rates and to put the company in a better position for the longer term. We then said on this call a year ago that 2015 was a very important year of execution for us to begin to see the results from that investment plan. 
As we look at where we are today, our organic growth rate has accelerated again to the top tier of the sector. We're pleased with how our teams have executed the plan, and we believe we've built the business in a manner that's sustainable. We've been able to achieve our objectives while continuing to invest in future growth despite absorbing various headwinds along the way. So while we're pleased with the execution of the plan so far, our focus remains solidly on the future. We have many potential opportunities for strong growth in front of us. We believe we have significant room for growth in emerging markets. We also have several technology platforms that we believe provide us with billions of dollars of market opportunity to pursue through new indications and expanded market development and penetration. And the Japan joint venture and Liberator acquisitions provide us better access to customers with delivery platforms that we believe will position us well for the long term. So we remain in investment mode to pursue these opportunities. Our objective remains sustained above-market growth on the top line that we believe should provide an organic engine positioned for reliable and attractive profitability on the bottom line. Chris will give you more details when he lays out our financial guidance. 
We continue to believe that the effective execution of our strategic investment plan will allow us to continue to increase shareholder value over the long term on a sustainable basis. 
With that, let me turn you over now to John Weiland for a review of our fourth quarter product line revenue."

Total net sales in this category for",893,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, as usual, I'll be giving all percentage growth data and comparison to the prior year period on a constant-currency basis, unless otherwise noted.
So let's start with Vascular. Total net sales in this category for the quarter were $239.3 million, a decline of 2% on a reported basis and an increase of 1% on a constant-currency basis when compared to Q4 of 2014. Adjusting for the nonoperating items, global Vascular sales were up 5%, with the U.S. business down 3% for the quarter and international up 18%. Sales in our Vascular graft category were up 7% in Q4, which is above trend, driven by some timing issues within our OEM business. 
Excluding the Gore royalty, our Endovascular business grew 4% in the fourth quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy line was up 10%, driven by strength in emerging markets. Our peripheral PTA products were up 5% this quarter. As expected, the growth rate here was affected by the anniversary of the significant stocking event for Lutonix in Q4 of 2014 as well as the reduction in Japanese sales due to our inventory adjustment there. 
As Tim said, we are very pleased with the first year of our drug-coated balloon sales in the United States. Sales in Q4 were as expected, and we estimate that end customer use, which more than doubled the prior year. We look forward to expanded adoption of this technology longer term as the market continues to develop. 
Our stent business was up 4% in the fourth quarter, which is better than recent trends, driven by strength in this product family internationally. And to complete the category, sales in our vena cava filter line were down 28% in the fourth quarter. This was mostly due to a supplier component issue that we expect will be resolved in the next few months. 
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $217.9 million, which is flat versus Q4 of last year on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding the Japanese inventory issue, global growth was 5%, with the United States up 5% and international up 4%. 
The Targeted Temperature Management product sold double-digit growth again this quarter, both domestically and internationally. Our basic drainage business was up 3% in Q4 globally and up 9% in the United States. PICCs were flat globally and up 7% in the United States. We believe the strong finish to the year in the United States is more related to our sales mix than overall volumes. We saw particular strength in our temperature-sensing products, which are nearly double the ASP of our base product. We continue to see a favorable shift in mix to higher-ASP products. 
Our continents business declined 1% in the prior year quarter. Sales in urological specialties were up 1%. Our brachytherapy product line up 7%. We do not hold significant brachytherapy inventory in Japan. So that product line benefited from moving to end customer pricing in the fourth quarter. And sales from our StatLock catheter stabilization line decreased 3% in Q4. 
Before we leave Urology, we're pleased to announce that we completed the acquisition of Liberator Medical last week. As Tim said, this adds a new delivery platform to a strong technology platform, and we're very excited about the possibilities here. 
Now for Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $237.8 million, which was flat compared to the fourth quarter last year on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusting for the Japan inventory issue, global sales were up 4%, with the United States up 2% and international sales up 10%. Our port line was down 8% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The Japanese inventory issue contributed to this decline as the timing issues of orders in emerging markets, which were lower than trend in the fourth quarter as we expect to register next-generation devices there in the first quarter of 2016.
PICC revenue growth was 9% in the fourth quarter. Contrary to ports, we saw very few PICCs in Japan currently. So the impact from the acquisition is minimal. Our Vascular Access ultrasound product line was up 1% this quarter, and our dialysis catheter business was up 9% in the fourth quarter. 
So let's then finish up with Surgical Specialties. Net sales in this category were $152.8 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% on an as-reported basis and 8% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusting for the Japan inventory issue, global sales were up 10%, with the United States up 11% and international sales up 7%. 
Our biosurgical product portfolio grew double digits again this quarter, and we're excited about the long-term potential here. 
Our soft tissue repair business grew 9% overall in the fourth quarter. Within that subtotal, our total synthetic products were up 9% this quarter, while our natural tissue products increased 7%. 
We're pleased with the execution and the momentum in our broad product portfolio of synthetic, natural tissue and hybrid products for the treatment of hernia repair. Our fixation business grew 15% in Q4 benefited -- benefiting from the initial launch of new products in this product category. 
Closing out the surgical category, our performance irrigation business was down 22%. This quarter consistent with expectations. This concludes our product line revenue discussion. 
I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

We expect 2016 to be another year with a robust pipeline and a similar number of launches planned. 
I'll start today with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. We're building inventory for the launch in Q1 of recently approved additional lengths and diameters in the U.S. SFA product line. We've also submitted to FDA seeking approval for the treatment of lung lesions based on clinical data we've gathered in Europe. 
During the Life Interventional Course, or LINK meeting this week, investigators are sharing data and updated results from several of our Bard-sponsored studies as well as results from independent studies of DCBs conducted by clinicians. Some highlights include yesterday's presentation by Dr. Christopher Med of updated Lutonix global registry results, including a 93% from TLR at 24 months now in 229 patients. He also presented results for subgroups, including a first look at freedom from reintervention from patients treated with in-stent restenosis. At 12 months, almost 92% of ISR patients were free from reintervention, and that result was durable with over 88% of patients free from intervention at 24 months. 
Also yesterday, Dr. Sabine Steiner from University Hospital presented results from their single-center comparative study of the impact in Lutonix DCBs. This real-world retrospective study included 12-month analysis of 456 patients with SFA popliteal disease. The retrospective the baseline patient and lesion characteristics were pretty well matched. These studies treated very difficult patients with an average treatment length in both groups of over 280 millimeters. No statistical difference between devices was seen with freedom from reintervention at 12 months in excess of 82%. Sustained clinical benefit define this freedom from an increase in Rutherford class was also found to exceed 80% in both groups at 12 months. 
In our Below the Knee IDE enrollment progresses, and we continue to work with FDA to expand patient inclusion and analysis in this important study. At projected recruitment rates, we anticipate we'll continue to enrollment patients through 2016, putting PMA submission late in 2017 or likely into 2018. 
On the other hand, our AV access DCB IDE study, which begun recruitment in Q2 of 2015, continues to enroll quickly. At current rates, we anticipate enrollment could be complete in late Q1 or Q2 of this year, putting PMA submission slightly ahead of schedule in the first half of 2017. 
The in-stent restenosis IDE study is also ongoing, and we're working toward a projected second half 2016 PMA submission, seeking this expanded indication. 
Around the world, we're also working to expand access to this important technology with submission for approval expected in the first half of the year in Japan. We also expect enrollment to begin to accelerate in our Levant China study. 
Also in Vascular, the Lifestream balloon expandable covered stent continues to perform well in Europe. The IDE is in follow-up after completing enrollment in Q3. These clinical studies evaluating the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease. We remain on schedule for the projected submission of the final module of the PMA in the second half of the year. 
Our COVERA next-generation stent graft, designed for use in AV access, recently received CE Mark and the IDE was submitted in December. Our current plans have enrollment commencing in Q1. 
And our new venous stent also received CE Mark in Q4, and our first case was completed in December. In the U.S., we received approval to commence our IDE study a few weeks ago. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care, we're expanding the launch of the new Magic3 Go self-lubricated catheter for female patients as our manufacturing ramps up inventory. We're also building large quantities of our Magic3 Touch list, and we anticipate launching the product family this quarter. And in endourology, we expect to launch around the end of Q1 upon FDA clearance the new family for flexible roscopy. 
In temperature management, we've released software upgrades for enhanced EMR connectivity and additional user controls. 
Moving to Oncology. Than new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system, which launched in Europe in Q3, has received clearance in the U.S. and we're launching the product this quarter with 3CG diamond and Pinpoint GT capabilities. We continue to believe the combination of ultrasound needle guidance and catheter tracking and tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a user-friendly and intuitive solution for vascular catheter placement. 
In PICCs, we're waiting FDA clearance for the launch anticipated in the first half of this year of our new family of chemical-resistant catheters based on a new material designed to resist commonly used chemotherapy solutions as well as cleaning and disinfecting agents. We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis or DVT and remain on plan to begin launching in the back half of the year. 
For the difficult stick IV catheter patients, we're gearing up to launch around the end of the first quarter an improved family of AccuCath wire-guided assisted products. These new products are anticipated to launch alongside our new midline catheter, the PowerGlide Pro, also slated for launch this quarter. 
And lastly, for the acute hemodialysis patient, we're preparing for the launch of the new dual lumen power Xenesys catheter, which was cleared by FDA earlier this month. Xenesys is designed for superior flexibility and kink resistance and flow rates in excess of 400 ml per minute in an 11 [ph] French configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. In 2016, we'll continue to expand our Phasix and XenMatrix AB families of products with launches planned throughout the year. In our BioSurgery product family, we're awaiting PMA approval for our new TRIDYNE vascular sealant and continue to anticipate approval and launch of the first in a series of indications in the back half of 2016. We're also working toward the launch of a new Progel sealant configuration designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic surgery. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we're expanding on our recent permanent and resorbable product launches with 2 additional fixation devices slated for later this year. 
And now before I hand you over to Chris, I'd like to invite all of you to our analyst day to be held on Monday, May 23 at the New York Alice Hotel at 4:30 p.m. I look forward to seeing you there. 
I've stalled about as long as I can, so I guess, I'll hand it over to Chris now."

Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.

Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. Net acquisition-related items of $33.9 million pretax, a $14.5 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives and a $4.5 million pretax charge for asset impairments. These items are detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q4 earnings press release. 
Now let's go to the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $550.8 million in Q4 or 63.3% of sales. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $553.2 million or 63.5% of sales. That's up 40 basis points from the prior year. The headwinds to GP in Q4 included new amortization of about 30 basis points and FX at about 30 basis points. Pricing pressure, which was about 100 basis points of headwind on the revenue line, was 40 basis points of headwind in GP during the quarter. 
On the positive side for GP, mix was favorable by about 40 basis points, and cost improvements in other items drove about 100 basis points of favorability this quarter. For the full year 2015, that brings adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales to 61.8%, which was at the very high end of our original guidance, down 30 basis points from 2014. FX was a headwind of 30 basis points. Price was negative by 40 basis points and new amortization was also 40 basis points. Mix was positive by 30 basis points and cost improvements and other items were about 50 basis points favorable. 
SG&A expenses were $279.3 million for the quarter or 32.1% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $271.3 million or 31.2% of sales. That's up 110 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of our Japanese joint venture. 
For the full year 2015, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 29.3%. That's a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year. SG&A was higher than we guided at the beginning of the year, primarily because of acquisitions as well as some additional investment spending in the back half of the year, reflective of our strong operating performance. 
R&D expenditures totaled $69.4 million for the fourth quarter or 8% of sales. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $64.8 million or 7.4% of sales, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year period. 
For the full year 2015, on an adjusted basis, R&D was also 7.4% of sales, which was consistent with our guidance and reflective of a very robust level of investment spent. Interest expense was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter and $44.9 million for the full year. Other income and expense was $32.9 million of expense for the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, it was $5 million of income for the quarter and $1.6 million of income for the year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%. On an adjusted basis, it was 22%, taking us to 24.1% for the full year, right in the middle of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. The quarter, of course, was lower than the full year average due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit in December, which as you now know, has been made permanent. That all adds up to cash EPS of $2.43 for Q4, excluding items affecting comparability, bringing us in at $9.08 for the full year on a same basis. That's $0.03 above the high end of our original guidance for the year despite having absorbed roughly $0.15 of additional FX headwind and dilution during the course of the year, which is indicative of a strong operating performance we saw in 2015. 
We repurchased about 600,000 shares of stock in Q4, taking total buybacks in 2015 to approximately 2.7 million shares. The balance sheet as of December 31 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1 billion versus $1.1 billion at September 30. For the full year, AR days were up 0.8 days and inventory days were up 6.9 days, driven by the acquisition of our Japanese JV. 
Capital expenditures totaled $23.6 million for the quarter and $102.9 million for the year. On the liability side, total debt was $1.4 billion as of December 31, no change from September 30. That's a total cap at the end of the fourth quarter was about 49% and total shareholder investment was $1.5 billion at December 31. 
So with a strong 2015 now in the books, let's turn to financial guidance for 2016, excluding the impact of items that affect comparability. For revenue, we project 2016 constant-currency organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%. Beyond organic growth, we'll benefit from incremental revenue in 2016 from the applications of our Japanese JV as well as Liberator Medical. We also expect to see nonoperating reduction to revenue from lower sales of EP products to Boston Scientific that were prepared for a range of levels for the Gore royalty. Therefore, our overall constant-currency revenue guidance is between 6% and 8%. Our expectations assume no change in the market growth rates from where they've been in the last couple of years, which we would characterize as being in the low single digits. Obviously, the strength of the U.S. dollar will continue to be a headwind for U.S. multinational companies in 2016. We estimate that at current rates we're looking at a revenue headwind related to currency of about 1.5%, which would put our reported revenue guidance for 2016 between 4.5% and 6.5%. 
As far as constant-currency revenue growth in our [indiscernible] disease categories, in 2016, we expect a Vascular revenue growth to be between 3% and 7%, Urology to be between 8% and 11%, Oncology to grow between 5% and 8% and our Surgical Specialties business to grow between 6% and 9%. To be clear, these are constant-currency growth rates, not organic. We're only providing organic revenue growth guidance at the corporate level. 
As we move down the P&L for financial guidance, we're making one important change in our presentation. As you know, when the sector moved to cash EPS, the vast majority of our peers excluded amortization of intangibles from their entire adjusted P&L. Up until now, we've been reporting amortization in the entire P&L and only excluding it from EPS number below the line. In order to make it easier for investors to understand our results in context with others in the sector, beginning with 2016, we'll exclude the amortization of intangibles from our entire adjusted P&L. We've provided a reconciliation of the key margin percentages on the Reg G section of our Investor Relations page on our website. And a summary of that reconciliation is provided on Slide 6 of the deck associated with this call. 
So the following guidance excludes items that may affect comparability and amortization of intangibles. We expect our overall gross margin percent to improve in 2016 between 50 and 100 basis points compared to 2015, which translates to a gross margin range between 65.8% and 66.3%. That reflects about 30 basis points of pressure from FX. Pricing pressure continues to be a challenge for us, and we estimate the impact on 2016 to be between 30 and 50 basis points of gross margin headwind. Our cost improvement programs are projected to contribute between 80 and 100 basis points of benefits to GP, and we expect mix to be favorable between 50 to 60 basis points, which includes the positive gross margin impact from our acquisition in Japan. 
We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about the same as 2015 as we continue to increase our investment in emerging markets this year and work to integrate our recent acquisitions. And we expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the mid-7% range again this year. This would project our operating margin in 2016 to be between 29% and 29.5%, which is an improvement of 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2015 on the same basis. We expect interest expense in 2016 to be between $50 million and $55 million, reflecting higher projected activity rates and debt levels compared to 2015. Primarily as a result of jurisdictional mix, we expect a slight pause in the cadence of our improvement in the effective tax rate, which we project to be between 25.5% and 26% in 2016. The R&D tax credit is now permanent, so we will not have a sharp reduction in the Q4 effective rate that we have seen the last couple of years. So all of that adds up to adjusted cash EPS for 2016, excluding items that affect comparability, between $9.90 and $10.05, representing 9% to 11% reported growth over 2015. This guidance includes a projected negative currency impact of about $0.30 based on today's rates. The suspension of the medical device excise tax represents approximately $0.20 of benefit to us, essentially offsetting 2/3 of our overall estimated currency headwind in 2016 at today's rates. So we do exclude both the negative impact of currency and the benefit from the debt suspension, our operational EPS growth forecast would have been between 10% and 12%. 
As we enter 2016, we continue to be in investment mode with planned, targeted incremental spending in SG&A, particularly in emerging markets, and a continued robust level of investment in R&D. We're pleased that we're able to provide attractive 2016 guidance with strong reported earnings growth without having to reduce or delay investments and projects we believe will provide long-term value to our shareholders. 
In Q1, we expect constant-currency sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5% and reported revenue growth between 2.5% and 3.5%. As was the case in Q4, Q1 revenue guidance reflects the negative impact from the sell-through of existing inventory in Japan. We expect this factor to be behind us by Q2. On an organic basis, we expect Q1 sales growth to be in the 5.5% to 6% range. We expect adjusted cash EPS in Q1 2016 to be between $2.14 and $2.18, which reflects the initial dilution from recent acquisitions as well as a foreign exchange headwind. We expect the dilutive impact from acquisitions, in particular our joint venture buyout in Japan, to moderate as we move through 2016. Excluding the front-loaded dilution from acquisitions, Q1 adjusted EPS would have been about 10%. So operationally, I expect us to be off to a very solid start to the year as we move into Q1. 
As for capital expenditures, we expect 2016 to be in the $120 million range, and we expect operating cash flow to be in the $700 million range in 2016. 
Thank you for your attention, and with that, I'll turn you back over to Tim."

So I like the way we're provisioned. I'd say we're still understanding it and trying to figure out where to plug and play in that kind of a environment. But we're optimistic about it, which is why we pulled the trigger on Liberator. We felt we needed that platform as a missing piece to solving that puzzle. So we're pleased with that, and I think you'll continue to hear more from us in the future about that, so I think just the one thing I got in I think it's important as you think about this strategy both Rochester and Liberator were movements into the home but based on the back of a strength in Urology. And I think as we said when we did Rochester and I'll repeat it again now that we've got this really interesting platform, it works just on the back of a Urology entry strategy into the home for us. What it's given us is clearly these other capabilities that we can begin think about how we can leverage into some other category areas. But we don't need to do that to make this both Rochester and Liberator now a combination very successful and really accretive to us for a long period of time.

I think Below the Knee is -- I'm not a marketing guy so I'm looking at John Weiland here. But I think it's 20%, 30% of the SFA opportunity. AV Access kind of in that same ballpark. So certainly, significant incremental opportunities. But the SFA probably makes up about half of the overall may be more than half of the overall opportunity."

I'd like to thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. I'd expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 40 minutes. You may note we have also placed a few slides on the Investor Relations page of our website to help you understand some of the moving pieces on our results and guidance to give you a little more clarity. Our discussions today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the fourth quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will cover fourth quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development pipeline; and then Chris Holland, our SVP and CFO, will cover the fourth quarter income statement, balance sheet and provide our financial guidance for 2016, and then we'll close with Q&A.
Fourth quarter 2015 net sales totaled $878.8 million. That's essentially flat on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant currency basis over the fourth quarter of last year. Currency impact for the quarter versus prior year was unfavorable by about 300 basis points. Other nonoperating adjustments also negatively affected revenue growth by about 200 basis points in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for these items, our organic growth rate for Q4 of 2015 was 5.5%, which exceeded our guidance from 3 months earlier. We've provided a summary reconciliation of these quarterly revenue results on Slide 3 of the deck provided on the website that I just referenced.
Net sales for the full year were $3.4 billion. That's up 3% as reported and up 6% on a constant currency basis. That correlates to approximately 6.8% organic growth for the year, compared with our original guidance for the year of 4% to 5%. 
The U.S. launch of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon exceeded our expectations, and we're also pleased to see the acceleration of the rest of the portfolio in 2015. It's notable that every business was at the top or above the revenue guidance ranges we provided a year ago. 
Net income for the fourth quarter was $136.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.79. That's up 2% and 4% respectively. Excluding items that affect the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, fourth quarter 2015 net income and diluted cash earnings per share, which exclude amortization of intangibles, were $164.6 million and $2.43. That's up 4% and 6%, respectively. 
Full year 2015 net income was $135.4 million and diluted EPS was $1.77. Excluding items that affect comparability between periods, full year 2015 net income was $615.8 million and diluted cash EPS was $9.08. That's up 5% and 8%, respectively. These results exceeded our original guidance for the year, despite an estimated additional $0.15 of headwind during the year from a combination of additional FX headwinds and dilution from acquisitions during the year.
Looking at the fourth quarter revenue growth geographically, compared to the prior year on a constant-currency basis, net sales in the U.S. grew 2%. Internationally we grew 5%, with Europe up 7%, Japan down 22%, and our other international geographies up 16%. 
To refresh your memory, the decline in Japan is due to the work down of inventory that was recorded as revenue when we sold into our Japanese joint venture prior to the acquisition of the joint venture. This issue should be substantially behind us after the first quarter of this year. As anticipated in our strategic investment plan, our emerging market sales continued to increase nicely and represented about 10% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at overall results with some historical context. 3 years ago, we announced our strategic investment plan to invest in advance of the receipt of the Gore royalty. At that time, our organic revenue growth profile was essentially flat. We increased our annual spending in SG&A and R&D by combined $70 million. We designed the investment plan to return the revenue growth of our portfolio to above-market rates and to put the company in a better position for the longer term. We then said on this call a year ago that 2015 was a very important year of execution for us to begin to see the results from that investment plan. 
As we look at where we are today, our organic growth rate has accelerated, again, to the top tier of the sector. We're pleased with how our teams have executed the plan, and we believe we've built the business in a manner that's sustainable. We've been able to achieve our objectives while continuing to invest in future growth despite absorbing various headwinds along the way. So while we're pleased with the execution of the plan so far, our focus remains solidly on the future. We have many potential opportunities for strong growth in front of us. We believe we have significant room for growth in emerging markets. We also have several technology platforms that we believe provide us with billions of dollars of market opportunity to pursue through new indications and expanded market development and penetration. And the Japan joint venture and Liberator acquisitions provide us better access to customers with delivery platforms that we believe will position us well for the long term. So we remain in investment mode to pursue these opportunities. Our objective remains sustained above-market growth on the top line, that we believe should provide an organic engine positioned for reliable and attractive profitability on the bottom line. Chris will give you more details when he lays out our financial guidance.  
We continue to believe that the effective execution of our strategic investment plan will allow us to continue to increase shareholder value over the long term on a sustainable basis. 
With that, let me turn you over now to John Weiland for a review of our fourth quarter product line revenue."

Total net sales in this category for",900,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, as usual, I'll be giving all percentage growth data and comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted.
So let's start with Vascular. Total net sales in this category for the quarter were $239.3 million, a decline of 2% on a reported basis and an increase of 1% on a constant currency basis when compared to Q4 of 2014. Adjusting for the nonoperating items, global Vascular sales were up 5%, with the U.S. business down 3% for the quarter and international up 18%. Sales in our Vascular graft category were up 7% in Q4, which is above trend, driven by some timing issues within our OEM business. 
Excluding the Gore royalty, our Endovascular business grew 4% in the fourth quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy line was up 10%, driven by strength in emerging markets. Our peripheral PTA products were up 5% this quarter. As expected, the growth rate here was affected by the anniversary of the significant stocking event for Lutonix in Q4 of 2014 as well as the reduction in Japanese sales due to our inventory adjustment there. 
As Tim said, we are very pleased with the first year of our drug-coated balloon sales in the United States. Sales in Q4 were as expected, and we estimate that end customer use, which more than doubled the prior year. We look forward to expanded adoption of this technology longer term as the market continues to develop. 
Our stent business was up 4% in the fourth quarter, which is better than recent trends, driven by strength in its product family internationally. And to complete the category, sales in our vena cava filter line were down 28% in the fourth quarter. This was mostly due to a supplier component issue that we expect will be resolved in the next few months. 
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $217.9 million, which is flat versus Q4 of last year on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the Japanese inventory issue, global growth was 5%, with the United States up 5% and international up 4%. 
The Targeted Temperature Management product sold double-digit growth again this quarter, both domestically and internationally. Our basic drainage business was up 3% in Q4 globally and up 9% in the United States. I.C. Foleys were flat globally and up 7% in the United States. We believe the strong finish to the year in the United States is more related to our sales mix than overall volumes. We saw particular strength in our temperature-sensing products, which are nearly double the ASP of our base product. We continue to see a favorable shift in mix to higher-ASP products. 
Our continence business declined 1% in the prior year quarter. Sales in urological specialties were up 1%, with our brachytherapy product line up 7%. We do not hold significant brachytherapy inventory in Japan. So that product line benefited from moving to end customer pricing in the fourth quarter. And sales from our StatLock catheter stabilization line decreased 3% in Q4. 
Before we leave Urology, we're pleased to announce that we completed the acquisition of Liberator Medical last week. As Tim said, this adds a new delivery platform to a strong technology platform, and we're very excited about the possibilities here. 
Now for Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $237.8 million, which was flat compared to the fourth quarter last year on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the Japan inventory issue, global sales were up 4%, with the United States up 2% and international sales up 10%. Our port line was down 8% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The Japanese inventory issue contributed to this decline as the timing issues of orders in emerging markets, which were lower than trend in the fourth quarter as we expect to register next-generation devices there in the first quarter of 2016.
PICC revenue growth was 9% in the fourth quarter. Contrary to ports, we saw very few PICCs in Japan currently. So the impact from the acquisition is minimal. Our vascular access ultrasound product line was up 1% this quarter, and our dialysis catheter business was up 9% in the fourth quarter. 
So let's then finish up with Surgical Specialties. Net sales in this category were $152.8 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% on an as-reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the Japan inventory issue, global sales were up 10%, with United States up 11% and international sales up 7%. 
Our biosurgical product portfolio grew double digits, again, this quarter, and we're excited about the long-term potential here. 
Our soft tissue repair business grew 9% overall in the fourth quarter. Within that subtotal, our total synthetic hernia products were up 9% this quarter, while our natural tissue products increased 7%. 
We're pleased with the execution and the momentum in our broad product portfolio of synthetic, natural tissue and hybrid products for the treatment of hernia repair. Our fixation business grew 15% in Q4 benefited -- benefiting from the initial launch of new products in this product category. 
Closing out the surgical category, our performance irrigation business was down 22%. This quarter consistent with expectations. This concludes our product line revenue discussion. 
I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

We expect 2016 to be another year with a robust pipeline and a similar number of launches planned. 
I'll start today with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. We're building inventory for the launch in Q1 of recently approved additional lengths and diameters in the U.S. SFA product line. We've also submitted to FDA, seeking approval for the treatment of lung lesions based on clinical data we've gathered in Europe. 
During the Leipzig Interventional Course, or LINC meeting, this week, investigators are sharing data and updated results from several of our Bard-sponsored studies as well as results from independent studies of DCBs conducted by clinicians. Some highlights include yesterday's presentation by Dr. Christopher Metzger of updated Lutonix global registry results, including a 93% freedom from TLR at 24 months, now in 229 patients. He also presented results for subgroups, including a first look at freedom from reintervention for patients treated for in-stent restenosis. At 12 months, almost 92% of ISR patients were free from reintervention, and that result was durable with over 88% of patients free from intervention at 24 months. 
Also yesterday, Dr. Sabine Steiner from University Hospital Leipzig presented results from their single-center comparative study of the impact in Lutonix DCBs. This real-world retrospective study included 12-month analysis of 456 patients with SFA and popliteal disease. The retrospective the baseline patient and lesion characteristics were pretty well matched. This study treated very difficult patients with an average treated length in both groups of over 280 millimeters. No statistical difference between devices was seen with freedom from reintervention at 12 months in excess of 82%. Sustained clinical benefit defined as freedom from an increase in Rutherford Class was also found to exceed 80% in both groups at 12 months. 
In our Below the Knee IDE enrollment progresses, and we continue to work with FDA to expand patient inclusion and analysis in this important study. At projected recruitment rates, we anticipate we'll continue to enroll patients through 2016, putting PMA submission late in 2017 or likely into 2018. 
On the other hand, our AV access DCB IDE study, which begun recruitment in Q2 of 2015, continues to enroll quickly. At current rates, we anticipate enrollment could be complete in late Q1 or Q2 of this year, putting PMA submission slightly ahead of schedule in the first half of 2017. 
The in-stent restenosis IDE study is also ongoing, and we're working toward a projected second half 2016 PMA submission, seeking this expanded indication. 
Around the world, we're also working to expand access to this important technology, with submission for approval expected in the first half of the year in Japan. We also expect enrollment to begin to accelerate in our Levant China study. 
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent continues to perform well in Europe. The IDE is in follow-up after completing enrollment in Q3. These clinical studies evaluating the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease. We remain on schedule for the projected submission of the final module of the PMA in the second half of the year. 
Our COVERA next-generation stent graft, designed for use in AV access, recently received CE Mark, and the IDE was submitted in December. Our current plans have enrollment commencing in Q1. 
And our new Venovo venous stent also received CE Mark in Q4, and our first case was completed in December. In the U.S., we received approval to commence our IDE study a few weeks ago. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care, we're expanding the launch of the new Magic3 Go self-lubricated catheter for female patients as our manufacturing ramps up inventory. We're also building launch quantities of our Magic3 Touchless, and we anticipate launching the product family this quarter. And in endourology, we expect to launch around the end of Q1 upon FDA clearance the new process [ph] sheath family for flexible ureteroscopy. 
In temperature management, we've released software upgrades for enhanced EMR connectivity and additional user controls. 
Moving to Oncology. The new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system, which launched in Europe in Q3, has received clearance in the U.S., and we're launching the product this quarter with 3CG Diamond and Pinpoint GT capabilities. We continue to believe the combination of ultrasound needle guidance and catheter tracking and tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a user-friendly and intuitive solution for vascular catheter replacement. 
In PICCs, we're waiting FDA clearance for the launch anticipated in the first half of this year of our new family of chemical-resistant catheters based on a new material designed to resist commonly used chemotherapy solutions as well as cleaning and disinfecting agents. We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family, designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis or DVT, and remain on plan to begin launching in the back half of the year. 
For the difficult stick IV catheter patients, we're gearing up to launch around the end of the first quarter an improved family of AccuCath wire-guided assisted products. These new products are anticipated to launch alongside our new midline catheter, the PowerGlide Pro, also slated for launch this quarter. 
And lastly, for the acute hemodialysis patient, we're preparing for the launch of the new dual-lumen Power Xenesys [ph] catheter, which was cleared by FDA earlier this month. Xenesys [ph] is designed for superior flexibility and kink resistance and flow rates in excess of 400 ml per minute in an 11 French configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. In 2016, we'll continue to expand our Phasix and XenMatrix AB families of products with launches planned throughout the year. In our BioSurgery product family, we're awaiting PMA approval for our new TRIDYNE vascular sealant and continue to anticipate approval and launch of the first in a series of indications in the back half of 2016. We're also working toward the launch of a new Progel sealant configuration, designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic surgery. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we're expanding on our recent permanent and resorbable product launches with 2 additional fixation devices slated for later this year. 
And now before I hand you over to Chris, I'd like to invite all of you to our Analyst Day to be held on Monday, May 23, at the New York Palace Hotel at 4:30 p.m. I look forward to seeing you there. 
I've stalled about as long as I can, so I guess, I'll hand it over to Chris now."

Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. Net acquisition-related items of $33.9 million pretax, a $14.5 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives and a $4.5 million pretax charge for asset impairments. These items are detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q4 earnings press release. 
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $550.8 million in Q4 or 63.3% of sales. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $553.2 million or 63.5% of sales. That's up 40 basis points from the prior year. The headwinds to GP in Q4 included new amortization of about 30 basis points and FX at about 30 basis points. Pricing pressure, which was about 100 basis points of headwind on the revenue line, was 40 basis points of headwind in GP during the quarter. 
On the positive side for GP, mix was favorable by about 40 basis points, and cost improvements in other items drove about 100 basis points of favorability this quarter. For the full year 2015, that brings adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales to 61.8%, which was at the very high end of our original guidance, down 30 basis points from 2014. FX was a headwind of 30 basis points. Price was negative by 40 basis points and new amortization was also 40 basis points. Mix was positive by 30 basis points and cost improvements and other items were about 50 basis points favorable. 
SG&A expenses were $279.3 million for the quarter or 32.1% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $271.3 million or 31.2% of sales. That's up 110 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of our Japanese joint venture. 
For the full year 2015, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 29.3%. That's a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year. SG&A was higher than we guided at the beginning of the year, primarily because of acquisitions as well as some additional investment spending in the back half of the year, reflective of our strong operating performance. 
R&D expenditures totaled $69.4 million for the fourth quarter or 8% of sales. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $64.8 million or 7.4% of sales, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year period. 
For the full year 2015, on an adjusted basis, R&D was also 7.4% of sales, which was consistent with our guidance and reflective of a very robust level of investment spent. Interest expense was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter and $44.9 million for the full year. Other income and expense was $32.9 million of expense for the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, it was $5 million of income for the quarter and $1.6 million of income for the year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%. On an adjusted basis, it was 22%, taking us to 24.1% for the full year, right in the middle of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. The quarter, of course, was lower than the full year average due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit in December, which as you now know, has been made permanent. That all adds up to cash EPS of $2.43 for Q4, excluding items affecting comparability, bringing us in at $9.08 for the full year on the same basis. That's $0.03 above the high end of our original guidance for the year despite having absorbed roughly $0.15 of additional FX headwind and dilution during the course of the year, which is indicative of the strong operating performance we saw in 2015. 
We repurchased about 600,000 shares of stock in Q4, taking total buybacks in 2015 to approximately 2.7 million shares. The balance sheet as of December 31 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1 billion versus $1.1 billion at September 30. For the full year, AR days were up 0.8 days and inventory days were up 6.9 days, driven by the acquisition of our Japanese JV. 
Capital expenditures totaled $23.6 million for the quarter and $102.9 million for the year. On the liability side, total debt was $1.4 billion as of December 31, no change from September 30. That's a total cap, at the end of the fourth quarter, was about 49% and total shareholder investment was $1.5 billion at December 31. 
So with a strong 2015 now in the books, let's turn to financial guidance for 2016, excluding the impact of items that affect comparability. For revenue, we project 2016 constant currency organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%. Beyond organic growth, we'll benefit from incremental revenue in 2016 from the acquisitions of our Japanese JV as well as Liberator Medical. We also expect to see a nonoperating reduction to revenue from lower sales of EP products to Boston Scientific and we're prepared for a range of levels for the Gore royalty. Therefore, our overall constant currency revenue guidance is between 6% and 8%. Our expectations assume no change in the market growth rates from where they have been in the last couple of years, which we would characterize as being in the low single digits. Obviously, the strength of the U.S. dollar will continue to be a headwind for U.S. multinational companies in 2016. We estimate that at current rates we're looking at a revenue headwind related to currency of about 1.5%, which would put our reported revenue guidance for 2016 between 4.5% and 6.5%. 
As far as constant currency revenue growth in our 4 disease state categories, in 2016, we expect Vascular revenue growth to be between 3% and 7%, Urology to be between 8% and 11%, Oncology to grow between 5% and 8% and our Surgical Specialties business to grow between 6% and 9%. To be clear, these are constant currency growth rates, not organic. We're only providing organic revenue growth guidance at the corporate level. 
As we move down the P&L for financial guidance, we're making one important change in our presentation. As you know, when the sector moved to cash EPS, the vast majority of our peers excluded amortization of intangibles from their entire adjusted P&L. Up until now, we have been reporting amortization in the entire P&L and only excluding it from the EPS number below the line. In order to make it easier for investors to understand our results in context with others in the sector, beginning with 2016, we'll exclude the amortization of intangibles from our entire adjusted P&L. We've provided a reconciliation of the key margin percentages on the Reg G section of our Investor Relations page on our website. And a summary of that reconciliation is provided on Slide 6 of the deck associated with this call. 
So the following guidance excludes items that may affect comparability and amortization of intangibles. We expect our overall gross margin percent to improve in 2016 between 50 and 100 basis points compared to 2015, which translates to a gross margin range between 65.8% and 66.3%. That reflects about 30 basis points of pressure from the FX. Pricing pressure continues to be a challenge for us, and we estimate the impact on 2016 to be between 30 and 50 basis points of gross margin headwind. Our cost improvement programs are projected to contribute between 80 and 100 basis points of benefits to GP, and we expect the mix to be favorable between 50 to 60 basis points, which includes the positive gross margin impact from our acquisition in Japan. 
We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about the same as 2015 as we continue to increase our investments in emerging markets this year and work to integrate our recent acquisitions. And we expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the mid-7% range again this year. This would project our operating margin in 2016 to be between 29% and 29.5%, which is an improvement of 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2015 on the same basis. We expect interest expense in 2016 to be between $50 million and $55 million, reflecting higher projected average rates and debt levels compared to 2015. Primarily as a result of jurisdictional mix, we expect a slight pause in the cadence of our improvement in the effective tax rate, which we project to be between 25.5% and 26% in 2016. The R&D tax credit is now permanent, so we will not have the sharp reduction in the Q4 effective rate that we have seen in the last couple of years. So all of that adds up to adjusted cash EPS for 2016, excluding items that affect the comparability, between $9.90 and $10.05 representing 9% to 11% reported growth over 2015. This guidance includes a projected negative currency impact of about $0.30 based on today's rates. The suspension of the medical device excise tax represents approximately $0.20 of benefit to us, essentially offsetting 2/3 of our overall estimated currency headwind in 2016 at today's rates. So we do exclude both the negative impact of currency and the benefit from the end debt suspension, our operational EPS growth forecast would have been between 10% and 12%. 
As we enter 2016, we continue to be in investment mode, with planned, targeted incremental spending in SG&A, particularly in emerging markets, and a continued robust level of investment in R&D. We're pleased that we're able to provide attractive 2016 guidance with strong reported earnings growth without having to reduce or delay investments and projects, we believe will provide long-term value to our shareholders. 
In Q1, we expect constant currency sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5% and reported revenue growth between 2.5% and 3.5%. As was the case in Q4, Q1 revenue guidance reflects the negative impact from the sell-through of existing inventory in Japan. We expect this factor to be behind us by Q2. On an organic basis, we expect Q1 sales growth to be in the 5.5% to 6% range. We expect adjusted cash EPS in Q1 2016 to be between $2.14 and $2.18, which reflects the initial dilution from recent acquisitions as well as the foreign exchange headwind. We expect the dilutive impact from acquisitions, in particular, our joint venture buyout in Japan, to moderate as we move through 2016. Excluding the front-loaded dilution from acquisitions, Q1 adjusted EPS would have been about 10%. So operationally, I expect us to be off to a very solid start to the year as we move into Q1. 
As for capital expenditures, we expect 2016 to be in the $120 million range, and we expect operating cash flow to be in the $700 million range in 2016. 
Thank you for your attention. And with that, I'll turn you back to Tim."

And we already have, of course, the ultrasound capability, which is pretty unique to us on an integrated basis. And then our tip-tracking technology, the Sherlock. And then, of course, we also continue to improve upon our final tip confirmation technology. And so we continue to add new algorithms and new ways to make that better, like 3CG Diamond. So we think we're going to continue to do that. We've got a few other tricks up our sleeves, and we'll -- as we get further down the pathway here, we'll talk about them."

I'd like to thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. I'd expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 40 minutes. You may note we have also placed a few slides on the Investor Relations page of our website to help you understand some of the moving pieces on our results and guidance and to give you a little more clarity. 
Our discussions today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the fourth quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will cover fourth quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP, Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on the product development pipeline; and then Chris Holland, our SVP and CFO, will cover the fourth quarter income statement, balance sheet and provide our financial guidance for 2016; and then we'll close with Q&A.
Fourth quarter 2015 net sales totaled $878.8 million. That's essentially flat on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant-currency basis over the fourth quarter of last year. Currency impact for the quarter versus prior year was unfavorable by about 300 basis points. Other nonoperating adjustments also negatively affected revenue growth by about 200 basis points in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for these items, our organic growth rate for Q4 of 2015 was 5.5%, which exceeded our guidance from 3 months earlier. We've provided a summary reconciliation of these quarterly revenue results on Slide 3 of the deck provided on the website that I just referenced.
Net sales for the full year were $3.4 billion. That's up 3% as reported and up 6% on a constant-currency basis. That correlates to approximately 6.8% organic growth for the year, compared with our original guidance for the year of 4% to 5%. 
The U.S. launch of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon exceeded our expectations, and we're also pleased to see the acceleration of the rest of the portfolio in 2015. It's notable that every business was at the top or above the revenue guidance ranges we provided a year ago. 
Net income for the fourth quarter was $136.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.79. That's up 2% and 4% respectively. Excluding items that affect the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, fourth quarter 2015 net income and diluted cash earnings per share, which exclude amortization of intangibles, were $164.6 million and $2.43. That's up 4% and 6%, respectively. 
Full year 2015 net income was $135.4 million and diluted EPS was $1.77. Excluding items that affect comparability between periods, full year 2015 net income was $615.8 million and diluted cash EPS was $9.08. That's up 5% and 8%, respectively. These results exceeded our original guidance for the year, despite an estimated additional $0.15 of headwind during the year from a combination of additional FX headwinds and dilution from acquisitions during the year.
Looking at the fourth quarter revenue growth geographically, compared to the prior year on a constant-currency basis, net sales in the U.S. grew 2%. Internationally we grew 5%, with Europe up 7%, Japan down 22% and our other international geographies up 16%. 
To refresh your memory, the decline in Japan is due to the work-down of inventory that was recorded as revenue when we sold into our Japanese joint venture prior to the acquisition of the joint venture. This issue should be substantially behind us after the first quarter of this year. As anticipated in our strategic investment plan, our emerging market sales continued to increase nicely and represented about 10% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at overall results with some historical context. 3 years ago, we announced our strategic investment plan to invest in advance of the receipt of the Gore royalty. At that time, our organic revenue growth profile was essentially flat. We increased our annual spending in SG&A and R&D by a combined $70 million. We designed the investment plan to return the revenue growth of our portfolio to above-market rates and to put the company in a better position for the longer term. We then said on this call a year ago that 2015 was a very important year of execution for us to begin to see the results from that investment plan. 
As we look at where we are today, our organic growth rate has accelerated, again, to the top tier of the sector. We're pleased with how our teams have executed the plan, and we believe we've built the business in a manner that's sustainable. We've been able to achieve our objectives while continuing to invest in future growth despite absorbing various headwinds along the way. So while we're pleased with the execution of the plan so far, our focus remains solidly on the future. We have many potential opportunities for strong growth in front of us. We believe we have significant room for growth in emerging markets. We also have several technology platforms that we believe provide us with billions of dollars of market opportunity to pursue through new indications and expanded market development and penetration. And the Japan joint venture and Liberator acquisitions provide us better access to customers with delivery platforms that we believe will position us well for the long term. So we remain in investment mode to pursue these opportunities. Our objective remains sustained above-market growth on the top line that we believe should provide an organic engine positioned for reliable and attractive profitability on the bottom line. Chris will give you more details when he lays out our financial guidance.  
We continue to believe that the effective execution of our strategic investment plan will allow us to continue to increase shareholder value over the long term on a sustainable basis. 
With that, let me turn you over now to John Weiland for a review of our fourth quarter product line revenue."

Total net sales in this category for",893,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, as usual, I'll be giving all percentage growth data and comparison to the prior-year period on a constant-currency basis, unless otherwise noted.
So let's start with Vascular. Total net sales in this category for the quarter were $239.3 million, a decline of 2% on a reported basis and an increase of 1% on a constant-currency basis when compared to Q4 of 2014. Adjusting for the nonoperating items, global Vascular sales were up 5%, with the U.S. business down 3% for the quarter and international up 18%. Sales in our Vascular graft category were up 7% in Q4, which is above trend, driven by some timing issues within our OEM business. 
Excluding the Gore royalty, our Endovascular business grew 4% in the fourth quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy line was up 10%, driven by strength in emerging markets. Our peripheral PTA products were up 5% this quarter. As expected, the growth rate here was affected by the anniversary of the significant stocking event for Lutonix in Q4 of 2014, as well as the reduction in Japanese sales due to our inventory adjustment there. 
As Tim said, we are very pleased with the first year of our drug-coated balloon sales in the United States. Sales in Q4 were as expected, and we estimate that end customer use of which more than doubled the prior year. We look forward to expanded adoption of this technology longer term as the market continues to develop. 
Our Stent business was up 4% in the fourth quarter, which is better than recent trends, driven by strength in this product family internationally. And to complete the category, sales in our vena cava filter line were down 28% in the fourth quarter. This was mostly due to a supplier component issue that we expect will be resolved in the next few months. 
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $217.9 million, which is flat versus Q4 of last year on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding the Japanese inventory issue, global growth was 5%, with the United States up 5% and international up 4%. 
The Targeted Temperature Management product saw double-digit growth again this quarter, both domestically and internationally. Our basic drainage business was up 3% in Q4 globally and up 9% in the United States. I.C. Foleys were flat globally and up 7% in the United States. We believe the strong finish to the year in the United States is more related to our sales mix than overall volumes. We saw particular strength in our temperature-sensing products, which are nearly double the ASP of our base product. We continue to see a favorable shift in mix to higher-ASP products. 
Our continence business declined 1% in the prior-year quarter. Sales in urological specialties were up 1%, with our brachytherapy product line up 7%. We do not hold significant brachytherapy inventory in Japan. So that product line benefited from moving to end-customer pricing in the fourth quarter. And sales from our StatLock catheter stabilization line decreased 3% in Q4. 
Before we leave Urology, we're pleased to announce that we completed the acquisition of Liberator Medical last week. As Tim said, this adds a new delivery platform to a strong technology platform, and we're very excited about the possibilities here. 
Now for Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $237.8 million, which was flat compared to the fourth quarter last year on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusting for the Japan inventory issue, global sales were up 4%, with the United States up 2% and international sales up 10%. 
Our port line was down 8% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The Japanese inventory issue contributed to this decline as did timing issues of orders in emerging markets, which were lower than trend in the fourth quarter as we expect to register next-generation devices there in the first quarter of 2016.
PICC revenue growth was 9% in the fourth quarter. Contrary to ports, we saw very few PICCs in Japan currently. So the impact from the acquisition is minimal. Our vascular access ultrasound product line was up 1% this quarter, and our dialysis catheter business was up 9% in the fourth quarter. 
So let's then finish up with Surgical Specialties. Net sales in this category were $152.8 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% on an as-reported basis and 8% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusting for the Japan inventory issue, global sales were up 10%, with United States up 11% and international sales up 7%. 
Our biosurgical product portfolio grew double digits again this quarter, and we're excited about the long-term potential here. 
Our soft tissue repair business grew 9% overall in the fourth quarter. Within that subtotal, our total synthetic hernia products were up 9% this quarter, while our natural tissue products increased 7%. 
We're pleased with the execution and the momentum in our broad product portfolio of synthetic, natural tissue and hybrid products for the treatment of hernia repair. Our fixation business grew 15% in Q4 benefited -- benefiting from the initial launch of new products in this product category. 
Closing out the Surgical category, our performance irrigation business was down 22% this quarter, consistent with expectations. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

We expect 2016 to be another year with a robust pipeline and a similar number of launches planned. 
I'll start today with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. We're building inventory for the launch in Q1 of recently approved additional lengths and diameters in the U.S. SFA product line. We've also submitted to FDA, seeking approval for the treatment of lung lesions based on clinical data we've gathered in Europe. 
During the Leipzig Interventional Course, or LINC meeting, this week, investigators are sharing data and updated results from several of our Bard-sponsored studies, as well as results from independent studies of DCBs conducted by clinicians. Some highlights include yesterday's presentation by Dr. Christopher Metzger of updated Lutonix global registry results, including a 93% freedom from TLR at 24 months, now in 229 patients. He also presented results for subgroups, including a first look at freedom from reintervention for patients treated for in-stent restenosis. At 12 months, almost 92% of ISR patients were free from reintervention, and that result was durable with over 88% of patients free from intervention at 24 months. 
Also yesterday, Dr. Sabine Steiner from University Hospital Leipzig presented results from their single-center comparative study of the impact in Lutonix DCBs. This real-world retrospective study included 12-month analysis of 456 patients with SFA and popliteal disease. Though retrospective, the baseline patient and lesion characteristics were pretty well matched. This study treated very difficult patients with an average treated length in both groups of over 280 millimeters. No statistical difference between devices was seen, with freedom from reintervention at 12 months in excess of 82%. Sustained clinical benefit, defined as freedom from an increase in Rutherford Class, was also found to exceed 80% in both groups at 12 months. 
In our Below the Knee IDE, enrollment progresses and we continue to work with FDA to expand patient inclusion and analysis in this important study. At projected recruitment rates, we anticipate we'll continue to enroll patients through 2016, putting PMA submission late in 2017 or likely into 2018. 
On the other hand, our AV access DCB IDE study, which began recruitment in Q2 of 2015, continues to enroll quickly. At current rates, we anticipate enrollment could be complete in late Q1 or Q2 of this year, putting PMA submission slightly ahead of schedule in the first half of 2017. 
The in-stent restenosis IDE study is also ongoing, and we're working toward a projected second half 2016 PMA submission, seeking this expanded indication. 
Around the world, we're also working to expand access to this important technology, with submission for approval expected in the first half of the year in Japan. We also expect enrollment to begin to accelerate in our Levant China study. 
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent continues to perform well in Europe. The IDE is in follow-up after completing enrollment in Q3. This clinical study's evaluating the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease. We remain on schedule for the projected submission of the final module of the PMA in the second half of the year. 
Our COVERA next-generation stent graft, designed for use in AV access, recently received CE Mark, and the IDE was submitted in December. Our current plans have enrollment commencing in Q1. 
And our new Venovo venous stent also received CE Mark in Q4, and our first case was completed in December. In the U.S., we received approval to commence our IDE study a few weeks ago. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We're expanding the launch of the new Magic3 Go self-lubricated catheter for female patients as our manufacturing ramps up inventory. We're also building launch quantities of our Magic3 TOUCHLESS, and we anticipate launching the product family this quarter. And in endourology, we expect to launch around the end of Q1 upon FDA clearance the new process [ph] sheath family for flexible ureteroscopy. 
In temperature management, we've released software upgrades for enhanced EMR connectivity and additional user controls. 
Moving to Oncology. The new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system, which launched in Europe in Q3, has received clearance in the U.S., and we're launching the product this quarter with 3CG diamond and Pinpoint GT capabilities. We continue to believe the combination of ultrasound needle guidance and catheter tracking and tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a user-friendly and intuitive solution for vascular catheter placement. 
In PICCs, we're awaiting FDA clearance for the launch anticipated in the first half of this year of our new family of chemical-resistant catheters based on a new material designed to resist commonly used chemotherapy solutions, as well as cleaning and disinfecting agents. We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family, designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis or DVT, and remain on plan to begin launching in the back half of the year. 
For the difficult stick IV catheter patients, we're gearing up to launch, around the end of the first quarter, an improved family of AccuCath wire-guided assisted products. These new products are anticipated to launch alongside our new midline catheter, the PowerGlide Pro, also slated for launch this quarter. 
And lastly, for the acute hemodialysis patient, we're preparing for the launch of the new dual-lumen Power Xenesys [ph] catheter, which was cleared by FDA earlier this month. Xenesys [ph] is designed for superior flexibility and kink resistance and flow rates in excess of 400 ml per minute in an 11 French configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. In 2016, we'll continue to expand our Phasix and XenMatrix AB families of products with launches planned throughout the year. In our BioSurgery product family, we're awaiting PMA approval for our new TRIDYNE vascular sealant and continue to anticipate approval and launch of the first in a series of indications in the back half of 2016. We're also working toward the launch of a new Progel sealant configuration, designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic surgery. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we're expanding on our recent permanent and resorbable product launches with 2 additional fixation devices slated for later this year. 
And now before I hand you over to Chris, I'd like to invite all of you to our Analyst Day to be held on Monday, May 23, at the New York Palace Hotel at 4:30 p.m. I look forward to seeing you there. 
I've stalled about as long as I can, so I guess, I'll hand it over to Chris now."
254131,321219429,923357,"CR Bard Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.

Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $33.9 million pretax, a $14.5 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives and a $4.5 million pretax charge for asset impairments. These items are detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q4 earnings press release. 
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $550.8 million in Q4 or 63.3% of sales. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $553.2 million or 63.5% of sales. That's up 40 basis points from the prior year. The headwinds to GP in Q4 included new amortization of about 30 basis points and FX at about 30 basis points. Pricing pressure, which was about 100 basis points of headwind on the revenue line, was 40 basis points of headwind in GP during the quarter. 
On the positive side for GP, mix was favorable by about 40 basis points, and cost improvements and other items drove about 100 basis points of favorability this quarter. For the full year 2015, that brings adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales to 61.8%, which was at the very high end of our original guidance, down 30 basis points from 2014. FX was a headwind of 30 basis points, price was negative by 40 basis points and new amortization was also 40 basis points. Mix was positive by 30 basis points and cost improvements and other items were about 50 basis points favorable. 
SG&A expenses were $279.3 million for the quarter or 32.1% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $271.3 million or 31.2% of sales. That's up 110 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of our Japanese joint venture. 
For the full year 2015, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 29.3%. That's a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year. SG&A was higher than we guided at the beginning of the year, primarily because of acquisitions, as well as some additional investment spending in the back half of the year, reflective of our strong operating performance. 
R&D expenditures totaled $69.4 million for the fourth quarter or 8% of sales. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $64.8 million or 7.4% of sales, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year period. 
For the full year 2015, on an adjusted basis, R&D was also 7.4% of sales, which was consistent with our guidance and reflective of a very robust level of investment spent. Interest expense was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter and $44.9 million for the full year. Other income and expense was $32.9 million of expense for the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, it was $5 million of income for the quarter and $1.6 million of income for the year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%. On an adjusted basis, it was 22%, taking us to 24.1% for the full year, right in the middle of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. The quarter, of course, was lower than the full year average due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit in December, which as you now know, has been made permanent. 
That all adds up to cash EPS of $2.43 for Q4, excluding items affecting comparability, bringing us in at $9.08 for the full year on the same basis. That's $0.03 above the high end of our original guidance for the year despite having absorbed roughly $0.15 of additional FX headwind and dilution during the course of the year, which is indicative of the strong operating performance we saw in 2015. 
We repurchased about 600,000 shares of stock in Q4, taking total buybacks in 2015 to approximately 2.7 million shares. The balance sheet as of December 31 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1 billion versus $1.1 billion at September 30. For the full year, AR days were up 0.8 days and inventory days were up 6.9 days, driven by the acquisition of our Japanese JV. 
Capital expenditures totaled $23.6 million for the quarter and $102.9 million for the year. On the liability side, total debt was $1.4 billion as of December 31, no change from September 30. Debt to total cap, at the end of the fourth quarter, was about 49% and total shareholder investment was $1.5 billion at December 31. 
So with a strong 2015 now in the books, let's turn to financial guidance for 2016, excluding the impact of items that affect comparability. For revenue, we project 2016 constant-currency organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%. Beyond organic growth, we'll benefit from incremental revenue in 2016 from the acquisitions of our Japanese JV, as well as Liberator Medical. We also expect to see a nonoperating reduction to revenue from lower sales of EP products to Boston Scientific and we're prepared for a range of levels for the Gore royalty. Therefore, our overall constant currency revenue guidance is between 6% and 8%. 
Our expectations assume no change in the market growth rates from where they've been the last couple of years, which we would characterize as being in the low single digits. Obviously, the strength of the U.S. dollar will continue to be a headwind for U.S. multinational companies in 2016. We estimate that at current rates, we're looking at a revenue headwind related to currency of about 1.5%, which would put our reported revenue guidance for 2016 between 4.5% and 6.5%. 
As far as constant-currency revenue growth in our 4 disease state categories, in 2016, we expect: Vascular revenue growth to be between 3% and 7%; Urology to be between 8% and 11%; Oncology to grow between 5% and 8%; and our Surgical Specialties business to grow between 6% and 9%. To be clear, these are constant-currency growth rates, not organic. We're only providing organic revenue growth guidance at the corporate level. 
As we move down the P&L for financial guidance, we're making one important change in our presentation. As you know, when the sector moved to cash EPS, the vast majority of our peers excluded amortization of intangibles from their entire adjusted P&L. Up until now, we have been reporting amortization in the entire P&L and only excluding it from the EPS number below the line. In order to make it easier for investors to understand our results in context with others in the sector, beginning with 2016, we'll exclude the amortization of intangibles from our entire adjusted P&L. We've provided a reconciliation of the key margin percentages on the Reg G section of our Investor Relations page on our website. And a summary of that reconciliation is provided on Slide 6 of the deck associated with this call. 
So the following guidance excludes items that may affect comparability and amortization of intangibles. We expect our overall gross margin percent to improve in 2016 between 50 and 100 basis points compared to 2015, which translates to a gross margin range between 65.8% and 66.3%. That reflects about 30 basis points of pressure from the FX. 
Pricing pressure continues to be a challenge for us, and we estimate the impact on 2016 to be between 30 and 50 basis points of gross margin headwind. Our cost improvement programs are projected to contribute between 80 and 100 basis points of benefits to GP, and we expect mix to be favorable between 50 to 60 basis points, which includes the positive gross margin impact from our acquisition in Japan. 
We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about the same as 2015 as we continue to increase our investments in emerging markets this year and work to integrate our recent acquisitions. And we expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the mid-7% range again this year. This would project our operating margin in 2016 to be between 29% and 29.5%, which is an improvement of 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2015 on the same basis. 
We expect interest expense in 2016 to be between $50 million and $55 million, reflecting higher projected average rates and debt levels compared to 2015. 
Primarily as a result of jurisdictional mix, we expect a slight pause in the cadence of our improvement in the effective tax rate, which we project to be between 25.5% and 26% in 2016. The R&D tax credit is now permanent, so we will not have the sharp reduction in the Q4 effective rate that we have seen the last couple of years. 
So all of that adds up to adjusted cash EPS for 2016, excluding items that affect comparability, between $9.90 and $10.05, representing 9% to 11% reported growth over 2015. This guidance includes a projected negative currency impact of about $0.30 based on today's rates. The suspension of the medical device excise tax represents approximately $0.20 of benefit to us, essentially offsetting 2/3 of our overall estimated currency headwind in 2016 at today's rates. So while we do exclude both the negative impact of currency and the benefit from the MDET suspension, our operational EPS growth forecast would have been between 10% and 12%. 
As we enter 2016, we continue to be in investment mode, with planned, targeted incremental spending in SG&A, particularly in emerging markets, and a continued robust level of investment in R&D. We're pleased that we're able to provide attractive 2016 guidance with strong reported earnings growth. Without having to reduce or delay investments and projects, we believe will provide long-term value to our shareholders. 
In Q1, we expect constant-currency sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5% and reported revenue growth between 2.5% and 3.5%. As was the case in Q4, Q1 revenue guidance reflects the negative impact from the sell-through of existing inventory in Japan. We expect this factor to be behind us by Q2. On an organic basis, we expect Q1 sales growth to be in the 5.5% to 6% range. 
We expect adjusted cash EPS in Q1 2016 to be between $2.14 and $2.18, which reflects the initial dilution from recent acquisitions, as well as a foreign exchange headwind. We expect the dilutive impact from acquisitions, in particular, our joint venture buyout in Japan, to moderate as we move through 2016. Excluding the front-loaded dilution from acquisitions, Q1 adjusted EPS would have been about 10%. So operationally, I expect us to be off to a very solid start to the year as we move into Q1. 
As for capital expenditures, we expect 2016 to be in the $120 million range, and we expect operating cash flow to be in the $700 million range in 2016. 
Thank you for your attention. And with that, I'll turn you back to Tim."

And I think as we said when we did Rochester, and I'll repeat it again, now that we've got this really interesting platform, it works just on the back of a Urology entry strategy into the home for us. What it's given us is clearly these other capabilities that we can then begin to really think about how we can leverage into some other category areas. But we don't need to do that to make this -- both the Rochester and the Liberator now in combination very successful and really accretive to us for a long period of time.

I do know, for example, just already this year, we've had meetings with the -- well over 50 different companies and technologies, et cetera, which is a very strong start for this early in the year. So that cadence isn't changed really; the effort, momentum, the resources are all what they were. So we don't feel any differently about our profile in terms of doing acquisitions going forward."

There's no question. If you look at their metrics, the quality of their billing, the quality of their customer service and in really the great partnerships they have with all the leading manufacturers, they were, frankly, the only platform that would have fit what we were looking for. And so the complexity of building a nationwide DME distribution, having all of the licenses and all the capability to build and -- bill and ship to Medicare patients in virtually all the 50 states, and to do that at the volume of transactions that they need to do it at, is something that frankly would have not been economically viable for us to try to build.

Currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable by about 190 basis points. Our organic revenue growth this quarter was 9%, which was significantly better than our guidance of 5.5% to 6%. 
Net income for the first quarter was $116.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.54. That's down 17% and 15%, respectively. Excluding amortization and certain items have affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, first quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $177 million and $2.34. That's up 10%, 11%, respectively. This was also significantly above our expectations and represents a pretty good start to the year. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter last year, first quarter net sales in the U.S. grew 9% compared to a year ago. On a constant currency basis, in Europe, we were up 5%, Japan was down 16% and our other international businesses were up 20%. As a reminder, the reduction in Japan is due to the workdown of inventory that was recorded as revenue when we sold it to our joint venture prior to the acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. As we move into the second quarter, that inventory workdown is substantially complete, and we are benefiting from recording revenue at the customer level. 
Our emerging market geographies continued their impressive growth in the first quarter with every major geography contributing double-digit growth. China was particularly exceptional. Our investments over the last couple of years have strengthened our position in this faster-growing markets. Emerging markets represented 10% of sales in Q1 compared to just 8% a year ago. And that meaningful mix shift is occurring even with high single-digit growth in the U.S. 
Accelerating the revenue growth of the company has been the purpose of our plan for the last several years. As we said many times, we believe investing in faster-growth platforms and geographies accomplishes that objective by shifting the mix of the portfolio. While these aren't metrics we plan to disclose on a regular basis, it may be appropriate as we pass the 3-year anniversary of the announcement of our strategic investment plan, to compare the growth profile of the business then versus now. Q1 2013, when we first announced our plan, our organic growth was essentially flat. At that time, between 35% and 40% of our organic portfolio was declining, and between 10% and 15% of the portfolio was growing double digits. 
After 3 years of significant focused investments in these faster-growth areas, that mix has literally been inverted. In Q1 of 2016, only 10% to 15% of our organic portfolio's declining and between 35% and 40% of the portfolio's growing double digits. We remain in investment mode, and we believe we are just in the early stages of seeing the returns on our past investments. Our focus has been and is to build platforms and capabilities that we expect will provide sustainable growth above the sector for years to come. If you followed us for very long, you know it's not uncommon for us to have a good start to the year, but we don't typically change full year guidance after only 1 quarter. In fact, in my 24 years here, I think we've only done it once. However, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the breadth of the strength, both geographically and from a product perspective, we already expect to exceed the full year guidance we gave you 3 months ago. We're not going to get too far ahead of ourselves because there's a lot of year left and a lot of work in front of us. Chris will cover the details with you a little bit later. 
Having said that, we're very pleased with the execution of the investment plan so far. We're moving on multiple fronts across product platforms and geographies. We are growing faster than our peers and we expect that to continue. We like the position we're in and we intend to continue to invest to maintain that position. 
So with that as an introduction, let me now turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."
254131,329843971,964954,"CR Bard Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise. So we'll begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $23",1149,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise. So we'll begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $239.5 million, up 3% over last year on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Vascular sales were up 3% in the first quarter and international sales were up 10%. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and the temporary reduction in Japan sales due to the acquisition, global Vascular sales grew 12%. 
Sales in our surgical graft category grew 3% this quarter, within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business was up 9% in the first quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy products were well above trend at 16% growth in Q1 with strong growth in the United States and emerging markets. There was good momentum in this business, but the strong 2015 we had provided some tougher comps in the coming quarters. 
Our peripheral PTA line increased 19% in the first quarter with our Lutonix DCB growing significantly. We are pleased with how our teams have executed here, and we expect that the expanding real-world data around effectiveness and safety will continue to support the selection of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon as the first line of therapy for peripheral artery disease. I'll remind you that in the first quarter of 2015 was a relatively easy comp due to the significant initial stocking in the fourth quarter of 2014, and the upcoming quarters have some more difficult comps as we saw stocking for Boston Scientific in the second quarter and third quarter of 2015 related to our distribution agreement with them. 
Our Stent business declined 1% in the first quarter compared to the prior year, impacted by the acquisition in Japan. And our vena cava filter line grew 3% in the quarter.
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $216.7 million, up 5% versus the first quarter of last year on a reported basis and up 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from Japan and the acquisition of Liberator Medical, global Urology sales were still up 5%, with the United States also up 5% and international up 3%. 
We saw healthy double-digit growth in our Targeted Temperature Management products again this quarter. Our basic drainage business was up 5% in Q1. In this category, we benefited from the new sales from Liberator, but had declines related to the inventory in Japan. If you exclude both of those, the business was still up 5% globally and up 6% in the United States, with our ICE Foley business up 4% globally and also up 4% in the United States. 
Looking at the last several quarters, we would characterize the results here as stable, but not necessarily accelerating on a macro level. We do see specific growth driven by a few new products of ours, both in the hospital and in the home.
Our continence business was up 22% in Q1, but would've been flat excluding Liberator and Japan. I'll remind you that the Liberator platform added ostomy products to our venue -- to our revenue and those are recorded in continence. 
Sales in urological specialties were up 8% in Q1 with our brachytherapy business also up 8%. As we said last quarter, we did not keep significant stocking inventory in Japan on the brachytherapy products. So we began recognizing customer level pricing in Q4 when we closed the acquisition. And finally, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line decreased 5% in Q1.
Next up is Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $241.9 million, an increase of 8% over Q1 last year on a reported basis and up 10% on a constant currency basis. We worked through the Japanese inventory a little quicker in this business and began to benefit from end customer sales in Japan in the first quarter. Excluding Japan, global Oncology sales were up 8%, with the United States up 6% and international sales up 15%.
Our port business rebounded from the temporary issues we told you about last quarter and grew 8% over Q1 of last year. Our PICC revenue was up 9% globally. As our largest single product line, we continue to expect PICCs to be a meaningful source of growth for us, especially in international markets where PICC penetration is in its very early days.
And to close out the category, our vascular access ultrasound product line grew 15% this quarter as we launched our new Site-Rite 8 platform. And our dialysis catheter product line was up 12%.
Now let's finish with Surgical Specialties. Total net sales in this category were $151.4 million, up 11% on a reported basis and up 13% on a constant currency basis. The impact to this business from the Japan acquisition was minimal. Excluding Japan, the global sales growth was still 13%, with United States sales of 12% and international sales of 14% in the quarter. 
Our performance irrigation business declined 6% in Q1 as we anniversary-ed the discontinuation of certain products in this category. Our soft tissue repair business grew 13% this quarter, which is the strongest growth we've seen for this category since Q3 of 2010. 
As we've seen over the last few years, the growth in synthetic hernia and biologic hernia are inversely related as procedures move from one to the other. This quarter saw a significant in reduction in overall natural tissue hernia, which declined 19% despite very good growth in our Xen AB platform. However, our synthetic hernia business grew 19%, which is the strongest growth we've seen in this product line since the first quarter of 2004, 12 years ago. While this business is mostly in the United stage -- States, which is benefiting from our new Phasix material, our emerging markets are growing nicely with our legacy portfolio. 
Because our mix in soft tissue is more than 5:1, in favor of synthetics, as positions move from biologics to synthetics or hybrids, we typically do well in that exchange as demonstrated this quarter by the strong performance in total soft tissue repair. 
Our hernia fixation line grew 37% this quarter as our new products are having an impact as anticipated. As we told you, we have the broadest portfolio in hernia repair across all types of products, from wide range of synthetics to hybrids, to natural tissue and now antibiotic-coated natural tissue. We are working with physicians to identify the right product for the right patient and provide a wide range of options for them.
Finally, our BioSurgery business grew in the healthy double digits again this quarter, and we believe continues to be a significant long-term growth opportunity for us.
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

And i",841,"Thanks for joining us, and good evening, everyone. With the Analyst Day in about a month, I'm just going to hit some of the highlights today, starting with our drug-coated balloon pipeline where we've launched our new 7-millimeter diameter products. And in early April, we also launched our full line of compatible DCBs. So now every balloon size for the SFA indication is available in a 5 per inch compatible configuration giving us a competitive advantage. After our submission last quarter of our long lesion supplement, we're hopeful for a late second half launch for the treatment of lesions up to 300 millimeters in length. In our Below the Knee IDE, enrollment is beginning to accelerate after FDA approved the expansion of our inclusion criteria in mid-Q1. 
At projected recruitment rates, we continue to anticipate enrollment through 2016, putting PMA submission likely in the first half of 2018. 
Moving to the AV access DCB IDE study. We completed enrollment in Q1 and are now in the 6-month follow-up window. Though these things are a little hard to predict precisely, we believe we should have results sometime in Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017, ahead of our previous schedule. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a second half 2017 U.S. launch. We're also anticipating the submission of our in-stent restenosis PMA supplement in the next couple of months. 
Around the world, we're working to expand access to this important technology. For example, are shown in submission for the SFA indication occurred in the end of Q1, seeking approval in Japan, and we began enrollment in our China study a few weeks ago. 
Also in Vascular, the live stream balloon expandable covered stent trial was fully enrolled in Q3 of 2015. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed with a 9-month follow-up in the treatment of iliac artery disease. Our current projected timeline continues to support submission of our final PMA module before year-end. 
Our COVERA next-generation stent graph IDE is under review at FDA, and we anticipate commencing enrollment upon approval. COVERA's design for use in the AV access circuit. Also in stents, our vivo vena stent is doing well in Europe, and we commenced enrollment in our U.S. IDE just a couple of weeks ago. We anticipate enrollment through 2016 with follow-up through 2017 and PMA submission in 2018. 
Our biopsy business launched 8 new products, including Encore Inspire, Encore Ultra and the mission semi-automatic biopsy family this quarter in Asia while launching 18 new products in Latin America and the Middle East. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We exited Q1 with launches in all 4 of our franchises. First, for the home care market, we launched our new Magic3 TOUCHLESS intermittent self-catheterization platform. We also launched our new proxy sheath family for flexible ureteroscopy in our endourology family, and we launched our new fully daily care kit designed to help health care workers adhere to best practices in daily full catheter care and maintenance in our basic drainage segment. In Targeted Temperature Management, we launched some new adult pad sizes to support temperature control over a broader range of patient sizes. 
Moving to Oncology. We're still working with FDA seeking clearance for the launch anticipated later this quarter of our new family of chemical-resistant catheters. We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis, or DVT, and remain on plan to begin launching in the back half of the year. 
For the difficult stick IV catheter patients, we began to launch of our AccuCath wire-guided assisted products earlier this month with additional sizes to launch over the next couple of quarters. These new products are complementary to our new midline catheter, the PowerGlide Pro, slated for launch upon FDA clearance. 
Lastly, in Q1, we launched our new dual-lumen power Xenesys catheter designed for superior flexibility, kink resistance and flow rates in excess of 400 mills [ph] per minute in a small 11-fringe [ph] catheter configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. Just a few days ago, we received PMA approval for our new TRIDYNE aortic sealant, and we're preparing to launch this new product around the end of this quarter. We're also working toward the launch of a new Progel sealant configuration designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic surgery and expect PMA submission this quarter with approval and launch around the end of year. We're also expanding our portfolio with Phasix resorbable mesh with additional sizes anticipated to launch in the back half of the year. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we anticipate expanding on our recent permanent and resorbable product launches, with 2 additional resorbable fixation devices slated for later this year. 
Now before I hand you over to Chris, I'd like to remind all of you to join us at our Analyst Day on Monday, May 23, at the New York Palace hotel at 4:30 p.m. I look forward to seeing you there. And now here's Chris."
254131,329843971,964954,"CR Bard Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $4.5 million pretax, a $9.8 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives, and",1046,"Thank you, John. Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $4.5 million pretax, a $9.8 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives, and we booked expense of $48.9 million for product liability matters, which principally is related to litigation on IVC filters. The P&L impact of these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and in the reconciliation accompanying our Q1 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter, and I'll remind you that our adjusted numbers now exclude the amortization of intangibles from the entire P&L, and the references to prior year are on that same basis. Gross profit was $553.1 million or 63.3% of sales for Q1. On an adjusted basis, GP was $581.2 million or 66.5% of sales. That's up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter and better than we expected. FX cost us about 20 basis points in GP for the quarter. Price pressure drove 40 basis points on the revenue line in Q1 and 20 basis points of headwind on GPs, which was significantly better than our expectations and the best result we've seen since 2010. We still expect price to be more of a headwind going forward, but we're certainly happy with the Q1 results. Our cost improvements and other items drove 90 basis points of benefit to GPs this quarter and mix was favorable by 160 basis points, which includes the gross profit benefit from acquiring our Japanese JV. As we look to Q2, we expect gross margin to be over 100 basis points better than Q2 of 2015. And for the full year, we're comfortable with our guidance for gross profit improvement. 
SG&A expenses were $270.6 million for the quarter or 31% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $266.5 million or 30.5% of sales, an increase of 180 basis points over last year. This is reflective of the timing of the 2 recent acquisitions, and we expect Q2 will also be higher than prior year as well. We still expect the full year to be about the same as 2015 as a percentage of sales as we integrate the acquisitions and leverage our infrastructure on higher sales throughout the year. 
R&D expenditures totaled $68.3 million for the first quarter or 7.8% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D was $66.8 million or 7.6% of sales, up 20 basis points from Q1 of last year and consistent with our guidance. Interest expense was $11.3 million for the quarter. Other income expense was $60 million of expense for the first quarter as reported and $1.9 million of income on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.7% on a reported basis and 25.8% on an adjusted basis, right in the middle of our full year guidance. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.2 million, and we purchased 897,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $186.57. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.34, which was well above our expectations for the quarter. This overachievement was driven by the strong sales and a slight easing of FX headwinds. The balance sheet, as of March 31, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion, essentially no change from December 31. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were up 1.2 days and inventory days were up 6.3 days. Both of these increases are related to the recent acquisitions. Capital expenditures totaled $20.5 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.7 billion as of March 31 compared to $1.4 billion at the end of December. Debt to total cap at the end of the first quarter was about 53%, and total shareholder investment was $1.5 billion at March 31. 
Turning now to guidance. In Q2, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 6.5% and 8%, with reported sales growth between 5.5% and 7%, inferring an FX headwind of approximately 1% on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 5.5% and 6% for the second quarter. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, excluding items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles, we see the second quarter in the range of $2.43 to $2.47. 
Given such a strong operational start to 2016, along with an easing of FX headwinds, we're comfortable raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 7% and 8.5%, with reported sales growth between 6% and 8%, inferring a currency headwind of between 50 and 100 basis points. 
On an organic basis, we had originally guided the year to be between 5% and 6%, but are increasing that range meaningfully today to be between 6% and 6.5%. It's not lost on us, and we're sure it's not lost on you that we did meaningfully better than that in Q1. To be clear, we see good momentum in the business and continued strength in our positioning. However, there were several product lines this quarter well above trend. China was exceptionally strong, and I just highlighted price headwind was abnormally low. So before we take the sustainability of some of these factors to the bank, we think it is prudent to get a little deeper into the year. 
We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.05 and $10.18, which is just about $0.15 above our original guidance range at the midpoint and represents 11% to 12% growth over 2015. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be approximately $0.20 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we are guiding to 13% to 14% growth. Given the strength of our operating performance, the success of our investment program and the demonstrated ability of our teams to execute against commitments, we plan to accelerate certain investments and targeted projects and geographies, beginning in Q2 and throughout the remainder of the year. We believe this disciplined investment approach will help provide sustainable profitable growth and value for our shareholders for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn you back to Tim."

And probably most prominently within Vascular, we've got Lutonix approvals coming down the pipeline here in fairly short order and having controlled that direct sales force ourselves, getting them aligned the right way and getting them motivated and ready for those launches again relative to the old ownership structure. We just feel we're in a position to maximize that opportunity in a way we just would haven't been able to otherwise."

Clearly, TTM continues to do well. The acquisitions that we've made continue to perform well. And the uptake in the U.S. seems to have become more steady. When you talk to hospital CEOs, I'm hearing more of them talk about some of their issues being things like nursing turnover, again being a big issue. We haven't really heard that, at least I am from a lot of hospital CEOs for several years now.

And thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us today. I would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 30 minutes, and we're going to try and keep the total call to about an hour. There is a slide deck available on the Investor Relations page of our website intended to help explain some of the moving pieces in our results and guidance.
The discussions today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review first quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior Vice President of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development pipeline; lastly, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will review the first quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. And then finally, we'll close with Q&A.
First quarter 2016 net sales totaled $873.5 million. That's up 7% over the first quarter last year on an as-reported basis and up 8.5% on a constant-currency basis. Currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable by about 190 basis points. Our organic revenue growth this quarter was 9%, which was significantly better than our guidance of 5.5% to 6%.
Net income for the first quarter was $116.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.54. That's down 17% and 15%, respectively. Excluding amortization and certain items that have affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, first quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $177 million and $2.34. That's up 10% and 11%, respectively. This was also significantly above our expectations and represents a pretty good start to the year.
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter last year, first quarter net sales in the U.S. grew 9% compared to a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, in Europe, we were up 5%, Japan was down 16% and our other international businesses were up 20%. As a reminder, the reduction in Japan is due to the workdown of inventory that was recorded as revenue when we sold it to our joint venture prior to the acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. As we move into the second quarter, that inventory workdown is substantially complete, and we are benefiting from recording revenue at the customer level.
Our emerging market geographies continued their impressive growth in the first quarter, with every major geography, contributing double-digit growth. China was particularly exceptional. Our investments over the last couple of years have strengthened our position in these faster-growing markets. Emerging markets represented 10% of sales in Q1 compared to just 8% a year ago. And that meaningful mix shift is occurring even with high single-digit growth in the U.S. 
Accelerating the revenue growth of the company has been the purpose of our plan for the last several years. As we said many times, we believe investing in faster-growth platforms and geographies accomplishes that objective by shifting the mix of the portfolio. While these aren't metrics we plan to disclose on a regular basis, it may be appropriate as we pass the 3-year anniversary of the announcement of our strategic investment plan, to compare the growth profile of the business then versus now. Q1 2013, when we first announced our plan, our organic growth was essentially flat. At that time, between 35% and 40% of our organic portfolio was declining, and between 10% and 15% of the portfolio was growing double digits.
After 3 years of significant focused investments in these faster-growth areas, that mix has literally been inverted. In Q1 of 2016, only 10% to 15% of our organic portfolio was declining and between 35% and 40% of the portfolio was growing double digits. We remained in investment mode, and we believe we are just in the early stages of seeing the returns on our past investments. Our focus has been and is to build platforms and capabilities that we expect will provide sustainable growth above the sector for years to come. If you followed us for very long, it's not uncommon for us to have a good start to the year, but we don't typically change full year guidance after only 1 quarter. In fact, in my 24 years here, I think we've only done it once. However, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the breadth of the strength, both geographically and from a product perspective, we already expect to exceed the full year guidance we gave you 3 months ago. We're not going to get too far ahead of ourselves because there's a lot of the year left and a lot of work in front of us. Chris will cover the details with you a little bit later. 
Having said that, we're very pleased with the execution of the investment plan, so far. We're moving on multiple fronts across product platforms and geographies. We are growing faster than our peers, and we expect that to continue. We like the position we're in and we intend to continue to invest to maintain that position.
So with that as an introduction, let me now turn it over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."
254131,329843971,965187,"CR Bard Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant-currency basis, unless noted otherwise. So we'll begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $23",1144,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant-currency basis, unless noted otherwise. So we'll begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $239.5 million, up 3% over last year on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant-currency basis. U.S. Vascular sales were up 3% in the first quarter and international sales were up 10%. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and the temporary reduction in Japan sales due to the acquisition, global Vascular sales grew 12%.
Sales in our surgical graft category grew 3% this quarter, within a range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business was up 9% in the first quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy products were well above trend at 16% growth in Q1 with strong growth in the United States and emerging markets. There was good momentum in this business, but the strong 2015 we had provided some tougher comps in the coming quarters.
Our peripheral PTA line increased 19% in the first quarter with our Lutonix DCB growing significantly. We are pleased with how our teams have executed here, and we expect that the expanding real-world data around effectiveness and safety will continue to support the selection of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon as the first line of therapy for peripheral artery disease. I'll remind you that in the first quarter of 2015 was a relatively easy comp due to the significant initial stocking in the fourth quarter of 2014, and the upcoming quarters have some more difficult comps as we saw stocking for Boston Scientific in the second quarter and third quarter of 2015 related to our distribution agreement with them.
Our Stent business declined 1% in the first quarter compared to the prior year, impacted by the acquisition in Japan. And our vena cava filter line grew 3% in the quarter.
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $216.7 million, up 5% versus the first quarter of last year on a reported basis and up 7% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding the impact from Japan and the acquisition of Liberator Medical, global Urology sales were still up 5%, with the United States also up 5% and international up 3%. 
We saw healthy double-digit growth in our Targeted Temperature Management products again this quarter. Our basic drainage business was up 5% in Q1. In this category, we benefited from the new sales from Liberator, but had declines related to the inventory in Japan. If you exclude both of those, the business was still up 5% globally and up 6% in the United States, with our I.C. Foleys business up 4% globally and also up 4% in the United States. 
Looking at the last several quarters, we would characterize the results here as stable, but not necessarily accelerating on a macro level. We do see specific growth driven by a few new products of ours, both in the hospital and in the home.
Our continence business was up 22% in Q1, but would have been flat excluding Liberator and Japan. I'll remind you that the Liberator platform added Ostomy products to our venue -- to our revenue and those are recorded in continence. 
Sales in urological specialties were up 8% in Q1 with our brachytherapy business also up 8%. As we said last quarter, we did not keep significant stocking inventory in Japan on the brachytherapy products. So we began recognizing customer level pricing in Q4 when we closed the acquisition. And finally, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line decreased 5% in Q1.
Next up is Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $241.9 million, an increase of 8% over Q1 last year on a reported basis and up 10% on a constant-currency basis. We worked with the Japanese inventory a little quicker in this business and began to benefit from end customer sales in Japan in the first quarter. Excluding Japan, global Oncology sales were up 8%, with the United States up 6% and international sales up 15%.
Our port business rebounded from the temporary issues we told you about last quarter and grew 8% over Q1 of last year. Our PICC revenue was up 9% globally. As our largest single product line, we continue to expect PICCs to be a meaningful source of growth for us, especially in international markets where PICC penetration is in its very early days.
And to close out the category, our vascular access ultrasound product line grew 15% this quarter as we launched our new Site-Rite 8 platform. And our dialysis catheter product line was up 12%.
Now let's finish with Surgical Specialties. Total net sales in this category were $151.4 million, up 11% on a reported basis and up 13% on a constant-currency basis. The impact to this business from the Japan acquisition was minimal. Excluding Japan, the global sales growth was still 13%, with United States sales of 12% and international sales of 14% in the quarter.
Our performance irrigation business declined 6% in Q1 as we anniversary-ed the discontinuation of certain products in this category. Our soft tissue repair business grew 13% this quarter, which is the strongest growth we've seen for this category since Q3 of 2010.
As we've seen over the last few years, the growth in synthetic hernia and biologic hernia are inversely related as procedures move from one to the other. This quarter saw a significant reduction in overall natural tissue hernia, which declined 19% despite very good growth in our Xen AB platform. However, our synthetic hernia business grew 19%, which is the strongest growth we've seen in this product line since the first quarter of 2004, 12 years ago. While this business is mostly in the United stage -- States, which is benefiting from our new Phasix material, our emerging markets are growing nicely with our legacy portfolio.
Because our mix in soft tissue is more than 5:1, in favor of synthetics, as positions move from biologics to synthetics or hybrids, we typically do well in that exchange as demonstrated this quarter by the strong performance in total soft tissue repair.
Our hernia fixation line grew 37% this quarter as our new products are having an impact as anticipated. As we told you, we have the broadest portfolio in hernia repair across all types of products, from wide range of synthetics to hybrids, to natural tissue and now antibiotic-coated natural tissue. We are working with physicians to identify the right product for the right patient and provide a wide range of options for them.
Finally, our BioSurgery business grew in the healthy double digits again this quarter, and we believe continues to be a significant long-term growth opportunity for us.
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

At projected recruitment rates, we continue to anticipate enrollment through 2016, putting PMA submission likely in the first half of 2018.
Moving to the AV access DCB IDE study. We completed enrollment in Q1 and are now in the 6-month follow-up window. Though these things are a little hard to predict precisely, we believe we should have results sometime in Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017, ahead of our previous schedule. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a second half 2017 U.S. launch. We're also anticipating the submission of our in-stent restenosis PMA supplement in the next couple of months.
Around the world, we're working to expand access to this important technology. For example, are shown in submission for the SFA indication occurred at the end of Q1, seeking approval in Japan. And we began enrollment in our China study a few weeks ago.
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent trial was fully enrolled in Q3 of 2015. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed with a 9-month follow-up in the treatment of iliac artery disease. Our current projected time line continues to support submission of our final PMA module before year-end.
Our COVERA next-generation stent graph IDE is under review at FDA, and we anticipate commencing enrollment upon approval. COVERA's design for use in the AV access circuit. Also in the stents, our Venovo venous stent is doing well in Europe, and we commenced enrollment in our U.S. IDE just a couple of weeks ago. We anticipate enrollment through 2016 with follow-up through 2017 and PMA submission in 2018.
Our biopsy business launched 8 new products, including EnCor Enspire, EnCor Ultra and the Mission semi-automatic biopsy family this quarter in Asia while launching 18 new products in Latin America and the Middle East.
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We exited Q1 with launches in all 4 of our franchises. First, for the home care market, we launched our new Magic3 TOUCHLESS intermittent self-catheterization platform. We also launched our new proxy sheath family for flexible ureteroscopy in our endourology family. And we launched our new fully daily care kit designed to help health care workers adhere to best practices in daily full catheter care and maintenance in our basic drainage segment. In Targeted Temperature Management, we launched some new adult pad sizes to support temperature control over a broader range of patient sizes.
Moving to Oncology. We're still working with FDA seeking clearance for the launch anticipated later this quarter of our new family of chemical-resistant catheters. We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis, or DVT, and remain on plan to begin launching in the back half of the year. 
For the difficult stick IV catheter patients, we began to launch of our AccuCath wire-guided assisted products earlier this month with additional sizes to launch over the next couple of quarters. These new products are complementary to our new midline catheter, the PowerGlide Pro, slated for launch upon FDA clearance.
Lastly, in Q1, we launched our new dual-lumen Power Xenosys [ph] catheter designed for superior flexibility, kink resistance and flow rates in excess of 400 ml per minute in a small 11 French catheter configuration.
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. Just a few days ago, we received PMA approval for our new TRIDYNE aortic sealant, and we're preparing to launch this new product around the end of this quarter. We're also working toward the launch of a new Progel sealant configuration designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic surgery. And expect PMA submission this quarter with approval and launch around the end of year. We're also expanding our portfolio with Phasix resorbable mesh with additional sizes anticipated to launch in the back half of the year.
And finally, in mesh fixation, we anticipate expanding on our recent permanent and resorbable product launches, with 2 additional resorbable fixation devices slated for later this year.
Now before I hand you over to Chris, I'd like to remind all of you to join us at our Analyst Day on Monday, May 23, at the New York Palace hotel at 4:30 p.m. I look forward to seeing you there. And now here's Chris."
254131,329843971,965187,"CR Bard Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $4.5 million pretax, a $9.8 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives, and",1048,"Thank you, John. Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $4.5 million pretax, a $9.8 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives, and we booked expense of $48.9 million for product liability matters, which principally is related to litigation on IVC filters. The P&L impact of these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and in the reconciliation accompanying our Q1 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter, and I'll remind you that our adjusted numbers now exclude the amortization of intangibles from the entire P&L, and the references to prior year are on that same basis. Gross profit was $553.1 million or 63.3% of sales for Q1. On an adjusted basis, GP was $581.2 million or 66.5% of sales. That's up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter and better than we expected. FX cost us about 20 basis points in GP for the quarter. Price pressure drove 40 basis points on the revenue line in Q1 and 20 basis points of headwind on GPs, which was significantly better than our expectations and the best result we've seen since 2010. We still expect price to be more of a headwind going forward, but we're certainly happy with the Q1 results. Our cost improvements and other items drove 90 basis points of benefit to GPs this quarter and mix was favorable by 160 basis points, which includes the gross profit benefit from acquiring our Japanese JV. As we look to Q2, we expect gross margin to be over 100 basis points better than Q2 of 2015. And for the full year, we're comfortable with our guidance for gross profit improvement.
SG&A expenses were $270.6 million for the quarter or 31% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $266.5 million or 30.5% of sales, an increase of 180 basis points over last year. This is reflective of the timing of the 2 recent acquisitions, and we expect Q2 will also be higher than prior year as well. We still expect the full year to be about the same as 2015 as a percentage of sales as we integrate the acquisitions and leverage our infrastructure on higher sales throughout the year.
R&D expenditures totaled $68.3 million for the first quarter or 7.8% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D was $66.8 million or 7.6% of sales, up 20 basis points from Q1 of last year and consistent with our guidance. Interest expense was $11.3 million for the quarter. Other income and expense was $60 million of expense for the first quarter as reported and $1.9 million of income on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.7% on a reported basis and 25.8% on an adjusted basis, right in the middle of our full year guidance.
Diluted shares for the period were 75.2 million, and we purchased 897,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $186.57. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.34, which was well above our expectations for the quarter. This overachievement was driven by the strong sales fee and a slight easing of FX headwinds. The balance sheet, as of March 31, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion, essentially no change from December 31. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were up 1.2 days and inventory days were up 6.3 days. Both of these increases are related to the recent acquisitions. Capital expenditures totaled $20.5 million for the quarter.
On the liability side, total debt was $1.7 billion as of March 31 compared to $1.4 billion at the end of December. Debt to total cap at the end of the first quarter was about 53%, and total shareholder investment was $1.5 billion at March 31.
Turning now to guidance. In Q2, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 6.5% and 8%, with reported sales growth between 5.5% and 7%, inferring an FX headwind of approximately 1% on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 5.5% and 6% for the second quarter. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, excluding items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles, we see the second quarter in the range of $2.43 to $2.47.
Given such a strong operational start to 2016, along with an easing of FX headwinds, we're comfortable raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 7% and 8.5%, with reported sales growth between 6% and 8%, inferring a currency headwind of between 50 and 100 basis points.
On an organic basis, we had originally guided the year to be between 5% and 6%, but are increasing that range meaningfully today to be between 6% and 6.5%. It's not lost on us, and we're sure it's not lost on you that we did meaningfully better than that in Q1. To be clear, we see good momentum in the business and continued strength in our positioning. However, there were several product lines this quarter well above trend. China was exceptionally strong, and I just highlighted price headwind was abnormally low. So before we take the sustainability of some of these factors to the bank, we think it is prudent to get a little deeper into the year.
We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.05 and $10.18, which is just about $0.15 above our original guidance range at the midpoint and represents 11% to 12% growth over 2015. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be approximately $0.20 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we are guiding to 13% to 14% growth. Given the strength of our operating performance, the success of our investment program and the demonstrated ability of our teams to execute against commitments, we plan to accelerate certain investments and targeted projects and geographies, beginning in Q2 and throughout the remainder of the year. We believe this disciplined investment approach will help provide sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareholders for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn you back to Tim."

They're clearly, Oncology, there's always new products kind of flowing through there, but that's one of the biggest drivers in emerging markets, especially in China. So again, you've got kind of both themes there as well. Vascular continues to do well. The PTA line, Lutonix in the U.S. continues to do well. And Urology, even across the board, clearly, TTM continues to do well. The acquisitions that we've made continue to perform well. And the uptake in the U.S. seems to have become more steady. When you talk to hospital CEOs, I'm hearing more of them talk about some of their issues being things like nursing turnover, again being a big issue. We really haven't heard that, at least I haven't from a lot of hospital CEOs for several years now. So that's an indication perhaps that volumes are coming back or other opportunities for nurses outside of hospitals one or and above of those things.

So as the sales that would already previously made into the joint venture then gets sold out the door to the customer, that incremental pricing right is gross margin. We're obviously no longer booking sales as we fill the pipe into the JV. So mix, as we expected for the full year from the JV, would be a positive contributor. It's actually more prominent in Q1 because there's fewer sales that we're booking into the JV. So I think the way to think about gross margin over the full year is actually -- we'll probably be pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter here on out as that -- as we see the normalization of Japan over time.

Again if we execute those are 2 things we can control. And then FX is obviously something that we can't."

And thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us today. I would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 30 minutes, and we're going to try and keep the total call to about an hour. There is a slide deck available on the Investor Relations page of our website intended to help explain some of the moving pieces in our results and guidance.
The discussions today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review first quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior Vice President of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development pipeline; lastly, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will review the first quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. And then finally, we'll close with Q&A.
First quarter 2016 net sales totaled $873.5 million. That's up 7% over the first quarter last year on an as-reported basis and up 8.5% on a constant-currency basis. Currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable by about 190 basis points. Our organic revenue growth this quarter was 9%, which was significantly better than our guidance of 5.5% to 6%.
Net income for the first quarter was $116.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.54. That's down 17% and 15%, respectively. Excluding amortization and certain items that have affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, first quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $177 million and $2.34. That's up 10% and 11%, respectively. This was also significantly above our expectations and represents a pretty good start to the year.
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter last year, first quarter net sales in the U.S. grew 9% compared to a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, in Europe, we were up 5%, Japan was down 16% and our other international businesses were up 20%. As a reminder, the reduction in Japan is due to the workdown of inventory that was recorded as revenue when we sold it to our joint venture prior to the acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. As we move into the second quarter, that inventory workdown is substantially complete, and we are benefiting from recording revenue at the customer level.
Our emerging market geographies continued their impressive growth in the first quarter, with every major geography, contributing double-digit growth. China was particularly exceptional. Our investments over the last couple of years have strengthened our position in these faster-growing markets. Emerging markets represented 10% of sales in Q1 compared to just 8% a year ago. And that meaningful mix shift is occurring even with high single-digit growth in the U.S. 
Accelerating the revenue growth of the company has been the purpose of our plan for the last several years. As we said many times, we believe investing in faster-growth platforms and geographies accomplishes that objective by shifting the mix of the portfolio. While these aren't metrics we plan to disclose on a regular basis, it may be appropriate as we pass the 3-year anniversary of the announcement of our strategic investment plan, to compare the growth profile of the business then versus now. Q1 2013, when we first announced our plan, our organic growth was essentially flat. At that time, between 35% and 40% of our organic portfolio was declining, and between 10% and 15% of the portfolio was growing double digits.
After 3 years of significant focused investments in these faster-growth areas, that mix has literally been inverted. In Q1 of 2016, only 10% to 15% of our organic portfolio was declining and between 35% and 40% of the portfolio was growing double digits. We remained in investment mode, and we believe we are just in the early stages of seeing the returns on our past investments. Our focus has been and is to build platforms and capabilities that we expect will provide sustainable growth above the sector for years to come. If you followed us for very long, it's not uncommon for us to have a good start to the year, but we don't typically change full year guidance after only 1 quarter. In fact, in my 24 years here, I think we've only done it once. However, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the breadth of the strength, both geographically and from a product perspective, we already expect to exceed the full year guidance we gave you 3 months ago. We're not going to get too far ahead of ourselves because there's a lot of the year left and a lot of work in front of us. Chris will cover the details with you a little bit later. 
Having said that, we're very pleased with the execution of the investment plan, so far. We're moving on multiple fronts across product platforms and geographies. We are growing faster than our peers, and we expect that to continue. We like the position we're in and we intend to continue to invest to maintain that position.
So with that as an introduction, let me now turn it over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant-currency basis, unless noted otherwise. So we'll begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $23",1144,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant-currency basis, unless noted otherwise. So we'll begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $239.5 million, up 3% over last year on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant-currency basis. U.S. Vascular sales were up 3% in the first quarter and international sales were up 10%. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and the temporary reduction in Japan sales due to the acquisition, global Vascular sales grew 12%.
Sales in our surgical graft category grew 3% this quarter, within a range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business was up 9% in the first quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy products were well above trend at 16% growth in Q1 with strong growth in the United States and emerging markets. There was good momentum in this business, but the strong 2015 we had provided some tougher comps in the coming quarters.
Our peripheral PTA line increased 19% in the first quarter with our Lutonix DCB growing significantly. We are pleased with how our teams have executed here, and we expect that the expanding real-world data around effectiveness and safety will continue to support the selection of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon as the first line of therapy for peripheral artery disease. I'll remind you that in the first quarter of 2015 was a relatively easy comp due to the significant initial stocking in the fourth quarter of 2014, and the upcoming quarters have some more difficult comps as we saw stocking for Boston Scientific in the second quarter and third quarter of 2015 related to our distribution agreement with them.
Our Stent business declined 1% in the first quarter compared to the prior year, impacted by the acquisition in Japan. And our vena cava filter line grew 3% in the quarter.
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $216.7 million, up 5% versus the first quarter of last year on a reported basis and up 7% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding the impact from Japan and the acquisition of Liberator Medical, global Urology sales were still up 5%, with the United States also up 5% and international up 3%. 
We saw healthy double-digit growth in our Targeted Temperature Management products again this quarter. Our basic drainage business was up 5% in Q1. In this category, we benefited from the new sales from Liberator, but had declines related to the inventory in Japan. If you exclude both of those, the business was still up 5% globally and up 6% in the United States, with our I.C. Foleys business up 4% globally and also up 4% in the United States. 
Looking at the last several quarters, we would characterize the results here as stable, but not necessarily accelerating on a macro level. We do see specific growth driven by a few new products of ours, both in the hospital and in the home.
Our continence business was up 22% in Q1, but would have been flat excluding Liberator and Japan. I'll remind you that the Liberator platform added Ostomy products to our venue -- to our revenue and those are recorded in continence. 
Sales in urological specialties were up 8% in Q1 with our brachytherapy business also up 8%. As we said last quarter, we did not keep significant stocking inventory in Japan on the brachytherapy products. So we began recognizing customer level pricing in Q4 when we closed the acquisition. And finally, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line decreased 5% in Q1.
Next up is Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $241.9 million, an increase of 8% over Q1 last year on a reported basis and up 10% on a constant-currency basis. We worked with the Japanese inventory a little quicker in this business and began to benefit from end customer sales in Japan in the first quarter. Excluding Japan, global Oncology sales were up 8%, with the United States up 6% and international sales up 15%.
Our port business rebounded from the temporary issues we told you about last quarter and grew 8% over Q1 of last year. Our PICC revenue was up 9% globally. As our largest single product line, we continue to expect PICCs to be a meaningful source of growth for us, especially in international markets where PICC penetration is in its very early days.
And to close out the category, our vascular access ultrasound product line grew 15% this quarter as we launched our new Site-Rite 8 platform. And our dialysis catheter product line was up 12%.
Now let's finish with Surgical Specialties. Total net sales in this category were $151.4 million, up 11% on a reported basis and up 13% on a constant-currency basis. The impact to this business from the Japan acquisition was minimal. Excluding Japan, the global sales growth was still 13%, with United States sales of 12% and international sales of 14% in the quarter.
Our performance irrigation business declined 6% in Q1 as we anniversary-ed the discontinuation of certain products in this category. Our soft tissue repair business grew 13% this quarter, which is the strongest growth we've seen for this category since Q3 of 2010.
As we've seen over the last few years, the growth in synthetic hernia and biologic hernia are inversely related as procedures move from one to the other. This quarter saw a significant reduction in overall natural tissue hernia, which declined 19% despite very good growth in our Xen AB platform. However, our synthetic hernia business grew 19%, which is the strongest growth we've seen in this product line since the first quarter of 2004, 12 years ago. While this business is mostly in the United stage -- States, which is benefiting from our new Phasix material, our emerging markets are growing nicely with our legacy portfolio.
Because our mix in soft tissue is more than 5:1, in favor of synthetics, as physicians move from biologics to synthetics or hybrids, we typically do well in that exchange as demonstrated this quarter by the strong performance in total soft tissue repair.
Our hernia fixation line grew 37% this quarter as our new products are having an impact as anticipated. As we told you, we have the broadest portfolio in hernia repair across all types of products, from wide range of synthetics to hybrids, to natural tissue and now antibiotic-coated natural tissue. We are working with physicians to identify the right product for the right patient and provide a wide range of options for them.
Finally, our BioSurgery business grew in the healthy double digits again this quarter, and we believe continues to be a significant long-term growth opportunity for us.
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

With the Analyst Day in about a month, I'm just going to hit some of the highlights today, starting with our drug-coated balloon pipeline where we've launched our new 7-millimeter diameter products. And in early April, we also launched our full line of 5 per inch compatible DCBs. So now every balloon size for the SFA indication is available in a 5 per inch compatible configuration giving us a competitive advantage. After our submission last quarter of our long lesion supplement, we're hopeful for a late second half launch for the treatment of lesions up to 300 millimeters in length. In our Below the Knee IDE, enrollment is beginning to accelerate after FDA approved the expansion of our inclusion criteria in mid-Q1.
At projected recruitment rates, we continue to anticipate enrollment through 2016, putting PMA submission likely in the first half of 2018.
Moving to the AV access DCB IDE study. We completed enrollment in Q1 and are now in the 6-month follow-up window. Though these things are a little hard to predict precisely, we believe we should have results sometime in Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017, ahead of our previous schedule. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a second half 2017 U.S. launch. We're also anticipating the submission of our in-stent restenosis PMA supplement in the next couple of months.
Around the world, we're working to expand access to this important technology. For example, our shown in submission for the SFA indication occurred at the end of Q1, seeking approval in Japan. And we began enrollment in our Levant China study a few weeks ago.
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent trial was fully enrolled in Q3 of 2015. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed with a 9-month follow-up in the treatment of iliac artery disease. Our current projected time line continues to support submission of our final PMA module before year-end.
Our COVERA next-generation stent graph IDE is under review at FDA, and we anticipate commencing enrollment upon approval. COVERA's design for use in the AV access circuit. Also in the stents, our Venovo venous stent is doing well in Europe, and we commenced enrollment in our U.S. IDE just a couple of weeks ago. We anticipate enrollment through 2016 with follow-up through 2017 and PMA submission in 2018.
Our biopsy business launched 8 new products, including EnCor Enspire, EnCor Ultra and the Mission semi-automatic biopsy family this quarter in Asia while launching 18 new products in Latin America and the Middle East.
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We exited Q1 with launches in all 4 of our franchises. First, for the home care market, we launched our new Magic3 TOUCHLESS intermittent self-catheterization platform. We also launched our new proxy sheath family for flexible ureteroscopy in our endourology family. And we launched our new Foley daily care kit designed to help health care workers adhere to best practices in daily Foley catheter care and maintenance in our basic drainage segment. In Targeted Temperature Management, we launched some new adult pad sizes to support temperature control over a broader range of patient sizes.
Moving to Oncology. We're still working with FDA seeking clearance for the launch anticipated later this quarter of our new family of chemical-resistant catheters. We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis, or DVT, and remain on plan to begin launching in the back half of the year. 
For the difficult stick IV catheter patients, we began to launch of our AccuCath wire-guided assisted products earlier this month with additional sizes to launch over the next couple of quarters. These new products are complementary to our new midline catheter, the PowerGlide Pro, slated for launch upon FDA clearance.
Lastly, in Q1, we launched our new dual-lumen Power Xenosys [ph] catheter designed for superior flexibility, kink resistance and flow rates in excess of 400 ml per minute in a small 11 French catheter configuration.
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. Just a few days ago, we received PMA approval for our new TRIDYNE aortic sealant, and we're preparing to launch this new product around the end of this quarter. We're also working toward the launch of a new Progel sealant configuration designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic surgery. And expect PMA submission this quarter with approval and launch around the end of year. We're also expanding our portfolio with Phasix resorbable mesh with additional sizes anticipated to launch in the back half of the year.
And finally, in mesh fixation, we anticipate expanding on our recent permanent and resorbable product launches, with 2 additional resorbable fixation devices slated for later this year.
Now before I hand you over to Chris, I'd like to remind all of you to join us at our Analyst Day on Monday, May 23, at the New York Palace hotel at 4:30 p.m. I look forward to seeing you there. And now here's Chris."
254131,329843971,965262,"CR Bard Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $4.5 million pretax, a $9.8 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives, and",1048,"Thank you, John. Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $4.5 million pretax, a $9.8 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives, and we booked expense of $48.9 million for product liability matters, which principally is related to litigation on IVC filters. The P&L impact of these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and in the reconciliation accompanying our Q1 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter, and I'll remind you that our adjusted numbers now exclude the amortization of intangibles from the entire P&L, and the references to prior year are on that same basis. Gross profit was $553.1 million or 63.3% of sales for Q1. On an adjusted basis, GP was $581.2 million or 66.5% of sales. That's up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter and better than we expected. FX cost us about 20 basis points in GP for the quarter. Price pressure drove 40 basis points on the revenue line in Q1 and 20 basis points of headwind on GPs, which was significantly better than our expectations and the best result we've seen since 2010. We still expect price to be more of a headwind going forward, but we're certainly happy with the Q1 results. Our cost improvements and other items drove 90 basis points of benefit to GPs this quarter and mix was favorable by 160 basis points, which includes the gross profit benefit from acquiring our Japanese JV. As we look to Q2, we expect gross margin to be over 100 basis points better than Q2 of 2015. And for the full year, we're comfortable with our guidance for gross profit improvement.
SG&A expenses were $270.6 million for the quarter or 31% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $266.5 million or 30.5% of sales, an increase of 180 basis points over last year. This is reflective of the timing of the 2 recent acquisitions, and we expect Q2 will also be higher than prior year as well. We still expect the full year to be about the same as 2015 as a percentage of sales as we integrate the acquisitions and leverage our infrastructure on higher sales throughout the year.
R&D expenditures totaled $68.3 million for the first quarter or 7.8% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D was $66.8 million or 7.6% of sales, up 20 basis points from Q1 of last year and consistent with our guidance. Interest expense was $11.3 million for the quarter. Other income and expense was $60 million of expense for the first quarter as reported and $1.9 million of income on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.7% on a reported basis and 25.8% on an adjusted basis, right in the middle of our full year guidance.
Diluted shares for the period were 75.2 million, and we purchased 897,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $186.57. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.34, which was well above our expectations for the quarter. This overachievement was driven by the strong sales fee and a slight easing of FX headwinds. The balance sheet, as of March 31, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion, essentially no change from December 31. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were up 1.2 days and inventory days were up 6.3 days. Both of these increases are related to the recent acquisitions. Capital expenditures totaled $20.5 million for the quarter.
On the liability side, total debt was $1.7 billion as of March 31 compared to $1.4 billion at the end of December. Debt to total cap at the end of the first quarter was about 53%, and total shareholder investment was $1.5 billion at March 31.
Turning now to guidance. In Q2, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 6.5% and 8%, with reported sales growth between 5.5% and 7%, inferring an FX headwind of approximately 1% on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 5.5% and 6% for the second quarter. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, excluding items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles, we see the second quarter in the range of $2.43 to $2.47.
Given such a strong operational start to 2016, along with an easing of FX headwinds, we're comfortable raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 7% and 8.5%, with reported sales growth between 6% and 8%, inferring a currency headwind of between 50 and 100 basis points.
On an organic basis, we had originally guided the year to be between 5% and 6%, but are increasing that range meaningfully today to be between 6% and 6.5%. It's not lost on us, and we're sure it's not lost on you that we did meaningfully better than that in Q1. To be clear, we see good momentum in the business and continued strength in our positioning. However, there were several product lines this quarter well above trend. China was exceptionally strong, and I just highlighted price headwind was abnormally low. So before we take the sustainability of some of these factors to the bank, we think it is prudent to get a little deeper into the year.
We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.05 and $10.18, which is just about $0.15 above our original guidance range at the midpoint and represents 11% to 12% growth over 2015. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be approximately $0.20 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we are guiding to 13% to 14% growth. Given the strength of our operating performance, the success of our investment program and the demonstrated ability of our teams to execute against commitments, we plan to accelerate certain investments in targeted projects and geographies, beginning in Q2 and throughout the remainder of the year. We believe this disciplined investment approach will help provide sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareholders for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn you back to Tim."

They're clearly, Oncology, there's always new products kind of flowing through there, but that's one of the biggest drivers in emerging markets, especially in China. So again, you've got kind of both themes there as well. Vascular continues to do well. The PTA line, Lutonix in the U.S. continues to do well. And Urology, even across the board, clearly, TTM continues to do well. The acquisitions that we've made continue to perform well. And the uptake in the U.S. seems to have become more steady. When you talk to hospital CEOs, I'm hearing more of them talk about some of their issues being things like nursing turnover, again being a big issue. We really haven't heard that, at least I haven't from a lot of hospital CEOs for several years now.

It's actually more prominent in Q1 because there's fewer sales that we're booking into the JV.

And then specifically on price, again, I hear you loud and clear that this is below kind of the levels that we've been seeing as of late. But was there anything specific in the quarter that allows you to get the better pricing or perhaps in another way, is there another thing to think about it as we move through the year that would influence pricing negatively? Or are you just trying to stay conservative there?"

And again, for the full year, we expect about $0.20 of headwind, at least as we sit here today, given where the yen is and the euro and the rest of the basket, which again is about $0.10 better on a full year basis than we had anticipated. But obviously, as we all know, currencies can move the other way pretty quickly as well. So there'll be less dilution in Japan if the yen stays where it's at. And again we're really focused on executing the integration. And if we execute well, hopefully, we'll do a little bit better from an operational standpoint."

Welcome to Bard's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call, and thanks for taking the time to join us today. I would expected the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes, and we're going to try and keep the total call to an hour. I'll also direct your attention to the slide deck that's available on the Investor Relations page of our website, which is intended to help explain some of the moving pieces in our results and guidance. 
The discussion today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the second quarter of 2016; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review second quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior Vice President, Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you a brief update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will go over the second quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. And then finally, we'll close with Q&A.
Second quarter 2016 net sales totaled $931.5 million. That's up 8% over Q2 of last year on an as-reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable by about 70 basis points. 
The organic growth rate was approximately 6.4% this quarter, which exceeded our expectations. As we told you earlier, the prior year Q2 included the initial stocking of Lutonix by Boston Scientific. And when you factor that in, our organic sales growth would have been above 7%. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $159.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $2.11. Excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affect the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, adjusted second quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $192.2 million and $2.54. That's up 11% and 12%, respectively. These adjusted results exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter, and the first half of the year has come in stronger than we had projected at the beginning of the year. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter last year, Q2 net sales in the U.S. increased 7% on a constant currency basis, Europe grew 7%. Japan was up 29%, benefiting from moving to customer pricing after the acquisition of our JV partner, and our other international businesses grew 15%. We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which represented 10% of our total sales in the second quarter. 
As John Weiland takes you through the product lines, you'll see that we continue to have sustained momentum across all of our businesses even in the face of the tougher comps that we previewed for you last quarter. We continue to believe that executing our strategy will position us to continue to achieve an above-market revenue growth rate for the overall portfolio with attractive returns for shareholders.

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $25",777,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $255.3 million, up 3% over last year on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and Japan sales, global Vascular sales grew 6% in Q2, with the United States business up 3% and international up 12%. 
Sales in our surgical graft category were up 5% in the second quarter, within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business grew 6% in the second quarter. Our peripheral PTA line grew 10% despite the prior year stocking from the Boston Scientific distribution agreement for Lutonix. The growth rates may look a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter from stocking events in the prior year, but we track average daily sales as a metric, and we continue to see good sequential momentum in both the United States and internationally. And we have third-party data that shows us maintaining our leadership position in this important long-term market opportunity. 
Our Stent business grew 1% in the second quarter, and sales in our vena cava filter line were down 13%. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 10% this quarter globally despite running up against the tougher comps we talked about last quarter. 
Now let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $240.0 million, up 15% on an as-reported and up 16% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2015. The combination of the first full quarter of Liberator Medical sales and the benefit of the Japanese business moving to customer pricing added about 1,200 basis points to the growth in the category. Excluding these 2 acquisitions, the United States business was up 4%, while internationally, we grew 5%. 
Our basic drainage business was up 19% globally. Excluding the acquisitions, the basic drainage business grew 6%, both globally and in the United States, with our infection control Foley business up 2% globally and 3% in the United States. 
Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew 19% this quarter, demonstrating continued momentum in this significant long-term opportunity. 
Our continence business was up 34% in the second quarter, all driven by the benefit from the new acquisitions. 
Sales in urological specialties were up 9% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew 7%, driven by Japan. 
And finally, in this category, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line decreased 5% in Q2. 
Now let's go to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $252.4 million, an increase of 7% as reported and 8% on a constant currency basis over Q2 last year. The Japan acquisition added 200 basis points to growth globally. Excluding that, sales in the United States were up 4%, and international sales were up 13%. 
Our port business was up 4% versus the second quarter of last year. Our PICC business was up 10% this quarter, with continued impressive growth outside of the United States. As you'll hear from John DeFord, we continue to advance our PICC and midline portfolio. 
Our Vascular Access Ultrasound product line grew 4% this quarter. And to close out the category, our dialysis access product line was up 13%. 
So let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $159.9 million, up 11% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. United States sales were up 11%, and international sales were up 13% this quarter, excluding the impact from Japan, which was minimum. 
Our performance irrigation business was down 3% now represents less than 1% of our total company sales. Our soft tissue repair business continued its strong momentum, growing 12% in Q2. Our broad product offering and our value-added programs that help customers select the right product for the patient are having a significant impact on the treatment paradigm, with more procedures shifting from natural tissue to our synthetic hernia portfolio and specifically, our Phasix material. Our synthetics business grew 18% this quarter, while our natural tissue products declined 27%. 
In our hernia fixation business, which is included in soft tissue repair subtotal, grew 49% this quarter on the continued impact from our recent product launches here. 
Closing out the surgical category in the second quarter, our BioSurgery business grew 16% and now represents between 20% and 25% of our Surgical Specialties business. This continues to represent a significant long-term opportunity for us. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for a pipeline update."

We covered the pipeline in pretty significant depth just a few weeks ago at the Analyst Day, so I'll try to just give you an update on a few of the key or near-term projects today. 
We'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. Our long leash in supplement is under review at FDA, and we're hopeful for approval of this expanded indication for the treatment of lesions up to 300 millimeters in length around year-end. In our Below the Knee IDE, enrollment is progressing and we're optimistic regarding our discussions with the FDA to bring this important treatment option to patients. The AV access DCB IDE study is in follow-up after a very rapid enrollment. We remain on track to get a look at our results in Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a late-Q4 2017 U.S. launch. 
We're also on track to submit clinical data for the in-stent restenosis PMA later this quarter. 
In Japan, our shown in submission for the Lutonix SFA indication is under review, and we anticipate a mid-2017 launch. While in China, we continue to enroll in our Levant China study that began last quarter. 
Also in Vascular, in Q2, we launched our new True Blow value plasty balloon family. This proprietary product is designed to reduce the stress placed on the heart by allowing blood to flow through the device during the procedure with limited restriction and back pressure. Early clinical results have also shown that in most cases, rapid pacing to reduce blood pressure has not been required. 
Also in Q2, we received FDA approval for the life stent system, with indications covering the entire artery. The life stent platform is now
[Audio Gap]
of 2 new stone basket configurations in our Sky Light platform, providing a full range of sizes. And in Targeted Temperature Management, this quarter, we received IDE approval for our new neurogenic fever prevention and control clinical study. This study will evaluate the use of the Arctic Sun system in this new indication. The study is anticipated to enroll more than 1,000 patients and will probably take about 3 years to complete. 
Moving to Oncology, we've had a very busy few weeks since the Analyst Day. We received clearance on our new chemical-resistant PowerPICC family named the PowerPICC EtOH. This new family will begin launching this quarter and is especially designed with a proprietary material that maintains all of the benefit of the PowerPICC and can withstand greater exposure to the sometimes harsh chemistry used in today's therapies. 
We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis or DVT. We remain on plan to launch products in this new family in the back half of the year. 
We also received FDA clearance on our new power midline and clearance for our PowerGlide Pro family of intermediate well catheters. Both of these products just launched and are shipping to customers. 
This quarter, we added 3 new applications to our tip confirmation portfolio for pediatrics, ports and central lines due to launch of first-generation system in Europe. We're also developing an advanced version slated for launch in the U.S. and other geographies later this year. 
I'll close my portion of prepared remarks today with surgery. As we discussed a few weeks ago, the TRIDYNE aortic sealant was approved by the FDA, and we're preparing to launch in the back half of this year. We're also working toward the launch of the Progel Emerald sealant, designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic thoracic surgery. 
In hernia repair, we continue to anticipate the launch of additional Phasix resorbable mesh sizes throughout the remainder of the year. This expansion is planned to provide surgeons and their patients the largest and most comprehensive size matrix in the market, including a 50-centimeter by 50-centimeter mesh. 
On the clinical front, we've completed 1-year follow-up in our Phasix clinical study of over 100 ventral hernia patients and expect results to be presented and published later this year. Similarly, additional clinical data for our XenMatrix AB product family is expected to be released later this year. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we anticipate launching the 15-count [ph] version of our OPTIFIX resorbable fixation device in Q4, with further launches in this category expected in the first half of 2017. 
I know we went through this quickly. Thanks for your attention. I think we covered 26 new products in about 6 minutes, so now I'll turn you over to Chris."

Let start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we had acquisition-related items of $3.9 million and an impairment charge of $1.2 million and charges of $11.9 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives. P&L impact to these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statement and the reconciliation accompanying our Q2 earnings press release. 
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $580.5 million or 62.3% of sales for Q2. On an adjusted basis, GP was $616.2 million or 66.2% of sales, up 140 basis points from the prior year quarter and better than the expected. Price was unfavorable at 40 basis points on the revenue line and about 10 basis points in GP, continuing the solid performance we saw in Q1. And FX was about 80 basis points of headwind to gross margin for the quarter. Mix was favorable by 110 basis points, which includes a positive impact from our Japanese business, and our cost improvement efforts drove approximately 120 basis points of favorability in Q2. 
Our cost savings and margin improvement programs are on track, and we now expect to exceed the original full year guidance for GPs that we gave you in January. 
SG&A expenses were $278.5 million for the quarter or 29.9% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 29.7%, 70 basis points above the prior year. Consistent with how we guided the full year as we integrate the recent acquisitions, we expect this leverage to improve somewhat in the second half. 
I would reiterate that as we see opportunities to do so, we will continue to make incremental investments in certain targeted areas, including, for example, emerging markets and our health economics capabilities. 
R&D expenditures totaled $71.3 million for the second quarter or 7.7% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expenses as a percentage of sales was 7.6%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and consistent with our full year guidance. We do expect a somewhat higher level of R&D investment spending in Q3. 
Interest expense was $13.4 million for the second quarter, and other income and expense was $9.6 million of expense for the second quarter as reported and $2.1 million of income on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.4%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.2 million, and we repurchased approximately 103,000 shares during the second quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.54, which excludes items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles. This was above the range we provided for the quarter, driven primarily by the overachievement in sales. 
The balance sheet as of June 30, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1 billion, similar to March 31. For the quarter, accounts receivables days were down 2.1 days, and inventory days were up 6.8 days, as we responded to recent inventory depletion from increased demand. Capital expenditures totaled $17.9 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of June 30 compared to $1.7 billion at March 31. Debt-to-total capital at the end of the second quarter was about 50%, and total shareholder investment was $1.6 billion at June 30. 
Moving to financial guidance. Given the strong first half of the year, we are again raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 8% and 9%, with reported sales growth between 7% and 8%, now implying a currency headwind of about 1%. On an organic basis, we had originally guided the year to be between 5% and 6%, but now expect that range to be between 6.5% and 7%. We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.10 and $10.20, representing 11% to 12% growth. U.S. dollar has strengthened somewhat since our last earnings call, and we now expect foreign exchange to be between $0.25 and $0.28 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we're guiding to 14% to 15% growth for all of 2016. 
For Q3, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 8% and 9%, with reported sales growth between 7% and 8%, also implying an FX headwind of about 1% on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 6% and 6.5% for the third quarter. 
From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we forecast third quarter in the range of $2.51 to $2.55, representing 10% to 12% growth on a reported basis. 
In summary, the first half of the year has gone well from both a sales and profitability perspective. As we now move to the second half, we remain focused on our continued execution, including smartly investing in strategic opportunities. The overall objective of our balanced efforts is to drive attractive and sustainable revenue growth, profitability and shareholder returns over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call back to Tim."

Our biopsy business has been tremendously strong and our emerging markets performance, particularly China in biopsy, has been terrific. Urology, we talked about the components of Urology. The Urology market, if you look at the basic drainage business, is not growing in the United States at all. In fact, it's relatively flat, maybe up 1%. But some of the new product offerings that we've introduced into that market, especially our Sure Step tray, has allowed hospitals to upgrade within their own existing framework. And that's given us a mixed differential, which is driving really a substantial portion of growth in basic drainage for us. And I'd also like to add, one of the areas that may not come out, but we have had excellent growth in Europe. They had another terrific quarter this quarter for us. And we've always been delighted with our growth in emerging markets, and that continues to be a really big positive for the corporation."

We're now building an app built a direct BioSurgery sales force and excited about that opportunity. We have our Lutonix SFA trial enrolling in China."

And as we talked about on the Q1 call, and as I reiterated again today, we're continuing to invest incrementally as we have the opportunity to do so. So I think the strength of the operating performance so far is allowing us to continue to make investments this year that coming into the year, we frankly didn't think we were going in position to do.

Welcome to Bard's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call, and thanks for taking the time to join us today. I'd expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes, and we're going to try and keep the total call to an hour. I'll also direct your attention to the slide deck that's available on the Investor Relations page of our website, which is intended to help explain some of the moving pieces in our results and guidance. 
The discussion today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the second quarter of 2016; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review second quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP, Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you a brief update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will go over the second quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year; and then finally, we'll close with Q&A.
Second quarter 2016 net sales totaled $931.5 million. That's up 8% over Q2 of last year on an as-reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable by about 70 basis points. 
The organic growth rate was approximately 6.4% this quarter, which exceeded our expectations. As we told you earlier, the prior year Q2 included the initial stocking of Lutonix by Boston Scientific. And when you factor that in, our organic sales growth would have been above 7%. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $159.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $2.11. Excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affect the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, adjusted second quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $192.2 million and $2.54. That's up 11% and 12%, respectively. These adjusted results exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter, and the first half of the year has come in stronger than we had projected at the beginning of the year. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter last year, Q2 net sales in the U.S. increased 7% on a constant currency basis; Europe grew 7%; Japan was up 29%, benefiting from moving the customer pricing after the acquisition of our JV partner; and our other international businesses grew 15%. We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which represented 10% of our total sales in the second quarter. 
As John Weiland takes you through the product lines, you'll see that we continue to have sustained momentum across all of our businesses even in the face of the tougher comps that we previewed for you last quarter. We continue to believe that executing our strategy will position us to continue to achieve an above-market revenue growth rate for the overall portfolio with attractive returns for shareholders. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $25",775,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $255.3 million, up 3% over last year on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and Japan sales, global Vascular sales grew 6% in Q2, with the United States business, up 3%; and international up 12%. 
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were up 5% in the second quarter, within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business grew 6% in the second quarter. Our peripheral PTA line grew 10% despite the prior year stocking from the Boston Scientific distribution agreement for Lutonix. The growth rates may look a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter from stocking events in the prior year, but we track average daily sales as a metric, and we continue to see good sequential momentum in both the United States and internationally. And we have third-party data that shows us maintaining our leadership position in this important long-term market opportunity. 
Our Stent business grew 1% in the second quarter, and sales in our vena cava filter line were down 13%. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 10% this quarter globally despite running up against the tougher comps we talked about last quarter. 
Now let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $240.0 million, up 15% on an as-reported and up 16% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2015. The combination of the first full quarter of Liberator Medical sales and the benefit of the Japanese business moving to customer pricing added about 1,200 basis points to the growth in the category. Excluding these 2 acquisitions, the United States business was up 4% while, internationally, we grew 5%. 
Our basic drainage business was up 19% globally. Excluding the acquisitions, the basic drainage business grew 6%, both globally and in the United States, with our infection control Foley business up 2% globally and 3% in the United States. 
Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew 19% this quarter, demonstrating continued momentum in this significant long-term opportunity. 
Our continence business was up 34% in the second quarter, all driven by the benefit from the new acquisitions. 
Sales in Urological Specialties were up 9% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew 7%, driven by Japan. 
And finally, in this category, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter-stabilization line decreased 5% in Q2. 
Now let's go to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $252.4 million, an increase of 7% as-reported and 8% on a constant currency basis over Q2 last year. The Japan acquisition added 200 basis points to growth globally. Excluding that, sales in the United States were up 4%, and international sales were up 13%. 
Our port business was up 4% versus the second quarter of last year. Our PICC business was up 10% this quarter, with continued impressive growth outside of the United States. As you'll hear from John DeFord, we continue to advance our PICC and midline portfolio. 
Our vascular access ultrasound product line grew 4% this quarter. And to close out the category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 13%. 
So let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $159.9 million, up 11% as-reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. United States sales were up 11%, and international sales were up 13% this quarter, excluding the impact from Japan, which was minimum. 
Our Performance Irrigation business was down 3%, and now represents less than 1% of our total company sales. Our soft tissue repair business continued its strong momentum, growing 12% in Q2. Our broad product offering and our value-added programs that help customers select the right product for the patient are having a significant impact on the treatment paradigm, with more procedures shifting from natural tissue to our synthetic hernia portfolio and, specifically, our Phasix material. Our synthetics business grew 18% this quarter, while our natural tissue products declined 27%. 
In our hernia fixation business, which is included in soft tissue repair subtotal, grew 49% this quarter on the continued impact from our recent product launches here. 
Closing out the surgical category, in the second quarter, our BioSurgery business grew 16% and now represents between 20% and 25% of our Surgical Specialties business. This continues to represent a significant long-term opportunity for us. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for a pipeline update."

We covered the pipeline in pretty significant depth just a few weeks ago at the Analyst Day, so I'll try to just give you an update on a few of the key or near-term projects today. 
We'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. Our long lesion supplement is under review at FDA, and we're hopeful for approval of this expanded indication for the treatment of lesions up to 300 millimeters in length around year-end. In our Below-the-Knee IDE, enrollment is progressing, and we're optimistic regarding our discussions with the FDA to bring this important treatment option to patients. The AV access DCB IDE study is in follow-up after a very rapid enrollment. We remain on track to get a look at our results in Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a late-Q4 2017 U.S. launch. 
We're also on track to submit clinical data for the in-stent restenosis PMA later this quarter. 
In Japan, our shown in submission for the Lutonix SFA indication is under review, and we anticipate a mid-2017 launch. While in China, we continue to enroll in our Levant China study that began last quarter. 
Also in Vascular, in Q2, we launched our new True Flow Valvuloplasty balloon family. This proprietary product is designed to reduce the stress placed on the heart by allowing blood to flow through the device during the procedure with limited restriction and back pressure. Early clinical results have also shown that, in most cases, rapid pacing to reduce blood pressure has not been required. 
Also in Q2, we received FDA approval for the LifeStent system, with indications covering the entire popliteal artery. The LifeStent platform is now the first and only self-expanding stent in the U.S. with this indication. Labeling is being updated, and our launch and education programs will commence this quarter. 
In stent grafts, LifeStream Balloon Expandable covered stent trial has completed follow-up, and the final PMA module was submitted last week to FDA, with approval and launch expected in mid-2017.
Our Covera next-generation AV access circuit stent graft received IDE approval a couple of weeks ago, and we anticipate commencing enrollment later this quarter or in early Q4. We expect enrollment will take about a year.
Our Venovo venous stent IDE study is in active recruitment. We anticipate enrollment throughout this year with follow-up in 2017 and PMA submission in 2018.
In biopsy, we just began the rollout of the ENCOR ENSPIRE system in China. In addition, the UltraCor Twirl breast biopsy marker just launched in the U.S. and Europe about a quarter ahead of our schedule.
Now moving to Urology and home care, we continue to advance our broad-based initiatives designed to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections through the launch of additional SURESTEP Foley Trays and our new SURESTEP Daily Care product. The SURESTEP Trays are helping standardize indwelling catheter placement around known guidelines. Our SURESTEP Daily Care product extends the solution to the maintenance phase and supports compliance to cleaning standards and awareness of indwelling time. Customers find this particularly helpful, especially in light of increasing nursing turnover.
In endourology, Q2 heralded the launch of 2 new stone basket configurations in our SkyLite platform, providing a full range of sizes. And in Targeted Temperature Management, this quarter, we received IDE approval for our new neurogenic fever prevention and control clinical study. This study will evaluate the use of the ARCTIC SUN system in this new indication. The study is anticipated to enroll more than 1,000 patients and will probably take about 3 years to complete. 
Moving to Oncology, we've had a very busy few weeks since the Analyst Day. We received clearance on our new chemical-resistant PowerPICC family named the PowerPICC EtOH. This new family will begin launching this quarter and is especially designed with a proprietary material that maintains all of the benefits of the PowerPICC and can withstand greater exposure to the sometimes harsh chemistry used in today's therapies. 
We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis or DVT. We remain on plan to launch products in this new family in the back half of the year. 
We also received FDA clearance on our new power midline and clearance for our PowerGlide Pro family of intermediate dwell catheters. Both of these products just launched and are shipping to customers. 
This quarter, we added 3 new applications to our Tip Confirmation portfolio for pediatrics, ports and central lines due to launch of a first-generation system in Europe. We're also developing an advanced version slated for launch in the U.S. and other geographies later this year. 
I'll close my portion of prepared remarks today with surgery. As we discussed a few weeks ago, the TRIDYNE aortic sealant was approved by the FDA, and we're preparing to launch in the back half of this year. We're also working toward the launch of the Progel Emerald sealant, designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic thoracic surgery. 
In hernia repair, we continue to anticipate the launch of additional Phasix resorbable mesh sizes throughout the remainder of the year. This expansion is planned to provide surgeons and their patients the largest and most comprehensive size matrix in the market, including a 50-centimeter by 50-centimeter mesh. 
On the clinical front, we've completed 1-year follow-up in our Phasix clinical study of over 100 ventral hernia patients and expect results to be presented and published later this year. Similarly, additional clinical data for our XenMatrix AB product family is expected to be released later this year. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we anticipate launching the 15-count version of our OPTIFIX resorbable fixation device in Q4, with further launches in this category expected in the first half of 2017. 
I know we went through this quickly. Thanks for your attention. I think we covered 26 new products in about 6 minutes, so now I'll turn you over to Chris."

Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we had acquisition-related items of $3.9 million and an impairment charge of $1.2 million and charges of $11.9 million related to restr",855,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we had acquisition-related items of $3.9 million and an impairment charge of $1.2 million and charges of $11.9 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives. P&L impact to these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statement and the reconciliation accompanying our Q2 earnings press release. 
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $580.5 million or 62.3% of sales for Q2. On an adjusted basis, GP was $616.2 million or 66.2% of sales, up 140 basis points from the prior year quarter and better than we expected. Price was unfavorable at 40 basis points on the revenue line and about 10 basis points in GP, continuing the solid performance we saw in Q1. And FX was about 80 basis points of headwind to gross margin for the quarter. Mix was favorable by 110 basis points, which includes the positive impact from our Japanese business, and our cost improvement efforts drove approximately 120 basis points of favorability in Q2. 
Our cost savings and margin improvement programs are on track, and we now expect to exceed the original full year guidance for GP that we gave you in January. 
SG&A expenses were $278.5 million for the quarter or 29.9% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 29.7%, 70 basis points above the prior year. Consistent with how we guided the full year, as we integrate the recent acquisitions, we expect this leverage to improve somewhat in the second half. 
I would reiterate that as we see opportunities to do so, we will continue to make incremental investments in certain targeted areas, including, for example, emerging markets and our health economics capabilities. 
R&D expenditures totaled $71.3 million for the second quarter or 7.7% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.6%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and consistent with our full year guidance. We do expect a somewhat higher level of R&D investment spending in Q3. 
Interest expense was $13.4 million for the second quarter, and other income and expense was $9.6 million of expense for the second quarter as reported and $2.1 million of income on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.4%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.2 million, and we repurchased approximately 103,000 shares during the second quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.54, which excludes items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles. This was above the range we provided for the quarter, driven primarily by the overachievement in sales. 
The balance sheet as of June 30, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1 billion, similar to March 31. For the quarter, accounts receivables days were down 2.1 days, and inventory days were up 6.8 days, as we responded to recent inventory depletion from increased demand. Capital expenditures totaled $17.9 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of June 30 compared to $1.7 billion at March 31. Debt-to-total capital at the end of the second quarter was about 50%, and total shareholder investment was $1.6 billion at June 30. 
Moving to financial guidance. Given the strong first half of the year, we are again raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 8% and 9%, with reported sales growth between 7% and 8%, now implying a currency headwind of about 1%. On an organic basis, we had originally guided the year to be between 5% and 6% but now expect that range to be between 6.5% and 7%. We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.10 and $10.20, representing 11% to 12% growth. U.S. dollar has strengthened somewhat since our last earnings call, and we now expect foreign exchange to be between $0.25 and $0.28 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we're guiding to 14% to 15% growth for all of 2016. 
For Q3, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 8% and 9%, with reported sales growth between 7% and 8%, also implying an FX headwind of about 1% on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 6% and 6.5% for the third quarter. 
From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we forecast third quarter in the range of $2.51 to $2.55, representing 10% to 12% growth on a reported basis. 
In summary, the first half of the year has gone well from both a sales and profitability perspective. As we now move to the second half, we remain focused on our continued execution, including smartly investing in strategic opportunities. The overall objective of our balanced efforts is to drive attractive and sustainable revenue growth, profitability and shareholder returns over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call back to Tim."

There's a lot of moving parts that affect health care usage these days in the U.S., in particular, as you know.

And in fact, the independent market share data that we saw for Q1 saw us pick up 7 share points in Q1 alone. So we have great momentum driven by the new product portfolio and the -- and as well as the products that we said that we're going to be launching, such as the new products in fixation.

Flip to Q2, we obviously don't have that and then also have the headwind associated with the Boston stocking order. We had talked about ports. There was a drag. We had a weak Q4 as we got ready for some new product launches in Q1. So ports were very strong in Q1. Biopsy was also incredibly strong in Q1 on the back of China. And China, in general, we called out that China had an absolutely phenomenal Q1. Some of that was again as we're building out the BioSurgery sales force, there was some stocking that went on as well. China had a terrific Q2 but, certainly, somewhat slower than, again, an unusual Q1. So I think the message we wanted to have you understand coming out of Q1, terrific quarter, some more onetime items, but leading into a Q2 that was going to be also very strong organically.

Yes, I think with the sale of our EP business a few years ago, I don't see any other businesses within the company that we would divest. Certainly, with as many SKUs as we have, there's always some that are, even by design, when you come out with a next-gen product, that are in decline. But we'd much rather have the management time focused on growth, and we've got plenty of opportunities through the investments that we've made to do that rather than focusing on a product line here or there that might be a bit of a drag."

And it's really, for us, driven by the pound. The RMB has sort of quietly weakened relative to the dollar. The euro, Aussie dollar, Canadian dollars have all moved relatively materially. Now it was very late in Q2, but as we sit here today, those are all going to cost us, in combination, $0.06 or $0.07 so, effectively, offset virtually all of the beat to the consensus number in Q2. And as we talked about on the Q1 call, and as I reiterated again today, we're continuing to invest incrementally as we have the opportunity to do so. So I think the strength of the operating performance so far is allowing us to continue to make investments this year that, coming into the year, we frankly didn't think we were going to be in a position to do. And we think that's the right thing to do for the long term. I think looking at Q2 of an 8.3 reported and a 12 reported, bottom line, very high quality. And us taking some of the upside that we've delivered to invest back into the business, we think is in the right balance. And you're seeing us continue to do that, and that's, frankly, also reflected in the guidance that we've just laid out for the remainder of the full year."

Welcome to Bard's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call, and thanks for taking the time to join us today. I'd expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes, and we're going to try and keep the total call to an hour. I'll also direct your attention to the slide deck that's available on the Investor Relations page of our website, which is intended to help explain some of the moving pieces in our results and guidance. 
The discussion today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the second quarter of 2016; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review second quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP, Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you a brief update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will go over the second quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year; and then finally, we'll close with Q&A.
Second quarter 2016 net sales totaled $931.5 million. That's up 8% over Q2 of last year on an as-reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable by about 70 basis points. 
The organic growth rate was approximately 6.4% this quarter, which exceeded our expectations. As we told you earlier, the prior year Q2 included the initial stocking of Lutonix by Boston Scientific. And when you factor that in, our organic sales growth would have been above 7%. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $159.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $2.11. Excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affect the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, adjusted second quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $192.2 million and $2.54. That's up 11% and 12%, respectively. These adjusted results exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter, and the first half of the year has come in stronger than we had projected at the beginning of the year. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter last year, Q2 net sales in the U.S. increased 7% on a constant currency basis; Europe grew 7%; Japan was up 29%, benefiting from moving the customer pricing after the acquisition of our JV partner; and our other international businesses grew 15%. We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which represented 10% of our total sales in the second quarter. 
As John Weiland takes you through the product lines, you'll see that we continue to have sustained momentum across all of our businesses even in the face of the tougher comps that we previewed for you last quarter. We continue to believe that executing our strategy will position us to continue to achieve an above-market revenue growth rate for the overall portfolio with attractive returns for shareholders. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $25",775,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $255.3 million, up 3% over last year on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and Japan sales, global Vascular sales grew 6% in Q2, with the United States business, up 3%; and international up 12%. 
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were up 5% in the second quarter, within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business grew 6% in the second quarter. Our peripheral PTA line grew 10% despite the prior year stocking from the Boston Scientific distribution agreement for Lutonix. The growth rates may look a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter from stocking events in the prior year, but we track average daily sales as a metric, and we continue to see good sequential momentum in both the United States and internationally. And we have third-party data that shows us maintaining our leadership position in this important long-term market opportunity. 
Our Stent business grew 1% in the second quarter, and sales in our vena cava filter line were down 13%. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 10% this quarter globally despite running up against the tougher comps we talked about last quarter. 
Now let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $240.0 million, up 15% on an as-reported and up 16% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2015. The combination of the first full quarter of Liberator Medical sales and the benefit of the Japanese business moving to customer pricing added about 1,200 basis points to the growth in the category. Excluding these 2 acquisitions, the United States business was up 4% while, internationally, we grew 5%. 
Our basic drainage business was up 19% globally. Excluding the acquisitions, the basic drainage business grew 6%, both globally and in the United States, with our infection control Foley business up 2% globally and 3% in the United States. 
Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew 19% this quarter, demonstrating continued momentum in this significant long-term opportunity. 
Our continence business was up 34% in the second quarter, all driven by the benefit from the new acquisitions. 
Sales in Urological Specialties were up 9% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew 7%, driven by Japan. 
And finally, in this category, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter-stabilization line decreased 5% in Q2. 
Now let's go to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $252.4 million, an increase of 7% as-reported and 8% on a constant currency basis over Q2 last year. The Japan acquisition added 200 basis points to growth globally. Excluding that, sales in the United States were up 4%, and international sales were up 13%. 
Our port business was up 4% versus the second quarter of last year. Our PICC business was up 10% this quarter, with continued impressive growth outside of the United States. As you'll hear from John DeFord, we continue to advance our PICC and midline portfolio. 
Our vascular access ultrasound product line grew 4% this quarter. And to close out the category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 13%. 
So let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $159.9 million, up 11% as-reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. United States sales were up 11%, and international sales were up 13% this quarter, excluding the impact from Japan, which was minimal. 
Our Performance Irrigation business was down 3%, and now represents less than 1% of our total company sales. Our soft tissue repair business continued its strong momentum, growing 12% in Q2. Our broad product offering and our value-added programs that help customers select the right product for the patient are having a significant impact on the treatment paradigm, with more procedures shifting from natural tissue to our synthetic hernia portfolio and, specifically, our Phasix material. Our synthetics business grew 18% this quarter, while our natural tissue products declined 27%. 
In our hernia fixation business, which is included in soft tissue repair subtotal, grew 49% this quarter on the continued impact from our recent product launches here. 
Closing out the surgical category, in the second quarter, our BioSurgery business grew 16% and now represents between 20% and 25% of our Surgical Specialties business. This continues to represent a significant long-term opportunity for us. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for a pipeline update."

We covered the pipeline in pretty significant depth just a few weeks ago at the Analyst Day, so I'll try to just give you an update on a few of the key or near-term projects today. 
We'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. Our long lesion supplement is under review at FDA, and we're hopeful for approval of this expanded indication for the treatment of lesions up to 300 millimeters in length around year-end. In our Below-the-Knee IDE, enrollment is progressing, and we're optimistic regarding our discussions with the FDA to bring this important treatment option to patients. The AV access DCB IDE study is in follow-up after a very rapid enrollment. We remain on track to get a look at our results in Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a late-Q4 2017 U.S. launch. 
We're also on track to submit clinical data for the in-stent restenosis PMA later this quarter. 
In Japan, our shown in submission for the Lutonix SFA indication is under review, and we anticipate a mid-2017 launch. While in China, we continue to enroll in our Levant China study that began last quarter. 
Also in Vascular, in Q2, we launched our new True Flow Valvuloplasty balloon family. This proprietary product is designed to reduce the stress placed on the heart by allowing blood to flow through the device during the procedure with limited restriction and back pressure. Early clinical results have also shown that, in most cases, rapid pacing to reduce blood pressure has not been required. 
Also in Q2, we received FDA approval for the LifeStent system, with indications covering the entire popliteal artery. The LifeStent platform is now the first and only self-expanding stent in the U.S. with this indication. Labeling is being updated, and our launch and education programs will commence this quarter. 
In stent grafts, LifeStream Balloon Expandable covered stent trial has completed follow-up, and the final PMA module was submitted last week to FDA, with approval and launch expected in mid-2017.
Our Covera next-generation AV access circuit stent graft received IDE approval a couple of weeks ago, and we anticipate commencing enrollment later this quarter or in early Q4. We expect enrollment will take about a year.
Our Venovo venous stent IDE study is in active recruitment. We anticipate enrollment throughout this year with follow-up in 2017 and PMA submission in 2018.
In biopsy, we just began the rollout of the ENCOR ENSPIRE system in China. In addition, the UltraCor Twirl breast biopsy marker just launched in the U.S. and Europe about a quarter ahead of our schedule.
Now moving to Urology and home care, we continue to advance our broad-based initiatives designed to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections through the launch of additional SURESTEP Foley Trays and our new SURESTEP Daily Care product. The SURESTEP Trays are helping standardize indwelling catheter placement around known guidelines. Our SURESTEP Daily Care product extends the solution to the maintenance phase and supports compliance to cleaning standards and awareness of indwelling time. Customers find this particularly helpful, especially in light of increasing nursing turnover.
In endourology, Q2 heralded the launch of 2 new stone basket configurations in our SkyLite platform, providing a full range of sizes. And in Targeted Temperature Management, this quarter, we received IDE approval for our new neurogenic fever prevention and control clinical study. This study will evaluate the use of the ARCTIC SUN system in this new indication. The study is anticipated to enroll more than 1,000 patients and will probably take about 3 years to complete. 
Moving to Oncology, we've had a very busy few weeks since the Analyst Day. We received clearance on our new chemical-resistant PowerPICC family named the PowerPICC EtOH. This new family will begin launching this quarter and is especially designed with a proprietary material that maintains all of the benefits of the PowerPICC and can withstand greater exposure to the sometimes harsh chemistry used in today's therapies. 
We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis or DVT. We remain on plan to launch products in this new family in the back half of the year. 
We also received FDA clearance on our new power midline and clearance for our PowerGlide Pro family of intermediate dwell catheters. Both of these products just launched and are shipping to customers. 
This quarter, we added 3 new applications to our Tip Confirmation portfolio for pediatrics, ports and central lines due to launch of a first-generation system in Europe. We're also developing an advanced version slated for launch in the U.S. and other geographies later this year. 
I'll close my portion of prepared remarks today with surgery. As we discussed a few weeks ago, the TRIDYNE aortic sealant was approved by the FDA, and we're preparing to launch in the back half of this year. We're also working toward the launch of the Progel Emerald sealant, designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic thoracic surgery. 
In hernia repair, we continue to anticipate the launch of additional Phasix resorbable mesh sizes throughout the remainder of the year. This expansion is planned to provide surgeons and their patients the largest and most comprehensive size matrix in the market, including a 50-centimeter by 50-centimeter mesh. 
On the clinical front, we've completed 1-year follow-up in our Phasix clinical study of over 100 ventral hernia patients and expect results to be presented and published later this year. Similarly, additional clinical data for our XenMatrix AB product family is expected to be released later this year. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we anticipate launching the 15-count version of our OPTIFIX resorbable fixation device in Q4, with further launches in this category expected in the first half of 2017. 
I know we went through this quickly. Thanks for your attention. I think we covered 26 new products in about 6 minutes, so now I'll turn you over to Chris."

Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we had acquisition-related items of $3.9 million and an impairment charge of $1.2 million and charges of $11.9 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives. P&L impact to these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statement and the reconciliation accompanying our Q2 earnings press release. 
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $580.5 million or 62.3% of sales for Q2. On an adjusted basis, GP was $616.2 million or 66.2% of sales, up 140 basis points from the prior year quarter and better than we expected. Price was unfavorable at 40 basis points on the revenue line and about 10 basis points in GP, continuing the solid performance we saw in Q1. And FX was about 80 basis points of headwind to gross margin for the quarter. Mix was favorable by 110 basis points, which includes the positive impact from our Japanese business, and our cost improvement efforts drove approximately 120 basis points of favorability in Q2. 
Our cost savings and margin improvement programs are on track, and we now expect to exceed the original full year guidance for GPs that we gave you in January. 
SG&A expenses were $278.5 million for the quarter or 29.9% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 29.7%, 70 basis points above the prior year. Consistent with how we guided the full year, as we integrate the recent acquisitions, we expect this leverage to improve somewhat in the second half. 
I would reiterate that as we see opportunities to do so, we will continue to make incremental investments in certain targeted areas, including, for example, emerging markets and our health economics capabilities. 
R&D expenditures totaled $71.3 million for the second quarter or 7.7% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.6%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and consistent with our full year guidance. We do expect a somewhat higher level of R&D investment spending in Q3. 
Interest expense was $13.4 million for the second quarter, and other income and expense was $9.6 million of expense for the second quarter as reported and $2.1 million of income on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.4%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.2 million, and we repurchased approximately 103,000 shares during the second quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.54, which excludes items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles. This was above the range we provided for the quarter, driven primarily by the overachievement in sales. 
The balance sheet as of June 30, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1 billion, similar to March 31. For the quarter, accounts receivables days were down 2.1 days, and inventory days were up 6.8 days, as we responded to recent inventory depletion from increased demand. Capital expenditures totaled $17.9 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of June 30 compared to $1.7 billion at March 31. Debt-to-total capital at the end of the second quarter was about 50%, and total shareholder investment was $1.6 billion at June 30. 
Moving to financial guidance. Given the strong first half of the year, we are again raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 8% and 9%, with reported sales growth between 7% and 8%, now implying a currency headwind of about 1%. On an organic basis, we had originally guided the year to be between 5% and 6% but now expect that range to be between 6.5% and 7%. We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.10 and $10.20, representing 11% to 12% growth. U.S. dollar has strengthened somewhat since our last earnings call, and we now expect foreign exchange to be between $0.25 and $0.28 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we're guiding to 14% to 15% growth for all of 2016. 
For Q3, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 8% and 9%, with reported sales growth between 7% and 8%, also implying an FX headwind of about 1% on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 6% and 6.5% for the third quarter. 
From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we forecast third quarter in the range of $2.51 to $2.55, representing 10% to 12% growth on a reported basis. 
In summary, the first half of the year has gone well from both a sales and profitability perspective. As we now move to the second half, we remain focused on our continued execution, including smartly investing in strategic opportunities. The overall objective of our balanced efforts is to drive attractive and sustainable revenue growth, profitability and shareholder returns over the long term.

Q1 was, by far, our easiest comp of the year, coming out of that big Q4 and working through some inventory in Q1. Flip to Q2, we obviously don't have that and then also have the headwind associated with the Boston stocking order. We had talked about ports. There was a drag. We had a weak Q4 as we got ready for some new product launches in Q1. So ports were very strong in Q1. Biopsy was also incredibly strong in Q1 on the back of China. And China, in general, we called out that China had an absolutely phenomenal Q1. Some of that was again as we're building out the BioSurgery sales force, there was some stocking that went on as well. China had a terrific Q2 but, certainly, somewhat slower than, again, an unusual Q1. So I think the message we wanted to have you understand coming out of Q1, terrific quarter, some more onetime items, but leading into a Q2 that was going to be also very strong organically. So actually, the good news is it came out exactly as we had thought, and the items that were more of a tailwind in Q1 indeed played out the way we thought in Q2."

And so they have been building inventory this time last year. And they're buying very, very little from us now. So big drag there. And the Gore royalty of $39 million.

Welcome to Bard's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call, and thanks for taking the time to join us today. I'd expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes, and we're going to try and keep the total call to an hour. I'll also direct your attention to the slide deck that's available on the Investor Relations page of our website, which is intended to help explain some of the moving pieces in our results and guidance. 
The discussion today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the second quarter of 2016; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review second quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP, Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you a brief update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will go over the second quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year; and then finally, we'll close with Q&A.
Second quarter 2016 net sales totaled $931.5 million. That's up 8% over Q2 of last year on an as-reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable by about 70 basis points. 
The organic growth rate was approximately 6.4% this quarter, which exceeded our expectations. As we told you earlier, the prior year Q2 included the initial stocking of Lutonix by Boston Scientific. And when you factor that in, our organic sales growth would have been above 7%. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $159.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $2.11. Excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affect the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, adjusted second quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $192.2 million and $2.54. That's up 11% and 12%, respectively. These adjusted results exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter, and the first half of the year has come in stronger than we had projected at the beginning of the year. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter last year, Q2 net sales in the U.S. increased 7% on a constant currency basis; Europe grew 7%; Japan was up 29%, benefiting from moving the customer pricing after the acquisition of our JV partner; and our other international businesses grew 15%. We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, which represented 10% of our total sales in the second quarter. 
As John Weiland takes you through the product lines, you'll see that we continue to have sustained momentum across all of our businesses even in the face of the tougher comps that we previewed for you last quarter. We continue to believe that executing our strategy will position us to continue to achieve an above-market revenue growth rate for the overall portfolio with attractive returns for shareholders. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $25",775,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $255.3 million, up 3% over last year on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and Japan sales, global Vascular sales grew 6% in Q2, with the United States business, up 3%; and international up 12%. 
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were up 5% in the second quarter, within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business grew 6% in the second quarter. Our peripheral PTA line grew 10% despite the prior year stocking from the Boston Scientific distribution agreement for Lutonix. The growth rates may look a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter from stocking events in the prior year, but we track average daily sales as a metric, and we continue to see good sequential momentum in both the United States and internationally. And we have third-party data that shows us maintaining our leadership position in this important long-term market opportunity. 
Our Stent business grew 1% in the second quarter, and sales in our vena cava filter line were down 13%. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 10% this quarter globally despite running up against the tougher comps we talked about last quarter. 
Now let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $240.0 million, up 15% on an as-reported and up 16% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2015. The combination of the first full quarter of Liberator Medical sales and the benefit of the Japanese business moving to customer pricing added about 1,200 basis points to the growth in the category. Excluding these 2 acquisitions, the United States business was up 4% while, internationally, we grew 5%. 
Our basic drainage business was up 19% globally. Excluding the acquisitions, the basic drainage business grew 6%, both globally and in the United States, with our infection control Foley business up 2% globally and 3% in the United States. 
Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew 19% this quarter, demonstrating continued momentum in this significant long-term opportunity. 
Our continence business was up 34% in the second quarter, all driven by the benefit from the new acquisitions. 
Sales in Urological Specialties were up 9% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew 7%, driven by Japan. 
And finally, in this category, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter-stabilization line decreased 5% in Q2. 
Now let's go to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $252.4 million, an increase of 7% as-reported and 8% on a constant currency basis over Q2 last year. The Japan acquisition added 200 basis points to growth globally. Excluding that, sales in the United States were up 4%, and international sales were up 13%. 
Our port business was up 4% versus the second quarter of last year. Our PICC business was up 10% this quarter, with continued impressive growth outside of the United States. As you'll hear from John DeFord, we continue to advance our PICC and midline portfolio. 
Our vascular access ultrasound product line grew 4% this quarter. And to close out the category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 13%. 
So let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $159.9 million, up 11% as-reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. United States sales were up 11%, and international sales were up 13% this quarter, excluding the impact from Japan, which was minimal. 
Our Performance Irrigation business was down 3%, and now represents less than 1% of our total company sales. Our soft tissue repair business continued its strong momentum, growing 12% in Q2. Our broad product offering and our value-added programs that help customers select the right product for the patient are having a significant impact on the treatment paradigm, with more procedures shifting from natural tissue to our synthetic hernia portfolio and, specifically, our Phasix material. Our synthetics business grew 18% this quarter, while our natural tissue products declined 27%. 
In our hernia fixation business, which is included in soft tissue repair subtotal, grew 49% this quarter on the continued impact from our recent product launches here. 
Closing out the surgical category, in the second quarter, our BioSurgery business grew 16% and now represents between 20% and 25% of our Surgical Specialties business. This continues to represent a significant long-term opportunity for us. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for a pipeline update."

We covered the pipeline in pretty significant depth just a few weeks ago at the Analyst Day, so I'll try to just give you an update on a few of the key or near-term projects today. 
We'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. Our long lesion supplement is under review at FDA, and we're hopeful for approval of this expanded indication for the treatment of lesions up to 300 millimeters in length around year-end. In our Below-the-Knee IDE, enrollment is progressing, and we're optimistic regarding our discussions with the FDA to bring this important treatment option to patients. The AV access DCB IDE study is in follow-up after a very rapid enrollment. We remain on track to get a look at our results in Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a late-Q4 2017 U.S. launch. 
We're also on track to submit clinical data for the in-stent restenosis PMA later this quarter. 
In Japan, our shown in submission for the Lutonix SFA indication is under review, and we anticipate a mid-2017 launch. While in China, we continue to enroll in our Levant China study that began last quarter. 
Also in Vascular, in Q2, we launched our new True Flow Valvuloplasty balloon family. This proprietary product is designed to reduce the stress placed on the heart by allowing blood to flow through the device during the procedure with limited restriction and back pressure. Early clinical results have also shown that, in most cases, rapid pacing to reduce blood pressure has not been required. 
Also in Q2, we received FDA approval for the LifeStent system, with indications covering the entire popliteal artery. The LifeStent platform is now the first and only self-expanding stent in the U.S. with this indication. Labeling is being updated, and our launch and education programs will commence this quarter. 
In stent grafts, LifeStream Balloon Expandable covered stent trial has completed follow-up, and the final PMA module was submitted last week to FDA, with approval and launch expected in mid-2017.
Our Covera next-generation AV access circuit stent graft received IDE approval a couple of weeks ago, and we anticipate commencing enrollment later this quarter or in early Q4. We expect enrollment will take about a year.
Our Venovo venous stent IDE study is in active recruitment. We anticipate enrollment throughout this year with follow-up in 2017 and PMA submission in 2018.
In biopsy, we just began the rollout of the ENCOR ENSPIRE system in China. In addition, the UltraCor Twirl breast biopsy marker just launched in the U.S. and Europe about a quarter ahead of our schedule.
Now moving to Urology and home care, we continue to advance our broad-based initiatives designed to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections through the launch of additional SURESTEP Foley Trays and our new SURESTEP Daily Care product. The SURESTEP Trays are helping standardize indwelling catheter placement around known guidelines. Our SURESTEP Daily Care product extends the solution to the maintenance phase and supports compliance to cleaning standards and awareness of indwelling time. Customers find this particularly helpful, especially in light of increasing nursing turnover.
In endourology, Q2 heralded the launch of 2 new stone basket configurations in our SkyLite platform, providing a full range of sizes. And in Targeted Temperature Management, this quarter, we received IDE approval for our new neurogenic fever prevention and control clinical study. This study will evaluate the use of the ARCTIC SUN system in this new indication. The study is anticipated to enroll more than 1,000 patients and will probably take about 3 years to complete. 
Moving to Oncology, we've had a very busy few weeks since the Analyst Day. We received clearance on our new chemical-resistant PowerPICC family named the PowerPICC EtOH. This new family will begin launching this quarter and is especially designed with a proprietary material that maintains all of the benefits of the PowerPICC and can withstand greater exposure to the sometimes harsh chemistry used in today's therapies. 
We're also making steady progress on our new PICC family designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis or DVT. We remain on plan to launch products in this new family in the back half of the year. 
We also received FDA clearance on our new power midline and clearance for our PowerGlide Pro family of intermediate dwell catheters. Both of these products just launched and are shipping to customers. 
This quarter, we added 3 new applications to our Tip Confirmation portfolio for pediatrics, ports and central lines due to launch of a first-generation system in Europe. We're also developing an advanced version slated for launch in the U.S. and other geographies later this year. 
I'll close my portion of prepared remarks today with surgery. As we discussed a few weeks ago, the TRIDYNE aortic sealant was approved by the FDA, and we're preparing to launch in the back half of this year. We're also working toward the launch of the Progel Emerald sealant, designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic thoracic surgery. 
In hernia repair, we continue to anticipate the launch of additional Phasix resorbable mesh sizes throughout the remainder of the year. This expansion is planned to provide surgeons and their patients the largest and most comprehensive size matrix in the market, including a 50-centimeter by 50-centimeter mesh. 
On the clinical front, we've completed 1-year follow-up in our Phasix clinical study of over 100 ventral hernia patients and expect results to be presented and published later this year. Similarly, additional clinical data for our XenMatrix AB product family is expected to be released later this year. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we anticipate launching the 15-count version of our OPTIFIX resorbable fixation device in Q4, with further launches in this category expected in the first half of 2017. 
I know we went through this quickly. Thanks for your attention. I think we covered 26 new products in about 6 minutes, so now I'll turn you over to Chris."

Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we had acquisition-related items of $3.9 million and an impairment charge of $1.2 million and charges of $11.9 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives. P&L impact to these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statement and the reconciliation accompanying our Q2 earnings press release. 
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $580.5 million or 62.3% of sales for Q2. On an adjusted basis, GP was $616.2 million or 66.2% of sales, up 140 basis points from the prior year quarter and better than we expected. Price was unfavorable at 40 basis points on the revenue line and about 10 basis points in GP, continuing the solid performance we saw in Q1. And FX was about 80 basis points of headwind to gross margin for the quarter. Mix was favorable by 110 basis points, which includes the positive impact from our Japanese business, and our cost improvement efforts drove approximately 120 basis points of favorability in Q2. 
Our cost savings and margin improvement programs are on track, and we now expect to exceed the original full year guidance for GPs that we gave you in January. 
SG&A expenses were $278.5 million for the quarter or 29.9% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 29.7%, 70 basis points above the prior year. Consistent with how we guided the full year, as we integrate the recent acquisitions, we expect this leverage to improve somewhat in the second half. 
I would reiterate that as we see opportunities to do so, we will continue to make incremental investments in certain targeted areas, including, for example, emerging markets and our health economics capabilities. 
R&D expenditures totaled $71.3 million for the second quarter or 7.7% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.6%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and consistent with our full year guidance. We do expect a somewhat higher level of R&D investment spending in Q3. 
Interest expense was $13.4 million for the second quarter, and other income and expense was $9.6 million of expense for the second quarter as reported and $2.1 million of income on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.4%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.2 million, and we repurchased approximately 103,000 shares during the second quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.54, which excludes items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles. This was above the range we provided for the quarter, driven primarily by the overachievement in sales. 
The balance sheet as of June 30, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1 billion, similar to March 31. For the quarter, accounts receivables days were down 2.1 days, and inventory days were up 6.8 days, as we responded to recent inventory depletion from increased demand. Capital expenditures totaled $17.9 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of June 30 compared to $1.7 billion at March 31. Debt-to-total capital at the end of the second quarter was about 50%, and total shareholder investment was $1.6 billion at June 30. 
Moving to financial guidance. Given the strong first half of the year, we are again raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 8% and 9%, with reported sales growth between 7% and 8%, now implying a currency headwind of about 1%. On an organic basis, we had originally guided the year to be between 5% and 6% but now expect that range to be between 6.5% and 7%. We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.10 and $10.20, representing 11% to 12% growth. U.S. dollar has strengthened somewhat since our last earnings call, and we now expect foreign exchange to be between $0.25 and $0.28 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we're guiding to 14% to 15% growth for all of 2016. 
For Q3, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 8% and 9%, with reported sales growth between 7% and 8%, also implying an FX headwind of about 1% on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 6% and 6.5% for the third quarter. 
From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we forecast third quarter in the range of $2.51 to $2.55, representing 10% to 12% growth on a reported basis. 
In summary, the first half of the year has gone well from both a sales and profitability perspective. As we now move to the second half, we remain focused on our continued execution, including smartly investing in strategic opportunities. The overall objective of our balanced efforts is to drive attractive and sustainable revenue growth, profitability and shareholder returns over the long term.

Over last year, we had noted we launched a number of Lutonix additional lengths in Q3, and so Boston needed to stock all of those lengths in Q3 as well. So there'll be a stocking phenomenon in Q3. It'll be a little bit less than the Q2 stocking, but just to let you know that that's coming as well. So I think the way we're seeing the business is we're growing pretty comfortably in that 6.5-ish percent organic range, and it's really balanced, which I think is very important and I think speaks to the quality of the overall results."

And so they have been building inventory this time last year. And they're buying very, very little from us now. So big drag there. And the Gore royalty of $39 million. When you strip all of those out as well as the Japan impact, Vascular grew 6 organic overall.

And as we talked about on the Q1 call, and as I reiterated again today, we're continuing to invest incrementally as we have the opportunity to do so. So I think the strength of the operating performance so far is allowing us to continue to make investments this year that, coming into the year, we frankly didn't think we were going to be in a position to do.

The agenda today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the third quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review third quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP, Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will give you the third quarter income statement, balance sheet as well as our expectations for Q4 and obviously, the full year. And then we'll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2016 net sales totaled $941.9 million. That's up 9% over the third quarter of last year on an as-reported basis and up 10% on a constant currency basis. Currency impact for the quarter versus Q3 of last year was unfavorable by about 90 basis points.
Our organic revenue growth was 6% for the quarter. Excluding the prior year stocking of Lutonix by Boston Scientific, we estimate that our organic sales growth was 6.4%.
While our recent acquisitions performed above the guidance we've provided, our Targeted Temperature Management business, which can be a little lumpy given timing issues had a soft quarter. John Weiland will take you through the product lines, and Chris will provide guidance. We believe you will see continued strength and momentum across the portfolio. 
Net income for the third quarter was $96.4 million and diluted EPS were $1.27. Excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affected the comparability of results between periods, Chris will cover those later. Adjusted third quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $199.5 million and $2.64. That's up 14% and 16%, respectively. These adjusted results well exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter of 2015, net sales in the U.S. increased 7%. On a constant currency basis, Europe grew 5%. Japan was up 44%, benefiting from moving the customer pricing after our acquisition of the joint venture there, and our other international businesses grew 19%. Emerging market growth was strong, yet again, representing 10% of our total sales in Q3. 
The results in Q3 continued to demonstrate the strength of our economic engine, driving organic growth between 6% and 7% on the top line, with attractive returns on the bottom line, even while we had continued to invest significantly for future growth. The results so far this year have exceeded our expectations, and we expect a strong finish to what has been a very strong year so far. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be getting all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise.So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $25",779,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I'll be getting all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise.
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $258.1 million, up 3% over last year on an as-reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and Japan sales, global Vascular sales grew 5% in Q3, with the United States business up 2% and international up 10%.
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were flat in the third quarter. Our Endovascular business grew 7% in the third quarter. Our peripheral PTA line grew 7% despite the prior year stocking from the Boston Scientific distribution agreement for Lutonix. 
We continue to see strong growth year-over-year in sales of Lutonix to customers, including sequential growth in the United States. Sales in our vena cava filter line were down 18% this quarter. Our Stent business grew 6% in the third quarter, which was the best quarter in 4 years, driven by strength internationally. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 10% this quarter globally, making -- marking the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth in this product family. 
Now let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $242.1 million, up 14% as reported and up 15% on a constant currency basis. The combination of Liberator Medical sales and the benefit of the Japanese business moving to customer pricing added about 1,200 basis points to the growth in this category. Excluding these 2 acquisitions, the United States business was up 2% while internationally, we grew 7%.
Our basic drainage business was up 19% globally. Excluding the acquisitions, the basic drainage business grew 5% globally and 4% in the United States, with our I.C. Foley business up 1% globally and flat in the U.S. 
Our Targeted Temperature Management business grew 4% this quarter. While the sales of our disposable pads grew double digits, as Tim said, the capital portion of this business can be a little lumpy. We continue to believe that this product line has long-term double-digit growth potential. 
Our continence business was up 28% in the third quarter, driven by the benefit from the new acquisitions. Sales in Urological Specialties were up 9% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew 6%, driven by Japan.
And finally, in this category, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter-stabilization line grew 2% in the third quarter.
Let's now go on to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $258.4 million, an increase of 8% on an as-reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis over the third quarter of last year. The Japan acquisition added about 200 basis points to growth globally. Excluding that, sales in the United States were up 3%, and international sales were up 15%. 
Our port business was up 9% versus the third quarter last year. Most of the benefit from -- in this category is from Japan that is in ports. Our PICC revenue was up 8% this quarter with continued strength internationally. Our Vascular Access Ultrasound product line grew 8% this quarter. And to close out the category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 7%.
Let's conclude then with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $158.8 million, up 14% on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. United States sales were up 11%, and international sales were up 21% this quarter, excluding the impact from Japan, which was minimal.
Our performance irrigation business was down 6%. Our soft tissue repair business delivered its strongest quarter in 6 years, growing 14% in the third quarter. We saw this growth despite continued procedural shifts away from natural tissue products, which declined 35% for us in the third quarter. 
In contrast, our synthetic business, which includes our hybrid Phasix material, grew 23% this quarter, which is the highest growth in more than 10 years. Our mix of synthetic revenue to natural tissue revenue is now greater than 7:1. 
We believe the quality and the breadth of our product offering and our value-added programs help customers select the right product for the patient, which is having a significant impact on the treatment paradigm. 
Our hernia fixation business grew 34% this quarter on the continued impact from our recent product launches here.
Closing out the surgical category, our BioSurgery business grew 22% in Q3, with strong growth in both the United States and outside the United States. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for a pipeline update."

Let me jump right in with a brief discussion of a few of our highlighted pipeline projects. As we've done over the last few quarters, I'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. First, our long lesion and",727,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me jump right in with a brief discussion of a few of our highlighted pipeline projects. As we've done over the last few quarters, I'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. First, our long lesion and in-stent restenosis supplements are under review at FDA, and we're hopeful for approval of both of these expanded indications early next year. 
In our Below the Knee IDE, as we recently announced, the FDA has approved an amendment to our study, supporting the primary efficacy analysis at the 6-month follow-up time point. This is an exciting development, and we're continuing to analyze the potential impact to our approval time line. We think this should put our launch in 2018. 
The AV access DCB IDE study is in follow-up after a very rapid enrollment. We remain on track to get a first look at our results in late Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a late Q4 2017 U.S. launch. 
In Japan, our shonen submission for the Lutonix SFA indication remains under review, and we continue to anticipate a mid-2017 launch. While in China, we continue to enroll in our Levant China study that began earlier this year.
Also in Vascular, our Lifestream balloon-expandable covered stent trial has completed follow-up, and the final PMA module was submitted last quarter to FDA, with approval and launch expected in mid-2017. 
Our COVERA next-generation AV access circuit stent graft received IDE approvals for both the fistula and the graft study. Both studies began recruitment in Q3, and we expect enrollment will take about a year. 
Our Venovo vena stent IDE is in active recruitment, and we continue to receive positive feedback from Europe where the products commercially available. We anticipate enrollment throughout 2016 with follow-up in 2017 and PMA submission in 2018. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We've now launched our female version of the Magic3 Go self-hydrating hydrophilic catheter in Europe, and we've begun direct-to-consumer advertising in this product in the U.S. In Targeted Temperature Management, we anticipate commencing enrollment in our new IDE study of neurogenic fever prevention and control. This study will evaluate the use of the Arctic Sun system in this new indication, and we plan to enroll more than 1,000 patients over the next 3-or-so years. 
Moving to Oncology. We're awaiting 510(k) clearance of our new PROVENA family of PowerPICCs designed to reduce the risk of DBT. We're building inventory in a broad range of single-, double- and triple-lumen configurations and anticipate launching around the end of the year. 
Late in Q2, we launched both our new Power Midline and PowerGlide Pro families of intermediate dual catheters. Early feedback has been very positive on both products, and we anticipate launching additional versions in early 2017. 
On the last call, I announced our European launch of the Delta system, with specific indications for Tip Confirmation for the pediatric patients for ports, PICCs and central lines. The next generation of this system is completing development, and we're planning for U.S. launch around the end of the year. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. First, in BioSurgery, we're preparing for the launch of the TRIDYNE aortic sealant. We hope to get this product to the market before the end of the year, but due to some near-term capacity constraints, we now expect to launch in Q1. We also expect to launch in Q2 of 2017 the Progel Emerald lung sealant that's been designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic thoracic surgery. 
In hernia repair, we continue to launch additional Phasix resorbable mesh sizes and expect to enhance our offerings around the end of the year. This expansion will dramatically increase the range of sizes from 5 to 25 different configurations, providing surgeons and their patients the largest and most comprehensive size matrix in the market.
Expansion of our XenMatrix AB platform with multiple new sizes is also on track for launch in early 2017. After launch, Bard will offer the largest biologically derived graft in the market. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we've launched the 15-count version of our OPTIFIX resorbable fixation device, with further launches in this category expected in the first half of 2017.
Thanks for your attention. Let me now turn you over to Chris."
254131,403600059,1060747,"CR Bard Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start tonight with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we took a charge of $110.6 million for product liability matters. We also had acquisition-related items of $5 million, charges",935,"Thank you, John. Let's start tonight with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we took a charge of $110.6 million for product liability matters. We also had acquisition-related items of $5 million, charges of $4.6 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives and a tax credit of $2.6 million related to the completion of certain tax, certain IRS examinations. The P&L impact to these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q3 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $589.7 million or 62.6% of sales for Q3. On an adjusted basis, GP were $624.3 million or 66.3% of sales, up 150 basis points from the prior year quarter. Price was unfavorable at 40 basis points on the revenue line and about 10 basis points in gross profit, continuing the solid performance we saw in the first half of the year. And foreign exchange was about a 50 basis point headwind to gross margin this quarter. Mix was favorable by 110 basis points, which includes the positive impact from our Japanese business. And finally, our cost improvement efforts drove approximately 100 basis points of favorability in Q3.
It's been a very strong year for margins for us. And as we told you last quarter, we expect to exceed the original full year guidance for GPs that we gave you in January. 
SG&A expenses were $272.6 million for the quarter or 28.9% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 28.7%, 20 basis points above the prior year. While we do expect to see decent leverage here in Q4 as we anniversary the acquisition of our Japanese joint venture, we expect to slightly exceed our original estimate for the full year due to incremental investments we've made in certain targeted areas. 
R&D expenditures totaled $74.2 million for the third quarter or 7.9% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.8%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Again, as we told you last quarter, we expect a somewhat higher level of R&D investment for the full year compared to our original guidance as our strong results have allowed us to fund new opportunities earlier than initially contemplated. We continue to be in investment mode to strengthen the long-term revenue growth potential of the portfolio. 
Interest expense was $14.9 million for the third quarter, and other income and expense was $115.8 million of expense in Q3 as reported or $0.4 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, down 130 basis points from the prior year. We are trending to be at the low end or maybe even slightly better than our original guidance for the full year. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.3 million, and we repurchased approximately 190,000 shares in the third quarter. The net result is reported EPS of $1.27 and adjusted EPS of $2.64, which excludes items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles. This was well above the guidance range we provided for the quarter, reflecting both higher-than-expected sales as well as the continued strong execution by our teams around the world.
The balance sheet as of September 30, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.15 billion, up slightly from June 30. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were down 1.5 days, and inventory was up 3.1 days. We believe inventory days will decline as we anniversary the recent acquisitions and execute on new product launches that we have been building in front of. Capital expenditures totaled $26 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of September 30, no change from June 30. Debt to total capital at the end of the third quarter was about 49%, and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion at September 30. 
Moving to financial guidance. Given the strong results, we are again raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 9% and 10%, with reported sales growth between 8% and 9%, implying the same currency headwind of about 1%. We now expect our full year 2016 organic revenue growth to be around 7%. We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.23 and $10.28, representing 13% growth for the year. We now expect foreign exchange to be between $0.23 and $0.25 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, wer guiding to 15% to 16% EPS growth. 
For Q4, we are expecting constant currency sales growth between 10% and 11%, with reported sales growth between 9.5% and 10.5%, implying an FX headwind of approximately 50 basis points on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 6% and 7% for the fourth quarter. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we forecast the fourth quarter in the range of $2.70 to $2.75, representing 11% to 13% growth on a reported basis. 
As we look ahead, we expect a strong finish to what has been a very strong year of both execution and financial performance. And we're very pleased that we've been able to produce these results while still significantly investing for the long-term health of the business. We look forward to reporting on the full year and providing guidance for 2017 in January. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim."

So we think it's a terrific ability for us to reinvest into the business while still driving significant operating margin improvement. So it's a model that we're focused on, continuing to replicate. Comes with a lot of hard work from a lot of people, but that's the model. And when we execute well, you get the results that you saw this quarter."

So if you recall, Bob, we've shown now several times kind of a pipeline of regulatory filings in various emerging markets and geographies.

It's just products that have already given derisked because they've most likely been launched someplace else already. So it's really a regulatory filing. So that's one component. Second, as John mentioned, we continue to invest and build out sales forces and expand in those geographies, and that will continue with the U.S. World Series beginning tonight to put in kind of a baseball analogy. I don't even think we're in the fifth inning yet in emerging markets, so I'd say it's still in the early innings of the game. And that is further another good metric for us. The enthusiasm level from clinician to be trained on our products almost overwhelms our capability to keep up with a capacity with a demand. So we just opened up another training center in South Asian markets that John has referred to. And that demand continues to be very, very strong.

I would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes. We're going to try and keep the total call to an hour. I'll also direct your attention to the slide deck available on the Investor Relations page of our website, which is intended to help explain some of the moving pieces in our results and guidance. 
The agenda today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the third quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review third quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP, Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will give you the third quarter income statement, balance sheet as well as our expectations for Q4 and, obviously, the full year. And then we'll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2016 net sales totaled $941.9 million. That's up 9% over the third quarter of last year on an as-reported basis and up 10% on a constant currency basis. Currency impact for the quarter versus Q3 of last year was unfavorable by about 90 basis points.
Our organic revenue growth was 6% for the quarter. Excluding the prior year stocking of Lutonix by Boston Scientific, we estimate that our organic sales growth was 6.4%.
While our recent acquisitions performed above the guidance we've provided, our Targeted Temperature Management business, which can be a little lumpy given timing issues and a soft quarter. John Weiland will take you through the product lines, and Chris will provide guidance. We believe you will see continued strength and momentum across the portfolio. 
Net income for the third quarter was $96.4 million and diluted EPS were $1.27. Excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affected the comparability of results between periods, Chris will cover those later. Adjusted third quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $199.5 million and $2.64. That's up 14% and 16%, respectively. These adjusted results well exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter of 2015, net sales in the U.S. increased 7%. On a constant currency basis, Europe grew 5%. Japan was up 44%, benefiting from moving the customer pricing after our acquisitions of joint venture there, and our other international businesses grew 19%. Emerging market growth was strong, yet again, representing 10% of our total sales in Q3. 
The results in Q3 continued to demonstrate the strength of our economic engine, driving organic growth between 6% and 7% on the top line, with attractive returns on the bottom line, even while we had continued to invest significantly for future growth. The results so far this year have exceeded our expectations, and we expect a strong finish to what has been a very strong year so far. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise.
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $258.1 million, up 3% over last year on an as-reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and Japan sales, global Vascular sales grew 5% in Q3, with the United States business up 2% and international up 10%.
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were flat in the third quarter. Our Endovascular business grew 7% in the third quarter. Our peripheral PTA line grew 7% despite the prior year stocking from the Boston Scientific distribution agreement for Lutonix. 
We continue to see strong growth year-over-year in sales of Lutonix to customers, including sequential growth in the United States. Sales in our vena cava filter line were down 18% this quarter. Our Stent business grew 6% in the third quarter, which was the best quarter in 4 years, driven by strength internationally. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 10% this quarter globally, making -- marking the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth in this product family. 
Now let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $242.1 million, up 14% as reported and up 15% on a constant currency basis. The combination of Liberator Medical sales and the benefit of the Japanese business moving to customer pricing added about 1,200 basis points to the growth in this category. Excluding these 2 acquisitions, the United States business was up 2%, while internationally we grew 7%.
Our basic drainage business was up 19% globally. Excluding the acquisitions, the basic drainage business grew 5% globally and 4% in the United States, with our I.C. Foley business up 1% globally and flat in the U.S. 
Our Targeted Temperature Management business grew 4% this quarter. While the sales of our disposable pads grew double digits, as Tim said, the capital portion of this business can be a little lumpy. We continue to believe that this product line has long-term double-digit growth potential. 
Our continence business was up 28% in the third quarter, driven by the benefit from the new acquisitions. Sales in Urological Specialties were up 9% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew 6%, driven by Japan.
And finally, in this category, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter-stabilization line grew 2% in the third quarter.
Let's now go on to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $258.4 million, an increase of 8% on an as-reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis over the third quarter of last year. The Japan acquisition added about 200 basis points to growth globally. Excluding that, sales in the United States were up 3%, and international sales were up 15%. 
Our port business was up 9% versus the third quarter last year. Most of the benefit from -- in this category is from Japan and is in ports. Our PICC revenue was up 8% this quarter with continued strength internationally. Our Vascular Access Ultrasound product line grew 8% this quarter. And to close out the category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 7%.
Let's conclude then with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $158.8 million, up 14% on both an as reported and constant currency basis. United States sales were up 11%, and international sales were up 21% this quarter, excluding the impact from Japan, which was minimal.
Our performance irrigation business was down 6%. Our soft tissue repair business delivered its strongest quarter in 6 years, growing 14% in the third quarter. We saw this growth despite continued procedural shifts away from natural tissue products, which declined 35% for us in the third quarter. 
In contrast, our synthetic business, which includes our hybrid Phasix material, grew 23% this quarter, which is the highest growth in more than 10 years. Our mix of synthetic revenue to natural tissue revenue is now greater than 7:1. 
We believe the quality and the breadth of our product offering and our value-added programs help customers select the right product for the patient, which is having a significant impact on the treatment paradigm. 
Our hernia fixation business grew 34% this quarter on the continued impact from our recent product launches here.
Closing out the surgical category, our BioSurgery business grew 22% in Q3, with strong growth in both the United States and outside the United States. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for a pipeline update."

As we've done over the last few quarters, I'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. First, our long lesion and in-stent restenosis supplements are under review at FDA, and we're hopeful for approval of both of these expanded indications early next year. 
In our Below-the-Knee IDE, as we recently announced, the FDA has approved an amendment to our study, supporting the primary efficacy analysis at the 6-month follow-up time point. This is an exciting development, and we're continuing to analyze the potential impact to our approval time line. We think this should put our launch in 2018. 
The AV access DCB IDE study is in follow-up after a very rapid enrollment. We remain on track to get a first look at our results in late Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a late Q4 2017 U.S. launch. 
In Japan, our shonen submission for the Lutonix SFA indication remains under review, and we continue to anticipate a mid-2017 launch. While in China, we continue to enroll in our Levant China study that began earlier this year.
Also in Vascular, our LifeStream Balloon Expandable covered stent trial has completed follow-up, and the final PMA module was submitted last quarter to FDA, with approval and launch expected in mid-2017. 
Our COVERA next-generation AV access circuit stent graft received IDE approvals for both a fistula and a graft study. Both studies began recruitment in Q3, and we expect enrollment will take about a year. 
Our Venovo vena stent IDE is in active recruitment, and we continue to receive positive feedback from Europe where the products commercially available. We anticipate enrollment throughout 2016 with follow-up in 2017 and PMA submission in 2018. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We've now launched our female version of the Magic3 Go self-hydrating hydrophilic catheter in Europe, and we've begun direct-to-consumer advertising in this product in the U.S. In Targeted Temperature Management, we anticipate commencing enrollment in our new IDE study of neurogenic fever prevention and control. This study will evaluate the use of the Arctic Sun system in this new indication, and we plan to enroll more than 1,000 patients over the next 3-or-so years. 
Moving to Oncology. We're awaiting 510(k) clearance of our new PROVENA family of PowerPICCs designed to reduce the risk of DVT. We're building inventory in a broad range of single-, double- and triple-lumen configurations and anticipate launching around the end of the year. 
Late in Q2, we launched both our new Power Midline and PowerGlide Pro families of intermediate dual catheters. Early feedback has been very positive on both products, and we anticipate launching additional versions in early 2017. 
On the last call, I announced our European launch of the Nautilus Delta system, with specific indications for Tip Confirmation for the pediatric patients for ports, PICCs and central lines. The next generation of this system is completing development, and we're planning for U.S. launch around the end of the year. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. First, in BioSurgery, we're preparing for the launch of the TRIDYNE aortic sealant. We hope to get this product to the market before the end of the year, but due to some near-term capacity constraints, we now expect to launch in Q1. We also expect to launch in Q2 of 2017 the Progel Emerald lung sealant that's been designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic thoracic surgery. 
In hernia repair, we continue to launch additional Phasix resorbable mesh sizes and expect to enhance our offerings around the end of the year. This expansion will dramatically increase the range of sizes from 5 to 25 different configurations, providing surgeons and their patients the largest and most comprehensive size matrix in the market.
Expansion of our XenMatrix AB platform with multiple new sizes is also on track for launch in early 2017. After launch, Bard will offer the largest biologically derived graft in the market. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we've launched the 15-count version of our OPTIFIX resorbable fixation device, with further launches in this category expected in the first half of 2017.
Thanks for your attention. Let me now turn you over to Chris."

Let's start tonight with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we took a charge of $110.6 million for product liability matters. We also had acquisition-related items of $5 million, charges",936,"Thank you, John. Let's start tonight with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we took a charge of $110.6 million for product liability matters. We also had acquisition-related items of $5 million, charges of $4.6 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives and a tax credit of $2.6 million related to the completion of certain tax, certain IRS examinations. The P&L impact to these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q3 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $589.7 million or 62.6% of sales for Q3. On an adjusted basis, GPs were $624.3 million or 66.3% of sales, up 150 basis points from the prior year quarter. Price was unfavorable at 40 basis points on the revenue line and about 10 basis points in gross profit, continuing the solid performance we saw in the first half of the year. And foreign exchange was about a 50 basis point headwind to gross margin this quarter. Mix was favorable by 110 basis points, which includes the positive impact from our Japanese business. And finally, our cost improvement efforts drove approximately 100 basis points of favorability in Q3.
It's been a very strong year for margins for us. And as we told you last quarter, we expect to exceed the original full year guidance for GPs that we gave you in January. 
SG&A expenses were $272.6 million for the quarter with 28.9% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 28.7%, 20 basis points above the prior year. While we do expect to see decent leverage here in Q4 as we anniversary the acquisition of our Japanese joint venture, we expect to slightly exceed our original estimate for the full year due to incremental investments we've made in certain targeted areas. 
R&D expenditures totaled $74.2 million for the third quarter or 7.9% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.8%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Again, as we told you last quarter, we expect a somewhat higher level of R&D investment for the full year compared to our original guidance, as our strong results have allowed us to fund new opportunities earlier than initially contemplated. We continue to be in investment mode to strengthen the long-term revenue growth potential of the portfolio. 
Interest expense was $14.9 million for the third quarter, and other income and expense was $115.8 million of expense in Q3 as reported or $0.4 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, down 130 basis points from the prior year. We are trending to be at the low end or maybe even slightly better than our original guidance for the full year. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.3 million, and we repurchased approximately 190,000 shares in the third quarter. The net result is reported EPS of $1.27 and adjusted EPS of $2.64, which excludes items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles. This was well above the guidance range we provided for the quarter, reflecting both higher-than-expected sales as well as the continued strong execution by our teams around the world.
The balance sheet as of September 30, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.15 billion, up slightly from June 30. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were down 1.5 days, and inventory was up 3.1 days. We believe inventory days will decline as we anniversary the recent acquisitions and execute on new product launches that we have been building in front of. Capital expenditures totaled $26 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of September 30, no change from June 30. Debt to total capital at the end of the third quarter was about 49%, and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion at September 30. 
Moving to financial guidance. Given the strong results, we are again raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 9% and 10%, with reported sales growth between 8% and 9%, implying the same currency headwind of about 1%. We now expect our full year 2016 organic revenue growth to be around 7%. We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.23 and $10.28, representing 13% growth for the year. We now expect foreign exchange to be between $0.23 and $0.25 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we are guiding to 15% to 16% EPS growth. 
For Q4, we are expecting constant currency sales growth between 10% and 11%, with reported sales growth between 9.5% and 10.5%, implying an FX headwind of approximately 50 basis points on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 6% and 7% for the fourth quarter. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we forecast the fourth quarter in the range of $2.70 to $2.75, representing 11% to 13% growth on a reported basis. 
As we look ahead, we expect a strong finish to what has been a very strong year of both execution and financial performance. And we're very pleased that we've been able to produce these results while still significantly investing for the long-term health of the business. We look forward to reporting on the full year and providing guidance for 2017 in January. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim."

I would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes. We're going to try and keep the total call to an hour. I'll also direct your attention to the slide deck available on the Investor Relations page of our website, which is intended to help explain some of the moving pieces in our results and guidance. 
The agenda today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the third quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review third quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP, Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will give you the third quarter income statement, balance sheet as well as our expectations for Q4 and, obviously, the full year. And then we'll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2016 net sales totaled $941.9 million. That's up 9% over the third quarter of last year on an as-reported basis and up 10% on a constant currency basis. Currency impact for the quarter versus Q3 of last year was unfavorable by about 90 basis points.
Our organic revenue growth was 6% for the quarter. Excluding the prior year stocking of Lutonix by Boston Scientific, we estimate that our organic sales growth was 6.4%.
While our recent acquisitions performed above the guidance we've provided, our Targeted Temperature Management business, which can be a little lumpy given timing issues, had a soft quarter. John Weiland will take you through the product lines, and Chris will provide guidance. We believe you will see continued strength and momentum across the portfolio. 
Net income for the third quarter was $96.4 million and diluted EPS were $1.27. Excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affected the comparability of results between periods, Chris will cover those later, adjusted third quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $199.5 million and $2.64. That's up 14% and 16%, respectively. These adjusted results well exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter in 2015, net sales in the U.S. increased 7%. On a constant currency basis, Europe grew 5%. Japan was up 44%, benefiting from moving the customer pricing after our acquisition of the joint venture there, and our other international businesses grew 19%. Emerging market growth was strong, yet again, representing 10% of our total sales in Q3. 
The results in Q3 continued to demonstrate the strength of our economic engine, driving organic growth between 6% and 7% on the top line, with attractive returns on the bottom line, even while we have continued to invest significantly for future growth. The results so far this year have exceeded our expectations, and we expect a strong finish to what has been a very strong year so far. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise.So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $258",779,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise.
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $258.1 million, up 3% over last year on an as-reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and Japan sales, global Vascular sales grew 5% in Q3, with the United States business up 2% and international up 10%.
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were flat in the third quarter. Our Endovascular business grew 7% in the third quarter. Our peripheral PTA line grew 7% despite the prior year stocking from the Boston Scientific distribution agreement for Lutonix. 
We continue to see strong growth year-over-year in sales of Lutonix to customers, including sequential growth in the United States. Sales in our vena cava filter line were down 18% this quarter. Our Stent business grew 6% in the third quarter, which was the best quarter in 4 years, driven by strength internationally. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 10% this quarter globally, making -- marking the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth in this product family. 
Now let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $242.1 million, up 14% as reported and up 15% on a constant currency basis. The combination of Liberator Medical sales and the benefit of the Japanese business moving to customer pricing added about 1,200 basis points to the growth in this category. Excluding these 2 acquisitions, the United States business was up 2%, while internationally we grew 7%.
Our basic drainage business was up 19% globally. Excluding the acquisitions, the basic drainage business grew 5% globally and 4% in the United States, with our I.C. Foley business up 1% globally and flat in the U.S. 
Our Targeted Temperature Management business grew 4% this quarter. While the sales of our disposable pads grew double digits, as Tim said, the capital portion of this business can be a little lumpy. We continue to believe that this product line has long-term double-digit growth potential. 
Our continence business was up 28% in the third quarter, driven by the benefit from the new acquisitions. Sales in Urological Specialties were up 9% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew 6%, driven by Japan.
And finally, in this category, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter-stabilization line grew 2% in the third quarter.
Let's now go on to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $258.4 million, an increase of 8% on an as-reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis over the third quarter of last year. The Japan acquisition added about 200 basis points to growth globally. Excluding that, sales in the United States were up 3%, and international sales were up 15%. 
Our port business was up 9% versus the third quarter last year. Most of the benefit from -- in this category is from Japan and is imports. Our PICC revenue was up 8% this quarter with continued strength internationally. Our Vascular Access Ultrasound product line grew 8% this quarter. And to close out the category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 7%.
Let's conclude then with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $158.8 million, up 14% on both an as reported and constant currency basis. United States sales were up 11%, and international sales were up 21% this quarter, excluding the impact from Japan, which was minimal.
Our performance irrigation business was down 6%. Our soft tissue repair business delivered its strongest quarter in 6 years, growing 14% in the third quarter. We saw this growth despite continued procedural shifts away from natural tissue products, which declined 35% for us in the third quarter. 
In contrast, our synthetic business, which includes our hybrid Phasix material, grew 23% this quarter, which is the highest growth in more than 10 years. Our mix of synthetic revenue to natural tissue revenue is now greater than 7:1. 
We believe the quality and the breadth of our product offering and our value-added programs help customers select the right product for the patient, which is having a significant impact on the treatment paradigm. 
Our hernia fixation business grew 34% this quarter on the continued impact from our recent product launches here.
Closing out the surgical category, our BioSurgery business grew 22% in Q3, with strong growth in both the United States and outside the United States. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for a pipeline update."

First, our long lesion and",729,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me jump right in with a brief discussion of a few of our highlighted pipeline projects. As we've done over the last few quarters, I'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. First, our long lesion and in-stent restenosis supplements are under review at FDA, and we're hopeful for approval of both of these expanded indications early next year. 
In our Below-the-Knee IDE, as we recently announced, the FDA has approved an amendment to our study supporting the primary efficacy analysis at the 6-month follow-up time point. This is an exciting development, and we're continuing to analyze the potential impact to our approval time line. We think this should put our launch in 2018. 
The AV access DCB IDE study is in follow-up after a very rapid enrollment. We remain on track to get a first look at our results in late Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a late Q4 2017 U.S. launch. 
In Japan, our shonen submission for the Lutonix SFA indication remains under review, and we continue to anticipate a mid-2017 launch. While in China, we continue to enroll in our Levant China study that began earlier this year.
Also in Vascular, our LifeStream Balloon Expandable covered stent trial has completed follow-up, and the final PMA module was submitted last quarter to FDA, with approval and launch expected in mid-2017. 
Our COVERA next-generation AV access circuit stent graft received IDE approvals for both a fistula and a graft study. Both studies began recruitment in Q3, and we expect enrollment will take about a year. 
Our Venovo vena stent IDE is in active recruitment, and we continue to receive positive feedback from Europe where the product is commercially available. We anticipate enrollment throughout 2016 with follow-up in 2017 and PMA submission in 2018. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We've now launched our female version of the Magic3 Go self-hydrating hydrophilic catheter in Europe, and we've begun direct-to-consumer advertising in this product in the U.S. In Targeted Temperature Management, we anticipate commencing enrollment in our new IDE study of neurogenic fever prevention and control. This study will evaluate the use of the Arctic Sun system in this new indication, and we plan to enroll more than 1,000 patients over the next 3-or-so years. 
Moving to Oncology. We're awaiting 510(k) clearance of our new PROVENA family of PowerPICCs designed to reduce the risk of DVT. We're building inventory in a broad range of single-, double- and triple-lumen configurations and anticipate launching around the end of the year. 
Late in Q2, we launched both our new Power Midline and PowerGlide Pro families of intermediate dual [ph] catheters. Early feedback has been very positive on both products, and we anticipate launching additional versions in early 2017. 
On the last call, I announced our European launch of the Nautilus Delta system, with specific indications for Tip Confirmation for the pediatric patient for ports, PICCs and central lines. The next generation of this system is completing development, and we're planning for U.S. launch around the end of the year. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. First, in BioSurgery, we're preparing for the launch of the TRIDYNE aortic sealant. We hope to get this product to the market before the end of the year, but due to some near-term capacity constraints, we now expect to launch in Q1. We also expect to launch in Q2 of 2017 the Progel Emerald lung sealant that's been designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic thoracic surgery. 
In hernia repair, we continue to launch additional Phasix resorbable mesh sizes and expect to enhance our offerings around the end of the year. This expansion will dramatically increase the range of sizes from 5 to 25 different configurations, providing surgeons and their patients the largest and most comprehensive size matrix in the market.
Expansion of our XenMatrix AB platform, with multiple new sizes, is also on track for launch in early 2017. After launch, Bard will offer the largest biologically derived graft in the market. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we've launched the 15-count version of our OPTIFIX resorbable fixation device, with further launches in this category expected in the first half of 2017.
Thanks for your attention. Let me now turn you over to Chris."
254131,403600059,1060973,"CR Bard Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start tonight with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we took a charge of $110.6 million for product liability matters. We also had acquisition-related items of $5 million, charges",936,"Thank you, John. Let's start tonight with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we took a charge of $110.6 million for product liability matters. We also had acquisition-related items of $5 million, charges of $4.6 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives and a tax credit of $2.6 million related to the completion of certain tax -- certain IRS examinations. The P&L impact for these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q3 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $589.7 million or 62.6% of sales for Q3. On an adjusted basis, GPs were $624.3 million or 66.3% of sales, up 150 basis points from the prior year quarter. Price was unfavorable at 40 basis points on the revenue line and about 10 basis points in gross profit, continuing the solid performance we saw in the first half of the year. And foreign exchange was about a 50 basis point headwind to gross margin this quarter. Mix was favorable by 110 basis points, which includes the positive impact from our Japanese business. And finally, our cost improvement efforts drove approximately 100 basis points of favorability in Q3.
It's been a very strong year for margins for us. And as we told you last quarter, we expect to exceed the original full year guidance for GPs that we gave you in January. 
SG&A expenses were $272.6 million for the quarter or 28.9% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 28.7%, 20 basis points above the prior year. While we do expect to see decent leverage here in Q4 as we anniversary the acquisition of our Japanese joint venture, we expect to slightly exceed our original estimate for the full year due to incremental investments we've made in certain targeted areas. 
R&D expenditures totaled $74.2 million for the third quarter or 7.9% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.8%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Again, as we told you last quarter, we expect a somewhat higher level of R&D investment for the full year, compared to our original guidance, as our strong results have allowed us to fund new opportunities earlier than initially contemplated. We continue to be in investment mode to strengthen the long-term revenue growth potential of the portfolio. 
Interest expense was $14.9 million for the third quarter, and other income and expense was $115.8 million of expense in Q3 as reported or $0.4 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, down 130 basis points from the prior year. We are trending to be at the low end or maybe even slightly better than our original guidance for the full year. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.3 million, and we repurchased approximately 190,000 shares in the third quarter. The net result is reported EPS of $1.27 and adjusted EPS of $2.64, which excludes items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles. This was well above the guidance range we provided for the quarter, reflecting both higher-than-expected sales as well as the continued strong execution by our teams around the world.
The balance sheet as of September 30, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.15 billion, up slightly from June 30. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were down 1.5 days, and inventory was up 3.1 days. We believe inventory days will decline as we anniversary the recent acquisitions and execute on new product launches that we have been building in front of. Capital expenditures totaled $26 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of September 30, no change from June 30. Debt to total capital at the end of the third quarter was about 49%, and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion at September 30. 
Moving to financial guidance. Given the strong results, we are again raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 9% and 10%, with reported sales growth between 8% and 9%, implying the same currency headwind of about 1%. We now expect our full year 2016 organic revenue growth to be around 7%. We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.23 and $10.28, representing 13% growth for the year. We now expect foreign exchange to be between $0.23 and $0.25 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we are guiding to 15% to 16% EPS growth. 
For Q4, we are expecting constant currency sales growth between 10% and 11%, with reported sales growth between 9.5% and 10.5%, implying an FX headwind of approximately 50 basis points on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 6% and 7% for the fourth quarter. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we forecast the fourth quarter in the range of $2.70 to $2.75, representing 11% to 13% growth on a reported basis. 
As we look ahead, we expect a strong finish to what has been a very strong year of both execution and financial performance. And we're very pleased that we've been able to produce these results while still significantly investing for the long-term health of the business. We look forward to reporting on the full year and providing guidance for 2017 in January. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Tim."

Medicon is another $30 million net for the year, if I'm doing my math right. So we're already at $100 million. We've got a few other small pieces. Seems to me like we're easily over even high end of that. So maybe give me a sense of what I'm missing on the nonorganic side even to get to your new guidance."

So central venous catheters, PICCs and ports in the pediatric case. And then we've got other things like our chemical-resistant PICCs that I've talked about before that I didn't mention today on the call, but are launching here in the near term as well.

We've built a whole new BioSurgery sales team that is really just starting to get their traction. And we have some pretty interesting investment opportunities for next year sales force-wise there. Latin America, we saw a nice move in the positive direction, and I think as I mentioned, it was our best quarter in Latin America in the last 5 quarters. And that's always been a pretty solid area of growth for us, with the exception of last quarter. So we rebounded significantly, made up great ground there. and I'd say the other area that we haven't talked about an awful lot, but we've made a number of investments in, what we call rest of Asia or the smaller markets in Asia that we build out sales forces, build out marketing teams and are getting approvals and registrations for our products and launching those. So I'd say we looked at our appetite in emerging markets, it's certainly high. As we -- if we look at our investment profile, that's equally high, and we're very optimistic about what we'll see there."

Second, as John mentioned, we continue to invest and build out sales forces and expand in those geographies, and that will continue with the U.S. World Series beginning tonight to put in kind of a baseball analogy. I don't even think we're into the fifth inning yet in emerging markets. So I'd say it's still in the early innings of the game. And that is further -- is another good metric for us. The enthusiasm level from clinicians to be trained on our products almost overwhelms our capability to keep up with the capacity for the demand.

Third quarter 2016 net sales totaled $941.9 million. That's up 9% over the third quarter of last year on an as-reported basis and up 10% on a constant currency basis. Currency impact for the quarter versus Q3 of last year was unfavorable by about 90 basis points.
Our organic revenue growth was 6% for the quarter. Excluding the prior year stocking of Lutonix by Boston Scientific, we estimate that our organic sales growth was 6.4%.
While our recent acquisitions performed above the guidance we've provided, our Targeted Temperature Management business, which can be a little lumpy given timing issues, had a soft quarter. John Weiland will take you through the product lines, and Chris will provide guidance. We believe you will see continued strength and momentum across the portfolio. 
Net income for the third quarter was $96.4 million and diluted EPS were $1.27. Excluding amortization of intangibles and items that affected the comparability of results between periods, Chris will cover those later, adjusted third quarter 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share were $199.5 million and $2.64. That's up 14% and 16%, respectively. These adjusted results well exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter in 2015, net sales in the U.S. increased 7%. On a constant currency basis, Europe grew 5%. Japan was up 44%, benefiting from moving the customer pricing after our acquisition of the joint venture there, and our other international businesses grew 19%. Emerging market growth was strong, yet again, representing 10% of our total sales in Q3. 
The results in Q3 continued to demonstrate the strength of our economic engine, driving organic growth between 6% and 7% on the top line, with attractive returns on the bottom line, even while we have continued to invest significantly for future growth. The results so far this year have exceeded our expectations, and we expect a strong finish to what has been a very strong year so far. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise.So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $258",779,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise.
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $258.1 million, up 3% over last year on an as-reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the Gore royalty, EP sales to Boston Scientific and Japan sales, global Vascular sales grew 5% in Q3, with the United States business up 2% and international up 10%.
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were flat in the third quarter. Our Endovascular business grew 7% in the third quarter. Our peripheral PTA line grew 7% despite the prior year stocking from the Boston Scientific distribution agreement for Lutonix. 
We continue to see strong growth year-over-year in sales of Lutonix to customers, including sequential growth in the United States. Sales in our vena cava filter line were down 18% this quarter. Our Stent business grew 6% in the third quarter, which was the best quarter in 4 years, driven by strength internationally. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 10% this quarter globally, making -- marking the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth in this product family. 
Now let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $242.1 million, up 14% as reported and up 15% on a constant currency basis. The combination of Liberator Medical sales and the benefit of the Japanese business moving to customer pricing added about 1,200 basis points to the growth in this category. Excluding these 2 acquisitions, the United States business was up 2%, while internationally we grew 7%.
Our basic drainage business was up 19% globally. Excluding the acquisitions, the basic drainage business grew 5% globally and 4% in the United States, with our I.C. Foley business up 1% globally and flat in the U.S. 
Our Targeted Temperature Management business grew 4% this quarter. While the sales of our disposable pads grew double digits, as Tim said, the capital portion of this business can be a little lumpy. We continue to believe that this product line has long-term double-digit growth potential. 
Our continence business was up 28% in the third quarter, driven by the benefit from the new acquisitions. Sales in Urological Specialties were up 9% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew 6%, driven by Japan.
And finally, in this category, stand-alone sales of our StatLock catheter-stabilization line grew 2% in the third quarter.
Let's now go on to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $258.4 million, an increase of 8% on an as-reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis over the third quarter of last year. The Japan acquisition added about 200 basis points to growth globally. Excluding that, sales in the United States were up 3%, and international sales were up 15%. 
Our port business was up 9% versus the third quarter last year. Most of the benefit from -- in this category is from Japan and is imports. Our PICC revenue was up 8% this quarter with continued strength internationally. Our Vascular Access Ultrasound product line grew 8% this quarter. And to close out the category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 7%.
Let's conclude then with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $158.8 million, up 14% on both an as reported and constant currency basis. United States sales were up 11%, and international sales were up 21% this quarter, excluding the impact from Japan, which was minimal.
Our performance irrigation business was down 6%. Our soft tissue repair business delivered its strongest quarter in 6 years, growing 14% in the third quarter. We saw this growth despite continued procedural shifts away from natural tissue products, which declined 35% for us in the third quarter. 
In contrast, our synthetic business, which includes our hybrid Phasix material, grew 23% this quarter, which is the highest growth in more than 10 years. Our mix of synthetic revenue to natural tissue revenue is now greater than 7:1. 
We believe the quality and the breadth of our product offering and our value-added programs help customers select the right product for the patient, which is having a significant impact on the treatment paradigm. 
Our hernia fixation business grew 34% this quarter on the continued impact from our recent product launches here.
Closing out the surgical category, our BioSurgery business grew 22% in Q3, with strong growth in both the United States and outside the United States. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for a pipeline update."

Let me jump right in with a brief discussion of a few of our highlighted pipeline projects. As we've done over the last few quarters, I'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. First, our long lesion and",729,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me jump right in with a brief discussion of a few of our highlighted pipeline projects. As we've done over the last few quarters, I'll start with our drug-coated balloon pipeline. First, our long lesion and in-stent restenosis supplements are under review at FDA, and we're hopeful for approval of both of these expanded indications early next year. 
In our Below-the-Knee IDE, as we recently announced, the FDA has approved an amendment to our study supporting the primary efficacy analysis at the 6-month follow-up time point. This is an exciting development, and we're continuing to analyze the potential impact to our approval time line. We think this should put our launch in 2018. 
The AV access DCB IDE study is in follow-up after a very rapid enrollment. We remain on track to get a first look at our results in late Q4, and we anticipate PMA submission in Q1 of 2017. Assuming normal review timing, we expect a late Q4 2017 U.S. launch. 
In Japan, our shonen submission for the Lutonix SFA indication remains under review, and we continue to anticipate a mid-2017 launch. While in China, we continue to enroll in our Levant China study that began earlier this year.
Also in Vascular, our LifeStream Balloon Expandable covered stent trial has completed follow-up, and the final PMA module was submitted last quarter to FDA, with approval and launch expected in mid-2017. 
Our COVERA next-generation AV access circuit stent graft received IDE approvals for both a fistula and a graft study. Both studies began recruitment in Q3, and we expect enrollment will take about a year. 
Our Venovo vena stent IDE is in active recruitment, and we continue to receive positive feedback from Europe where the product is commercially available. We anticipate enrollment throughout 2016 with follow-up in 2017 and PMA submission in 2018. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We've now launched our female version of the Magic3 Go self-hydrating hydrophilic catheter in Europe, and we've begun direct-to-consumer advertising in this product in the U.S. In Targeted Temperature Management, we anticipate commencing enrollment in our new IDE study of neurogenic fever prevention and control. This study will evaluate the use of the Arctic Sun system in this new indication, and we plan to enroll more than 1,000 patients over the next 3-or-so years. 
Moving to Oncology. We're awaiting 510(k) clearance of our new PROVENA family of PowerPICCs designed to reduce the risk of DVT. We're building inventory in a broad range of single-, double- and triple-lumen configurations and anticipate launching around the end of the year. 
Late in Q2, we launched both our new Power Midline and PowerGlide Pro families of intermediate dual [ph] catheters. Early feedback has been very positive on both products, and we anticipate launching additional versions in early 2017. 
On the last call, I announced our European launch of the Nautilus Delta system, with specific indications for Tip Confirmation for the pediatric patient for ports, PICCs and central lines. The next generation of this system is completing development, and we're planning for U.S. launch around the end of the year. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. First, in BioSurgery, we're preparing for the launch of the TRIDYNE aortic sealant. We hope to get this product to the market before the end of the year, but due to some near-term capacity constraints, we now expect to launch in Q1. We also expect to launch in Q2 of 2017 the Progel Emerald lung sealant that's been designed to improve visibility during minimally invasive and robotic thoracic surgery. 
In hernia repair, we continue to launch additional Phasix resorbable mesh sizes and expect to enhance our offerings around the end of the year. This expansion will dramatically increase the range of sizes from 5 to 25 different configurations, providing surgeons and their patients the largest and most comprehensive size matrix in the market.
Expansion of our XenMatrix AB platform, with multiple new sizes, is also on track for launch in early 2017. After launch, Bard will offer the largest biologically derived graft in the market. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we've launched the 15-count version of our OPTIFIX resorbable fixation device, with further launches in this category expected in the first half of 2017.
Thanks for your attention. Let me now turn you over to Chris."
254131,403600059,1062334,"CR Bard Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start tonight with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we took a charge of $110.6 million for product liability matters. We also had acquisition-related items of $5 million, charges",936,"Thank you, John. Let's start tonight with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. This quarter, we took a charge of $110.6 million for product liability matters. We also had acquisition-related items of $5 million, charges of $4.6 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives and a tax credit of $2.6 million related to the completion of certain tax -- certain IRS examinations. The P&L impact for these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q3 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $589.7 million or 62.6% of sales for Q3. On an adjusted basis, GPs were $624.3 million or 66.3% of sales, up 150 basis points from the prior year quarter. Price was unfavorable at 40 basis points on the revenue line and about 10 basis points in gross profit, continuing the solid performance we saw in the first half of the year. And foreign exchange was about a 50 basis point headwind to gross margin this quarter. Mix was favorable by 110 basis points, which includes the positive impact from our Japanese business. And finally, our cost improvement efforts drove approximately 100 basis points of favorability in Q3.
It's been a very strong year for margins for us. And as we told you last quarter, we expect to exceed the original full year guidance for GPs that we gave you in January. 
SG&A expenses were $272.6 million for the quarter or 28.9% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 28.7%, 20 basis points above the prior year. While we do expect to see decent leverage here in Q4 as we anniversary the acquisition of our Japanese joint venture, we expect to slightly exceed our original estimate for the full year due to incremental investments we've made in certain targeted areas. 
R&D expenditures totaled $74.2 million for the third quarter or 7.9% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.8%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Again, as we told you last quarter, we expect a somewhat higher level of R&D investment for the full year, compared to our original guidance, as our strong results have allowed us to fund new opportunities earlier than initially contemplated. We continue to be in investment mode to strengthen the long-term revenue growth potential of the portfolio. 
Interest expense was $14.9 million for the third quarter, and other income and expense was $115.8 million of expense in Q3 as reported or $0.4 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, down 130 basis points from the prior year. We are trending to be at the low end or maybe even slightly better than our original guidance for the full year. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.3 million, and we repurchased approximately 190,000 shares in the third quarter. The net result is reported EPS of $1.27 and adjusted EPS of $2.64, which excludes items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles. This was well above the guidance range we provided for the quarter, reflecting both higher-than-expected sales as well as the continued strong execution by our teams around the world.
The balance sheet as of September 30, reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.15 billion, up slightly from June 30. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were down 1.5 days, and inventory was up 3.1 days. We believe inventory days will decline as we anniversary the recent acquisitions and execute on new product launches that we have been building in front of. Capital expenditures totaled $26 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of September 30, no change from June 30. Debt to total capital at the end of the third quarter was about 49%, and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion at September 30. 
Moving to financial guidance. Given the strong results, we are again raising our guidance for the full year on both the top and bottom line. We now expect full year constant currency sales growth to be between 9% and 10%, with reported sales growth between 8% and 9%, implying the same currency headwind of about 1%. We now expect our full year 2016 organic revenue growth to be around 7%. We're also increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to be between $10.23 and $10.28, representing 13% growth for the year. We now expect foreign exchange to be between $0.23 and $0.25 of headwind for the full year. So on an FX-neutral basis, we are guiding to 15% to 16% EPS growth. 
For Q4, we are expecting constant currency sales growth between 10% and 11%, with reported sales growth between 9.5% and 10.5%, implying an FX headwind of approximately 50 basis points on the revenue line. This assumes organic growth between 6% and 7% for the fourth quarter. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we forecast the fourth quarter in the range of $2.70 to $2.75, representing 11% to 13% growth on a reported basis. 
As we look ahead, we expect a strong finish to what has been a very strong year of both execution and financial performance. And we're very pleased that we've been able to produce these results while still significantly investing for the long-term health of the business. We look forward to reporting on the full year and providing guidance for 2017 in January. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Tim."

Pricing, as you saw, came in again below, I think, our expectations, which is certainly helpful. Mix continues to be positive, driven by, over the last couple of years, some of the launches that we've had. And then our operations teams continued to deliver excellent results from a cost improvement standpoint. So frankly, the strength that we've seen from strong execution on the gross margin line has allowed us to continue to invest in R&D and SG&A, frankly ahead of where we had anticipated to be able to coming into the year. So we think it's a terrific ability for us to reinvest into the business while still driving significant operating margin improvement. So it's a model that we're focused on continuing to replicate. It comes with a lot of hard work from a lot of people, but that's the model. And when we execute well, you get the results that you saw this quarter."

And from what you're seeing in the marketplace, is there any sign of any competitive offerings that look interesting? Because obviously, J&J has been exiting some portions of the market, and you guys have been launching great products. So just curious on the competitive landscape, what you're seeing on hernia, and if you think something around 20% is sustainable in EM."

So if you recall, Bob, we've shown now several times kind of a pipeline of regulatory filings in various emerging markets and geographies. We track that every month, and that we continue to build and invest in that pipeline. So we feel good about that, if you want to think about that. It's almost like another R&D portfolio. It's just products that have already been de-risked, because they've most likely been launched someplace else already. So it's really a regulatory filing. So that's one component. Second, as John mentioned, we continue to invest and build out sales forces and expand in those geographies, and that will continue with the U.S. World Series beginning tonight to put in kind of a baseball analogy. I don't even think we're into the fifth inning yet in emerging markets. So I'd say it's still in the early innings of the game. And that is further -- is another good metric for us. The enthusiasm level from clinicians to be trained on our products almost overwhelms our capability to keep up with the capacity for the demand. So we just opened up another training center in some of the South Asia markets that John has referred to. And that demand continues to be very, very strong. So all of those things really make us believe that we've got a lot of runway left in emerging markets. You want to...?"

The fact of the matter is if everybody performs at the high end of what they told us, we're going to do very well. And that is about execution, both on the new product side, the sales force, marketing, everything. Frankly, that has to do with running a business. And when you execute well, you perform pretty well and that's kind of been the way it's been here the last several quarters."

And when you get that kind of broad-based outstanding execution, you're in a position to do what we're doing here, again, for the third time, which is raising guidance. So the base businesses and again the balance of it, I think it's critically important where all the businesses are contributing really attractive organic growth. The acquisitions, as we've said, have exceeded our expectations. We're doing better on price. Our operations teams are delivering what they committed to and the mix within the portfolio, frankly, the portfolio -- the growth in surgery is very helpful to mix and to margins, as John highlighted as well. And as those emerging market sales reps become more and more productive, that execution gives us some upside. So it's a lot of little things across a lot of parts of the company that, in combination, really result in really strong top and bottom line performance."

So we kind of anticipate all of that, and we think we've got pretty robust data. Obviously, LEVANT 2 was a ""first of a kind"" study, and we learned a lot from that study, and we've seen and talked about, at length, some of the findings on the importance of procedural aspects of that.
