For our second fiscal quarter of 2016, 21 posted a total revenue of $2.93 billion with gross margin of 20%, non-GAAP net loss of $48 million and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow is $763",1054,"Thank you, Ivan. For our second fiscal quarter of 2016, 21 posted a total revenue of $2.93 billion with gross margin of 20%, non-GAAP net loss of $48 million and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow is $763 million. Our results were impacted by continued weakness in the PC market, seasonality and timing of product launch is inserted market segments. We are continuing -- we are simultaneously ramping, qualifying and delivering several products including 20-nanometer DDR4, low-power DDR4 and 3D NAND based solutions. Our products has been strong but it is always challenging to precisely align technology convergence and fab outlook with customer qualification cycle's and market seasonality. Today had like to provide a high-level overview of our progress in each of the business units and have asked Ernie to cover business unit metric and financial performance. 
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, recently receive initial customer qualifications to our 20-nanometer DDR4 products. These are now ramping in volume. In the enterprise, we have qualified an innovative NV Dems solution at 2 major OEMs. At the graphic segment, were enthusiastic about the early success of our GDDR 5x a discrete solution for increasing data rates above 10 gigabits per second. We had several major design wins and expect to have the products available by the end of the current fiscal quarter. In the networking segment, we are seeing early signs of demand recovery in China, where we believe our broad portfolio and strong customer engagements position us well for the future. 
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit, results have been negatively impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LP DDR4 products. We do expect to finalize 20-nanometer low-power DDR4 qualifications with most customers by the end of this quarter, and this, coupled with our expectation that memory demand across the smartphone categories will continue to expand, leaves us confident that our mobile business is well-positioned for substantial growth by the fourth fiscal quarter of this year. In our embedded business unit, automotive design in activity remains strong, particularly with 20-nanometer DDR3 and low-power DDR4 products. We are seeing growth with automotive customers in greater Asia and continuing to build upon success with European and U.S. manufacturers. We are also generating strong design in activity for our industrial SSDs and we are delivering a broad portfolio of differentiated non-volatile memory DRAM and MCP solutions to the consumer and connected home segments. 
Finally, our Storage Business Unit has been positioning this product portfolio to take advantage of our high-performance 3D NAND technology. We are currently sampling Tier 1 OEMs with early versions of our 3D NAND-enabled PCIe MBME client SSDs. Over the next 2 quarters, we'll be shipping crucial branded low-cost 3D NAND client SSDs, high-performance drives targeting gaming enthusiasts and a 2 terabyte client OEM drive. 
In summary, the leading edge technology deployment is progressing well across manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and our bit growth and cost reduction targets are on track. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes, will drive significant improvement in Micron's relative competitive position in the second half of 2016 and beyond. 
Turning to memory industry more generally, we believe that DRAM industry bit supply will decrease to the low to mid-20% range in 2016 and could drop to below 20% in 2017. Our estimate is based on slowing technology driven supply growth and no incremental way for supply. Although the current environment remains challenging, we believe -- we continue to believe that longer term DRAM bit demand growth in the low to mid-20% range will result in healthy market fundamentals. For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid- to high 30% range as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. We continue to expect the cost and performance advantages of 3D NAND will drive enhanced adoption rates and densities across key storage markets and we're confident in Micron's roadmap in 3D NAND in terms of timing, performance and relative composition. 
And currently, and from an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key operating priorities. For DRAM, we continue ramping 20-nanometer. This technology node will represent more than 50% of our fab bit output in the current fiscal quarter. We are enabling 1X DRAM and manufacturing and recently began transferring this technology to our Taiwan fab in Taichung. We expect to ramp 1x nanometer in volume starting in fiscal 2017. We are still forecasting our own fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth CAGR in the 20% to 30% range. This is likely above the market. Our current year bit growth will be weighted to the second half of fiscal year 2016 with substantial bit production output gains in fiscal Q3 and Q4. We currently have no plans to add you dram wafer capacity so and a market share growth in DRAM will be result of technology deployment. For NAND, we're ramping gen 1 3D NAND in Singapore and expect to have more than 50% of our NAND bit fab bit output on 3D by the fall of 2016. We're also enabling Gen 2/3D in manufacturing and expect to be in early production starting this summer. We are forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth CAGR in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be below the market in 2016 but well above the market in 2017. Most of this growth will be related to 3D and TLC conversions, which will begin to deliver more substantial bit growth and cost reductions starting late in fiscal year 2016. We are planning for incremental capacity with our Singapore fab expansion and are beginning 2 installations this quarter. As always, we continue to be mindful of market conditions as we contemplate our investment decisions.  Relative to 3D Crosspoint, we are working with market enablers and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success. We continue to augment our controller and subsystem capabilities and have made good progress in aligning this roadmap with our 3D NAND. We expect is substantially expand our vertically integrated solutions over the next 12 months. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."

Before showing our normal financial summary, cover more technology and business unit details. DRAM represented 54% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the low 20% range; the PC segment was in the mid-20% range, the server business was in the low 20% range; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high 20% range. In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 37% of total revenue with the following segmentation: Consumer, which includes our memory cards, USB and components, represented more than 50%; mobile, including MCP, was in the low teens percent range; while SSDs were in the mid-teens percent range. Automotive and industrial multi-market segment and other embedded applications were in the mid-teens percent range. 
Moving on, I'll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. First, CNBU, the Compute Networking Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.05 billion, down 8% from the previous quarter, impacted by lower average selling prices and continued softness and demand for the PC segment. Hour non-GAAP operating loss was $55 million or 5%. Our high-value solutions from enterprise, networking and graphics market helped offset some of these weakness. In the enterprise and cloud segment, we continue to see significant demand for our DDR4 solutions, specifically within the cloud segment. We have record DDR4 shipments come increasing our market share with the hyperscale customers in Asia Pacific. Within the enterprise segment, demand for our 32 gigabyte DDR4 RDEM also gained significant traction with key customers. In graphics, we continue to see demand softness, however, second-half demand looks stronger for products such as our 20-nanometer, 8 gig GDDR5 solution. The networking, we also saw slowdown in demand as a result of lower LTD shipments during the quarter, but we are expecting a recovery in the second half of the year. Finally, within the client segment, we achieved successful enablement and volume ramp in our 20-nanometer, 4 megabit DDR3 solutions. Also, we shipped samples of our 20-nanometer 8-gigabit DDR4 solutions to all major OEMs and began high volume production. Micron's mobile business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $503 million, down 40% from the prior quarter due to delayed customer qualifications and pricing pressure in the EMCP market. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $21 million or 4% of revenue. We expect some continued challenges during fiscal Q3 as we conclude our customer qualifications but expect to see improved shipments during our fourth fiscal quarter. Bit shipments of EMCPs were down approximately 25% as we redirected bits through higher-margin homes. We saw strong LPDDR3 demand from China in mid-tier phones and expect this demand will continue into next year. Looking forward, our mobile portfolio continues to position us for growth and success. While we had some missteps in our mobile qualifications and F Q2, we expect the situation to progressively improve during the calendar year. We continue to ramp our LPDDR4 solutions into both the flagship and high-end segments, and we'll be introducing our innovative 3D NAND into flagships and some higher-end phones in the second half of calendar 2016. The Embedded Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $460 million, down 4% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating income of $87 million or 19% of revenue. The results were primarily impacted by softness in demand from the consumer and industrial multi-market segments, offset by continued strength in the automotive segment. Looking ahead, we continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and EMMC for automotive application that includes infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. In addition, our NOR extreme flash product introduced last quarter continues to gain adoption with key vendors within the automotive ecosystem. Our industrial multi-market segment, we are seeing good design in activity of our M500 IT industrial SSDs and specialty DRAM and in the connected home segment, we have seen increased DRAM demand from key set-top box customers in both Asia and North America. 
Micron's Storage Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $901 million, up 2% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $18 million, which represents 2% of revenue. We continue to optimize our product mix to address market challenges, particularly in the client and data center SSD segments. Our Trade NAND component bit growth was up 16% quarter-over-quarter, and we see demand increasing driven by OEM enterprise solution providers and web scale customers who want to leverage the energy savings and performance gain enabled by Micron Flash. In our client and consumer SSD segment, consecutive quarter bit growth was up 13%, reflecting accelerated SSD adoption and OEM ultrabook and ultrathin PCs. In our enterprise SSD segment, we are starting to ship our S600 series SAS drive, Micron's first product produced through our strategic partnership with Seagate. We expect to realize revenue from this new product line in Q3 as we move into volume production. Finally, the data center SSD market segments saw significant downward pricing pressure, driven by TLC-enabled competitors and aggressive competition for hyperscale business. Micron's participation in this market has been measured, and in the second quarter, we strategically shipped bit supply from the segment to more favorable margin opportunities. Looking at the company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the second quarter was $2.93 billion, which was at the low end of our guided range. Our revenues were impacted by seasonality, timing of product launches and DRAM and NAND pricing pressure, driven primarily by the PC end market. Gross margin for the quarter was 20%, 5 percentage points below the previous quarter and at the high-end of our guidance. The non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $48 million or $0.05 per share at the favorable end of our guided range. Gross margin reflects the pricing environment noted earlier as well as the timing of our leading-edge technology migrations. As we've noted before, these migrations will generate more substantial cost per bit reductions starting in F Q3 for DRAM and F Q4 for NAND. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP reporting. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.06 per share for the recently completed quarter. 
Look at results by product line. DRAM revenue decreased 18% compared to the first fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of lower average selling prices and lower volume shipments. During the second quarter, DRAM bit inventories increased as a result of the 20-nanometer ramp and the timing of product qualifications with certain mobile customers. While we currently expect substantial growth in the volume of DRAM sales in Q3, we also expect an additional inventory increase that will become available for incremental revenue during the following quarters. The further market adoption of DDR4 products continued in the second quarter and represented approximately 26% of total DRAM volume sales. As a result of decreases in average selling prices, DRAM gross margin was lower than in our previous quarter at approximately 20%, while bit costs remained relatively flat. Our non-volatile trade revenue decreased 6% compared to the first quarter as a result of the decrease in selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volume. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points as improvements in per bit cost nearly offset the decrease in selling prices. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $583 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guided range. The company generated operating cash flow of $763 million during the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.1 billion. Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.2 billion and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the $5 billion range net of partner contributions. During the second quarter, we borrowed approximately $425 million with equipment financing and also repaid the third installment on the former Elpida creditor debt, bringing the total repayment to approximately half of the total debt. 
Moving now to our third fiscal quarter guidance, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion; gross margin in the range of 16.5% to 19%; operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million; operating income ranging between a loss of $70 million and income of $10 million; and an EPS range between a loss of $0.12 per share and a loss of $0.05 per share based on  1,036,000,000 deleted shares. Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit production target outlined in our recent analyst day. Along these lines, we expect strong double-digit bit growth and related cost reductions for DRAM in fiscal Q3 as a result of the deployment of our 20-nanometer technology. These trends will continue in future quarters along with benefits of expected improvements in seasonality and further progress on our product qualifications. Our 3D NAND ramp-up and manufacturing is proceeding well in the expectancy significant bit growth and cost reductions starting in fiscal Q4. With that, chart it back over to Mark."

The answer there is we're now a month into the quarter. So a significant part of the output is already out, and another significant part of the output is already running in the fab. We've seen a month of yield data already. I would just reinforce what I said in the last analyst day presentation, that the ramp is really, at that time was and continues to outperform any previous new technology ramp in terms of yield maturity.

For our second fiscal quarter of 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.93 billion with gross margin of 20%, non-GAAP net loss of $48 million and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $7",1060,"Thank you, Ivan. For our second fiscal quarter of 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.93 billion with gross margin of 20%, non-GAAP net loss of $48 million and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $763 million. Our results were impacted by continued weakness in the PC market, seasonality and timing of product launches in certain market segments. We are continuing -- we are simultaneously ramping, qualifying and delivering several leading edge products, including 20-nanometer DDR4, low-power DDR4 and 3D NAND-based solutions. Our progress has been strong, but it's always challenging to precisely align technology convergence and fab output with customer qualification cycles and market seasonality.
Today, had like to provide a high-level overview of our progress in each of the business units and have asked Ernie to cover business unit metrics and financial performance.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we recently achieved initial customer qualification on our 20-nanometer 8-gigabit DDR4 products. These are now ramping in volume. In the enterprise, we have qualified an innovative NV DIMM solution at 2 major OEMs. In the graphics segment, we are enthusiastic about the early success of our GDDR5X, a discrete solution for increasing data rates above 10 gigabits per second. We have several major design wins and expect to have the products available by the end of the current fiscal quarter. In the networking segment, we are seeing early signs of demand recovery in China where we believe our broad portfolio and strong customer engagements position us well for the future.
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit, results have been negatively impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4 products. We do expect to finalize 20-nanometer low-power DDR4 qualifications with most customers by the end of this quarter, and this, coupled with our expectation that memory demand across the smartphone categories will continue to expand, leaves us confident that our mobile business is well positioned for substantial growth by the fourth fiscal quarter of this year.
In our Embedded Business Unit, automotive design-in activity remains strong, particularly with 20-nanometer DDR3 and low-power DDR4 products. We are seeing growth with automotive customers in Greater Asia and continuing to build upon success with European and U.S. manufacturers. We are also generating strong design-in activity for our industrial SSDs, and we are delivering a broad portfolio of differentiated nonvolatile memory, DRAM and MCP solutions to the consumer and connected home segments.
Finally, our Storage Business Unit has been positioning this product portfolio to take advantage of our high-performance 3D NAND technology. We are currently sampling Tier 1 OEMs with early versions of our 3D NAND-enabled PCIe NVMe client SSDs. Over the next 2 quarters, we will be shipping Crucial-branded low-cost 3D NAND client SSDs, high-performance drives targeting gaming enthusiasts and a 2-terabyte client OEM drive.
In summary, the leading edge technology deployment is progressing well across manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and our bit growth and cost reduction targets are on track. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive significant improvement in Micron's relative competitive position in the second half of 2016 and beyond.
Turning to memory industry more generally, we believe that DRAM industry bit supply will decrease to the low- to mid-20% range in 2016 and could drop below 20% in 2017. Our estimate is based on slowing technology-driven supply growth and no incremental way for supply. Although the current environment remains challenging, we believe -- we continue to believe that longer-term DRAM bit demand growth in the low- to mid-20% range will result in healthy market fundamentals.
For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid- to high-30% range as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. We continue to expect the cost and performance advantages of 3D NAND will drive enhanced adoption rates and densities across key storage markets. And we are confident in Micron's road map in 3D NAND in terms of timing, performance and relative composition.
Internally and from an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key operating priorities. For DRAM, we continue ramping 20-nanometer. This technology node will represent more than 50% of our fab bit output in the current fiscal quarter. We are enabling 1X DRAM in manufacturing and recently began transferring this technology to our Taiwan fab in Taichung. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer in volume starting in fiscal 2017. We are still forecasting our own fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth CAGR in the 20% to 30% range. This is likely above the market. Our current year bit growth will be weighted to the second half of fiscal year 2016 with substantial bit production output gains in fiscal Q3 and Q4. We currently have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity so any market share growth in DRAM will be a result of technology deployment.
For NAND, we are ramping Gen1 3D NAND in Singapore and expect to have more than 50% of our NAND bit -- fab bit output on 3D by the fall of 2016. We are also enabling Gen2 3D in manufacturing and expect to be in early production starting this summer. We are forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2007 (sic) [ 2017 ] NAND bit growth CAGR in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be below the market in 2016 but well above the market in 2017. Most of this growth will be related to 3D and TLC conversions, which will begin to deliver more substantial bit growth and cost reductions starting late in fiscal year 2017 -- 2016, excuse me.
We are planning for incremental capacity with our Singapore fab expansion and are beginning 2 installations this quarter. As always, we continue to be mindful of market conditions as we contemplate our investment decisions.
Relative to 3D XPoint, we are working with market enablers and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success. We continue to augment our controller and subsystem capabilities and have made good progress in aligning this road map with our 3D NAND ramp. We expect to substantially expand our vertically integrated solutions over the next 12 months.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."

Before sharing our normal financial summary, I'll cover more technology and business unit details. DRAM represented 54% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: was in the low 20% range; the PC segment was in the mid-20% rang",1517,"Thank you, Mark. Before sharing our normal financial summary, I'll cover more technology and business unit details. DRAM represented 54% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: was in the low 20% range; the PC segment was in the mid-20% range; the server business was in the low 20% range; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high-20% range.
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 37% of total revenue with the following segmentation: consumer, which includes our memory cards, USB and components, represented more than 50%; mobile, including MCP, was in the low-teens percent range; while SSDs were in the mid-teens percent range. Automotive and industrial multi-market segment and other embedded applications were in the mid-teens percent range.
Moving on, I'll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. First, CNBU, the Compute Networking Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.05 billion, down 8% from the previous quarter, impacted by lower average selling prices and continued softness in demand for the PC segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $55 million or 5%. Our high-value solutions through enterprise, networking and graphics market, helped to offset some of these weakness. In the enterprise and cloud segment, we continue to see significant demand for our DDR4 solutions, specifically within the cloud segment, we had record DDR4 shipments increasing our market share with key hyperscale customers in Asia Pacific. Within the enterprise segment, demand for our 32-gigabyte DDR4 RDIMM also gained significant traction with key customers. In graphics, we continue to see demand softness, however, second-half demand looks stronger for products such as our 20-nanometer 8-gig DDR -- GDDR5 solution. In networking, we also saw a slowdown in demand as a result of lower LTD shipments during the quarter, but we are expecting a recovery in the second half of the year. Finally, within the client segment, we achieved successful enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer 4-gigabit DDR3 solutions. Also, we shipped samples of our 20-nanometer 8-gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs and began high-volume production.
Micron's Mobile Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $503 million, down 40% from the prior quarter, due to delayed customer qualifications and pricing pressure in the eMCP market. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $21 million or 4% of revenue. We expect some continued challenges during fiscal Q3 as we conclude our customer qualifications but expect to see improved shipments during our fourth fiscal quarter. Bit shipments of eMCPs were down approximately 25% as we redirected bits through higher-margin homes. We saw strong LPDDR3 demand from China in mid-tier phones and expect this demand will continue into next year. Looking forward, our mobile portfolio continues to position us for growth and success. While we had some missteps in our mobile qualifications and F Q2, we expect this situation to progressively improve during the calendar year. We continue to ramp our LPDDR4 solutions into both the flagship and high-end segments, and we'll be introducing our innovative 3D NAND into flagships and some higher-end phones in the second half of calendar 2016.
The Embedded Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $460 million, down 4% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating income of $87 million or 19% of revenue. The results were primarily impacted by softness in demand from the consumer and industrial multi-market segments, offset by continued strength in the automotive segment. Looking ahead, we continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC for automotive application that includes infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. In addition, our NOR extreme flash product introduced last quarter continues to gain adoption with key vendors within the automotive ecosystem. Our industrial multi-market segment, we are seeing good design-in activity of our M500IT, Industrial SSDs and specialty DRAM. And in the connected home segment, we are seeing increased DRAM demand from key set-top box customers in both Asia and North America.
Micron's Storage Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $901 million, up 2% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $18 million, which represents 2% of revenue. We continue to optimize our product mix to address market challenges, particularly in the client and data center SSD segments. Our Trade NAND component bit growth was up 16% quarter-over-quarter, and we see demand increasing driven by OEM enterprise solution providers and web scale customers who want to leverage the energy savings and performance gain enabled by Micron Flash. In our client and consumer SSD segment, consecutive quarter bit growth was up 13%, reflecting accelerated SSD adoption in OEM ultrabook and ultrathin PCs. In our enterprise SSD segment, we are starting to ship our S600 Series SAS drive, Micron's first product produced through our strategic partnership with Seagate. We expect to realize revenue from this new product line in Q3 as we move into volume production. Finally, the data center SSD market segment saw a significant downward pricing pressure, driven by TLC-enabled competitors and aggressive competition for hyperscale business. Micron's participation in this market has been measured, and in the second quarter, we strategically shifted bit supply from this segment to more favorable market -- margin opportunities.
Looking at the company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the second quarter was $2.93 billion, which was at the low end of our guided range. Our revenues were impacted by seasonality, timing of product launches and DRAM and NAND pricing pressure, driven primarily by the PC end market. Gross margin for the quarter was 20%, 5 percentage points below the previous quarter and at the high end of our guidance. The non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $48 million or $0.05 per share at the favorable end of our guided range. Gross margin reflects the pricing environment noted earlier as well as the timing of our leading edge technology migrations. As we've noted before, these migrations will generate more substantial cost per bit reductions starting in F Q3 for DRAM and F Q4 for NAND. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP reporting. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.06 per share for the recently completed quarter.
Looking at results by product line, DRAM revenue decreased 18% compared to the first fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of lower average selling prices and lower volume shipments. During the second quarter, DRAM bit inventories increased as a result of the 20-nanometer ramp and the timing of product qualifications with certain mobile customers. While we currently expect substantial growth in the volume of DRAM sales in Q3, we also expect an additional inventory increase that will become available for incremental revenue during the following quarters. The further market adoption of DDR4 products continued in the second quarter and represented approximately 26% of total DRAM volume sales. As a result of decreases in average selling prices, DRAM gross margin was lower than in our previous quarter at approximately 20%, while bit cost remained relatively flat. Our nonvolatile trade revenue decreased 6% compared to the first quarter as a result of the decrease in selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volume.
Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points as improvements in per bit cost nearly offset the decrease in selling prices.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $583 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guided range.
The company generated operating cash flow of $763 million during the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.1 billion.
Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.2 billion, and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the $5 billion range net of partner contributions.
During the second quarter, we borrowed approximately $425 million with equipment financing and also repaid the third installment on the former Elpida creditor debt, bringing the total repayment to approximately half of the total debt.
Moving now to our third fiscal quarter guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion; gross margin in the range of 16.5% to 19%; operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million; operating income ranging between a loss of $70 million and income of $10 million; and an EPS range between a loss of $0.12 per share and a loss of $0.05 per share based on 1,036,000,000 diluted shares.
Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit production target outlined in our recent Analyst Day. Along these lines, we expect strong double-digit bit growth and related cost reductions for DRAM in fiscal Q3 as a result of the deployment of our 20-nanometer technology. These trends will continue in future quarters, along with benefits of expected improvements in seasonality and further progress on our product qualifications. Our 3D NAND ramp and manufacturing is proceeding well, and we expect to see significant bit growth and cost reductions starting in fiscal Q4.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

So really, what we experience is more of a timing issue relative to some of those products and some of those customers, and we're very confident that the product meets their need. It's just a matter of now getting them queued up and through the qualification cycle. So I'm very confident that we have a good handle on the timing, and that's why we continue to build those products and are confident holding a lot of inventory to cover that. Relative to the -- to client SSDs, you're right, there's been significant pressure there. We have talked about strong double-digit growth in terms of our bit growth on NAND on a go-forward basis, and given that, significant cost reductions that come with that as well as the strong ability to ramp TLC as move later in the year with our 3D NAND.

We've seen a month of yield data already.

For our second fiscal quarter of 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.93 billion with gross margin of 20%, non-GAAP net loss of $48 million and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $7",1061,"Thank you, Ivan. For our second fiscal quarter of 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.93 billion with gross margin of 20%, non-GAAP net loss of $48 million and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $763 million. Our results were impacted by continued weakness in the PC market, seasonality and timing of product launches in certain market segments. We are continuing -- we are simultaneously ramping, qualifying and delivering several leading edge products, including 20-nanometer DDR4, low-power DDR4 and 3D NAND-based solutions. Our progress has been strong, but as always challenging to precisely align technology convergence and fab output with customer qualification cycles and market seasonality.
Today, I'd like to provide a high-level overview of our progress in each of the business units and have asked Ernie to cover business unit metrics and financial performance.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we recently achieved initial customer qualifications on our 20-nanometer 8-gigabit DDR4 products. These are now ramping in volume. In the enterprise, we have qualified an innovative NV DIMM solution at 2 major OEMs. In the graphics segment, we are enthusiastic about the early success of our GDDR5X, a discrete solution for increasing data rates above 10 gigabits per second. We have several major design wins and expect to have the products available by the end of the current fiscal quarter. In the networking segment, we are seeing early signs of demand recovery in China where we believe our broad portfolio and strong customer engagements position us well for the future.
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit, results have been negatively impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4 products. We do expect to finalize 20-nanometer low-power DDR4 qualifications with most customers by the end of this quarter, and this, coupled with our expectation that memory demand across the smartphone categories will continue to expand, leaves us confident that our mobile business is well positioned for substantial growth by the fourth fiscal quarter of this year.
In our Embedded Business Unit, automotive design-in activity remains strong, particularly with 20-nanometer DDR3 and low-power DDR4 products. We are seeing growth with automotive customers in Greater Asia and continuing to build upon success with European and U.S. manufacturers. We are also generating strong design-in activity for our industrial SSDs, and we are delivering a broad portfolio of differentiated nonvolatile memory, DRAM and MCP solutions to the consumer and connected home segments.
Finally, our Storage Business Unit has been positioning its product portfolio to take advantage of our high-performance 3D NAND technology. We are currently sampling Tier 1 OEMs with early versions of our 3D NAND-enabled PCIe NVMe client SSDs. Over the next 2 quarters, we will be shipping Crucial-branded low-cost 3D NAND client SSDs, high-performance drives targeting gaming enthusiasts and a 2-terabyte client OEM drive.
In summary, the leading edge technology deployment is progressing well across manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and our bit growth and cost reduction targets are on track. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive significant improvement in Micron's relative competitive position in the second half of 2016 and beyond.
Turning to memory industry more generally, we believe that DRAM industry bit supply will decrease to the low- to mid-20% range in 2016 and could drop below 20% in 2017. Our estimate is based on slowing technology-driven supply growth and no incremental wait for supply. Although the current environment remains challenging, we believe -- we continue to believe that longer-term DRAM bit demand growth in the low- to mid-20% range will result in healthy market fundamentals.
For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid- to high-30% range as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. We continue to expect the cost and performance advantages of 3D NAND will drive enhanced adoption rates and densities across key storage markets. And we are confident in Micron's road map in 3D NAND in terms of timing, performance and relative cost position.
Internally and from an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key operating priorities. For DRAM, we continue ramping 20-nanometer. This technology node will represent more than 50% of our fab bit output in the current fiscal quarter. We are enabling 1X DRAM in manufacturing and recently began transferring this technology to our Taiwan fab in Taichung. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer in volume starting in fiscal 2017. We are still forecasting our own fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth CAGR in the 20% to 30% range. This is likely above the market. Our current year bit growth will be weighted to the second half of fiscal year 2016 with substantial bit production output gains in fiscal Q3 and Q4. We currently have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity so any market share growth in DRAM will be a result of technology deployment.
For NAND, we are ramping Gen1 3D NAND in Singapore and expect to have more than 50% of our NAND bit -- fab bit output on 3D by the fall of 2016. We are also enabling Gen2 3D in manufacturing and expect to be in early production starting this summer. We are forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2007 (sic) [ 2017 ] NAND bit growth CAGR in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be below the market in 2016 but well above the market in 2017. Most of this growth will be related to 3D and TLC conversions, which will begin to deliver more substantial bit growth and cost reductions starting late in fiscal year 2017 -- 2016, excuse me.
We are planning for incremental capacity with our Singapore fab expansion and are beginning tool installations this quarter. As always, we continue to be mindful of market conditions as we contemplate our investment decisions.
Relative to 3D XPoint, we are working with market enablers and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success. We continue to augment our controller and subsystem capabilities and have made good progress in aligning this road map with our 3D NAND ramp. We expect to substantially expand our vertically integrated solutions over the next 12 months.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."

Before sharing our normal financial summary, I'll cover more technology and business unit details. DRAM represented 54% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the low 20% range; the PC segment was in the mid-2",1518,"Thank you, Mark. Before sharing our normal financial summary, I'll cover more technology and business unit details. DRAM represented 54% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the low 20% range; the PC segment was in the mid-20% range; the server business was in the low 20% range; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high-20% range.
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 37% of total revenue with the following segmentation: Consumer, which includes our memory cards, USB and components, represented more than 50%; mobile, including MCP, was in the low-teens percent range; while SSDs were in the mid-teens percent range. Automotive and industrial multi-market segment and other embedded applications were in the mid-teens percent range.
Moving on, I'll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. First, CNBU, the Compute Networking Business Unit, posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.05 billion, down 8% from the previous quarter, impacted by lower average selling prices and continued softness in demand for the PC segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $55 million or 5%. Our high-value solutions through enterprise, networking and graphics market helped to offset some of these weakness. In the enterprise and cloud segment, we continued to see significant demand for our DDR4 solutions; specifically within the cloud segment, we had record DDR4 shipments increasing our market share with key hyperscale customers in Asia Pacific. Within the enterprise segment, demand for our 32-gigabyte DDR4 RDIMM also gained significant traction with key customers. In graphics, we continue to see demand softness, however, second-half demand looks stronger for products such as our 20-nanometer 8-gig DDR -- GDDR5 solution. In networking, we also saw a slowdown in demand as a result of lower LTD shipments during the quarter, but we are expecting a recovery in the second half of the year. Finally, within the client segment, we achieved successful enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer 4-gigabit DDR3 solutions. Also, we shipped samples of our 20-nanometer 8-gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs and began high-volume production.
Micron's Mobile Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $503 million, down 40% from the prior quarter, due to delayed customer qualifications and pricing pressure in the eMCP market. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $21 million or 4% of revenue. We expect some continued challenges during fiscal Q3 as we conclude our customer qualifications but expect to see improved shipments during our fourth fiscal quarter. Bit shipments of eMCPs were down approximately 25% as we redirected bits through higher-value homes. We saw strong LPDDR3 demand from China in mid-tier phones and expect this demand will continue into next year. Looking forward, our mobile portfolio continues to position us for growth and success. While we had some missteps in our mobile qualifications in F Q2, we expect this situation to progressively improve during the calendar year. We continue to ramp our LPDDR4 solutions into both the flagship and high-end segments, and we'll be introducing our innovative 3D NAND into flagships and some higher-end phones in the second half of calendar 2016.
The Embedded Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $460 million, down 4% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating income of $87 million or 19% of revenue. The results were primarily impacted by softness in demand from the consumer and industrial multi-market segments, offset by continued strength in the automotive segment. Looking ahead, we continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC for automotive application that includes infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. In addition, our NOR extreme flash product introduced last quarter continues to gain adoption with key vendors within the automotive ecosystem. Our industrial multi-market segment, we are seeing good design-in activity of our M500IT, Industrial SSDs and specialty DRAM. And in the connected home segment, we are seeing increased DRAM demand from key set-top box customers in both Asia and North America.
Micron's Storage Business Unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $901 million, up 2% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $18 million, which represents 2% of revenue. We continue to optimize our product mix to address market challenges, particularly in the client and data center SSD segments. Our Trade NAND component bit growth was up 16% quarter-over-quarter, and we see demand increasing driven by OEM enterprise solution providers and web scale customers who want to leverage the energy savings and performance gain enabled by Micron Flash. In our client and consumer SSD segment, consecutive quarter bit growth was up 13%, reflecting accelerated SSD adoption in OEM ultrabook and ultrathin PCs. In our enterprise SSD segment, we are starting to ship our S600 Series SAS drive, Micron's first product produced through our strategic partnership with Seagate. We expect to realize revenue from this new product line in Q3 as we move into volume production. Finally, the data center SSD market segment saw significant downward pricing pressure, driven by TLC-enabled competitors and aggressive competition for hyperscale business. Micron's participation in this market has been measured, and in the second quarter, we strategically shifted bit supply from this segment to more favorable market -- margin opportunities.
Looking at the company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the second quarter was $2.93 billion, which is at the low end of our guided range. Our revenues were impacted by seasonality, timing of product launches and DRAM and NAND pricing pressure, driven primarily by the PC end market. Gross margin for the quarter was 20%, 5 percentage points below the previous quarter and at the high end of our guidance. The non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $48 million or $0.05 per share at the favorable end of our guided range. Gross margin reflects the pricing environment noted earlier as well as the timing of our leading edge technology migrations. As we've noted before, these migrations will generate more substantial cost per bit reductions starting in F Q3 for DRAM and F Q4 for NAND. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP reporting. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.06 per share for the recently completed quarter.
Looking at results by product line, DRAM revenue decreased 18% compared to the first fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of lower average selling prices and lower volume shipments. During the second quarter, DRAM bit inventories increased as a result of the 20-nanometer ramp and the timing of product qualifications with certain mobile customers. While we currently expect substantial growth in the volume of DRAM sales in Q3, we also expect an additional inventory increase that will become available for incremental revenue during the following quarters. The further market adoption of DDR4 products continued in the second quarter and represented approximately 26% of total DRAM volume sales. As a result of decreases in average selling prices, DRAM gross margin was lower than in our previous quarter at approximately 20%, while bit cost remained relatively flat. Our nonvolatile trade revenue decreased 6% compared to the first quarter as a result of the decrease in selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volume.
Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points as improvements in per bit cost nearly offset the decrease in selling prices.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $583 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guided range.
The company generated operating cash flow of $763 million during the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.1 billion.
Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.2 billion, and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the $5 billion range net of partner contributions.
During the second quarter, we borrowed approximately $425 million with equipment financing and also repaid the third installment on the former Elpida creditor debt, bringing the total repayment to approximately half of the total debt.
Moving now to our third fiscal quarter guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion; gross margin in the range of 16.5% to 19%; operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million; operating income ranging between a loss of $70 million and income of $10 million; and an EPS range between a loss of $0.12 per share and a loss of $0.05 per share based on 1,036,000,000 diluted shares.
Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit production target outlined in our recent Analyst Day. Along these lines, we expect strong double-digit bit growth and related cost reductions for DRAM in fiscal Q3 as a result of the deployment of our 20-nanometer technology. These trends will continue in future quarters, along with the benefits of expected improvements in seasonality and further progress on our product qualifications. Our 3D NAND ramp and manufacturing is proceeding well, and we expect to see significant bit growth and cost reductions starting in fiscal Q4.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

So first, relative to the qualification, obviously, when you're ramping multiple new fabs on new technology nodes and simultaneously transitioning to new densities and new I/Os, it's a complicated thing to keep everything completely aligned with all the various customer requirements and customer product rollouts, particularly in a design-in sort of more sticky environment like we experience in the mobile segment. So really, what we experience is more of a timing issue relative to some of those products and some of those customers, and we're very confident that the product meets their need. It's just a matter of now getting them queued up and through the qualification cycle. So I'm very confident that we have a good handle on the timing, and that's why we continue to build those products and are confident holding an amount of inventory to cover that. Relative to the -- to client SSDs, you're right, there's been significant pressure there. We have talked about strong double-digit growth in terms of our bit growth on NAND on a go-forward basis, and given that, significant cost reductions that come with that as well as the strong ability to ramp TLC as we move late into the year with our 3D NAND. So generally speaking, we feel pretty good about where our NAND business goes as we move late into this year and into the next year."

We've seen a month of yield data already.

For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. Top lin",1154,"Thanks, Ivan. For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. 
Top line results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC segment and the mobile qualifications we discussed last quarter. With recent data points indicating some improvement in Channel pricing, an expectation of finalizing our mobile qualifications and continued progress on our technology and operational milestones, we remain confident about our opportunities. Today, I'd like to provide a brief overview of our progress in each of the businesses and Ernie will cover other business unit performance details.
In our computer networking business unit, we return to revenue growth despite pricing pressure in the client segment. This was driven by the ongoing ramp of our 20-nanometer products, which exceeded 25-nanometer shipments on a bit basis for the first time. We enjoyed continued 20-nanometer qualifications across all CMB market segments, led by our 8 gigabit DDR 4 product in enterprise, cloud and client. 
In May, NVIDIA launched the world's fastest consumer graphics card designed with Micron's GDDR5 X. We're excited about the prospects of this high-performance memory product. In enterprise and cloudy, we saw initial customer announcements based on our product NVDIM product offering with high-performance persistent memory. 
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. Our results continue to be impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LP DDR 4. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter, and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. We are ramping out for these products throughout the quarter and into fiscal Q1 2017. 
We anticipate continued demand growth in mobile market in the fourth quarter in terms of both NAN and LP DRAM. In our Embedded Business Unit, the automotive segment delivered record revenue, driven by volume increases in DDR3 and increasing density mix in the eMMC. Density Activity remains strong with recent qualifications of automotive consumer and connected home applications. In the consumer MCP business, we saw some recovery that we expect to continue into fiscal Q4 aligning would seasonal demand.
Finally, our Storage business unit is in the midst of refreshing its SSD portfolio with a higher capacity 3D NAND technology. We also introduced Micron Accelerated Solutions, which are enabled by our enterprise SSDs and advanced DRAM, integrating compute and storage to improve efficiency and performance in a variety of storage applications. And we announced our new 1 10 SATA client SSDs, leveraging triple levels cells 3D NAND for class leading performance power efficiency. 
To summarize, our leading-edge technology deployment continues to progress throughout manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and we are on track with our bit growth and cost reduction targets. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive improvement in our competitive position in the rest of 2016 and beyond. 
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We believe that the DRAM industry supply growth will be in the low to mid-20% range in 2016, which is consistent with our prior commentary. If wafer output declines in the latter half of the year as some forecast, we would expect to exit the year on a slower run rate and 2017, the supply growth could be in the mid to high teens. This compares to a long-term bit demand forecast in the low to mid-20% range the significant improvement we're seeing in channel pricing are not currently impacting other segment and as a result, we continue to take a conservative view of the market environment. 
For NAND, we estimate 2016 supply growth in the mid 30% to low 40% range with a similar range in 2017, as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. Over the last several quarters, we experienced strong demand coupled with aggressive pricing as suppliers have been driving increased penetration rates and densities. 
Similar to DRAM, the current channel pricing environment appears to be improving, but has not yet significantly impacted across other segments. Our long-term bit demand forecast is in the low 40% range as lower cost and higher performance 3D NAND solutions enter the market. From an operational perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key priorities. For DRAM, we successfully achieved our targeted 20-nanometer crossover during fiscal Q3 and also enabled our 1X [ph] manufacturing. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer DRAM and volume starting in 2017.
We are forecasting -- we are still forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth in the 28% to 30% range, which is slightly above the market. We achieved 22% bit growth in fiscal Q3 and expect even stronger bit growth in Q4. 
In light of current market conditions, we have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity. As noted above, we are migrating to advanced technology nodes in order to achieve cost-reduction and adjust higher density designs for mobile, cloud and enterprise segments. 
For NAND, we continue to make great progress on our Jen 1 3D NAND and re reaching maturity yields ahead of expectations. We still expect to achieve 3D bit crossover by this fall, which would allow us to take advantage of the cost benefits that this technology provides. Our second-generation 3D product is also on track with initial production this quarter. Equally exciting is that we expect TLC to be the majority of our 3D bit output within the next few quarters. In aggregate, we are forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be somewhat below the market in 2016 and somewhat above the market in 2017. 
TLC enabled 3D NAND technology is a big step forward and a significant driver relative to the progress we expect to make in our NAND business. This technology progress must be complemented by enabling product solutions for key storage and mobile segments. We've outlined a storage product road map, which includes our recently announced client SSDs, followed by cloud rise later this year and enterprise solutions early next year. We're also evaluating a number of mobile product opportunities for 3D NAND in 2017. 
Relative to 3D XPoint, we're working with market enablers across a number of market segments and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success with revenue in 2017 and beyond. Micron has a committed focus on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products for our customers. While we haven't finalized our fiscal year 2017 business plan, we are approaching that plan with prudence and conservatism and carefully reviewing our capital investments and projected operating cash flows to ensure the appropriate balance. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."
289030,346817206,1003826,"Micron Technology, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Micron Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I'll start off by sharing technology and business units tells and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. DRAM represents a 60% of our total revenue with the follo",1623,"Thanks, Mark. I'll start off by sharing technology and business units tells and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. 
DRAM represents a 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the mid-20% range, the PC segment represented about 25%; the server business was in the low 20% range; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high 20% range. 
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 55%. Mobile and SSDs each represented approximately 13%. And as a reminder, eMCPs are accounts for in the mobile segment. The automotive, industrial, multi market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range. 
Moving on, I'll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. Micron's compete and networking business unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.09 billion, up 4% from the previous quarter, primarily driven by our 20-nanometer shipment growth across all segments and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $63 million or 6% of revenue. 
In the enterprise segment, demand for our 20-nanometer 32 gigabit DDR4 RDAM was driven by the launch of Intel's latest server platform. We also saw solid growth in the cloud segment with continued transition to DDR4. 
In graphics, we saw strong growth driven by our GDDR 5 in the GDDR 5X products and are approaching a seasonally strong period for graphics application, including virtual reality, and expect good performance from this segment for the next quarter. 
In networking, our business was somewhat flat. However, we made significant progress enabling our 20-nanometer products and also announced our eUSB 3.0 solution. 
Finally, within the client segment, we continued enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer, 4 gigabit DDR3 and 8 gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs. In Micron's Mobile Business Unit, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $561 million, up 12% from the prior quarter, as we continue to ramp 20-nanometer LPDDR3 and LPDDR4. While the low-density eMCP market is still under pressure, a move to higher density designs in SG 4 in early FY '17 should help stabilize and improve this segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $17 million or 3% of revenue.
We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. This work will allow us to more fully ramp our 20-nanometer mobile products in fiscal Q4 and into next year. Both LP DRAM and NAND content continues to increase in mobile devices, which when combined with even modest unit growth, will result in very solid bit consumption. 
In our embedded business, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $487 million, up 6% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating income of $107 million or 22% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by continued strength in the automotive and consumer segments, offset by softness in the industrial multi market segment. 
In our Automotive segment, we achieved record revenue increasing 6% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-on-year. We continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC applications that include infotainment, instrument cluster and advanced driver systems, and continue to see strong demand from our EMEA customers, which has more recently complemented by growth in Korea and demand recovery in North America. 
Our portfolio of leading edge solution is enabling major 2018 platform automotive design wins. Our industrial multi market business declined 9% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to global market softness in the manufacturing infrastructure segment. However, we continue to see healthy demand for our NOR and NAND based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules. 
Our consumer connected home revenue was up 3% quarter-over-quarter with some softness in the set-top box business, offset by strong demand for NAND and LP DRAM MCPs to support action camera and home automation applications. As we enter into a seasonally strong period, we expect demand to continue to grow. Customers are also beginning to design NAND and ramp, our 20-nanometer DDR 4 products, into set-top box applications. 
Micron Storage business unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $719 million, down 20% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $62 million or 9% of revenue. As we transition to lower cost 3D NAND products, we continue to optimize our product mix. In clients and consumer SSD, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 20% as we reduced production of planar NAND based SSDs while ramp in volume production of 3D NAND based SATA and PCIE clients and consumer SSDs. These new products will enable the company to enhance its competitive position. 
In the Enterprise and Data Center SSD segments consecutive quarter bits sold were down 10%. As we have previously noted, our 3D NAND solutions will improve our product portfolio in the segment, enabling us to participate more significantly in this important growth business for the company. Now looking at the company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the third quarter was $2.9 billion, which was near the midpoint of our guided range and roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by decreases in selling prices while trade NAND shipments declined as we are in the middle of a significant conversion from Planar to the 3D NAND. Gross margin for the quarter was 17% within our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $79 million or $0.08 per share, slightly better than the midpoints of our guided range. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.05 per share for the recently completed quarter. Now let's look at results by product line. 
DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the second quarter as a result of the 22% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by lower selling prices. As the results of our 20-nanometer ramp and ongoing mobile qualification timeline, DRAM finished goods inventory increase during the quarter. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter decreased approximately 2 percentage points to 18%, as decreases in the ASPs outpaced significant cost reductions. Our nonvolatile trade revenue decreased 15% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a 10% decrease in bit shipments combined with a 6% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 17% as ASP reductions outpaced cost per bit reductions.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $523 million below our guided range due to the reversal of accrued cost for variable compensation plans, which were suspended in the third quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $389 million, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.7 billion. Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion net of partner contributions.
During the quarter, we received approximately $2 billion from the issuance of secured notes and an additional $114 million in equipment financing. Also, we resolved the long outstanding tax matter, which resulted in a $52 million benefit to the tax line. This benefit was offset by the write-off of a related $30 million receivable that was reflected as nonoperating expense. In the third quarter, we also acquired Photonics interest in our cap mass operations for $93 million resulting in 100% ownership of the mask operations.
Moving on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 15.5% to 18%, operating expenses between $580 million and $630 million and operating loss ranging between $135 million and $55 million, and an EPS loss ranging between $0.24 and $0.16 per share based on 1,036,000,000 diluted shares. 
Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction that we previously shared as we continue to ramp our 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND production. 
In recognition of the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on the company's key priorities, we plan to implement the cost saving program, which we expect will save the company approximately $80 million per quarter in fiscal 2017. The savings will result from a combination of our more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a material number of open headcount requisition and a workforce reduction in certain areas of the business, as well as other nonheadcount related spending reductions. About half of these savings will appear in the gross margin line of company while the remainder will be reflected in operating expenses. These savings are baseline against our previously planned 2017 fiscal spend levels. 
We expect to take reserves approximating $70 million for the cost of this program, a majority of which will occur in fiscal Q4 with the remainder in the early part of fiscal 2017. As we complete our fiscal 2017 planning process, we are mindful of the need to effectively balance period spending, CapEx and free cash flow, and we continue to explore other opportunities to improve the company's financial performance. 
Finally, at this time, we don't have any new information to share relative to Inotera. As we stated in our press release, the transaction will not be closing in mid July and we expect to provide an update during the latter part of the calendar year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

So I would assume you're but it costs are coming down nicely. You mentioned other parts of the market that may not be participating on the pricing stabilization that we're seeing in the PC market. But if I look at the end market, demand parameters, data center, networking fundamentals seem to be improving into the second half embedded fundamentals seem to be seasonally up.

So it is important to recognize that these data points are really happening in realtime. And as we look at how we actually entered this quarter, we were actually starting the quarter below the average of the prior quarter and we're now seeing some upward trends that are causing everyone to have the enthusiasm that we're talking about. But it isn't important to understand that what you'll be reading about in the last 2 weeks as A, not impacted the entirety of the quarter and B, hasn't reflected itself it as we look at forward pricing. And as Mark mentioned a couple of times, we really are wanting to provide prudent guidance in the context of an environment that's moving around very, very significantly. The other point I would make is it is absolutely true that we are seeing strong bit growth and cost reductions on the DRAM side remembered that we said the majority of the NAND cost reductions as we see that big cross over which is later in the fall of this year. So we are getting quarter-on-quarter cost productions in NAND, but I think you might be perhaps pulling towards that bit crossover comment into the full quarter that we're coming up on, and that's just not going to be the case."

For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. Top lin",1147,"Thanks, Ivan. For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. 
Top line results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC segment and the mobile qualifications we discussed last quarter. With recent data points indicating some improvement in channel pricing, an expectation of finalizing our mobile qualifications and continued progress on our technology and operational milestones, we remain confident about our opportunities. 
Today, I'd like to provide a brief overview of our progress in each of the businesses, and Ernie will cover other business unit performance details.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we return to revenue growth despite pricing pressure in the client segment. This was driven by the ongoing ramp of our 20-nanometer products, which exceeded 25-nanometer shipments on a bit basis for the first time. We enjoyed continued 20-nanometer qualifications across all CNBU market segments, led by our 8-gigabit DDR4 product in enterprise, cloud and client. 
In May, NVIDIA launched the world's fastest consumer graphics card designed with Micron's GDDR5X. We're excited about the prospects for this high-performance memory product. In enterprise and cloud, we saw initial customer announcements based on our NVDIMM product offering with high-performance persistent memory. 
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. Our results continue to be impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter, and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. We are ramping the output of these products throughout the quarter and into fiscal Q1 2017. We anticipate continued demand growth in mobile market in the fourth quarter in terms of both NAND and LPDRAM. 
In our Embedded Business Unit, the automotive segment delivered record revenue, driven by volume increases in DDR3 and increasing density mix in the eMMC. Density activity remains strong with recent qualifications of automotive consumer and connected home applications. In the consumer MCP business, we saw some recovery that we expect to continue into fiscal Q4 aligning with seasonal demand.
And finally, our Storage Business Unit is in the midst of refreshing its SSD portfolio with a higher-capacity 3D NAND memory technology. We also introduced Micron Accelerated Solutions, which are enabled by our enterprise SSDs and advanced DRAM, integrating compute and storage to improve efficiency and performance in a variety of storage applications. And we announced our new 110 SATA client SSDs, leveraging triple-level cell 3D NAND for class-leading performance and power efficiency. 
To summarize, our leading-edge technology deployment continues to progress throughout manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and we are on track with our bit growth and cost-reduction targets. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive improvement in our competitive position in the rest of 2016 and beyond. 
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We believe that the DRAM industry supply growth will be in the low to mid-20% range in 2016, which is consistent with our prior commentary. If wafer output declines in the latter half of the year as some already forecast, we would expect to exit the year on a slower run rate and 2017 bit supply growth could be in the mid to high teens. This compares to our long-term bit demand forecast in the low to mid-20% range. The significant improvements we're seeing in channel pricing are not currently impacting other segments, and as a result, we continue to take a conservative view of the market environment. 
For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid-30% to low 40% range with a similar range in 2017, as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. Over the last several quarters, we've experienced strong demand coupled with aggressive pricing as suppliers have been driving to increased penetration rates and densities. Similar to DRAM, the current channel pricing environment appears to be improving but has not yet significantly impacted across other segments. Our long-term bit demand forecast is in the low 40% range, as lower-cost and higher-performance 3D NAND solutions enter the market. 
From an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key priorities. For DRAM, we successfully achieved our targeted 20-nanometer crossover during fiscal Q3 and also enabled our 1X node in manufacturing. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer DRAM and volume starting in 2017. We are forecasting -- we are still forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth in the 28% to 30% range, which is slightly above the market. We achieved 22% bit growth in fiscal Q3 and expect even stronger bit growth in Q4. 
In light of current market conditions, we have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity. As noted above, we are migrating to advanced technology nodes in order to achieve cost reduction and adjust higher-density designs for mobile, the cloud and enterprise segments. 
For NAND, we continue to make great progress on our Gen1 3D NAND and reaching maturity yields ahead of expectations. We still expect to achieve 3D bit crossover by this fall, which will allow us to take advantage of the cost benefits that this technology provides. Our second-generation 3D product is also on track with initial production this quarter. Equally exciting is that we expect TLC to be the majority of our 3D bit output within the next few quarters. 
In aggregate, we are forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be somewhat below the market in 2016 and somewhat above the market in 2017. 
TLC-enabled 3D NAND technology is a big step forward and a significant driver relative to the progress we expect to make in our NAND business. This technology progress must be complemented by enabling product solutions for key storage and mobile segments. We've outlined the storage product road map, which includes our recently announced client SSDs, followed by cloud rise later this year and enterprise solutions early next year. We're also evaluating a number of mobile product opportunities for 3D NAND in 2017. 
Relative to 3D XPoint, we're working with market enablers across a number of market segments and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success with revenue in 2017 and beyond. Micron has a committed focus on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products for our customers. While we haven't finalized our fiscal year 2017 business plan, we are approaching that plan with prudence and conservatism and carefully reviewing our capital investments and projected operating cash flows to ensure the appropriate balance. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."

I'll start off by sharing technology and business unit details and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the follo",1600,"Thanks, Mark. I'll start off by sharing technology and business unit details and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. 
DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the mid-20% range. The PC segment represented about 25%. The server business was in the low 20% range. And specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high 20% range. 
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation: Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 55%. Mobile and SSDs each represented approximately 13%. And as a reminder, eMCPs are accounted for in the mobile segment. The automotive, industrial, multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range. 
Moving on, I'll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. Micron's Compute and Networking Business Unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.09 billion, up 4% from the previous quarter, primarily driven by our 20-nanometer shipment growth across all segments and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $63 million or 6% of revenue. 
In the enterprise segment, demand for our 20-nanometer, 32-gigabit DDR4 RDIMM was driven by the launch of Intel's latest server platform. We also saw solid growth in the cloud segment with continued transition to DDR4. 
In graphics, we saw strong growth driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products and are approaching a seasonally strong period for graphics applications, including virtual reality, and expect good performance from this segment for the next quarter. 
In networking, our business was somewhat flat. However, we've made significant progress enabling our 20-nanometer products and also announced our eUSB 3.0 solution. 
Finally, within the client segment, we continued enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer, 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs. 
In Micron's Mobile Business Unit, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $561 million, up 12% from the prior quarter, as we continue to ramp 20-nanometer LPDDR3 and LPDDR4. While the low-density eMCP market is still under pressure, a move to higher-density designs in F Q4 and early FY '17 should help stabilize and improve this segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $17 million or 3% of revenue.
We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter, and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. This work will allow us to more fully ramp our 20-nanometer mobile products in fiscal Q4 and into next year. Both LPDRAM and NAND content continues to increase in mobile devices, which when combined with even modest unit growth, will result in very solid bit consumption. 
In our Embedded Business, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $487 million, up 6% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating income of $107 million or 22% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by continued strength in the automotive and consumer segments, offset by softness in the industrial multi-market segment. 
In our automotive segment, we achieved record revenue increasing 6% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-on-year. We continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC applications that include infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assist Systems and continue to see strong demand from our EMEA customers, which is more recently complemented by growth in Korea and demand recovery in North America. Our portfolio of leading-edge solutions is enabling major 2018 platform automotive design wins. 
Our industrial multi-market business declined 9% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to global market softness in the manufacturing infrastructure segment. However, we continue to see healthy demand for our NOR and NAND-based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules. 
Our consumer and connected home revenue was up 3% quarter-over-quarter with some softness in the set-top box business, offset by strong demand for NAND and LPDRAM MCPs to support action camera and home-automation applications. As we enter into a seasonally strong period, we expect demand to continue to grow. Customers are also beginning to design NAND and ramp our 20-nanometer DDR4 products into set-top box applications. 
Micron's Storage Business Unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $719 million, down 20% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $62 million or 9% of revenue. As we transition to lower-cost 3D NAND products, we continue to optimize our product mix. 
In clients and consumer SSD, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 20% as we reduced production of planar NAND-based SSDs while ramping volume production of 3D NAND-based SATA and PCIe clients and consumer SSDs. These new products will enable the company to enhance its competitive position. 
In the enterprise and data center SSD segments, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 10%. As we have previously noted, our 3D NAND solutions will improve our product portfolio in the segment, enabling us to participate more significantly in this important growth business for the company. 
Now looking at the company overall. As Mark noted earlier, revenue for the third quarter was $2.9 billion, which was near the midpoint of our guided range and roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by decreases in selling prices, while trade NAND shipments declined as we are in the middle of a significant conversion from planar to the 3D NAND. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 17% within our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $79 million or $0.08 per share, slightly better than the midpoints of our guided range. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.05 per share for the recently completed quarter. 
Now let's look at results by product line. 
DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the second quarter as a result of the 22% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by lower selling prices. As the results of our 20-nanometer ramp and ongoing mobile qualification time line, DRAM finished goods inventory increase during the quarter. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter decreased approximately 2 percentage points to 18%, as decreases in ASPs outpaced significant cost reductions. 
Our nonvolatile trade revenue decreased 15% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a 10% decrease in bit shipments combined with a 6% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 17%, as ASP reductions outpaced cost per bit reductions.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $523 million below our guided range due to the reversal of accrued cost for variable compensation plans, which were suspended in the third quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $389 million, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.7 billion. 
Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion net of partner contributions.
During the quarter, we received approximately $2 billion from the issuance of secured notes and an additional $114 million in equipment financing. Also, we resolved the long-outstanding tax matter, which resulted in a $52 million benefit to the tax line. This benefit was offset by the writeoff of a related $30 million receivable that was reflected as nonoperating expense. 
In the third quarter, we also acquired Photronics' interest in our captive mask operations for $93 million, resulting in 100% ownership of the mask operations.
Moving on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 15.5% to 18%, operating expenses between $580 million and $630 million and operating loss ranging between $135 million and $65 million and an EPS loss ranging between $0.24 and $0.16 per share based on 1,036,000,000 diluted shares. 
Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction that we've previously shared, as we continue to ramp our 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND production. 
In recognition of the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on the company's key priorities, we plan to implement the cost-saving program, which we expect will save the company approximately $80 million per quarter in fiscal 2017. The savings will result from a combination of our more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a material number of open headcount requisition and a workforce reduction in certain areas of the business as well as other non-headcount-related spending reductions. About half of these savings will appear in the gross margin line of the company, while the remainder will be reflected in operating expenses. These savings are baseline against our previously planned 2017 fiscal spend levels. 
We expect to take reserves approximating $70 million for the cost of this program, a majority of which will occur in fiscal Q4 with the remainder in the early part of fiscal 2017. As we complete our fiscal 2017 planning process, we are mindful of the need to effectively balance period spending, CapEx and free cash flow, and we continue to explore other opportunities to improve the company's financial performance. 
Finally, at this time, we don't have any new information to share relative to Inotera. As we stated in our press release, the transaction will not be closing in mid-July, and we expect to provide an update during the latter part of the calendar year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

So we've got one full set in Hiroshima, one full set in the MMT fab in Taichung and a separate tool set in the Inotera fab, and that's just more complicated.

For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. Top lin",1149,"Thanks, Ivan. For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. 
Top line results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC segment and the mobile qualifications we discussed last quarter. With recent data points indicating some improvement in channel pricing, an expectation of finalizing our mobile qualifications and continued progress on our technology and operational milestones, we remain confident about our opportunities. 
Today, I'd like to provide a brief overview of our progress in each of the businesses, and Ernie will cover other business unit performance details.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we returned to revenue growth despite pricing pressure in the client segment. This was driven by the ongoing ramp of our 20-nanometer products, which exceeded 25-nanometer shipments on a bit basis for the first time. We enjoyed continued 20-nanometer qualifications across all CNBU market segments, led by our 8-gigabit DDR4 product in enterprise, cloud and client. 
In May, NVIDIA launched the world's fastest consumer graphics card designed with Micron's GDDR5X. We're excited about the prospects for this high-performance memory product. In enterprise and cloud, we saw initial customer announcements based on our NVDIMM product offering with high-performance persistent memory. 
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. Our results continue to be impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter, and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. We are ramping the output of these products throughout the quarter and into fiscal Q1 2017. We anticipate continued demand growth in mobile market in the fourth quarter in terms of both NAND and LPDRAM. 
In our Embedded Business Unit, the automotive segment delivered record revenue, driven by volume increases in DDR3 and increasing density mix in the eMMC. Density activity remains strong with recent qualifications of automotive, consumer and connected home applications. In the consumer MCP business, we saw some recovery that we expect to continue into fiscal Q4 aligning with seasonal demand.
And finally, our Storage Business Unit is in the midst of refreshing its SSD portfolio with a higher-capacity 3D NAND memory technology. We also introduced Micron Accelerated Solutions, which are enabled by our enterprise SSDs and advanced DRAM, integrating compute and storage to improve efficiency and performance in a variety of storage applications. And we announced our new 110 SATA client SSDs, leveraging triple-level cell 3D NAND for class-leading performance and power efficiency. 
To summarize, our leading-edge technology deployment continues to progress throughout manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and we are on track with our bit growth and cost-reduction targets. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive improvement in our competitive position in the rest of 2016 and beyond. 
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We believe that the DRAM industry supply growth will be in the low to mid-20% range in 2016, which is consistent with our prior commentary. If wafer output declines in the latter half of the year as some have already forecast, we would expect to exit the year on a slower run rate and 2017 bit supply growth could be in the mid to high teens. This compares to our long-term bit demand forecast in the low to mid-20% range. The significant improvements we're seeing in channel pricing are not currently impacting other segments, and as a result, we continue to take a conservative view of the market environment. 
For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid-30% to low 40% range with a similar range in 2017, as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. Over the last several quarters, we've experienced strong demand coupled with aggressive pricing as suppliers have been driving to increased penetration rates and densities. Similar to DRAM, the current channel pricing environment appears to be improving but is not yet significantly impacted across other segments. Our long-term bit demand forecast is in the low 40% range, as lower-cost and higher-performance 3D NAND solutions enter the market. 
From an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key priorities. For DRAM, we successfully achieved our targeted 20-nanometer crossover during fiscal Q3 and also enabled our 1X node in manufacturing. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer DRAM and volume starting in 2017. We are forecasting -- we are still forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth in the 28% to 30% range, which is slightly above the market. We achieved 22% bit growth in fiscal Q3 and expect even stronger bit growth in Q4. 
In light of current market conditions, we have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity. As noted above, we are migrating to advanced technology nodes in order to achieve cost reduction and adjust higher-density designs for mobile, the cloud and enterprise segments. 
For NAND, we continue to make great progress on our Gen1 3D NAND and are reaching maturity yields ahead of expectations. We still expect to achieve 3D bit crossover by this fall, which will allow us to take advantage of the cost benefits that this technology provides. Our second-generation 3D product is also on track with initial production this quarter. Equally exciting is that we expect TLC to be the majority of our 3D bit output within the next few quarters. 
In aggregate, we are forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be somewhat below the market in 2016 and somewhat above the market in 2017. 
TLC-enabled 3D NAND technology is a big step forward and a significant driver relative to the progress we expect to make in our NAND business. This technology progress must be complemented by enabling product solutions for key storage and mobile segments. We've outlined the storage product road map, which includes our recently announced client SSDs, followed by cloud drives later this year and enterprise solutions early next year. We're also evaluating a number of mobile product opportunities for 3D NAND in 2017. 
Relative to 3D XPoint, we're working with market enablers across a number of market segments and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success with revenue in 2017 and beyond. Micron has a committed focus on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products for our customers. While we haven't finalized our fiscal year 2017 business plan, we are approaching that plan with prudence and conservatism and carefully reviewing our capital investments and projected operating cash flows to ensure the appropriate balance. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."

Micron's Compute and Networking Business Unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.09 billion, up 4% from the previous quarter, primarily driven by our 20-nanometer shipment growth across all segments and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $63 million or 6% of revenue. 
In the enterprise segment, demand for our 20-nanometer, 32-gigabit DDR4 RDIMM was driven by the launch of Intel's latest server platform. We also saw solid growth in the cloud segment with continued transition to DDR4. 
In graphics, we saw strong growth driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products and are approaching a seasonally strong period for graphics applications, including virtual reality, and expect good performance from this segment for the next quarter. 
In networking, our business was somewhat flat. However, we've made significant progress enabling our 20-nanometer products and also announced our eUSB 3.0 solution. 
Finally, within the client segment, we continued enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer, 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs. 
In Micron's Mobile Business Unit, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $561 million, up 12% from the prior quarter, as we continue to ramp 20-nanometer LPDDR3 and LPDDR4. While the low-density eMCP market is still under pressure, a move to higher-density designs in F Q4 and early FY '17 should help stabilize and improve this segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $17 million or 3% of revenue.
We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter, and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. This work will allow us to more fully ramp our 20-nanometer mobile products in fiscal Q4 and into next year. Both LPDRAM and NAND content continues to increase in mobile devices, which when combined with even modest unit growth, will result in very solid bit consumption. 
In our Embedded Business, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $487 million, up 6% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating income of $107 million or 22% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by continued strength in the automotive and consumer segments, offset by softness in the industrial multi-market segment. 
In our automotive segment, we achieved record revenue, increasing 6% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-on-year. We continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC applications that include infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assist Systems and continue to see strong demand from our EMEA customers, which is more recently complemented by growth in Korea and demand recovery in North America. Our portfolio of leading-edge solutions is enabling major 2018 platform automotive design wins. 
Our industrial multi-market business declined 9% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to global market softness in the manufacturing infrastructure segment. However, we continue to see healthy demand for our NOR and NAND-based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules. 
Our consumer and connected home revenue was up 3% quarter-over-quarter, with some softness in the set-top box business offset by strong demand for NAND and LPDRAM MCPs to support action camera and home-automation applications. As we enter into a seasonally strong period, we expect demand to continue to grow. Customers are also beginning to design in and ramp our 20-nanometer DDR4 products into set-top box applications. 
Micron's Storage Business Unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $719 million, down 20% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $62 million or 9% of revenue. As we transition to lower-cost 3D NAND products, we continue to optimize our product mix. 
In clients and consumer SSD, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 20% as we reduced production of planar NAND-based SSDs while ramping volume production of 3D NAND-based SATA and PCIe clients and consumer SSDs. These new products will enable the company to enhance its competitive position. 
In the enterprise and data center SSD segments, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 10%. As we have previously noted, our 3D NAND solutions will improve our product portfolio in the segment, enabling us to participate more significantly in this important growth business for the company. 
Now looking at the company overall. As Mark noted earlier, revenue for the third quarter was $2.9 billion, which was near the midpoint of our guided range and roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by decreases in selling prices, while trade NAND shipments declined as we are in the middle of a significant conversion from planar to 3D NAND. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 17%,  within our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $79 million or $0.08 per share, slightly better than the midpoint of our guided range. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.05 per share for the recently completed quarter. 
Now let's look at results by product line. 
DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the second quarter as a result of a 22% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by lower selling prices. As a result of our 20-nanometer ramp and ongoing mobile qualification time line, DRAM finished goods inventory increase during the quarter. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter decreased approximately 2 percentage points to 18%, as decreases in ASPs outpaced significant cost reductions. 
Our nonvolatile trade revenue decreased 15% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a 10% decrease in bit shipments combined with a 6% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 17%, as ASP reductions outpaced cost per bit reductions.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $523 million below our guided range due to the reversal of accrued cost for variable compensation plans, which were suspended in the third quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $389 million, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.7 billion. 
Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion net of partner contributions.
During the quarter, we received approximately $2 billion from the issuance of secured notes and an additional $114 million in equipment financing. Also, we resolved a long-outstanding tax matter, which resulted in a $52 million benefit to the tax line. This benefit was offset by the writeoff of a related $30 million receivable that was reflected as nonoperating expense. 
In the third quarter, we also acquired Photronics' interest in our captive mask operations for $93 million, resulting in 100% ownership of the mask operations.
Moving on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 15.5% to 18%, operating expenses between $580 million and $630 million and operating loss ranging between $135 million and $55 million and an EPS loss ranging between $0.24 and $0.16 per share based on 1,036,000,000 diluted shares. 
Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction that we've previously shared, as we continue to ramp our 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND production. 
In recognition of the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on the company's key priorities, we plan to implement the cost-saving program, which we expect will save the company approximately $80 million per quarter in fiscal 2017. The savings will result from a combination of our more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a material number of open headcount requisitions and a workforce reduction in certain areas of the business as well as other non-headcount-related spending reductions. About half of these savings will appear in the gross margin line of the company, while the remainder will be reflected in operating expenses. These savings are baseline against our previously planned 2017 fiscal spend levels. 
We expect to take reserves approximating $70 million for the cost of this program, a majority of which will occur in fiscal Q4 with the remainder in the early part of fiscal 2017. As we complete our fiscal 2017 planning process, we are mindful of the need to effectively balance period spending, CapEx and free cash flow, and we continue to explore other opportunities to improve the company's financial performance. 
Finally, at this time, we don't have any new information to share relative to Inotera. As we stated in our press release, the transaction will not be closing in mid-July, and we expect to provide an update during the latter part of the calendar year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

So certainly, we think 3D NAND has gone very, very well for that, as that -- for us, that has been really a model where we take technology we've developed in Fab 4 and move it into a consistent equipment set in a historically Micron environment where the equipment all matches and things go very, very well. What we experienced in 20-nanometer is we're matching a disparate set of equipment, given the Elpida acquisition. So we've got one full set in Hiroshima, one full set in the MMT fab in Taichung and a separate tool set in the Inotera fab, and that's just more complicated. And every time we make this transition, we get more and more of those tools aligned, and we feel like actually, we're in pretty good shape now. And as we move to the 1X node beyond that, it's going to be a lot more seamless and a lot easier to execute on a go-forward basis. So we are the -- we think we're the leader in 3D, and we think we're getting closer in DRAM. And 1X is coming along now running at sort of pre-production levels in both Hiroshima and Taichung."

For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. Top lin",1149,"Thanks, Ivan. For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. 
Top line results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC segment and the mobile qualifications we discussed last quarter. With recent data points indicating some improvement in channel pricing, an expectation of finalizing our mobile qualifications and continued progress on our technology and operational milestones, we remain confident about our opportunities. 
Today, I'd like to provide a brief overview of our progress in each of the businesses, and Ernie will cover other business unit performance details.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we returned to revenue growth despite pricing pressure in the client segment. This was driven by the ongoing ramp of our 20-nanometer products, which exceeded 25-nanometer shipments on a bit basis for the first time. We enjoyed continued 20-nanometer qualifications across all CNBU market segments, led by our 8-gigabit DDR4 product in enterprise, cloud and client. 
In May, NVIDIA launched the world's fastest consumer graphics card designed with Micron's GDDR5X. We're excited about the prospects for this high-performance memory product. In enterprise and cloud, we saw initial customer announcements based on our NVDIMM product offering with high-performance persistent memory. 
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. Our results continue to be impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter, and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. We are ramping the output of these products throughout the quarter and into fiscal Q1 2017. We anticipate continued demand growth in mobile market in the fourth quarter in terms of both NAND and LPDRAM. 
In our Embedded Business Unit, the automotive segment delivered record revenue, driven by volume increases in DDR3 and increasing density mix in the eMMC. Density activity remains strong with recent qualifications of automotive, consumer and connected home applications. In the consumer MCP business, we saw some recovery that we expect to continue into fiscal Q4 aligning with seasonal demand.
And finally, our Storage Business Unit is in the midst of refreshing its SSD portfolio with a higher-capacity 3D NAND memory technology. We also introduced Micron Accelerated Solutions, which are enabled by our enterprise SSDs and advanced DRAM, integrating compute and storage to improve efficiency and performance in a variety of storage applications. And we announced our new 110 SATA client SSDs, leveraging triple-level cell 3D NAND for class-leading performance and power efficiency. 
To summarize, our leading-edge technology deployment continues to progress throughout manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and we are on track with our bit growth and cost-reduction targets. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive improvement in our competitive position in the rest of 2016 and beyond. 
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We believe that the DRAM industry supply growth will be in the low to mid-20% range in 2016, which is consistent with our prior commentary. If wafer output declines in the latter half of the year as some have already forecast, we would expect to exit the year on a slower run rate and 2017 bit supply growth could be in the mid to high teens. This compares to our long-term bit demand forecast in the low to mid-20% range. The significant improvements we're seeing in channel pricing are not currently impacting other segments, and as a result, we continue to take a conservative view of the market environment. 
For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid-30% to low 40% range with a similar range in 2017, as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. Over the last several quarters, we've experienced strong demand coupled with aggressive pricing as suppliers have been driving to increased penetration rates and densities. Similar to DRAM, the current channel pricing environment appears to be improving but is not yet significantly impacted across other segments. Our long-term bit demand forecast is in the low 40% range, as lower-cost and higher-performance 3D NAND solutions enter the market. 
From an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key priorities. For DRAM, we successfully achieved our targeted 20-nanometer crossover during fiscal Q3 and also enabled our 1X node in manufacturing. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer DRAM and volume starting in 2017. We are forecasting -- we are still forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth in the 28% to 30% range, which is slightly above the market. We achieved 22% bit growth in fiscal Q3 and expect even stronger bit growth in Q4. 
In light of current market conditions, we have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity. As noted above, we are migrating to advanced technology nodes in order to achieve cost reduction and adjust higher-density designs for mobile, the cloud and enterprise segments. 
For NAND, we continue to make great progress on our Gen1 3D NAND and are reaching maturity yields ahead of expectations. We still expect to achieve 3D bit crossover by this fall, which will allow us to take advantage of the cost benefits that this technology provides. Our second-generation 3D product is also on track with initial production this quarter. Equally exciting is that we expect TLC to be the majority of our 3D bit output within the next few quarters. 
In aggregate, we are forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be somewhat below the market in 2016 and somewhat above the market in 2017. 
TLC-enabled 3D NAND technology is a big step forward and a significant driver relative to the progress we expect to make in our NAND business. This technology progress must be complemented by enabling product solutions for key storage and mobile segments. We've outlined the storage product road map, which includes our recently announced client SSDs, followed by cloud drives later this year and enterprise solutions early next year. We're also evaluating a number of mobile product opportunities for 3D NAND in 2017. 
Relative to 3D XPoint, we're working with market enablers across a number of market segments and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success with revenue in 2017 and beyond. Micron has a committed focus on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products for our customers. While we haven't finalized our fiscal year 2017 business plan, we are approaching that plan with prudence and conservatism and carefully reviewing our capital investments and projected operating cash flows to ensure the appropriate balance. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."
289030,346817206,1003968,"Micron Technology, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Micron Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I'll start off by sharing technology and business unit details and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the follo",1599,"Thanks, Mark. I'll start off by sharing technology and business unit details and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. 
DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the mid-20% range. The PC segment represented about 25%. The server business was in the low 20% range. And specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high 20% range. 
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation: Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 55%. Mobile and SSDs each represented approximately 13%. And as a reminder, eMCPs are accounted for in the mobile segment. The automotive, industrial, multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range. 
Moving on, I'll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. Micron's Compute and Networking Business Unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.09 billion, up 4% from the previous quarter, primarily driven by our 20-nanometer shipment growth across all segments and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $63 million or 6% of revenue. 
In the enterprise segment, demand for our 20-nanometer, 32-gigabit DDR4 RDIMM was driven by the launch of Intel's latest server platform. We also saw solid growth in the cloud segment with continued transition to DDR4. 
In graphics, we saw strong growth driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products and are approaching a seasonally strong period for graphics applications, including virtual reality, and expect good performance from this segment for the next quarter. 
In networking, our business was somewhat flat. However, we've made significant progress enabling our 20-nanometer products and also announced our eUSB 3.0 solution. 
Finally, within the client segment, we continued enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer, 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs. 
In Micron's Mobile Business Unit, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $561 million, up 12% from the prior quarter, as we continue to ramp 20-nanometer LPDDR3 and LPDDR4. While the low-density eMCP market is still under pressure, a move to higher-density designs in F Q4 and early FY '17 should help stabilize and improve this segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $17 million or 3% of revenue.
We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter, and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. This work will allow us to more fully ramp our 20-nanometer mobile products in fiscal Q4 and into next year. Both LPDRAM and NAND content continues to increase in mobile devices, which when combined with even modest unit growth, will result in very solid bit consumption. 
In our Embedded Business, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $487 million, up 6% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating income of $107 million or 22% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by continued strength in the automotive and consumer segments, offset by softness in the industrial multi-market segment. 
In our automotive segment, we achieved record revenue, increasing 6% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-on-year. We continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC applications that include infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assist Systems and continue to see strong demand from our EMEA customers, which is more recently complemented by growth in Korea and demand recovery in North America. Our portfolio of leading-edge solutions is enabling major 2018 platform automotive design wins. 
Our industrial multi-market business declined 9% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to global market softness in the manufacturing infrastructure segment. However, we continue to see healthy demand for our NOR and NAND-based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules. 
Our consumer and connected home revenue was up 3% quarter-over-quarter, with some softness in the set-top box business offset by strong demand for NAND and LPDRAM MCPs to support action camera and home-automation applications. As we enter into a seasonally strong period, we expect demand to continue to grow. Customers are also beginning to design in and ramp our 20-nanometer DDR4 products into set-top box applications. 
Micron's Storage Business Unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $719 million, down 20% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $62 million or 9% of revenue. As we transition to lower-cost 3D NAND products, we continue to optimize our product mix. 
In clients and consumer SSD, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 20% as we reduced production of planar NAND-based SSDs while ramping volume production of 3D NAND-based SATA and PCIe clients and consumer SSDs. These new products will enable the company to enhance its competitive position. 
In the enterprise and data center SSD segments, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 10%. As we have previously noted, our 3D NAND solutions will improve our product portfolio in the segment, enabling us to participate more significantly in this important growth business for the company. 
Now looking at the company overall. As Mark noted earlier, revenue for the third quarter was $2.9 billion, which was near the midpoint of our guided range and roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by decreases in selling prices, while trade NAND shipments declined as we are in the middle of a significant conversion from planar to 3D NAND. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 17%,  within our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $79 million or $0.08 per share, slightly better than the midpoint of our guided range. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.05 per share for the recently completed quarter. 
Now let's look at results by product line. 
DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the second quarter as a result of a 22% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by lower selling prices. As a result of our 20-nanometer ramp and ongoing mobile qualification time line, DRAM finished goods inventory increase during the quarter. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter decreased approximately 2 percentage points to 18%, as decreases in ASPs outpaced significant cost reductions. 
Our nonvolatile trade revenue decreased 15% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a 10% decrease in bit shipments combined with a 6% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 17%, as ASP reductions outpaced cost per bit reductions.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $523 million below our guided range due to the reversal of accrued cost for variable compensation plans, which were suspended in the third quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $389 million, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.7 billion. 
Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion net of partner contributions.
During the quarter, we received approximately $2 billion from the issuance of secured notes and an additional $114 million in equipment financing. Also, we resolved a long-outstanding tax matter, which resulted in a $52 million benefit to the tax line. This benefit was offset by the writeoff of a related $30 million receivable that was reflected as nonoperating expense. 
In the third quarter, we also acquired Photronics' interest in our captive mask operations for $93 million, resulting in 100% ownership of the mask operations.
Moving on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 15.5% to 18%, operating expenses between $580 million and $630 million and operating loss ranging between $135 million and $55 million and an EPS loss ranging between $0.24 and $0.16 per share based on 1,036,000,000 diluted shares. 
Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction that we've previously shared, as we continue to ramp our 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND production. 
In recognition of the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on the company's key priorities, we plan to implement the cost-saving program, which we expect will save the company approximately $80 million per quarter in fiscal 2017. The savings will result from a combination of our more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a material number of open headcount requisitions and a workforce reduction in certain areas of the business as well as other non-headcount-related spending reductions. About half of these savings will appear in the gross margin line of the company, while the remainder will be reflected in operating expenses. These savings are baseline against our previously planned 2017 fiscal spend levels. 
We expect to take reserves approximating $70 million for the cost of this program, a majority of which will occur in fiscal Q4 with the remainder in the early part of fiscal 2017. As we complete our fiscal 2017 planning process, we are mindful of the need to effectively balance period spending, CapEx and free cash flow, and we continue to explore other opportunities to improve the company's financial performance. 
Finally, at this time, we don't have any new information to share relative to Inotera. As we stated in our press release, the transaction will not be closing in mid-July, and we expect to provide an update during the latter part of the calendar year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

And as Mark mentioned a couple of times, we really are wanting to provide prudent guidance in the context of an environment that's moving around very, very significantly. The other point I would make is it is absolutely true that we are seeing strong bit growth and cost reductions on the DRAM side. Remember that we said the majority of the NAND cost reductions occur as we achieve that big crossover, which is later in the fall of this year.

For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. Top lin",1148,"Thanks, Ivan. For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. 
Top line results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC segment and the mobile qualifications we discussed last quarter. With recent data points indicating some improvement in channel pricing, an expectation of finalizing our mobile qualifications and continued progress on our technology and operational milestones, we remain confident about our opportunities. 
Today, I'd like to provide a brief overview of our progress in each of the businesses, and Ernie will cover other business unit performance details.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we return to revenue growth despite pricing pressure in the client segment. This was driven by the ongoing ramp of our 20-nanometer products, which exceeded 25-nanometer shipments on a bit basis for the first time. We enjoyed continued 20-nanometer qualifications across all CNBU market segments, led by our 8-gigabit DDR4 product in enterprise, cloud and client. 
In May, NVIDIA launched the world's fastest consumer graphics card designed with Micron's GDDR5X. We're excited about the prospects for this high-performance memory product. In enterprise and cloud, we saw initial customer announcements based on our NVDIMM product offering with high-performance persistent memory. 
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. Our results continue to be impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter, and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. We are ramping the output of these products throughout the quarter and into fiscal Q1 2017. We anticipate continued demand growth in mobile market in the fourth quarter in terms of both NAND and LPDRAM. 
In our Embedded Business Unit, the automotive segment delivered record revenue, driven by volume increases in DDR3 and increasing density mix in the eMMC. Density activity remains strong with recent qualifications of automotive, consumer and connected home applications. In the consumer MCP business, we saw some recovery that we expect to continue into fiscal Q4 aligning with seasonal demand.
And finally, our Storage Business Unit is in the midst of refreshing its SSD portfolio with a higher-capacity 3D NAND memory technology. We also introduced Micron Accelerated Solutions, which are enabled by our enterprise SSDs and advanced DRAM, integrating compute and storage to improve efficiency and performance in a variety of storage applications. And we announced our new 110 SATA client SSDs, leveraging triple-level cell 3D NAND for class-leading performance and power efficiency. 
To summarize, our leading-edge technology deployment continues to progress throughout manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and we are on track with our bit growth and cost-reduction targets. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive improvement in our competitive position in the rest of 2016 and beyond. 
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We believe that the DRAM industry supply growth will be in the low to mid-20% range in 2016, which is consistent with our prior commentary. If wafer output declines in the latter half of the year as some already forecast, we would expect to exit the year on a slower run rate and 2017 bit supply growth could be in the mid to high teens. This compares to our long-term bit demand forecast in the low to mid-20% range. The significant improvements we're seeing in channel pricing are not currently impacting other segments, and as a result, we continue to take a conservative view of the market environment. 
For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid-30% to low 40% range with a similar range in 2017, as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. Over the last several quarters, we've experienced strong demand coupled with aggressive pricing as suppliers have been driving to increased penetration rates and densities. Similar to DRAM, the current channel pricing environment appears to be improving but is not yet significantly impacted across other segments. Our long-term bit demand forecast is in the low 40% range, as lower-cost and higher-performance 3D NAND solutions enter the market. 
From an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key priorities. For DRAM, we successfully achieved our targeted 20-nanometer crossover during fiscal Q3 and also enabled our 1X node in manufacturing. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer DRAM and volume starting in 2017. We are forecasting -- we are still forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth in the 28% to 30% range, which is slightly above the market. We achieved 22% bit growth in fiscal Q3 and expect even stronger bit growth in Q4. 
In light of current market conditions, we have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity. As noted above, we are migrating to advanced technology nodes in order to achieve cost reduction and adjust higher-density designs for mobile, the cloud and enterprise segments. 
For NAND, we continue to make great progress on our Gen1 3D NAND and are reaching maturity yields ahead of expectations. We still expect to achieve 3D bit crossover by this fall, which will allow us to take advantage of the cost benefits that this technology provides. Our second-generation 3D product is also on track with initial production this quarter. Equally exciting is that we expect TLC to be the majority of our 3D bit output within the next few quarters. 
In aggregate, we are forecasting Micron's fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be somewhat below the market in 2016 and somewhat above the market in 2017. 
TLC-enabled 3D NAND technology is a big step forward and a significant driver relative to the progress we expect to make in our NAND business. This technology progress must be complemented by enabling product solutions for key storage and mobile segments. We've outlined the storage product road map, which includes our recently announced client SSDs, followed by cloud drives later this year and enterprise solutions early next year. We're also evaluating a number of mobile product opportunities for 3D NAND in 2017. 
Relative to 3D XPoint, we're working with market enablers across a number of market segments and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success with revenue in 2017 and beyond. Micron has a committed focus on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products for our customers. While we haven't finalized our fiscal year 2017 business plan, we are approaching that plan with prudence and conservatism and carefully reviewing our capital investments and projected operating cash flows to ensure the appropriate balance. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."
289030,346817206,1004230,"Micron Technology, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Micron Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I'll start off by sharing technology and business unit details and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the follo",1599,"Thanks, Mark. I'll start off by sharing technology and business unit details and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. 
DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the mid-20% range. The PC segment represented about 25%. The server business was in the low 20% range. And specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high 20% range. 
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation: Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 55%. Mobile and SSDs each represented approximately 13%. And as a reminder, eMCPs are accounted for in the mobile segment. The automotive, industrial, multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range. 
Moving on, I'll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. Micron's Compute and Networking Business Unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.09 billion, up 4% from the previous quarter, primarily driven by our 20-nanometer shipment growth across all segments and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $63 million or 6% of revenue. 
In the enterprise segment, demand for our 20-nanometer, 32-gigabit DDR4 RDIMM was driven by the launch of Intel's latest server platform. We also saw solid growth in the cloud segment with continued transition to DDR4. 
In graphics, we saw strong growth driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products and are approaching a seasonally strong period for graphics applications, including virtual reality, and expect good performance from this segment for the next quarter. 
In networking, our business was somewhat flat. However, we've made significant progress enabling our 20-nanometer products and also announced our eUSB 3.0 solution. 
Finally, within the client segment, we continued enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer, 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs. 
In Micron's Mobile Business Unit, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $561 million, up 12% from the prior quarter, as we continue to ramp 20-nanometer LPDDR3 and LPDDR4. While the low-density eMCP market is still under pressure, a move to higher-density designs in F Q4 and early FY '17 should help stabilize and improve this segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $17 million or 3% of revenue.
We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter, and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. This work will allow us to more fully ramp our 20-nanometer mobile products in fiscal Q4 and into next year. Both LPDRAM and NAND content continues to increase in mobile devices, which when combined with even modest unit growth, will result in very solid bit consumption. 
In our Embedded Business, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $487 million, up 6% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating income of $107 million or 22% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by continued strength in the automotive and consumer segments, offset by softness in the industrial multi-market segment. 
In our automotive segment, we achieved record revenue, increasing 6% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-on-year. We continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC applications that include infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assist Systems and continue to see strong demand from our EMEA customers, which is more recently complemented by growth in Korea and demand recovery in North America. Our portfolio of leading-edge solutions is enabling major 2018 platform automotive design wins. 
Our industrial multi-market business declined 9% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to global market softness in the manufacturing infrastructure segment. However, we continue to see healthy demand for our NOR and NAND-based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules. 
Our consumer and connected home revenue was up 3% quarter-over-quarter with some softness in the set-top box business, offset by strong demand for NAND and LPDRAM MCPs to support action camera and home-automation applications. As we enter into a seasonally strong period, we expect demand to continue to grow. Customers are also beginning to design in and ramp our 20-nanometer DDR4 products into set-top box applications. 
Micron's Storage Business Unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $719 million, down 20% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $62 million or 9% of revenue. As we transition to lower-cost 3D NAND products, we continue to optimize our product mix. 
In clients and consumer SSD, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 20% as we reduced production of planar NAND-based SSDs while ramping volume production of 3D NAND-based SATA and PCIe clients and consumer SSDs. These new products will enable the company to enhance its competitive position. 
In the enterprise and data center SSD segments, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 10%. As we have previously noted, our 3D NAND solutions will improve our product portfolio in the segment, enabling us to participate more significantly in this important growth business for the company. 
Now looking at the company overall. As Mark noted earlier, revenue for the third quarter was $2.9 billion, which was near the midpoint of our guided range and roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by decreases in selling prices, while trade NAND shipments declined as we are in the middle of a significant conversion from planar to 3D NAND. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 17% within our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $79 million or $0.08 per share, slightly better than the midpoints of our guided range. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.05 per share for the recently completed quarter. 
Now let's look at results by product line. 
DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the second quarter as a result of a 22% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by lower selling prices. As a result of our 20-nanometer ramp and ongoing mobile qualification time line, DRAM finished goods inventory increase during the quarter. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter decreased approximately 2 percentage points to 18%, as decreases in ASPs outpaced significant cost reductions. 
Our nonvolatile trade revenue decreased 15% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a 10% decrease in bit shipments combined with a 6% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 17%, as ASP reductions outpaced cost per bit reductions.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $523 million below our guided range due to the reversal of accrued cost for variable compensation plans, which were suspended in the third quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $389 million, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.7 billion. 
Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion net of partner contributions.
During the quarter, we received approximately $2 billion from the issuance of secured notes and an additional $114 million in equipment financing. Also, we resolved a long-outstanding tax matter, which resulted in a $52 million benefit to the tax line. This benefit was offset by the writeoff of a related $30 million receivable that was reflected as nonoperating expense. 
In the third quarter, we also acquired Photronics' interest in our captive mask operations for $93 million, resulting in 100% ownership of the mask operations.
Moving on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 15.5% to 18%, operating expenses between $580 million and $630 million and operating loss ranging between $135 million and $55 million and an EPS loss ranging between $0.24 and $0.16 per share based on 1,036,000,000 diluted shares. 
Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction that we've previously shared, as we continue to ramp our 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND production. 
In recognition of the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on the company's key priorities, we plan to implement the cost-saving program, which we expect will save the company approximately $80 million per quarter in fiscal 2017. The savings will result from a combination of our more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a material number of open headcount requisition and a workforce reduction in certain areas of the business as well as other non-headcount-related spending reductions. About half of these savings will appear in the gross margin line of the company, while the remainder will be reflected in operating expenses. These savings are baseline against our previously planned 2017 fiscal spend levels. 
We expect to take reserves approximating $70 million for the cost of this program, a majority of which will occur in fiscal Q4 with the remainder in the early part of fiscal 2017. As we complete our fiscal 2017 planning process, we are mindful of the need to effectively balance period spending, CapEx and free cash flow, and we continue to explore other opportunities to improve the company's financial performance. 
Finally, at this time, we don't have any new information to share relative to Inotera. As we stated in our press release, the transaction will not be closing in mid-July, and we expect to provide an update during the latter part of the calendar year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

We've got -- I think we've done a good job on the 20-nanometer ramp, and we'll continue to see some improvement for that as we move through the next quarter.

So we've got a lot of good tailwinds. We're -- we also articulated we're making a lot of good progress on qualifying and resegmenting those more advanced technology nodes in the right market segments.

And as Mark mentioned a couple of times, we really are wanting to provide prudent guidance in the context of an environment that's moving around very, very significantly. The other point I would make is it is absolutely true that we are seeing strong bit growth and cost reductions on the DRAM side. Remember that we said the majority of the NAND cost reductions occur as we achieve that big crossover, which is later in the fall of this year.

For fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin is 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share. Both revenue and gross margin were at the high end of the guidance range and together gene",1309,"Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin is 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share. Both revenue and gross margin were at the high end of the guidance range and together generated earnings per share that exceeded guidance. Operating cash flow was $896 million. 
On the last call, we reported that while we were seeing signs of improvement in selected markets, we were uncertain of the extent and the duration of the improvements. During the quarter, we continue to see market conditions improve, driven by both supply and demand fundamentals. Industry inventory appears lean, and the current market outlook for both NAND and DRAM continues to be positive. Currently, prices are increasing in a number of segments, stabilizing in others and we're seeing fewer segments showing residual declines. This environment framed our thinking of the guidance that Ernie will provide a little later on. 
We made significant progress on a number of key initiatives in the quarter, including the completion of the mobile product qualifications that we have been discussing here, and our early 1X nanometer DRAM deployment. We were also seeing the benefits of the 3D NAND yield ramp, which generated strong-than-expected NAND bit growth in the quarter. 
I'm going to provide a high-level overview of each of the business units, and Ernie will follow with more details on each business's financial performance.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we experienced accelerating revenue growth in the face of moderating pricing environment. Revenue growth was driven by continued increases of 20-nanometer shipments as well as a significant transition to DDR4 in the cloud and client segments, where shipments exceeded DDR3 for the first time. We saw ongoing strength in graphics, driven by our GDDR5 and 5X products we supported in Vegas introduction of the 5X-based [indiscernible], the highest performance consumer graphics card in the market. 
In the enterprise segment, Micron was recognized at the Flash Memory Summit as the innovation leader in nonvolatile BIMs and an important solution for high-performance servers. 
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. China's becoming a more significant growth driver in the mobile -- and mobile devices. Most of these devices are differentiated by large amounts of memory, including up to 6 gigabytes of low-power DRAM. Additionally, the top-of-the-line Apple and Samsung models now ship with 256 gigabytes of NAND, and we see midrange Chinese handsets heading in the same direction in order to compete. Although there is a moderating pace of smartphone unit growth, significant content increases of both NAND and DRAM will generate strong overall bit growth.
During the quarter, we introduced 4 new mid- to high-density mobile 3D NAND products, with positive reviews from the press and from our customer base. Mobile DRAM and eMCP declines moderated in the quarter, with more recent signs of stabilization and increases. Revenue growth in our Embedded Business Unit has been driven by a record automotive business and increased performance in the consumer and connected home segments as well as a strengthening industrial multi-market business during the quarter. We have maintained our leadership position in automotive through strong customer support and introduction of new products that meet the fast-growing memory content requirements through infotainment, apps and instrument cluster applications. High-temperature DRAM and automotive-grade NAND products are enabling a strong design win pipeline. 
The introduction of several new industrial solutions has positioned us to grow our share within IMM and retain our high market share in machine-to-machine communication modules as the industry migrates from 2G to 4G and LTE. We have also been successful in achieving strong market share positions in consumer applications from action cameras and home automation to high-volume markets, including digital TV and set-top boxes. 
Finally, our Storage Business Unit is continuing to transition this product line to our leading-edge 3D NAND technology. We've seen positive response from customers of this quarter related to our refreshed SSD portfolio, which offers a breadth of solutions to meet diverse application requirements. We're finalizing qualification with 8 major OEMs on our 1,100-client drive and are engaging with cloud customers on future designs. In the enterprise, we're seeing companies begin to retrofit HDD infrastructures with SaaS SSDs as these modernize existing investments. Our customers and demanding sectors like financial services and energy are moving closer to server. We've seen significant interest in our PCIE NVMe drives in these applications due to their ability to deliver very consistent high performance. 
We are actively expanding TLC 3D NAND across our cloud and enterprise portfolio and expect to introduce our first TLC 3D SATA drive for these markets later this year, followed by a server-focused version early next year. We expect to see positive supply and demand dynamics in the SSD market for 2017. 
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We've seen further evidence that DRAM wafer output is declining as a result of lost throughput related to the 20-nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions. Absence some replacement of these wafers, we could see industry supply growth as low as mid-teens in 2017. And some of the wafer output is replaced industry supply growth could be in the high teens percent range. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-20% range.
For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-40% range. 
Despite significant investments in 3D conversions across the industry, we believe that 2017 supply growth will be relatively balanced with demand, given the disruption in the fab output related to these conversions. 
For our operational priorities for fiscal 2017, where our operational priorities for fiscal 2017 continue to be targeted at ramping advanced technologies with an added focus on building out a more robust product portfolio, in particular, for nonvolatile memory products. For DRAM, we begin the 1X nanometer ramp and expect to have meaningful output by the middle of 2017. 
At our winter Analyst Day, we shared 2-year bit growth targets for DRAM, and we are on track to  meet these targets. We were slightly below the range in fiscal 2017 and expect to be above the range in fiscal 2017. All of the DRAM bit growth will come from technology transitions, and we currently have no plans to add wafer capacity. 
We expect our fiscal 2017 DRAM cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of completing the 20-nanometer migration and initiating the 1X nanometer conversion. 
Our cash cost per bit declines will be meaningfully higher than this range. 
For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our general 1 3D as well as TLC. As we updated at our last analyst meeting, 3D bit output will exceed 2D output in the current quarter, ahead of our initial target. We will also be working on deploying second-generation 64-layer 3D technology. 
Similar to DRAM, our 2016 NAND bit growth came in below the 2-year CAGR shared at our analyst event, and we therefore expect 2017 to be above that range. We are forecasting our fiscal 2017 NAND cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of the 3D and TLC conversions. This cost per bit includes the impact of our planned buildout of SSDs, eMCPs and managed NAND solutions, all of which carry additional materials costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix. 
On a like-for-like basis, cost per bit will decline more substantially.
Relative to 3D Crosspoint technology, we're working with market enablers on adoption of our solutions and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success with initial revenue later in 2017.
Now I'd like to turn the mic over to Ernie."

We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution, coupled with a more favorable business environment, resulted in improved financial performance. I'll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit",1716,"Thank you, Mark. We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution, coupled with a more favorable business environment, resulted in improved financial performance. I'll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit details, followed by an overview of the company's results for the quarter and guidance for our first fiscal quarter 2017. 
DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: mobile represented about 25%, similar to the prior quarter; the PC segment was in the upper 20% range, up slightly from the prior quarter; server business was in the high teens percent range, down from the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 30% range, up from the prior quarter and primarily driven by an increasing graphics, which represented more than 10% for the quarter. 
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation: consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 50%, down slightly from the prior quarter; mobile was in the high teens percent range, up from 13% in the prior quarter, as we began to see the impact of our completed customer calls. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs represented 13%, similar to last quarter, and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range, similar to prior quarters. 
Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.25 billion, up 14% sequentially, primarily driven by 20-nanometer shipment growth, accompanied by strengthening demand and a moderating pricing environment across all segments. The non-GAAP operating loss was $7 million or less than 1% of revenue. In the enterprise segment, conversions to DDR4 are now largely complete, and we are focused on enabling our solutions for the next-generation server platform. We are seeing continued interest in both higher-density RDIMMs and and LRDIMMs as well as NVDIMM solutions. The cloud component of the enterprise segment is growing quickly, driven by continued growth in density across both DDR3 and DDR4 solutions. 
In graphics, we saw growth well above typical seasonality, driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products. There are additional G5X-based product announcements for NVIDIA in both the graphics workstation segments during the quarter. 
In networking, we enjoyed revenue growth with strength across all regions and growing interest in applying the high-bandwidth capabilities of GDDR5 and GDDR5X to the networking segment. 
Finally, within the client segment, we saw market demand which exceeded our expectations as well as a continued transition to DDR4, which, for the first, represented the majority of client shipments. The Mobile Business Unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $671 million, up 20% sequentially, driven by a strong quarter in our eMCP products. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 7% of revenue and was partially impacted by the consumption of higher cost early production inventory accumulated over the last 2 quarters. We saw significant growth in the recently qualified higher-density MCPs as smartphone OEMs are positioning their products based on higher memory density specifications, which is helping to accelerate adoption of smartphones with richer memory content. 
The Embedded Business Unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $513 million, up 5% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $133 million or 26% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by record automotive and increasing consumer business, combined with some recovery in our industrial multi-market business. 
The automotive business delivered solid results with revenue up 6% sequentially, driven by strong and increasing demand for both DRAM and eMMC solutions for infotainment instrument cluster and advanced driver systems applications. European, Korean and Japanese customers continued to feel this growth, and our portfolio of leading edge automotive-grade solutions is continuing to enable platform design wins. The industrial and multi-market business increased 16% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our NOR- and NAND-based MCP issues in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules. 
Consumer and connected home revenue was up 7% sequentially, with solid demand for MCPs used in action cameras and home automation applications. We continue to see this demand pattern continue in the current fiscal quarter, which typically sees strong seasonal demand. Our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into set-top boxes and IMM applications. 
The Storage business delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $758 million, up 5% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $69 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we entered production and OEM qualification of TLC 3D NAND-based SSDs in the client and consumer segment, providing customers with a refreshed 3D based portfolio as storage products had spanned the demand spectrum in these markets. 
In the enterprise SSD segment, consecutive quarter bits sold were up 45% based on higher sales of our planar MOC-based cloud drive. We are deploying 3D TLC across the enterprise and cloud portfolio with several product launches over the next 2 [ph] quarters.
Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $3.2 billion at the top end of our guidance range and up 11% sequentially. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by moderating ASP declines, while trade NAND shipments increased as a result of early success of our 3D ramp. And we experienced generally stable ASPs. Gross margin for the quarter was 18%, also at the top end of our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $56 million or $0.05 per share, significantly better than our guidance. 
For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP profitability despite our technology transition and memory market pricing pressure achieving non-GAAP net income of $66 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, Micron included both amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock compensation expense in our fiscal Q4 non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.04 a share in the fourth fiscal quarter and $0.20 per share for the full 2016 fiscal year.
Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 13% compared to the prior quarter as a result of the 20% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a 6% decrease in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter increased 2 percentage points to 20%, primarily driven by strong cost reductions as a result of the continued 20-nanometer ramp. Our nonvolatile trade revenue increased 12% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 13% increase in bit shipment, partially offset by a 1% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 16% as cost per bit was up related to the 3D RAM and buildout of higher cost storage in mobile solutions to support future growth. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $559 million [ph]. This was below our guidance, primarily due to continued expense control and the timing of prequalification expenses for the fourth quarter, some of which will now occur in fiscal Q1. The company generated operating cash flow of $896 million, which included a strong quarter for collection activity, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately  $4.8 billion. 
In the fourth fiscal quarter, capital expenditures, net of partner contributions, were approximately $1.7 billion.
Before we move on to our guidance for the upcoming quarter, I wanted to share some changes to our reporting. The first of these changes relates to the depreciation schedule for our DRAM capital equipment. Previously, this equipment had been depreciated over 5 years. However, given the longer intervals between technology transitions, we have changed the depreciable life of our DRAM capital equipment from 5 years to 7 years. This change will reduce depreciation by approximately $100 million per quarter on a going-forward basis. The depreciation schedule for NAND-related equipment remains unchanged. Additionally, and to be consistent with the majority of semiconductor companies who report non-GAAP results, Micron will exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from our non-GAAP reporting. These expenses, on average, are approximately $50 million per quarter. 
Moving on now to our guidance for the first fiscal quarter, which we developed in the context of the market environment that Mark described earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion; gross margin in the range of 23% to 25.5%; operating expenses between $600 million and $650 million due to the resumption of variable compensation expense and the higher pre-call expenses that we spoke of earlier. Taken together, these items represent a sequential increase of approximately $80 million of which $25 million resulted from the timing of pre-call between fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1. Operating income in the range of $245 million to $330 million and EPS ranging between $0.13 and $0.21 per share based on 1,046,000,000 diluted shares. Relative to our capital spending plans for fiscal '17, as we shared last month, we expect to spend between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion, net of partner contributions. Between 40% and 50% of the total will be allocated to DRAM, between 30% and 40% to nonvolatile memory and between 15% and 25% to technology and product enablement. Consistent with our public comments, this level of CapEx allows us to appropriately fund our technology investments while achieving neutral to positive free cash flow generation in fiscal 2017. Operationally, we are on track to deliver the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that we previously shared as we complete the 20-nanometer DRAM conversion, reach crossover of first-generation 3D NAND this quarter and commence the ramp of 1X nanometer DRAM and second-generation 3D NAND in 2017. 
For FY '17, specifically, we expect DRAM and NAND cost per bit reductions between 20% and 25%. 
Finally, relative to the Inotera transaction, Micron and Inotera have concluded that sufficient progress has been made in Inotera addressing the issues that caused the delay in closing. An Inotera board meeting has been scheduled for October 11, and the directors of Inotera are expected to study shares swap record date at that meeting. We anticipate that the share swap record date will be set for the first half of December 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

So I think it's important to acknowledge that although we beat our EPS guidance, we actually were well in the ranges of both our revenue and our gross margin guidance. And so we did think about the opportunity that was ahead of ourselves as we were giving the guidance for last quarter, and we've done the same thing, in essence, this quarter as well. So I think you can look at the range of our guidance, and it generally contemplates the outcomes that we see. And obviously, if things continue on a strong and favorable momentum, it's reasonable to think that you'd end up at the upper end of both pieces of the range, which would generate a result similar to this quarter. And I think consistent with Mark's prior comments, we are continuing to see positive momentum. I do think it's important to understand that, that momentum has existed and has started to strengthen. And so as a result of its actual impact in our fiscal quarter, with part of it already completed and we're in negotiations for others, I think that the trap we want to avoid is presuming that whatever the latest pricing news is gets retroactively applied across the entire quarter because that's certainly not the environment that we're living in. But I do think we were pretty thoughtful about the revenue range. And obviously, we're going to work hard and try to do as well as we can. But we put a lot of thought behind the numbers we just shared with you."

And then secondly, we have -- we had, even prior to this rollover, the highest point of pre-call expenses for the entire fiscal year was actually occurring in Q1, plus we have the resumption of variable compensation, given the new pricing environment. And so what we've tried to frame for folks is sequentially, between the variable comp being reinstated as well as the pre-call expenses, that the sequential increase of about $80 million from F Q4 to F Q1. So that predominantly explains the change to the OpEx. And it certainly -- we're hopeful that the variable compensation piece continues because we're hopeful that the business environment is favorable. And we would expect pre-call expenses to moderate such that we should be in that range of 600, plus or minus, so probably midpoint around 600, a few quarters, maybe a couple of quarters higher, a couple of quarters a little bit lower, under the new framework for recording OpEx. So those numbers would still exclude stock-based comp, but you would expect to see a pretty meaningful moderation of OpEx as we go forward throughout the year as a result of this pre-call situation being resolved from the rollover."

Obviously, we're in the middle of a very significant portfolio sort of change-out, and we have to execute on those. So far, record has been good with respect to the client and consumer segments. But we have some big product launches with respect to both data center and enterprise coming up here toward the end of this calendar year and in early calendar '17, and those would be really pivotal to us in completing that transition. I think that, again, track record has been good. The SSDs have been well-reviewed, and we're very optimistic that our subsequent product launches will be equally successful. I also think it's important to keep in mind that we also are seeing the benefit of 3D in the memory -- or, I'm sorry, in the Mobile Business Unit as well. We saw that we had the mobile percentage of our NAND business this quarter move from the low teens essentially to the high teens as a result of more and more calls there and the increasing importance of the MCP portfolio. So we are seeing the benefit of that really across multiple business units."

For fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin is 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share.

For fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin is 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share. Both revenue and gross margin were at the high end of the guidance range and together, generated earnings per share that exceeded guidance. Operating cash flow was $896 million.
On the last call, we reported that while we were seeing signs of improvement in selected markets, we were uncertain of the extent and the duration of the improvements. During the quarter, we continue to see market conditions improve, driven by both supply and demand fundamentals. Industry inventory appears lean, and the current market outlook for both NAND and DRAM continues to be positive. Currently, prices are increasing in a number of segments, stabilizing in others, and we're seeing fewer segments showing residual declines. This environment framed our thinking on the guidance that Ernie will provide a little later on.
We made significant progress on a number of key initiatives in the quarter, including the completion of the mobile product qualifications that we had been discussing and our early 1X nanometer DRAM deployment. We were also seeing the benefits of the 3D NAND yield ramp, which generated stronger-than-expected NAND bit growth in the quarter. I'm going to provide a high-level overview of each of the business units, and Ernie will follow with more details on each business' financial performance.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we experienced accelerating revenue growth in the face of moderating pricing environment. Revenue growth was driven by continued increases of 20-nanometer shipments as well as a significant transition to DDR4 in the cloud and client segments, where shipments exceeded DDR3 for the first time. We saw ongoing strength in graphics, driven by our GDDR5 and 5X products. We supported NVIDIA's introduction of the 5X-based TITAN X, the highest performance consumer graphics card in the market.
In the enterprise segment, Micron was recognized at the Flash Memory Summit as the innovation leader in non-volatile DIMMs and important solution for high-performance servers.
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. China's becoming a more significant growth driver in the mobile -- in mobile devices. Most of these devices are differentiated by large amounts of memory, including up to 6 gigabytes of low-power DRAM. Additionally, the ""top of the line"" Apple and Samsung models now ship with 256 gigabytes of NAND, and we see mid-range Chinese handsets heading in the same direction in order to compete. Although there is a moderating pace of smartphone unit growth, significant content increases of both NAND and DRAM will generate strong overall bit growth. During the quarter, we introduced 4 new mid- to high-density mobile 3D NAND products with positive reviews from the press and from our customer base. Mobile DRAM and eMCP price declines moderated in the quarter with more recent signs of stabilization and increases.
Revenue growth in our Embedded Business Unit has been driven by a record automotive business and increased performance in the consumer and connected home segments as well as a strengthening industrial multi-market business during the quarter. We have maintained our leadership position in automotive through strong customer support and the introduction of new products that meet the fast growing memory content requirements for infotainment, ADAS and instrument cluster applications. High-temperature DRAM and automotive-grade NAND products are enabling a strong design win pipeline.
The introduction of several new industrial solutions has positioned us to grow our share within IMM and retain our high market share in machine-to-machine communication modules as the industry migrates from 2G to 4G and LTE. We have also been successful in achieving strong market share positions in consumer applications from action cameras and home automation to high-volume markets, including digital TV and set-top boxes.
Finally, our Storage Business Unit is continuing to transition its product line to our leading-edge 3D NAND technology. We've seen positive response from customers this quarter related to our refreshed SSD portfolio, which offers a breadth of solutions to meet diverse application requirements. We're finalizing qualification with 8 major OEMs on our 1,100-client drive and are engaging with cloud customers on future designs. In the enterprise, we're seeing companies begin to retrofit HDD infrastructures with SaaS SSDs as these modernize existing investments. Our customers and demanding sectors like financial services and energy are moving storage closer to the server. We've seen significant interest in our PCIe, NVMe drives in these applications due to their ability to deliver very consistent high performance. 
We are actively extending TLC 3D NAND across our cloud and enterprise portfolio and expect to introduce our first TLC 3D SATA drive for these markets later this year followed by a server-focused version early next year. We expect to see positive supply-and-demand dynamics in the SSD market for 2017.
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We've seen further evidence that DRAM wafer output is declining as a result of lost throughput related to the 20-nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions. Absent some replacement of these wafers, we could see industry supply growth as low as mid-teens in 2017. If some of the lost wafer output is replaced, industry supply growth could be in the high teens percent range. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-20% range.
For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-40% range.  Despite significant investments in 3D conversions across the industry, we believe that 2017 supply growth will be relatively balanced with demand given the disruption in the fab output related to these conversions.
For our operational priorities for fiscal 2017 -- or our operational priorities for fiscal 2017 continue to be targeted at ramping advanced technologies with an added focus on building out a more robust product portfolio, in particular, for non-volatile memory products. For DRAM, we begin the 1X nanometer ramp and expect to have meaningful output by the middle of 2017.
At our winter Analyst Day, we shared 2-year bit growth targets for DRAM, and we are on track to meet these targets. We were slightly below the range in fiscal 2017 and expect to be above the range in fiscal 2017. All of the DRAM bit growth will come from technology transitions, and we currently have no plans to add wafer capacity. We expect our fiscal 2017 DRAM cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of completing the 20-nanometer migration and initiating the 1X nanometer conversion. Our cash cost per bit declines will be meaningfully higher than this range.
For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen 1 3D as well as TLC. As we updated at our last Analyst Meeting, 3D bit output will exceed 2D output in the current quarter ahead of our initial target. We will also be working on deploying second-generation 64-layer 3D technology.
Similar to DRAM, our 2016 NAND bit growth came in below the 2-year CAGR shared at our analyst event, and we therefore expect 2017 to be above that range. We are forecasting our fiscal 2017 NAND cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of the 3D and TLC conversions. This cost per bit includes the impact of our planned build-out of SSDs, eMCPs and managed NAND solutions, all of which carry additional bill-of-materials cost but will also enable a richer ASP mix. On a like-for-like basis, cost per bit will decline more substantially.
Relative to 3D XPoint technology, we're working with market enablers on adoption of our QuantX solutions and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success with initial revenue later in 2017.
Now I'd like to turn the mic over to Ernie."

We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution, coupled with a more favorable business environment, resulted in improved financial performance. I'll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit",1719,"Thank you, Mark. We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution, coupled with a more favorable business environment, resulted in improved financial performance. I'll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's results for the quarter and guidance for our first fiscal quarter 2017.
DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile represented about 25%, similar to the prior quarter; The PC segment was in the upper 20% range, up slightly from the prior quarter; Server business was in the high teens percent range, down from the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 30% range, up from the prior quarter and primarily driven by an increasing graphics, which represented more than 10% for the quarter.
In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation: Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 50%, down slightly from the prior quarter; Mobile was in the high teens percent range, up from 13% in the prior quarter as we began to see the impact of our completed customer quals. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs represented 13%, similar to last quarter; and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range, similar to prior quarter.
Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.25 billion, up 14% sequentially, primarily driven by 20-nanometer shipment growth accompanied by strengthening demand in a moderating pricing environment across all segments. The non-GAAP operating loss was $7 million or less than 1% of revenue.
In the enterprise segment, conversions to DDR4 are now largely complete, and we are focused on enabling our solutions for the next-generation server platform. We are seeing continued interest in both higher-density RDIMMs and LRDIMMs as well as NVDIMM solutions. The cloud component of the enterprise segment is growing quickly, driven by continued growth in density across both DDR3 and DDR4 solutions.
In graphics, we saw a growth well above typical seasonality driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products. There are additional G5X-based product announcements for NVIDIA in both the graphics and workstation segments during the quarter.
In networking, we enjoyed double-digit revenue growth with strength across all regions and growing interest in applying the high-bandwidth capabilities of GDDR5 and GDDR5X to the networking segment. Finally, within the client segment, we saw market demand, which exceeded our expectations as well as a continued transition to DDR4, which, for the first time, represented the majority of client shipments.
The Mobile Business Unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $671 million, up 20% sequentially, driven by a strong quarter in our eMCP products. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 7% of revenue and was partially impacted by the consumption of higher cost early production inventory accumulated over the last 2 quarters. We saw significant growth in the recently qualified higher-density MCPs and -- as smartphone OEMs are positioning their products based on higher memory density specifications, which is helping to accelerate adoption of smartphones with richer memory content.
The Embedded Business Unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $513 million, up 5% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $133 million or 26% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by record automotive and increasing consumer business combined with some recovery in our industrial multi-market business.
The automotive business delivered solid results with revenue up 6% sequentially, driven by strong and increasing demand for both DRAM and eMMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems applications. European, Korean and Japanese customers continued to feel this growth, and our portfolio of leading-edge, automotive-grade solutions is continuing to enable platform design wins.
The industrial and multi-market business increased 16% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our NOR- and NAND-based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules.
Consumer and connected home revenue was up 7% sequentially with solid demand for MCPs used in action cameras and home automation applications. We continued to see this demand pattern continue in the current fiscal quarter, which typically sees strong seasonal demand. Our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into set-top boxes and IMM applications.
The Storage business delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $758 million, up 5% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $69 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we entered production and OEM qualification of TLC 3D NAND-based SSDs in the client and consumer segment, providing customers with a refreshed 3D-based portfolio of storage products that span the demand spectrum in these markets.
In the enterprise SSD segment, consecutive quarter bits sold were up 45% based on higher sales of our planar MLC-based cloud drive. We are deploying 3D TLC across the enterprise and cloud portfolio with several product launches over the next 2 quarters.
Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $3.2 billion, at the top end of our guidance range and up 11% sequentially. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by moderating ASP declines, while trade NAND shipments increased as a result of early success of our 3D ramp. And we experienced generally stable ASPs. Gross margin for the quarter was 18%, also at the top end of our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $56 million or $0.05 per share, significantly better than our guidance.
For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP profitability despite our technology transition and memory market pricing pressure achieving non-GAAP net income of $66 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, Micron included both amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock compensation expense in our fiscal Q4 non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.04 a share in the fourth fiscal quarter and $0.20 per share for the full 2016 fiscal year.
Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 13% compared to the prior quarter as a result of the 20% increase in bit shipments partially offset by a 6% decrease in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter increased 2 percentage points to 20%, primarily driven by strong cost reductions as a result of the continued 20-nanometer ramp.
Our non-volatile trade revenue increased 12% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 13% increase in bit shipment partially offset by a 1% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 16% as cost per bit was up related to the 3D ramp and build-out of higher-cost storage and mobile solutions to support future growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $559 million. This was below our guidance primarily due to continued expense control and the timing of prequalification expenses for the fourth quarter. Some of which will now occur in fiscal Q1. The company generated operating cash flow of $896 million, which included a strong quarter for collection activity, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.8 billion. In the fourth fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.7 billion.
Before we move on to our guidance for the upcoming quarter, I wanted to share some changes to our reporting. The first of these changes relates to the depreciation schedule for our DRAM capital equipment. Previously, this equipment had been depreciated over 5 years. However, given the longer intervals between technology transitions, we have changed the depreciable life of our DRAM capital equipment from 5 years to 7 years. This change will reduce depreciation by approximately $100 million per quarter on a going forward basis. The depreciation schedule for NAND-related equipment remains unchanged.
Additionally and to be consistent with the majority of semiconductor companies who report non-GAAP results, Micron will exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from our non-GAAP reporting. These expenses, on average, are approximately $50 million per quarter.
Moving on now to our guidance for the first fiscal quarter, which we developed in the context of the market environment that Mark described earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, gross margin in the range of 23% to 25.5%, operating expenses between $600 million and $650 million due to the resumption of variable compensation expense and the higher pre-qual expenses that we spoke of earlier. Taken together, these items represent a sequential increase of approximately $80 million, of which $25 million resulted from the timing of pre-qual between fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1. Operating income in the range of $245 million to $330 million, and EPS ranging between $0.13 and $0.21 per share based on 1,046,000,000 diluted shares. Relative to our capital spending plans for fiscal '17, as we shared last month, we expect to spend between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion net of partner contributions. Between 40% and 50% of the total will be allocated to DRAM, between 30% and 40% to non-volatile memory, and between 15% and 25% to technology and product enablement. Consistent with our public comments, this level of CapEx allows us to appropriately fund our technology investments while achieving neutral to positive free cash flow generation in fiscal 2017. 
Operationally, we are on track to deliver the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that we've previously shared as we complete the 20-nanometer DRAM conversion, reach crossover of first-generation 3D NAND this quarter and commence the ramp of 1X nanometer DRAM and second-generation 3D NAND in 2017. For FY '17 specifically, we expect DRAM and NAND cost per bit reductions between 20% and 25%.
Finally, relative to the Inotera transaction, Micron and Inotera have concluded that sufficient progress has been made in Inotera addressing the issues that caused the delay in closing. An Inotera board meeting has been scheduled for October 11, and the directors of Inotera are expected to set a share swap record date at that meeting. We anticipate that the share swap record date will be set for the first half of December 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

And so we did think about the opportunity that was ahead of ourselves as we were giving the guidance for last quarter, and we've done the same thing, in essence, this quarter as well. So I think you can look at the range of our guidance, and it generally contemplates the outcomes that we see. And obviously, if things continue on a strong and favorable momentum, it's reasonable to think that you'd end up at the upper end of both pieces of the range, which would generate a result similar to this quarter. And I think consistent with Mark's prior comments, we are continuing to see positive momentum. I do think it's important to understand that, that momentum has existed and has started to strengthen. And so as a result of its actual impact in our fiscal quarter with part of it already completed and we're in negotiations for others, I think that the trap we want to avoid is presuming that whatever the latest pricing news is gets retroactively applied across the entire quarter because that's certainly not the environment that we're living in. But I do think we were pretty thoughtful about the revenue range, and obviously, we're going to work hard and try to do as well as we can.

I guess, if you add the stock comp back and you assume that it's mostly OpEx, you're guiding to, like, $650 million to $700 million. But it sounds like maybe $80 million of that is really onetime in nature, so maybe the baseline is more like $600 million going into next quarter. Is that -- or, sorry, going into the fiscal Q2. Is that the right run rate headed into the January quarter?"

We had a couple of things that are impacting this quarter's OpEx. The first was that about $25 million, give or take, are pre-qual expenses that we had planned to spend in F Q4 are appearing in F Q1. And then secondly, we have -- we had, even prior to this rollover, the highest point of pre-qual expenses for the entire fiscal year was actually occurring in Q1, plus we have the resumption of variable compensation given the new pricing environment. And so what we've tried to frame for folks is sequentially, between the variable comp being reinstated as well as the pre-qual expenses, that's a sequential increase of about $80 million from F Q4 to F Q1. So that predominantly explains the change to the OpEx. And then certainly we're hopeful that the variable compensation piece continues because we're hopeful that the business environment is favorable. And we would expect pre-qual expenses to moderate such that we should be in that range of 600, plus or minus, so probably midpoint around 600, a few quarters, maybe a couple of quarters higher, a couple of quarters a little bit lower, under the new framework for recording OpEx. So those numbers would still exclude stock-based comp, but you would expect to see a pretty meaningful moderation of OpEx as we go forward throughout the year as a result of this pre-qual situation being resolved from the rollover."

First, as we've talked about in the last quarter or so, as we are ramping on the new technologies and predominantly because of these delayed mobile calls, we had some inventory built up that is now flowing through. However, we absolutely still continue to get more and more output from the factory, and it's going to be a couple of quarters before that inventory actually starts to decline. But we have a very clear view of an ability to decrease inventory meaningfully over the course of fiscal '17. I'd also remind you that we are also building supply chains for SSDs and MCPs which take longer in terms of their aggregate end-to-end cycle time than selling components. So we have that effect as well. That will cap out here in the next quarter or so, and then you'll see a normalization and a flow-through of that as well.

I think you put your finger on a piece of it which is that the volatility in this business, I think, we can conclude, is going to be less going forward. This certainly seems to have been borne out as we move through this last cycle. It doesn't mean that cycles are gone, it just means that the volatility is less. And so that is less of a defensive driver, so to speak. An important thing for us in this whole picture is operational flexibility and control. As we're thinking about our ability to drive new technologies, either into manufacturing or to transition technologies with the Inotera assets, having ownership of that asset and the ability to mix and match different technologies as well as potentially more value-add products and capture that value significant, notwithstanding the fact we had a good operating relationship with Inotera, we believe that there's more value we can bring as sole owners than as board members and operational partners. And at the end of the day, it gives us the ability as well to take cash flow that's going to be generated with Inotera and deploy it across our network where we could find that most useful. So a number of different factors playing into it, all of which, I think, point to the direction that we're moving."

For Fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin is 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share.

For Fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin is 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share. Both revenue and gross margin were at the high end of the guidance range and together, generated earnings per share that exceeded guidance. Operating cash flow was $896 million.
On the last call, we reported that while we were seeing signs of improvement in selected markets, we were uncertain of the extent and the duration of the improvements. During the quarter, we continue to see market conditions improve, driven by both supply and demand fundamentals. Industry inventory appears lean, and the current market outlook for both NAND and DRAM continues to be positive. Currently, prices are increasing in a number of segments, stabilizing in others, and we're seeing fewer segments showing residual declines. This environment framed our thinking on the guidance that Ernie will provide a little later on.
We made significant progress on a number of key initiatives in the quarter, including the completion of the mobile product qualifications that we had been discussing and our early 1X nanometer DRAM deployment. We were also seeing the benefits of the 3D NAND yield ramp, which generated stronger-than-expected NAND bit growth in the quarter. I'm going to provide a high-level overview of each of the business units, and Ernie will follow with more details on each business' financial performance.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we experienced accelerating revenue growth in the face of moderating pricing environment. Revenue growth was driven by continued increases of 20-nanometer shipments as well as a significant transition to DDR4 in the cloud and client segments, where shipments exceeded DDR3 for the first time. We saw ongoing strength in graphics, driven by our GDDR5 and 5X products. We supported NVIDIA's introduction of the 5X-based TITAN X, the highest performance consumer graphics card in the market.
In the enterprise segment, Micron was recognized at the Flash Memory Summit as the innovation leader in non-volatile DIMMs; an important solution for high-performance servers.
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. China's becoming a more significant growth driver in the mobile -- in mobile devices. Most of these devices are differentiated by large amounts of memory, including up to 6 gigabytes of low-power DRAM. Additionally, the ""top of the line"" Apple and Samsung models now ship with 256 gigabytes of NAND, and we see mid-range Chinese handsets heading in the same direction in order to compete. Although there is a moderating pace of smartphone unit growth, significant content increases of both NAND and DRAM will generate strong overall bit growth. During the quarter, we introduced 4 new mid- to high-density mobile 3D NAND products with positive reviews from the press and from our customer base. Mobile DRAM and eMCP price declines moderated in the quarter with more recent signs of stabilization and increases.
Revenue growth in our Embedded Business Unit has been driven by a record automotive business and increased performance in the consumer and connected home segments as well as a strengthening industrial multi-market business during the quarter. We have maintained our leadership position in automotive through strong customer support and the introduction of new products that meet the fast growing memory content requirements for infotainment, ADAS and instrument cluster applications. High-temperature DRAM and automotive-grade NAND products are enabling a strong design win pipeline.
The introduction of several new industrial solutions has positioned us to grow our share within IMM and retain our high market share in machine-to-machine communication modules as the industry migrates from 2G to 4G and LTE. We have also been successful in achieving strong market share positions in consumer applications from action cameras and home automation to high-volume markets, including digital TV and set-top boxes.
Finally, our Storage Business Unit is continuing to transition its product line to our leading-edge 3D NAND technology. We've seen positive response from customers this quarter related to our refreshed SSD portfolio, which offers a breadth of solutions to meet diverse application requirements. We're finalizing qualification with 8 major OEMs on our 1,100-client drive and are engaging with cloud customers on future designs. In the enterprise, we're seeing companies begin to retrofit HDD infrastructures with SaaS SSDs as they modernize existing investments. Our customers in demanding sectors like financial services and energy are moving storage closer to the server. We've seen significant interest in our PCIe, NVMe drives in these applications due to their ability to deliver very consistent high performance. 
We are actively extending TLC 3D NAND across our cloud and enterprise portfolio and expect to introduce our first TLC 3D SATA drive for these markets later this year followed by a server-focused version early next year. We expect to see positive supply-and-demand dynamics in the SSD market for 2017.
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We've seen further evidence that DRAM wafer output is declining as a result of lost throughput related to the 20-nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions. Absent some replacement of these wafers, we could see industry supply growth as low as mid-teens in 2017. If some of the lost wafer output is replaced, industry supply growth could be in the high teens percent range. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-20% range.
For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-40% range.  Despite significant investments in 3D conversions across the industry, we believe that 2017 supply growth will be relatively balanced with demand given the disruption in the fab output related to these conversions.
For our operational priorities for fiscal 2017 -- or our operational priorities for Fiscal 2017 continue to be targeted at ramping advanced technologies with an added focus on building out a more robust product portfolio, in particular, for non-volatile memory products. For DRAM, we begin the 1X nanometer ramp and expect to have meaningful output by the middle of 2017.
At our winter Analyst Day, we shared 2-year bit growth targets for DRAM, and we are on track to meet these targets. We were slightly below the range in Fiscal 2017 (sic) (2016)and expect to be above the range in Fiscal 2017. All of the DRAM bit growth will come from technology transitions, and we currently have no plans to add wafer capacity. We expect our Fiscal 2017 DRAM cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of completing the 20-nanometer migration and initiating the 1X nanometer conversion. Our cash cost per bit declines will be meaningfully higher than this range.
For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen 1 3D as well as TLC. As we updated at our last Analyst Meeting, 3D bit output will exceed 2D output in the current quarter, ahead of our initial target. We will also be working on deploying second-generation 64-layer 3D technology.
Similar to DRAM, our 2016 NAND bit growth came in below the 2-year CAGR shared at our analyst event, and we therefore expect 2017 to be above that range. We are forecasting our Fiscal 2017 NAND cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of the 3D and TLC conversions. This cost per bit includes the impact of our planned build-out of SSDs, eMCPs and managed NAND solutions, all of which carry additional bill-of-materials costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix. On a like-for-like basis, cost per bit will decline more substantially.
Relative to 3D XPoint technology, we're working with market enablers on adoption of our QuantX solutions and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success, with initial revenue later in 2017.
Now I'd like to turn the mic over to Ernie."

We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution, coupled with a more favorable business environment, resulted in improved financial performance. I'll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's results for the quarter and guidance for our First Fiscal Quarter 2017.
DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile represented about 25%, similar to the prior quarter; The PC segment was in the upper 20% range, up slightly from the prior quarter; Server business was in the high teens percent range, down from the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 30% range, up from the prior quarter and primarily driven by an increasing graphics, which represented more than 10% for the quarter.
In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation: Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 50%, down slightly from the prior quarter; Mobile was in the high teens percent range, up from 13% in the prior quarter as we began to see the impact of our completed customer quals. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs represented 13%, similar to last quarter; and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range, similar to prior quarter.
Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.25 billion, up 14% sequentially, primarily driven by 20-nanometer shipment growth, accompanied by strengthening demand in a moderating pricing environment across all segments. The non-GAAP operating loss was $7 million or less than 1% of revenue.
In the enterprise segment, conversions to DDR4 are now largely complete, and we are focused on enabling our solutions for the next-generation server platform. We are seeing continued interest in both higher-density RDIMMs and LRDIMMs as well as NVDIMM solutions. The cloud component of the enterprise segment is growing quickly, driven by continued growth in density across both DDR3 and DDR4 solutions.
In graphics, we saw a growth well above typical seasonality driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products. There are additional G5X-based product announcements for NVIDIA in both the graphics and workstation segments during the quarter.
In networking, we enjoyed double-digit revenue growth with strength across all regions and growing interest in applying the high-bandwidth capabilities of GDDR5 and GDDR5X to the networking segment. Finally, within the client segment, we saw market demand, which exceeded our expectations as well as a continued transition to DDR4, which, for the first time, represented a majority of client shipments.
The Mobile Business Unit delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $671 million, up 20% sequentially, driven by a strong quarter in our eMCP products. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 7% of revenue and was partially impacted by the consumption of higher cost early production inventory accumulated over the last 2 quarters. We saw significant growth in the recently qualified higher-density MCPs and -- as smartphone OEMs are positioning their products based on higher memory density specifications, which is helping to accelerate adoption of smartphones with richer memory content.
The Embedded Business Unit delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $513 million, up 5% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $133 million or 26% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by record automotive and increasing consumer business combined with some recovery in our industrial multi-market business.
The automotive business delivered solid results with revenue up 6% sequentially, driven by strong and increasing demand for both DRAM and eMMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems applications. European, Korean and Japanese customers continued to feel this growth, and our portfolio of leading-edge, automotive-grade solutions is continuing to enable platform design wins.
The industrial and multi-market business increased 16% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our NOR- and NAND-based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules.
Consumer and connected home revenue was up 7% sequentially with solid demand for MCPs used in action cameras and home automation applications. We continued to see this demand pattern continue in the current fiscal quarter, which typically sees strong seasonal demand. Our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into set-top boxes and IMM applications.
The Storage business delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $758 million, up 5% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $69 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we entered production and OEM qualification of TLC 3D NAND-based SSDs in the client and consumer segment, providing customers with a refreshed 3D-based portfolio of storage products that span the demand spectrum in these markets.
In the enterprise SSD segment, consecutive quarter bits sold were up 45% based on higher sales of our planar MLC-based cloud drive. We are deploying 3D TLC across the enterprise and cloud portfolio with several product launches over the next 2 quarters.
Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the Fourth Fiscal Quarter was $3.2 billion, at the top end of our guidance range and up 11% sequentially. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by moderating ASP declines, while trade NAND shipments increased as a result of early success of our 3D ramp. And we experienced generally stable ASPs. Gross margin for the quarter was 18%, also at the top end of our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $56 million or $0.05 per share, significantly better than our guidance.
For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP profitability despite our technology transition and memory market pricing pressure, achieving non-GAAP net income of $66 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, Micron included both amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock compensation expense in our Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.04 a share in the Fourth Fiscal Quarter and $0.20 per share for the Full 2016 fiscal year.
Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 13% compared to the prior quarter as a result of the 20% increase in bit shipments partially offset by a 6% decrease in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter increased 2 percentage points to 20%, primarily driven by strong cost reductions as a result of the continued 20-nanometer ramp.
Our non-volatile trade revenue increased 12% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 13% increase in bit shipment partially offset by a 1% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 16% as cost per bit was up, related to the 3D ramp and build-out of higher-cost storage and mobile solutions to support future growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $559 million. This was below our guidance, primarily due to continued expense control and the timing of prequalification expenses for the fourth quarter. Some of which will now occur in Fiscal Q1. The company generated operating cash flow of $896 million, which included a strong quarter for collection activity, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.8 billion. In the Fourth fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.7 billion.
Before we move on to our guidance for the upcoming quarter, I wanted to share some changes to our reporting. The first of these changes relates to the depreciation schedule for our DRAM capital equipment. Previously, this equipment had been depreciated over 5 years. However, given the longer intervals between technology transitions, we have changed the depreciable life of our DRAM capital equipment from 5 years to 7 years. This change will reduce depreciation by approximately $100 million per quarter on a going forward basis. The depreciation schedule for NAND-related equipment remains unchanged.
Additionally and to be consistent with the majority of semiconductor companies who report non-GAAP results, Micron will exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from our non-GAAP reporting. These expenses, on average, are approximately $50 million per quarter.
Moving on now to our guidance for the First fiscal quarter, which we developed in the context of the market environment that Mark described earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, gross margin in the range of 23% to 25.5%, operating expenses between $600 million and $650 million due to the resumption of variable compensation expense and the higher pre-qual expenses that we spoke of earlier. Taken together, these items represent a sequential increase of approximately $80 million, of which $25 million resulted from the timing of pre-qual between Fiscal Q4 and Fiscal Q1. Operating income in the range of $245 million to $330 million, and EPS ranging between $0.13 and $0.21 per share based on 1,046,000,000 diluted shares. 
Relative to our capital spending plans for Fiscal '17, as we shared last month, we expect to spend between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion net of partner contributions. Between 40% and 50% of the total will be allocated to DRAM, between 30% and 40% to non-volatile memory, and between 15% and 25% to technology and product enablement. Consistent with our public comments, this level of CapEx allows us to appropriately fund our technology investments while achieving neutral to positive free cash flow generation in Fiscal 2017. 
Operationally, we are on track to deliver the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that we've previously shared as we complete the 20-nanometer DRAM conversion, reach crossover of first-generation 3D NAND this quarter and commence the ramp of 1X nanometer DRAM and second-generation 3D NAND in 2017. For FY '17 specifically, we expect DRAM and NAND cost per bit reductions between 20% and 25%.
Finally, relative to the Inotera transaction, Micron and Inotera have concluded that sufficient progress has been made in Inotera addressing the issues that caused the delay in closing. An Inotera board meeting has been scheduled for October 11, and the Directors of Inotera are expected to set a share swap record date at that meeting. We anticipate that the share swap record date will be set for the first half of December 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

So I think it's important to acknowledge that although we beat our EPS guidance, we actually were well in the ranges of both our revenue and our gross margin guidance. And so we did think about the opportunity that was ahead of ourselves as we were giving the guidance for last quarter, and we've done the same thing, in essence, this quarter as well. So I think you can look at the range of our guidance, and it generally contemplates the outcomes that we see. And obviously, if things continue on a strong and favorable momentum, it's reasonable to think that you'd end up at the upper end of both pieces of the range, which would generate a result similar to this quarter. And I think consistent with Mark's prior comments, we are continuing to see positive momentum. I do think it's important to understand that, that momentum has existed and has started to strengthen. And so as a result of its actual impact in our fiscal quarter with part of it already completed and we're in negotiations for others, I think that the trap we want to avoid is presuming that whatever the latest pricing news is gets retroactively applied across the entire quarter, because that's certainly not the environment that we're living in. But I do think we were pretty thoughtful about the revenue range, and obviously, we're going to work hard and try to do as well as we can.

And then secondly, we have -- we had, even prior to this rollover, the highest point of pre-qual expenses for the entire fiscal year was actually occurring in Q1, plus we have the resumption of variable compensation; given the new pricing environment. And so what we've tried to frame for folks is sequentially, between the variable comp being reinstated as well as the pre-qual expenses, that's a sequential increase of about $80 million from F Q4 to F Q1. So that predominantly explains the change to the OpEx. And then certainly we're hopeful that the variable compensation piece continues, because we're hopeful that the business environment is favorable. And we would expect pre-qual expenses to moderate such that we should be in that range of $600 million -- plus or minus -- so probably midpoint around $600 million a few quarters maybe a couple of quarters higher, a couple of quarters a little bit lower under the new framework for recording OpEx. So those numbers would still exclude stock-based comp, but you would expect to see a pretty meaningful moderation of OpEx as we go forward throughout the year as a result of this pre-qual situation being resolved from the rollover."

But we have a very clear view of an ability to decrease inventory meaningfully over the course of Fiscal '17. I'd also remind you that we are also building supply chains for SSDs and MCPs which take longer in terms of their aggregate end-to-end cycle time than selling components. So we have that effect as well. That will cap out here in the next quarter or so, and then you'll see a normalization and a flow-through of that as well.

And just last question for me on the cash flow and, obviously, you can't talk about Fiscal year '17. But if you take your CapEx guidance and your depreciation add-back, it does seem like it still will be kind of difficult to generate a meaningful free cash flow next year, assuming a fairly big ramp in gross margins and revenue; gross margins maybe continuing to increase above and beyond what you're guiding for November.

But I'd really stress that, that's an average amount, which would be sort of the free cash flow net of the incremental depreciation -- I'm sorry, the incremental CapEx. But I think that the best way I could guide your thinking there is that we have prepared a pretty conservative plan, and we have a free cash flow-neutral position in the context of that conservative plan. Obviously, Q4 is a little bit stronger. It's fair to say that Q1 was a little bit stronger as we look at it now versus our conservative plan. And so we would expect to be able to accumulate cash over the course of 2017 if, in fact, this current market environment continues. Anytime we use words like significant, it kind of gets hard to determine what's significant to you or significant to me.

As we're thinking about our ability to drive new technologies, either into manufacturing or to transition technologies with the Inotera assets, having ownership of that asset and the ability to mix and match different technologies as well as potentially more value-add products and capture that value is significant, notwithstanding the fact we had a good operating relationship with Inotera, we believe that there's more value we can bring as sole owners than as board members and operational partners. And at the end of the day, it gives us the ability as well to take the cash flow that's going to be generated with Inotera and deploy it across our network where ever we -- where we find that most useful.

For Fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin is 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share. Both revenue and gross margin were at the high end of the guidance range and together, generated earnings per share that exceeded guidance. Operating cash flow was $896 million.
On the last call, we reported that while we were seeing signs of improvement in selected markets, we were uncertain of the extent and the duration of the improvements. During the quarter, we continue to see market conditions improve, driven by both supply and demand fundamentals. Industry inventory appears lean, and the current market outlook for both NAND and DRAM continues to be positive. Currently, prices are increasing in a number of segments, stabilizing in others, and we're seeing fewer segments showing residual declines. This environment framed our thinking on the guidance that Ernie will provide a little later on.
We made significant progress on a number of key initiatives in the quarter, including the completion of the mobile product qualifications that we had been discussing and our early 1X nanometer DRAM deployment. We were also seeing the benefits of the 3D NAND yield ramp, which generated stronger-than-expected NAND bit growth in the quarter. I'm going to provide a high-level overview of each of the business units, and Ernie will follow with more details on each business' financial performance.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we experienced accelerating revenue growth in the face of moderating pricing environment. Revenue growth was driven by continued increases of 20-nanometer shipments as well as a significant transition to DDR4 in the cloud and client segments, where shipments exceeded DDR3 for the first time. We saw ongoing strength in graphics, driven by our GDDR5 and 5X products. We supported NVIDIA's introduction of the 5X-based TITAN X, the highest performance consumer graphics card in the market.
In the enterprise segment, Micron was recognized at the Flash Memory Summit as the innovation leader in non-volatile DIMMs; an important solution for high-performance servers.
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. China's becoming a more significant growth driver in the mobile -- in mobile devices. Most of these devices are differentiated by large amounts of memory, including up to 6 gigabytes of low-power DRAM. Additionally, the ""top of the line"" Apple and Samsung models now ship with 256 gigabytes of NAND, and we see mid-range Chinese handsets heading in the same direction in order to compete. Although there is a moderating pace of smartphone unit growth, significant content increases of both NAND and DRAM will generate strong overall bit growth. During the quarter, we introduced 4 new mid- to high-density mobile 3D NAND products with positive reviews from the press and from our customer base. Mobile DRAM and eMCP price declines moderated in the quarter with more recent signs of stabilization and increases.
Revenue growth in our Embedded Business Unit has been driven by a record automotive business and increased performance in the consumer and connected home segments as well as a strengthening industrial multi-market business during the quarter. We have maintained our leadership position in automotive through strong customer support and the introduction of new products that meet the fast growing memory content requirements for infotainment, ADAS and instrument cluster applications. High-temperature DRAM and automotive-grade NAND products are enabling a strong design win pipeline.
The introduction of several new industrial solutions has positioned us to grow our share within IMM and retain our high market share in machine-to-machine communication modules as the industry migrates from 2G to 4G and LTE. We have also been successful in achieving strong market share positions in consumer applications from action cameras and home automation to high-volume markets, including digital TV and set-top boxes.
Finally, our Storage Business Unit is continuing to transition its product line to our leading-edge 3D NAND technology. We've seen positive response from customers this quarter related to our refreshed SSD portfolio, which offers a breadth of solutions to meet diverse application requirements. We're finalizing qualification with 8 major OEMs on our 1,100-client drive and are engaging with cloud customers on future designs. In the enterprise, we're seeing companies begin to retrofit HDD infrastructures with SaaS SSDs as they modernize existing investments. Our customers in demanding sectors like financial services and energy are moving storage closer to the server. We've seen significant interest in our PCIe, NVMe drives in these applications due to their ability to deliver very consistent high performance. 
We are actively extending TLC 3D NAND across our cloud and enterprise portfolio and expect to introduce our first TLC 3D SATA drive for these markets later this year followed by a server-focused version early next year. We expect to see positive supply-and-demand dynamics in the SSD market for 2017.
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We've seen further evidence that DRAM wafer output is declining as a result of lost throughput related to the 20-nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions. Absent some replacement of these wafers, we could see industry supply growth as low as mid-teens in 2017. If some of the lost wafer output is replaced, industry supply growth could be in the high teens percent range. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-20% range.
For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-40% range.  Despite significant investments in 3D conversions across the industry, we believe that 2017 supply growth will be relatively balanced with demand given the disruption in the fab output related to these conversions.
For our operational priorities for fiscal 2017 -- or our operational priorities for Fiscal 2017 continue to be targeted at ramping advanced technologies with an added focus on building out a more robust product portfolio, in particular, for non-volatile memory products. For DRAM, we begin the 1X nanometer ramp and expect to have meaningful output by the middle of 2017.
At our winter Analyst Day, we shared 2-year bit growth targets for DRAM, and we are on track to meet these targets. We were slightly below the range in Fiscal 2017 (sic) (2016)and expect to be above the range in Fiscal 2017. All of the DRAM bit growth will come from technology transitions, and we currently have no plans to add wafer capacity. We expect our Fiscal 2017 DRAM cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of completing the 20-nanometer migration and initiating the 1X nanometer conversion. Our cash cost per bit declines will be meaningfully higher than this range.
For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen 1 3D as well as TLC. As we updated at our last Analyst Meeting, 3D bit output will exceed 2D output in the current quarter, ahead of our initial target. We will also be working on deploying second-generation 64-layer 3D technology.
Similar to DRAM, our 2016 NAND bit growth came in below the 2-year CAGR shared at our analyst event, and we therefore expect 2017 to be above that range. We are forecasting our Fiscal 2017 NAND cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of the 3D and TLC conversions. This cost per bit includes the impact of our planned build-out of SSDs, eMCPs and managed NAND solutions, all of which carry additional bill-of-materials costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix. On a like-for-like basis, cost per bit will decline more substantially.
Relative to 3D XPoint technology, we're working with market enablers on adoption of our QuantX solutions and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success, with initial revenue later in 2017.
Now I'd like to turn the mic over to Ernie."

We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution, coupled with a more favorable business environment, resulted in improved financial performance. I'll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's results for the quarter and guidance for our First Fiscal Quarter 2017.
DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile represented about 25%, similar to the prior quarter; The PC segment was in the upper 20% range, up slightly from the prior quarter; Server business was in the high teens percent range, down from the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 30% range, up from the prior quarter and primarily driven by an increasing graphics, which represented more than 10% for the quarter.
In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation: Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 50%, down slightly from the prior quarter; Mobile was in the high teens percent range, up from 13% in the prior quarter as we began to see the impact of our completed customer quals. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs represented 13%, similar to last quarter; and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range, similar to prior quarter.
Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.25 billion, up 14% sequentially, primarily driven by 20-nanometer shipment growth, accompanied by strengthening demand in a moderating pricing environment across all segments. The non-GAAP operating loss was $7 million or less than 1% of revenue.
In the enterprise segment, conversions to DDR4 are now largely complete, and we are focused on enabling our solutions for the next-generation server platform. We are seeing continued interest in both higher-density RDIMMs and LRDIMMs as well as NVDIMM solutions. The cloud component of the enterprise segment is growing quickly, driven by continued growth in density across both DDR3 and DDR4 solutions.
In graphics, we saw a growth well above typical seasonality driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products. There are additional G5X-based product announcements for NVIDIA in both the graphics and workstation segments during the quarter.
In networking, we enjoyed double-digit revenue growth with strength across all regions and growing interest in applying the high-bandwidth capabilities of GDDR5 and GDDR5X to the networking segment. Finally, within the client segment, we saw market demand, which exceeded our expectations as well as a continued transition to DDR4, which, for the first time, represented a majority of client shipments.
The Mobile Business Unit delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $671 million, up 20% sequentially, driven by a strong quarter in our eMCP products. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 7% of revenue and was partially impacted by the consumption of higher cost early production inventory accumulated over the last 2 quarters. We saw significant growth in the recently qualified higher-density MCPs and -- as smartphone OEMs are positioning their products based on higher memory density specifications, which is helping to accelerate adoption of smartphones with richer memory content.
The Embedded Business Unit delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $513 million, up 5% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $133 million or 26% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by record automotive and increasing consumer business combined with some recovery in our industrial multi-market business.
The automotive business delivered solid results with revenue up 6% sequentially, driven by strong and increasing demand for both DRAM and eMMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems applications. European, Korean and Japanese customers continued to feel this growth, and our portfolio of leading-edge, automotive-grade solutions is continuing to enable platform design wins.
The industrial and multi-market business increased 16% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our NOR- and NAND-based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules.
Consumer and connected home revenue was up 7% sequentially with solid demand for MCPs used in action cameras and home automation applications. We continued to see this demand pattern continue in the current fiscal quarter, which typically sees strong seasonal demand. Our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into set-top boxes and IMM applications.
The Storage business delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $758 million, up 5% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $69 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we entered production and OEM qualification of TLC 3D NAND-based SSDs in the client and consumer segment, providing customers with a refreshed 3D-based portfolio of storage products that span the demand spectrum in these markets.
In the enterprise SSD segment, consecutive quarter bits sold were up 45% based on higher sales of our planar MLC-based cloud drive. We are deploying 3D TLC across the enterprise and cloud portfolio with several product launches over the next 2 quarters.
Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the Fourth Fiscal Quarter was $3.2 billion, at the top end of our guidance range and up 11% sequentially. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by moderating ASP declines, while trade NAND shipments increased as a result of early success of our 3D ramp. And we experienced generally stable ASPs. Gross margin for the quarter was 18%, also at the top end of our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $56 million or $0.05 per share, significantly better than our guidance.
For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP profitability despite our technology transition and memory market pricing pressure, achieving non-GAAP net income of $66 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, Micron included both amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock compensation expense in our Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.04 a share in the Fourth Fiscal Quarter and $0.20 per share for the Full 2016 fiscal year.
Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 13% compared to the prior quarter as a result of the 20% increase in bit shipments partially offset by a 6% decrease in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter increased 2 percentage points to 20%, primarily driven by strong cost reductions as a result of the continued 20-nanometer ramp.
Our non-volatile trade revenue increased 12% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 13% increase in bit shipment partially offset by a 1% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 16% as cost per bit was up, related to the 3D ramp and build-out of higher-cost storage and mobile solutions to support future growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $559 million. This was below our guidance, primarily due to continued expense control and the timing of prequalification expenses for the fourth quarter. Some of which will now occur in Fiscal Q1. The company generated operating cash flow of $896 million, which included a strong quarter for collection activity, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.8 billion. In the Fourth fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.7 billion.
Before we move on to our guidance for the upcoming quarter, I wanted to share some changes to our reporting. The first of these changes relates to the depreciation schedule for our DRAM capital equipment. Previously, this equipment had been depreciated over 5 years. However, given the longer intervals between technology transitions, we have changed the depreciable life of our DRAM capital equipment from 5 years to 7 years. This change will reduce depreciation by approximately $100 million per quarter on a going forward basis. The depreciation schedule for NAND-related equipment remains unchanged.
Additionally and to be consistent with the majority of semiconductor companies who report non-GAAP results, Micron will exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from our non-GAAP reporting. These expenses, on average, are approximately $50 million per quarter.
Moving on now to our guidance for the First fiscal quarter, which we developed in the context of the market environment that Mark described earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, gross margin in the range of 23% to 25.5%, operating expenses between $600 million and $650 million due to the resumption of variable compensation expense and the higher pre-qual expenses that we spoke of earlier. Taken together, these items represent a sequential increase of approximately $80 million, of which $25 million resulted from the timing of pre-qual between Fiscal Q4 and Fiscal Q1. Operating income in the range of $245 million to $330 million, and EPS ranging between $0.13 and $0.21 per share based on 1,046,000,000 diluted shares. 
Relative to our capital spending plans for Fiscal '17, as we shared last month, we expect to spend between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion net of partner contributions. Between 40% and 50% of the total will be allocated to DRAM, between 30% and 40% to non-volatile memory, and between 15% and 25% to technology and product enablement. Consistent with our public comments, this level of CapEx allows us to appropriately fund our technology investments while achieving neutral to positive free cash flow generation in Fiscal 2017. 
Operationally, we are on track to deliver the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that we've previously shared as we complete the 20-nanometer DRAM conversion, reach crossover of first-generation 3D NAND this quarter and commence the ramp of 1X nanometer DRAM and second-generation 3D NAND in 2017. For FY '17 specifically, we expect DRAM and NAND cost per bit reductions between 20% and 25%.
Finally, relative to the Inotera transaction, Micron and Inotera have concluded that sufficient progress has been made in Inotera addressing the issues that caused the delay in closing. An Inotera board meeting has been scheduled for October 11, and the Directors of Inotera are expected to set a share swap record date at that meeting. We anticipate that the share swap record date will be set for the first half of December 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

And I think consistent with Mark's prior comments, we are continuing to see positive momentum. I do think it's important to understand that, that momentum has existed and has started to strengthen. And so as a result of its actual impact in our fiscal quarter with part of it already completed and we're in negotiations for others, I think that the trap we want to avoid is presuming that whatever the latest pricing news is gets retroactively applied across the entire quarter, because that's certainly not the environment that we're living in. But I do think we were pretty thoughtful about the revenue range, and obviously, we're going to work hard and try to do as well as we can. But we put a lot of thought behind the numbers we've just shared with you."

And then secondly, we have -- we had, even prior to this rollover, the highest point of pre-qual expenses for the entire fiscal year was actually occurring in Q1, plus we have the resumption of variable compensation; given the new pricing environment. And so what we've tried to frame for folks is sequentially, between the variable comp being reinstated as well as the pre-qual expenses, that's a sequential increase of about $80 million from F Q4 to F Q1. So that predominantly explains the change to the OpEx. And then certainly we're hopeful that the variable compensation piece continues, because we're hopeful that the business environment is favorable. And we would expect pre-qual expenses to moderate such that we should be in that range of $600 million -- plus or minus -- so probably midpoint around $600 million a few quarters maybe a couple of quarters higher, a couple of quarters a little bit lower under the new framework for recording OpEx. So those numbers would still exclude stock-based comp, but you would expect to see a pretty meaningful moderation of OpEx as we go forward throughout the year as a result of this pre-qual situation being resolved from the rollover."

But we have a very clear view of an ability to decrease inventory meaningfully over the course of Fiscal '17. I'd also remind you that we are also building supply chains for SSDs and MCPs which take longer in terms of their aggregate end-to-end cycle time than selling components. So we have that effect as well. That will cap out here in the next quarter or so, and then you'll see a normalization and a flow-through of that as well.

And so that is less of a defensive driver, so to speak. An important thing for us in this whole picture is operational flexibility and control. As we're thinking about our ability to drive new technologies, either into manufacturing or to transition technologies with the Inotera assets, having ownership of that asset and the ability to mix and match different technologies as well as potentially more value-add products and capture that value is significant, notwithstanding the fact we had a good operating relationship with Inotera, we believe that there's more value we can bring as sole owners than as board members and operational partners. And at the end of the day, it gives us the ability as well to take the cash flow that's going to be generated with Inotera and deploy it across our network where ever we -- where we find that most useful. So a number of different factors playing into it, all of which, I think, point in the direction that we're moving."

For Fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin is 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share.

For Fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin is 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share. Both revenue and gross margin were at the high end of the guidance range and together, generated earnings per share that exceeded guidance. Operating cash flow was $896 million.
On the last call, we reported that while we were seeing signs of improvement in selected markets, we were uncertain of the extent and the duration of the improvements. During the quarter, we continue to see market conditions improve, driven by both supply and demand fundamentals. Industry inventory appears lean, and the current market outlook for both NAND and DRAM continues to be positive. Currently, prices are increasing in a number of segments, stabilizing in others, and we're seeing fewer segments showing residual declines. This environment framed our thinking on the guidance that Ernie will provide a little later on.
We made significant progress on a number of key initiatives in the quarter, including the completion of the mobile product qualifications that we had been discussing and our early 1X nanometer DRAM deployment. We were also seeing the benefits of the 3D NAND yield ramp, which generated stronger-than-expected NAND bit growth in the quarter. I'm going to provide a high-level overview of each of the business units, and Ernie will follow with more details on each business' financial performance.
In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we experienced accelerating revenue growth in the face of moderating pricing environment. Revenue growth was driven by continued increases of 20-nanometer shipments as well as a significant transition to DDR4 in the cloud and client segments, where shipments exceeded DDR3 for the first time. We saw ongoing strength in graphics, driven by our GDDR5 and 5X products. We supported NVIDIA's introduction of the 5X-based TITAN X, the highest performance consumer graphics card in the market.
In the enterprise segment, Micron was recognized at the Flash Memory Summit as the innovation leader in non-volatile DIMMs; an important solution for high-performance servers.
Turning to our Mobile Business Unit. China's becoming a more significant growth driver in the mobile -- in mobile devices. Most of these devices are differentiated by large amounts of memory, including up to 6 gigabytes of low-power DRAM. Additionally, the ""top of the line"" Apple and Samsung models now ship with 256 gigabytes of NAND, and we see mid-range Chinese handsets heading in the same direction in order to compete. Although there is a moderating pace of smartphone unit growth, significant content increases of both NAND and DRAM will generate strong overall bit growth. During the quarter, we introduced 4 new mid- to high-density mobile 3D NAND products with positive reviews from the press and from our customer base. Mobile DRAM and eMCP price declines moderated in the quarter with more recent signs of stabilization and increases.
Revenue growth in our Embedded Business Unit has been driven by a record automotive business and increased performance in the consumer and connected home segments as well as a strengthening industrial multi-market business during the quarter. We have maintained our leadership position in automotive through strong customer support and the introduction of new products that meet the fast growing memory content requirements for infotainment, ADAS and instrument cluster applications. High-temperature DRAM and automotive-grade NAND products are enabling a strong design win pipeline.
The introduction of several new industrial solutions has positioned us to grow our share within IMM and retain our high market share in machine-to-machine communication modules as the industry migrates from 2G to 4G and LTE. We have also been successful in achieving strong market share positions in consumer applications from action cameras and home automation to high-volume markets, including digital TV and set-top boxes.
Finally, our Storage Business Unit is continuing to transition its product line to our leading-edge 3D NAND technology. We've seen positive response from customers this quarter related to our refreshed SSD portfolio, which offers a breadth of solutions to meet diverse application requirements. We're finalizing qualification with 8 major OEMs on our 1,100-client drive and are engaging with cloud customers on future designs. In the enterprise, we're seeing companies begin to retrofit HDD infrastructures with SaaS SSDs as they modernize existing investments. Our customers in demanding sectors like financial services and energy are moving storage closer to the server. We've seen significant interest in our PCIe, NVMe drives in these applications due to their ability to deliver very consistent high performance. 
We are actively extending TLC 3D NAND across our cloud and enterprise portfolio and expect to introduce our first TLC 3D SATA drive for these markets later this year followed by a server-focused version early next year. We expect to see positive supply-and-demand dynamics in the SSD market for 2017.
Turning to the memory industry more generally. We've seen further evidence that DRAM wafer output is declining as a result of lost throughput related to the 20-nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions. Absent some replacement of these wafers, we could see industry supply growth as low as mid-teens in 2017. If some of the lost wafer output is replaced, industry supply growth could be in the high teens percent range. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-20% range.
For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid-40% range.  Despite significant investments in 3D conversions across the industry, we believe that 2017 supply growth will be relatively balanced with demand given the disruption in the fab output related to these conversions.
For our operational priorities for fiscal 2017 -- or our operational priorities for Fiscal 2017 continue to be targeted at ramping advanced technologies with an added focus on building out a more robust product portfolio, in particular, for non-volatile memory products. For DRAM, we begin the 1X nanometer ramp and expect to have meaningful output by the middle of 2017.
At our winter Analyst Day, we shared 2-year bit growth targets for DRAM, and we are on track to meet these targets. We were slightly below the range in Fiscal 2017 (sic) (2016)and expect to be above the range in Fiscal 2017. All of the DRAM bit growth will come from technology transitions, and we currently have no plans to add wafer capacity. We expect our Fiscal 2017 DRAM cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of completing the 20-nanometer migration and initiating the 1X nanometer conversion. Our cash cost per bit declines will be meaningfully higher than this range.
For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen 1 3D as well as TLC. As we updated at our last Analyst Meeting, 3D bit output will exceed 2D output in the current quarter, ahead of our initial target. We will also be working on deploying second-generation 64-layer 3D technology.
Similar to DRAM, our 2016 NAND bit growth came in below the 2-year CAGR shared at our analyst event, and we therefore expect 2017 to be above that range. We are forecasting our Fiscal 2017 NAND cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of the 3D and TLC conversions. This cost per bit includes the impact of our planned build-out of SSDs, eMCPs and managed NAND solutions, all of which carry additional bill-of-materials costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix. On a like-for-like basis, cost per bit will decline more substantially.
Relative to 3D XPoint technology, we're working with market enablers on adoption of our QuantX solutions and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success, with initial revenue later in 2017.
Now I'd like to turn the mic over to Ernie."

We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution, coupled with a more favorable business environment, resulted in improved financial performance. I'll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit",1719,"Thank you, Mark. We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution, coupled with a more favorable business environment, resulted in improved financial performance. I'll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's results for the quarter and guidance for our First Fiscal Quarter 2017.
DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile represented about 25%, similar to the prior quarter; The PC segment was in the upper 20% range, up slightly from the prior quarter; Server business was in the high teens percent range, down from the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 30% range, up from the prior quarter and primarily driven by an increasing graphics, which represented more than 10% for the quarter.
In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation: Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 50%, down slightly from the prior quarter; Mobile was in the high teens percent range, up from 13% in the prior quarter as we began to see the impact of our completed customer quals. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs represented 13%, similar to last quarter; and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range, similar to prior quarter.
Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.25 billion, up 14% sequentially, primarily driven by 20-nanometer shipment growth, accompanied by strengthening demand in a moderating pricing environment across all segments. The non-GAAP operating loss was $7 million or less than 1% of revenue.
In the enterprise segment, conversions to DDR4 are now largely complete, and we are focused on enabling our solutions for the next-generation server platform. We are seeing continued interest in both higher-density RDIMMs and LRDIMMs as well as NVDIMM solutions. The cloud component of the enterprise segment is growing quickly, driven by continued growth in density across both DDR3 and DDR4 solutions.
In graphics, we saw a growth well above typical seasonality driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products. There are additional G5X-based product announcements for NVIDIA in both the graphics and workstation segments during the quarter.
In networking, we enjoyed double-digit revenue growth with strength across all regions and growing interest in applying the high-bandwidth capabilities of GDDR5 and GDDR5X to the networking segment. Finally, within the client segment, we saw market demand, which exceeded our expectations as well as a continued transition to DDR4, which, for the first time, represented a majority of client shipments.
The Mobile Business Unit delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $671 million, up 20% sequentially, driven by a strong quarter in our eMCP products. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 7% of revenue and was partially impacted by the consumption of higher cost early production inventory accumulated over the last 2 quarters. We saw significant growth in the recently qualified higher-density MCPs and -- as smartphone OEMs are positioning their products based on higher memory density specifications, which is helping to accelerate adoption of smartphones with richer memory content.
The Embedded Business Unit delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $513 million, up 5% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $133 million or 26% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by record automotive and increasing consumer business combined with some recovery in our industrial multi-market business.
The automotive business delivered solid results with revenue up 6% sequentially, driven by strong and increasing demand for both DRAM and eMMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems applications. European, Korean and Japanese customers continued to feel this growth, and our portfolio of leading-edge, automotive-grade solutions is continuing to enable platform design wins.
The industrial and multi-market business increased 16% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our NOR- and NAND-based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules.
Consumer and connected home revenue was up 7% sequentially with solid demand for MCPs used in action cameras and home automation applications. We continued to see this demand pattern continue in the current fiscal quarter, which typically sees strong seasonal demand. Our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into set-top boxes and IMM applications.
The Storage business delivered Fiscal Q4 revenue of $758 million, up 5% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $69 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we entered production and OEM qualification of TLC 3D NAND-based SSDs in the client and consumer segment, providing customers with a refreshed 3D-based portfolio of storage products that span the demand spectrum in these markets.
In the enterprise SSD segment, consecutive quarter bits sold were up 45% based on higher sales of our planar MLC-based cloud drive. We are deploying 3D TLC across the enterprise and cloud portfolio with several product launches over the next 2 quarters.
Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the Fourth Fiscal Quarter was $3.2 billion, at the top end of our guidance range and up 11% sequentially. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by moderating ASP declines, while trade NAND shipments increased as a result of early success of our 3D ramp. And we experienced generally stable ASPs. Gross margin for the quarter was 18%, also at the top end of our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $56 million or $0.05 per share, significantly better than our guidance.
For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP profitability despite our technology transition and memory market pricing pressure, achieving non-GAAP net income of $66 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, Micron included both amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock compensation expense in our Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP results. Taken together, these 2 items represent $0.04 a share in the Fourth Fiscal Quarter and $0.20 per share for the Full 2016 fiscal year.
Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 13% compared to the prior quarter as a result of the 20% increase in bit shipments partially offset by a 6% decrease in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter increased 2 percentage points to 20%, primarily driven by strong cost reductions as a result of the continued 20-nanometer ramp.
Our non-volatile trade revenue increased 12% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 13% increase in bit shipment partially offset by a 1% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 16% as cost per bit was up, related to the 3D ramp and build-out of higher-cost storage and mobile solutions to support future growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $559 million. This was below our guidance, primarily due to continued expense control and the timing of prequalification expenses for the fourth quarter. Some of which will now occur in Fiscal Q1. The company generated operating cash flow of $896 million, which included a strong quarter for collection activity, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.8 billion. In the fourth fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.7 billion.
Before we move on to our guidance for the upcoming quarter, I wanted to share some changes to our reporting. The first of these changes relates to the depreciation schedule for our DRAM capital equipment. Previously, this equipment had been depreciated over 5 years. However, given the longer intervals between technology transitions, we have changed the depreciable life of our DRAM capital equipment from 5 years to 7 years. This change will reduce depreciation by approximately $100 million per quarter on a going forward basis. The depreciation schedule for NAND-related equipment remains unchanged.
Additionally and to be consistent with the majority of semiconductor companies who report non-GAAP results, Micron will exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from our non-GAAP reporting. These expenses, on average, are approximately $50 million per quarter.
Moving on now to our guidance for the First fiscal quarter, which we developed in the context of the market environment that Mark described earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, gross margin in the range of 23% to 25.5%, operating expenses between $600 million and $650 million due to the resumption of variable compensation expense and the higher pre-qual expenses that we spoke of earlier. Taken together, these items represent a sequential increase of approximately $80 million, of which $25 million resulted from the timing of pre-qual between Fiscal Q4 and Fiscal Q1. Operating income in the range of $245 million to $330 million, and EPS ranging between $0.13 and $0.21 per share based on 1,046,000,000 diluted shares. 
Relative to our capital spending plans for Fiscal '17, as we shared last month, we expect to spend between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion net of partner contributions. Between 40% and 50% of the total will be allocated to DRAM, between 30% and 40% to non-volatile memory, and between 15% and 25% to technology and product enablement. Consistent with our public comments, this level of CapEx allows us to appropriately fund our technology investments while achieving neutral to positive free cash flow generation in Fiscal 2017. 
Operationally, we are on track to deliver the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that we've previously shared as we complete the 20-nanometer DRAM conversion, reach crossover of first-generation 3D NAND this quarter and commence the ramp of 1X nanometer DRAM and second-generation 3D NAND in 2017. For FY '17 specifically, we expect DRAM and NAND cost per bit reductions between 20% and 25%.
Finally, relative to the Inotera transaction, Micron and Inotera have concluded that sufficient progress has been made in Inotera addressing the issues that caused the delay in closing. An Inotera board meeting has been scheduled for October 11, and the Directors of Inotera are expected to set a share swap record date at that meeting. We anticipate that the share swap record date will be set for the first half of December 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mark."

So I think you can look at the range of our guidance, and it generally contemplates the outcomes that we see. And obviously, if things continue on a strong and favorable momentum, it's reasonable to think that you'd end up at the upper end of both pieces of the range, which would generate a result similar to this quarter. And I think consistent with Mark's prior comments, we are continuing to see positive momentum. I do think it's important to understand that, that momentum has existed and has started to strengthen. And so as a result of its actual impact in our fiscal quarter with part of it already completed and we're in negotiations for others, I think that the trap we want to avoid is presuming that whatever the latest pricing news is gets retroactively applied across the entire quarter, because that's certainly not the environment that we're living in.

We had a couple of things that are impacting this quarter's OpEx. The first was that about $25 million -- give or take -- of pre-qual expenses that we had planned to spend in F Q4 are appearing in F Q1. And then secondly, we have -- we had, even prior to this rollover, the highest point of pre-qual expenses for the entire fiscal year was actually occurring in Q1, plus we have the resumption of variable compensation; given the new pricing environment. And so what we've tried to frame for folks is sequentially, between the variable comp being reinstated as well as the pre-qual expenses, that's a sequential increase of about $80 million from F Q4 to F Q1. So that predominantly explains the change to the OpEx. And then certainly we're hopeful that the variable compensation piece continues, because we're hopeful that the business environment is favorable. And we would expect pre-qual expenses to moderate such that we should be in that range of $600 million -- plus or minus -- so probably midpoint around $600 million a few quarters maybe a couple of quarters higher, a couple of quarters a little bit lower under the new framework for recording OpEx. So those numbers would still exclude stock-based comp, but you would expect to see a pretty meaningful moderation of OpEx as we go forward throughout the year as a result of this pre-qual situation being resolved from the rollover."

First, as we've talked about in the last quarter or so, as we are ramping on the new technologies and predominantly because of these delayed mobile calls, we had some inventory built up that is now flowing through. However, we absolutely still continue to get more and more output from the factory, and it's going to be a couple of quarters before that inventory actually starts to decline. But we have a very clear view of an ability to decrease inventory meaningfully over the course of Fiscal '17. I'd also remind you that we are also building supply chains for SSDs and MCPs which take longer in terms of their aggregate end-to-end cycle time than selling components. So we have that effect as well. That will cap out here in the next quarter or so, and then you'll see a normalization and a flow-through of that as well. So we're not -- we're cognizant of the inventory position. We'd like to think that we anticipated that and shared that with you.

Obviously, Q4 is a little bit stronger. It's fair to say that Q1 was a little bit stronger as we look at it now versus our conservative plan. And so we would expect to be able to accumulate cash over the course of 2017 if, in fact, this current market environment continues.

I think you put your finger on a piece of it which is that the volatility in this business, I think, we can conclude, is going to be less going forward. This certainly seems to have been borne out as we move through this last cycle. It doesn't mean that cycles are gone, it just means that the volatility is less. And so that is less of a defensive driver, so to speak. An important thing for us in this whole picture is operational flexibility and control. As we're thinking about our ability to drive new technologies, either into manufacturing or to transition technologies with the Inotera assets, having ownership of that asset and the ability to mix and match different technologies as well as potentially more value-add products and capture that value is significant, notwithstanding the fact we had a good operating relationship with Inotera, we believe that there's more value we can bring as sole owners than as board members and operational partners. And at the end of the day, it gives us the ability as well to take the cash flow that's going to be generated with Inotera and deploy it across our network where ever we -- where we find that most useful. So a number of different factors playing into it, all of which, I think, point in the direction that we're moving."

For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow",1160,"Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion.
In the first quarter, we saw an acceleration of a positive market condition to [ph] began this fall. For the industry, supply is slowing, demand is strong in a number of key segments and inventory is at low levels. Prices have been strengthening on a like-for-like basis across all leading SDRAM [ph] edge DRAM and products and we see these trends continuing into the current quarter. To give you some perspective and pricing dynamics, after declining for roughly 18 months, PC DRAM ASPs [ph] are up 50% to 60% compared to the trough pricing driven by an improvement in demand, historically low inventory levels and the impact of supply ships to other segments. In contrast, all other DRAM segments declined substantially less so in the same period and are recovering at a slower rate. Given the duration of the broad supply and demand tightness in the market, we are currently seeing improvements in quarter-over-quarter pricing trends in these non-PC segments.
Taking all these variables together, blended DRAM ASPs are essentially flat compared to the same period last year. With this in mind and as we look at our current quarter, operational execution is driving DRAM sales up more than $1 billion year-over-year while our cost of goods sold is up only about half this amount, driving substantial improvements in gross margins.
Product mix has a more significant impact on the NAND's landscape, where we are also experiencing like-for-like pricing increases. However, we are also shifting our product portfolio to 3D and TLC NAND, [ph] which enables higher density and lower cost products that also have lower ASPs. Taken together, blended NAND ASPs are down approximately 10% year-over-year while gross margins are up meaningfully.
Turning to the industry outlook. We're currently -- we currently expect 2017 DRAM bid supply growth in the 15% to 20% range. This is based on an assumption that suppliers won't add significant wafer capacity to the industry but will continue to focus on process build migrations to enable cost reductions and actual supply growth. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 20% to 25%. We expect favorable supply demand dynamics to persist in 2017. For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 40% to 45%. 3D conversions continue to be a headwind to industry supply growth. This factor, along with strong demand for storage and mobile solutions, sets up for a well-balanced supply and demand dynamic in 2017.
I'll now provide a high-level overview of each of our business units and Ernie will follow with more details on their specific financial performances. In the compute and networking business unit, [ph] we experienced revenue growth as a result of strengthening -- or strength in demand. We executed well to our 20-nanometer shipment plan and achieved key qualifications of 64-gigabyte LRDIMMs at multiple server customers. We also continued our strong performance in the graphics segment, where our GDDR5X technology leads competitors. In our Mobile Business Unit, [ph] the completion of our customer qualifications drove substantial revenue and profit growth this quarter. As noted last quarter, we continue to see the Chinese market driving mobile growth and higher memory content for smartphone. We had strong growth in our LPDRAM and mobile NAND product lines and are focused on new qualification opportunities as we see the mobile market as one of the strongest growth drivers of our business. Our embedded business was driven by strong demand across a variety of segments. Our NAND-based MCPs continue in business in machine-to-machine communications modules and our strong portfolio also brought us significant share in several new home automation and action camera platforms this quarter. We expect our new application optimize SD cards to drive market share gains within both industrial and connected home segments. [ph] 
Our automotive business [ph] had another excellent quarter. We're securing an increasing number of automotive design wins on our leading edge managed NAND and 20-nanometer DRAM products. We also see automotive demand for advanced memory technologies accelerating as more sophisticated ADAS systems come to market in the years ahead. Our Storage business unit [ph] continues to make progress, shifting our portfolio to advanced 3D NAND technologies. First, the 1,100 client SSDs we announced last quarter completed qualifications and we commenced volume shipments with several major customers. This complements our crucial MX300 [ph] consumer drive which is currently shipping at high volumes. Additionally, we announced our cloud-based 5100 SATA eSSD [ph] earlier this month, offering industry-leading performance in 8 terabyte capacities. All 3 of these SSDs are built with our TLC 3D NAND [ph] and illustrate our focused portfolio transition to this high-capacity, high-performance and cost-effective technology.
We continue to provide updates with respect to critical targets related to operational execution originally shared at our Analyst Day in August 2015. Thus far, these milestones include a big cross over on 20-nanometer DRAM [ph] and 3D NAND and the SSD product release roadmap have all been achieved on or ahead of schedule. Our 2 bit -- our 2-year bit growth and cost per bit targets remain on track and we continue to be focused on delivering to our commitments. Our focus in DRAM this year is primarily related to the deployment of our 1X nanometer technology. We're targeting meaningful output on 1X by the latter part of fiscal 2017. We expect to generate approximately 20% to 25% cost per bit reductions in fiscal 2017. Our cash cost for bit declines will be well above this range. For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen1 3D [ph] as well as TLC. We've also commenced production on our second generation 64-layer 3D technology and we're targeting meaningful output by the latter part of fiscal 2017. The 3D and TLC ramps will deliver 20% to 25% cost per bit improvement in fiscal 2017. This cost per bit includes the impact of expanding our SSD, eMCP and Managed NAND solutions, which carry additional bill of materials and costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix.
Relative to 3D XPoint technology, we will be shipping our QuantX solutions for revenue in 2017 and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success.
This month, just after our quarter closed, we finalized the acquisition of Inotera in Taiwan, which we expect to continue to provide strategic and financial opportunities for the company. We're excited to welcome the Inotera team to Micron and look forward to realizing the benefits of the new operating model.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."

As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance range as we provided in October. Today, I'll fir",1278,"Thank you, Mark. As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance range as we provided in October. Today, I'll first discuss some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's results for the quarter and guidance for our fiscal second quarter.
DRAM represented 61% of our total revenue, with the following segmentation: mobile represented about 30%, up from 25% the prior quarter; the PC segment was in the mid-20% range; and the server business was in the high teens percent range. [ph] Specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the mid-20% range, down from the prior quarter. 
In our nonvolatile memory business, [ph] trade revenue represented 32% of total revenue, with the following segmentation: consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented 40%, down from the prior quarter; mobile was in the low 20% range, up from the prior quarter, as we saw the continued impact of our completed customer qualifications. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-teens range, up from the prior quarter and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the 20% range.
Turning to performance by business unit. The compute and networking business unit [ph] reported fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.47 billion, up 18% sequentially, primarily due to stronger demand and higher 20-nanometer shipments and a stronger pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating profit was $204 million or 14% of revenue. In the enterprise segment, we executed well in shipping 20-nanometer solutions to the market and qualified several lower cost products at multiple customers. Cloud with CNBU's fastest-growing segment and Micron is now qualified on most high-volume sockets for the top customers in this segment. Demand is being driven by both our leading edge DDR4 solutions, as well as continuing need for DDR3. In graphics, we had continued share growth in GDDR with our major graphics customers. New graphics card [ph] launches and strong console sales sustain favorable demand for both GDDR5 and GDDR5 X. [ph] In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer 4 gigabyte DDR3 and 8 gigabyte DDR4. We continue to see strong interest in our high-performance memory portfolio as well. Finally, within the client segment, ASP strength exceeded our expectations and solid execution on 20-nanometer drove improved shipments and cost reductions. The mobile business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.03 billion, up 54% sequentially, driven by completed customer qualifications and strong sales of LPDRAM and mobile NAND products in an improved pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating income was $89 million or 9% of revenue as we continued to ramp our 20-nanometer products and made substantial progress reducing higher costs early production inventory. The Embedded Business Unit [ph] delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $578 million, up 13% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $178 million or 31% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by seasonally strong consumer business and record automotive revenue. Embedded ASP trends tend to be more stable compared to the broader compute and mobile markets but we are beginning to see the benefit of tightening supply demand in this business unit as well. Consumer revenue was up 25% sequentially, driven by home automation and camera application. In addition, our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into some 4K set-top [ph] box applications. The automotive business performed well, with revenue up 7% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. These solid results continue to be driven by strong and increasing demand for both DDR3 and e.MMC solutions for infotainment instrument cluster and LPDRAM for advanced driver systems applications. The industrial and multi-market business increased 6% sequentially, with a strong quarter for our NOR business combined with ramping our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see growing demand for our industrial grade managed NAND solutions. The Storage [ph] business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $860 million, up 13% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 5% of revenue. During the quarter, SBU strengthened both the NAND and SSD product portfolios having now entered fully ramped production and customer qualification of 3D TLC NAND clients and cloud drives. Our ramp of 3D TLC cost competitive products will position us to effectively participate more fully in this growth segment. SBU is also benefiting from the favorable supply demand balance in the industry, with like-for-like pricing improving for many products. Demand drivers look strong for the foreseeable future.
Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $3.97 billion, up 23% sequentially and driven by strong volume shipments for DRAM combined with increasing ASPs. Trade NAND shipments also increased as a result of the successful crossover of 3D production which occurred in the quarter and we experienced stable blended ASPs, with like-for-like ASPs trending up in many cases. Non-GAAP operating -- excuse me, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 26%, up from 19% in the prior quarter driven by a strong pricing environment, particularly for DRAM and solid execution on cost per bit reductions. NAND cost reductions were driven by an ongoing ramp of 3D and the portfolio shifting to higher density TLC enabled solutions. Non-GAAP net income was $335 million or $0.32 per share.
Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 24% compared to the prior quarter as a result of an 18% increase in bit shipments and a 5% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the first quarter increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 28%, primarily driven by the strong pricing environment and continued 20-nanometer ramp. Our nonvolatile trade revenue increased 26% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 26% increase in bit shipments. ASPs were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter on a blended basis. Gross margin increased 6 percentage points sequentially to 23% as cost per bit was down 8%, benefiting from the 3D and TLC ramps. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $594 million, slightly below the lower end of our guided range, driven by lower prequalification expenses, lower legal costs and higher expense sharing credits. The company generated cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of $200 million over the last quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.3 billion. In the first fiscal quarter, capital expenditures, net of partner contributions, were approximately $1.18 billion.
Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.7 billion; gross margin in the range of 31% to 34%; operating expenses between $590 million and $640 million; operating income ranging between $800 million and $900 million; and EPS ranging between $0.58 and $0.68 per share based on 1,123,000,000 diluted shares.
Please note that as indicated earlier this month, we expect the impact from the Inotera acquisition to be accretive beginning this quarter, specifically, for fiscal quarter 2, we expect the accretion to positively impact gross margins by low single-digit percentage and contribute approximately $0.02 to EPS. These impacts have already been included in the guidance I just provided and will not be further distinguished as we provide guidance in future quarters. From an operational perspective, we remain on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that was previously shared and we look forward to sharing more details on our progress and plans at our analyst conference on February 2.
With that, I will turn it back to Mark."

Relative to what Micron has said about our interests in China, we have a great interest in doing business in China. We have large existing operations there, including back end operations, circuit design, product engineering activities as well as software and firmware activities. So we have a lot of activity in China already from an operations perspective and we have a large number of important customers over there. So we stay fully engaged with China and continue to expect to have strong relationships there and grow our business.

Some of the specific segments, that are value add that are pretty important things like graphics, we grew our graphics business pretty substantially this year. In many cases, [indiscernible] sole-source relationships or 2 sources at most and a significant piece of the customers end product and so those types of relationships I think are flagships for that kind of thought process. Automobile, also, I think is another one where Micron has very significant market share deep relationships with the customers and trust that we're going to be there for them with the right products as markets tighten up."

The biggest change structurally in the market though really is the fact that the products are going in a much broader set of end markets or much more broadly distributed. Now, we're 3 or 4 years on from where we were in the last cycle and I think that does make a difference. On top of that -- I'll add one more piece to that, which is, sort of a long-term trend that we talked about in the past in terms of slowing technology migrations means that competitors in the marketplace are likely doing math with numbers that are changing less rapidly than they used to be. So both from a demand and supply perspective, as those numbers get smaller and the slope gets smaller and the rate of change, it gets a little bit easier to do the math and to keep things in balance. Finally, as you layer on what's going on with NAND right now from a demand perspective, just explosive, I think, is probably the right word in terms of demand and elastic as well. And so I think there's may be some insulation there that wasn't there last time around."

For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow",1146,"Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion.
In the first quarter, we saw an acceleration of the positive market condition that began this fall. For the industry, supply is slowing, demand is strong in a number of key segments and inventory is at low levels. Prices have been strengthening on a like-for-like basis across all leading edge DRAM and NAND products and we see these trends continuing into the current quarter. To give you some perspective and pricing dynamics, after declining for roughly 18 months, PC DRAM ASPs are up 50% to 60% compared to the trough pricing driven by an improvement in demand, historically low inventory levels and the impact of supply ships to other segments. In contrast, all other DRAM segments declined substantially less so in the same period and are recovering at a slower rate. Given the duration of the broad supply and demand tightness in the market, we are currently seeing improvements in quarter-over-quarter pricing trends in these non-PC segments.
Taking all these variables together, blended DRAM ASPs are essentially flat compared to the same period last year. With this in mind and as we look at our current quarter, operational execution is driving DRAM sales up more than $1 billion year-over-year while our cost of goods sold is up only about half this amount, driving substantial improvements in gross margins.
Product mix has a more significant impact on the NAND's landscape, where we are also experiencing like-for-like pricing increases. However, we are also shifting our product portfolio to 3D and TLC NAND, which enables higher density and lower cost products that also have lower ASPs. Taken together, blended NAND ASPs are down approximately 10% year-over-year while gross margins are up meaningfully.
Turning to the industry outlook. We're currently -- we currently expect 2017 DRAM bid supply growth in the 15% to 20% range. This is based on an assumption that suppliers won't add significant wafer capacity to the industry but will continue to focus on process build migrations to enable cost reductions and actual supply growth. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 20% to 25%. We expect favorable supply demand dynamics to persist in 2017. For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 40% to 45%. 3D conversions continue to be a headwind to industry supply growth. This factor, along with strong demand for storage and mobile solutions, sets up for a well-balanced supply and demand dynamic in 2017.
I'll now provide a high-level overview of each of our business units and Ernie will follow with more details on their specific financial performances. In the Compute and Networking Business Unit, we experienced revenue growth as a result of strengthening -- or strength in demand. We executed well to our 20-nanometer shipment plan and achieved key qualifications of 64-gigabyte LRDIMMs at multiple server customers. We also continued our strong performance in the graphics segment, where our GDDR5X technology leads competitors. In our Mobile Business Unit, the completion of our customer qualifications drove substantial revenue and profit growth this quarter. As noted last quarter, we continue to see the Chinese market driving mobile growth and higher memory content for smartphone. We had strong growth in our LPDRAM and mobile NAND product lines and are focused on new qualification opportunities as we see the mobile market as one of the strongest growth drivers of our business. Our embedded business was driven by strong demand across a variety of segments. Our NAND-based MCPs continue in business in machine-to-machine communications modules and our strong portfolio also brought us significant share in several new home automation and action camera platforms this quarter. We expect our new application optimize SD cards to drive market share gains within both industrial and connected home segments.
Our automotive business had another excellent quarter. We're securing an increasing number of automotive design wins on our leading edge managed NAND and 20-nanometer DRAM products. We also see automotive demand for advanced memory technologies accelerating as more sophisticated ADAS systems come to market in the years ahead. Our Storage Business Unit continues to make progress, shifting our portfolio to advanced 3D NAND technologies. First, the 1,100 client SSDs we announced last quarter completed qualifications and we commenced volume shipments with several major customers. This complements our crucial MX300 consumer drive which is currently shipping at high volumes. Additionally, we announced our cloud-based 5100 SATA eSSD earlier this month, offering industry-leading performance in 8 terabyte capacities. All 3 of these SSDs are built with our TLC 3D NAND and illustrate our focused portfolio transition to this high-capacity, high-performance and cost-effective technology.
We continue to provide updates with respect to critical targets related to operational execution originally shared at our Analyst Day in August 2015. Thus far, these milestones include a big cross over on 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND and the SSD product release roadmap have all been achieved on or ahead of schedule. Our 2 bit -- our 2-year bit growth and cost per bit targets remain on track and we continue to be focused on delivering to our commitments. Our focus in DRAM this year is primarily related to the deployment of our 1X nanometer technology. We're targeting meaningful output on 1X by the latter part of fiscal 2017. We expect to generate approximately 20% to 25% cost per bit reductions in fiscal 2017. Our cash cost for bit declines will be well above this range. For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen1 3D as well as TLC. We've also commenced production on our second generation 64-layer 3D technology and we're targeting meaningful output by the latter part of fiscal 2017. The 3D and TLC ramps will deliver 20% to 25% cost per bit improvement in fiscal 2017. This cost per bit includes the impact of expanding our SSD, eMCP and managed NAND solutions, which carry additional bill of materials and costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix.
Relative to 3D XPoint technology, we will be shipping our QuantX solutions for revenue in 2017 and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success.
This month, just after our quarter closed, we finalized the acquisition of Inotera in Taiwan, which we expect to continue to provide strategic and financial opportunities for the company. We're excited to welcome the Inotera team to Micron and look forward to realizing the benefits of the new operating model.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."
289030,410555004,1104725,"Micron Technology, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","Micron Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance range as we provided in October. Today, I'll fir",1269,"Thank you, Mark. As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance range as we provided in October. Today, I'll first discuss some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's results for the quarter and guidance for our fiscal second quarter.
DRAM represented 61% of our total revenue, with the following segmentation: mobile represented about 30%, up from 25% the prior quarter; the PC segment was in the mid-20% range; and the server business was in the high teens percent range. Specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the mid-20% range, down from the prior quarter. 
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 32% of total revenue, with the following segmentation: consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented 40%, down from the prior quarter; mobile was in the low 20% range, up from the prior quarter, as we saw the continued impact of our completed customer qualifications. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-teens range, up from the prior quarter and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the 20% range.
Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit reported fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.47 billion, up 18% sequentially, primarily due to stronger demand and higher 20-nanometer shipments and a stronger pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating profit was $204 million or 14% of revenue. In the enterprise segment, we executed well in shipping 20-nanometer solutions to the market and qualified several lower cost products at multiple customers. Cloud with CNBU's fastest-growing segment and Micron is now qualified on most high-volume sockets for the top customers in this segment. Demand is being driven by both our leading edge DDR4 solutions, as well as continuing need for DDR3. In graphics, we had continued share growth in GDDR with our major graphics customers. New graphics card launches and strong console sales sustain favorable demand for both GDDR5 and GDDR5X. In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer 4 gigabyte DDR3 and 8 gigabyte DDR4. We continue to see strong interest in our high-performance memory portfolio as well. Finally, within the client segment, ASP strength exceeded our expectations and solid execution on 20-nanometer drove improved shipments and cost reductions. The mobile business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.03 billion, up 54% sequentially, driven by completed customer qualifications and strong sales of LPDRAM and mobile NAND products in an improved pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating income was $89 million or 9% of revenue as we continued to ramp our 20-nanometer products and made substantial progress reducing higher costs early production inventory. The Embedded Business Unit delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $578 million, up 13% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $178 million or 31% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by seasonally strong consumer business and record automotive revenue. Embedded ASP trends tend to be more stable compared to the broader compute and mobile markets but we are beginning to see the benefit of tightening supply demand in this business unit as well. Consumer revenue was up 25% sequentially, driven by home automation and camera application. In addition, our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into some 4K set-top box applications. The automotive business performed well, with revenue up 7% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. These solid results continue to be driven by strong and increasing demand for both DDR3 and e.MMC solutions for infotainment instrument cluster and LPDRAM for advanced driver systems applications. The industrial and multi-market business increased 6% sequentially, with a strong quarter for our NOR business combined with ramping our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see growing demand for our industrial grade managed NAND solutions. The storage business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $860 million, up 13% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 5% of revenue. During the quarter, SBU strengthened both the NAND and SSD product portfolios having now entered fully ramped production and customer qualification of 3D TLC NAND clients and cloud drives. Our ramp of 3D TLC cost competitive products will position us to effectively participate more fully in this growth segment. SBU is also benefiting from the favorable supply demand balance in the industry, with like-for-like pricing improving for many products. Demand drivers look strong for the foreseeable future.
Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $3.97 billion, up 23% sequentially and driven by strong volume shipments for DRAM combined with increasing ASPs. Trade NAND shipments also increased as a result of the successful crossover of 3D production which occurred in the quarter and we experienced stable blended ASPs, with like-for-like ASPs trending up in many cases. Non-GAAP operating -- excuse me, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 26%, up from 19% in the prior quarter driven by a strong pricing environment, particularly for DRAM and solid execution on cost per bit reductions. NAND cost reductions were driven by an ongoing ramp of 3D and the portfolio shifting to higher density TLC enabled solutions. Non-GAAP net income was $335 million or $0.32 per share.
Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 24% compared to the prior quarter as a result of an 18% increase in bit shipments and a 5% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the first quarter increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 28%, primarily driven by the strong pricing environment and continued 20-nanometer ramp. Our nonvolatile trade revenue increased 26% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 26% increase in bit shipments. ASPs were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter on a blended basis. Gross margin increased 6 percentage points sequentially to 23% as cost per bit was down 8%, benefiting from the 3D and TLC ramps. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $594 million, slightly below the lower end of our guided range, driven by lower prequalification expenses, lower legal costs and higher expense sharing credits. The company generated cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of $200 million over the last quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.3 billion. In the first fiscal quarter, capital expenditures, net of partner contributions, were approximately $1.18 billion.
Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.7 billion; gross margin in the range of 31% to 34%; operating expenses between $590 million and $640 million; operating income ranging between $800 million and $900 million; and EPS ranging between $0.58 and $0.68 per share based on 1,123,000,000 diluted shares.
Please note that as indicated earlier this month, we expect the impact from the Inotera acquisition to be accretive beginning this quarter, specifically, for fiscal quarter 2, we expect the accretion to positively impact gross margins by low single-digit percentage and contribute approximately $0.02 to EPS. These impacts have already been included in the guidance I just provided and will not be further distinguished as we provide guidance in future quarters. From an operational perspective, we remain on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that was previously shared and we look forward to sharing more details on our progress and plans at our analyst conference on February 2.
With that, I will turn it back to Mark."

On average for the mobile market, probably moving to 2.4 gigabytes of DRAM and high 30s, somewhere in the 35 to 40, maybe in the middle of that range, in terms of gigabytes of NAND.

So first of all, let me say that comments that I make in the press are sometimes not in the full context of the discussion I had. I think one of the things to think about in terms of what might or might not happen in China is that these things do take time. Our investment cycles take place over periods of useful life of equipment 5 years so we think in the long term, when we think about investing in our business to make sure that we're being good stewards of the shareholders' money, but anything that would happen there is going to play out over many years and having a crystal ball as to exactly how that will play out is difficult to say. Relative to what Micron has said about our interests in China, we have a great interest in doing business in China. We have large existing operations there, including back end operations, circuit design, product engineering activities as well as software and firmware activities. So we have a lot of activity in China already from an operations perspective and we have a large number of important customers over there. So we stay fully engaged with China and continue to expect to have strong relationships there and grow our business. Relative to whether we would undertake any expansion or licensing activity in China, what we said is really as it has been, which is our job is to look for opportunities to make Micron a stronger company, and we will continue to investigate lots of options about ways to generate shareholder value whether it's in China or any other part of the world. And that's just part of us being effective managers of the company and we'll continue to do that and if we can figure out things that make the company stronger, we'll always consider that in terms of the long-term benefits and act accordingly."

I'm wondering if you can talk about the 1X transition for you. It seems like there's 2 vectors where you might be able to close that gap. One, it just seems like a better strength for you than maybe your peers, and two, correct me if I'm wrong, but most of Rex Chip, I believe, is still a 25-nanometer. So it might seem to me that as you guys move to 1X, you'll have a bigger wafer start days at 1X than you had at 20 nanometers. Am I thinking about that the right way?

So that gap will continue to narrow with the forecast we've given you. Specifically, relative to 110 series, yes, it's a good strength we have. As I mentioned, we've got a number of different products coming. Some of them are bigger shrimps [ph] than others and we're pretty particularly excited about some of the ones that come later in the fiscal year that really drive out a lot of cost in die size as opposed to some of the ones that come earlier and fill value-added potential segments or specific power performance attributes that the customers are looking for. Beyond that, I think it's fair to say that we should get good bang for the buck on this technology transition, not only because it's a substantial strength, but also because a chunk of it, a large chunk of it's happening in Taichung so we're actually transitioning capacity from 25-nanometer all the way down to 1X. So it's -- as we did with 20-nanometer in Hiroshima and Inotera, and a big chunk of that capacity at Inotera was a double hop from 30-nanometer to 20-nanometer, this will be a double hop from 25 to 1X at the Taichung fab and so there's a pretty good bang for the buck there."

The biggest change structurally in the market though really is the fact that the products are going in a much broader set of end markets or much more broadly distributed. Now we're 3 or 4 years on from where we were in the last cycle and I think that does make a difference. On top of that -- and Mark, I'll add one more piece to that, which is, sort of a long-term trend that we talked about in the past in terms of slowing technology migrations means that competitors in the marketplace are likely doing math with numbers that are changing less rapidly than they used to be. So both from a demand and a supply perspective, as those numbers get smaller and the slope gets smaller and the rate of change, it gets a little bit easier to do the math and it keeps things in balance. And then finally, as you layer on what's going on with NAND right now from a demand perspective, just explosive, I think, is probably the right word in terms of demand and elastic as well. And so I think there's may be some insulation there that wasn't there last time around."

For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow",1143,"Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion.
In the first quarter, we saw an acceleration of the positive market conditions that began this fall. For the industry, supply is slowing, demand is strong in a number of key segments and inventory is at low levels. Prices have been strengthening on a like-for-like basis across all leading edge DRAM and NAND products and we see these trends continuing into the current quarter. To give you some perspective and pricing dynamics, after declining for roughly 18 months, PC DRAM ASPs are up 50% to 60% compared to the trough pricing driven by an improvement in demand, historically low inventory levels and the impact of supply shifts to other segments. In contrast, all other DRAM segments declined substantially less so in the same period and are recovering at a slower rate. Given the duration of the broad supply and demand tightness in the market, we are currently seeing improvements in quarter-over-quarter pricing trends in these non-PC segments.
Taking all these variables together, blended DRAM ASPs are essentially flat compared to the same period last year. With this in mind and as we look at our current quarter, operational execution is driving DRAM sales up more than $1 billion year-over-year while our cost of goods sold is up only about half this amount, driving substantial improvements in gross margins.
Product mix has a more significant impact on NAND's landscape, where we are also experiencing like-for-like pricing increases. However, we are also shifting our product portfolio to 3D and TLC NAND, which enables higher density and lower cost products that also have lower ASPs. Taken together, blended NAND ASPs are down approximately 10% year-over-year while gross margins are up meaningfully.
Turning to the industry outlook. We're currently -- we currently expect 2017 DRAM bit supply growth in the 15% to 20% range. This is based on an assumption that suppliers won't add significant wafer capacity to the industry but will continue to focus on process node migrations to enable cost reductions and actual supply growth. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 20% to 25%. We expect favorable supply demand dynamics to persist in 2017. For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 40% to 45%. 3D conversions continue to be a headwind to industry supply growth. This factor, along with strong demand for storage and mobile solutions, sets up for a well-balanced supply and demand dynamic in 2017.
I'll now provide a high-level overview of each of our business units and Ernie will follow with more details on their specific financial performances. In the Compute and Networking Business Unit, we experienced revenue growth as a result of strengthening -- or strengthened demand. We executed well to our 20-nanometer shipment plan and achieved key qualifications of 64-gigabyte LRDIMMs at multiple server customers. We also continued our strong performance in the graphics segment, where our GDDR5X technology leads competitors. In our Mobile Business Unit, the completion of our customer qualifications drove substantial revenue and profit growth this quarter. As noted last quarter, we continue to see the Chinese market driving mobile growth and higher memory content for smartphones. We had strong growth in our LPDRAM and mobile NAND product lines and are focused on new qualification opportunities as we see the mobile market as one of the strongest growth drivers of our business. Our embedded business was driven by strong demand across a variety of segments. Our NAND-based MCPs continue in business and machine-to-machine communications modules and our strong portfolio also brought us significant share in several new home automation and action camera platforms this quarter. We expect our new application-optimized SD cards to drive market share gains within both industrial and connected home segments.
Our automotive business had another excellent quarter. We're securing an increasing number of automotive design wins on our leading edge managed NAND and 20-nanometer DRAM products. We also see automotive demand for advanced memory technologies accelerating as more sophisticated ADAS systems come to market in the years ahead. Our Storage Business Unit continues to make progress, shifting our portfolio to advanced 3D NAND technologies. First, the 1,100 client SSDs we announced last quarter completed qualifications and we commenced volume shipments with several major customers. This complements our crucial MX300 consumer drive which is currently shipping at high volumes. Additionally, we announced our cloud-based 5100 SATA eSSD earlier this month, offering industry-leading performance in 8 terabyte capacities. All 3 of these SSDs are built with our TLC 3D NAND and illustrate our focused portfolio transition to this high-capacity, high-performance and cost-effective technology.
We continue to provide updates with respect to critical targets related to operational execution originally shared at our Analyst Day in August of 2015. Thus far, these milestones, including a big crossover on 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND and the SSD product release roadmap, have all been achieved on or ahead of schedule. Our 2 bit -- our 2-year bit growth and cost per bit targets remain on track and we continue to be focused on delivering to our commitments. Our focus in DRAM this year is primarily related to the deployment of our 1X nanometer technology. We're targeting meaningful output on 1X by the latter part of fiscal 2017. We expect to generate approximately 20% to 25% cost per bit reductions in fiscal 2017. Our cash cost for bit declines will be well above this range. For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen1 3D as well as TLC. We've also commenced production on our second generation 64-layer 3D technology and we're targeting meaningful output by the latter part of fiscal 2017. The 3D and TLC ramps will deliver 20% to 25% cost per bit improvement in fiscal 2017. This cost per bit includes the impact of expanding our SSD, eMCP and managed NAND solutions, which carry additional bill of materials and costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix.
Relative to 3D XPoint technology, we will be shipping our QuantX solutions for revenue in 2017 and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success.
This month, just after our quarter closed, we finalized the acquisition of Inotera in Taiwan, which we expect to continue to provide strategic and financial opportunities for the company. We're excited to welcome the Inotera team to Micron and look forward to realizing the benefits of the new operating model.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."
289030,410555004,1104737,"Micron Technology, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","Micron Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Today, I'll first",1266,"Thank you, Mark. As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Today, I'll first discuss some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's results for the quarter and guidance for our fiscal second quarter.
DRAM represented 61% of our total revenue, with the following segmentation: mobile represented about 30%, up from 25% the prior quarter; the PC segment was in the mid-20% range; and the server business was in the high teens percent range. Specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the mid-20% range, down from the prior quarter. 
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 32% of total revenue, with the following segmentation: consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented 40%, down from the prior quarter; mobile was in the low 20% range, up from the prior quarter, as we saw the continued impact of our completed customer qualifications. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-teens range, up from the prior quarter and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the 20% range.
Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit reported fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.47 billion, up 18% sequentially, primarily due to stronger demand and higher 20-nanometer shipments and a stronger pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating profit was $204 million or 14% of revenue. In the enterprise segment, we executed well in shipping 20-nanometer solutions to the market and qualified several lower-cost products at multiple customers. Cloud was CNBU's fastest-growing segment and Micron is now qualified on most high-volume sockets for the top customers in this segment. Demand is being driven by both our leading edge DDR4 solutions, as well as continuing need for DDR3. In graphics, we had continued share growth in GDDR with our major graphics customers. New graphics card launches and strong console sales sustained favorable demand for both GDDR5 and GDDR5X. In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer 4 gigabyte DDR3 and 8 gigabyte DDR4. We continue to see strong interest in our high-performance memory portfolio as well. Finally, within the client segment, ASP strength exceeded our expectations and solid execution on 20-nanometer drove improved shipments and cost reductions. The mobile business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.03 billion, up 54% sequentially, driven by completed customer qualifications and strong sales of LPDRAM and mobile NAND products in an improved pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating income was $89 million or 9% of revenue as we continued to ramp our 20-nanometer products and made substantial progress reducing higher-cost early production inventory. The Embedded Business Unit delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $578 million, up 13% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $178 million or 31% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by seasonally strong consumer business and record automotive revenue. Embedded ASP trends tend to be more stable compared to the broader compute and mobile markets but we are beginning to see the benefit of tightening supply demand in this business unit as well. Consumer revenue was up 25% sequentially, driven by home automation and camera application. In addition, our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continued to ramp into some 4K set-top box applications. The automotive business performed well, with revenue up 7% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. These solid results continue to be driven by strong and increasing demand for both DDR3 and e.MMC solutions for infotainment instrument cluster and LPDRAM for advanced driver systems applications. The industrial and multi-market business increased 6% sequentially, with a strong quarter for our NOR business combined with ramping our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see growing demand for our industrial grade managed NAND solutions. The storage business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $860 million, up 13% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 5% of revenue. During the quarter, SBU strengthened both the NAND and SSD product portfolios, having now entered fully ramped production and customer qualification of 3D TLC NAND clients and cloud drives. Our ramp of 3D TLC cost competitive products will position us to effectively participate more fully in this growth segment. SBU is also benefiting from the favorable supply demand balance in the industry, with like-for-like pricing improving for many products. Demand drivers look strong for the foreseeable future.
Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $3.97 billion, up 23% sequentially and driven by strong volume shipments for DRAM combined with increasing ASPs. Trade NAND shipments also increased as a result of the successful crossover of 3D production which occurred in the quarter and we experienced stable blended ASPs, with like-for-like ASPs trending up in many cases. Non-GAAP operating -- excuse me, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 26%, up from 19% in the prior quarter, driven by a strong pricing environment, particularly for DRAM and solid execution on cost per bit reductions. NAND cost reductions were driven by an ongoing ramp of 3D and the portfolio shifting to higher density TLC enabled solutions. Non-GAAP net income was $335 million or $0.32 per share.
Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 24% compared to the prior quarter as a result of an 18% increase in bit shipments and a 5% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the first quarter increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 28%, primarily driven by the strong pricing environment and continued 20-nanometer ramp. Our nonvolatile trade revenue increased 26% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 26% increase in bit shipments. ASPs were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter on a blended basis. Gross margin increased 6 percentage points sequentially to 23% as cost per bit was down 8%, benefiting from the 3D and TLC ramps. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $594 million, slightly below the lower end of our guided range, driven by lower prequalification expenses, lower legal costs and higher expense sharing credits. The company generated cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of $200 million over the last quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.3 billion. In the first fiscal quarter, capital expenditures, net of partner contributions, were approximately $1.18 billion.
Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.7 billion; gross margin in the range of 31% to 34%; operating expenses between $590 million and $640 million; operating income ranging between $800 million and $900 million; and EPS ranging between $0.58 and $0.68 per share based on 1,123,000,000 diluted shares.
Please note that as indicated earlier this month, we expect the impact from the Inotera acquisition to be accretive beginning this quarter. Specifically, for fiscal quarter 2, we expect the accretion to positively impact gross margins by low single-digit percentage and contribute approximately $0.02 to EPS. These impacts have already been included in the guidance I just provided and will not be further distinguished as we provide guidance in future quarters. From an operational perspective, we remain on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that was previously shared and we look forward to sharing more details on our progress and plans at our analyst conference on February 2.
With that, I will turn it back to Mark."

On average for the mobile market, probably moving to 2.4 gigabytes of DRAM and the high 30s, somewhere in the 35 to 40, maybe in the middle of that range, in terms of gigabytes of NAND. So now if you net that out, that's almost 20% DRAM bit growth per system and maybe a little north of 40% on NAND.

So first of all, let me say that comments that I make in the press are sometimes not in the full context of the discussion I had. I think one of the things to think about in terms of what might or might not happen in China is that these things do take time. Our investment cycles take place over periods of useful life of equipment 5 years so we think in the long term, when we think about investing in our business to make sure that we're being good stewards of the shareholders' money, but anything that would happen there is going to play out over many years, and having a crystal ball as to exactly how that will play out is difficult to say. Relative to what Micron has said about our interests in China, we have a great interest in doing business in China. We have large existing operations there, including back end operations, circuit design, product engineering activities as well as software and firmware activities. So we have a lot of activity in China already from an operations perspective and we have a large number of important customers over there. So we stay fully engaged with China and continue to expect to have strong relationships there and grow our business. Relative to whether we would undertake any expansion or licensing activity in China, what we said is really as it has been, which is our job is to look for opportunities to make Micron a stronger company, and we will continue to investigate lots of options about ways to generate shareholder value whether it's in China or any other part of the world. And that's just part of us being effective managers of the company and we'll continue to do that and if we can figure out things that make the company stronger, we'll always consider that in terms of the long-term benefits and act accordingly."

I'm wondering if you can talk about the 1X transition for you. It seems like there's 2 vectors where you might be able to close that gap. One, it just seems like a better strength for you than maybe your peers, and two, correct me if I'm wrong, but most of Rex Chip, I believe, is still a 25-nanometer. So it might seem to me that as you guys move to 1X, you'll have a bigger wafer start days at 1X than you had at 20 nanometers. Am I thinking about that the right way?

So that gap will continue to narrow with the forecast we've given you. Specifically, relative to 110 series, yes, it's a good strength we have. As I mentioned, we've got a number of different products coming. Some of them are bigger shrimps than others and we're pretty particularly excited about some of the ones that come later in the fiscal year that really drive out a lot of cost in die size as opposed to some of the ones that come earlier and fill value-added potential segments or specific power performance attributes that the customers are looking for. Beyond that, I think it's fair to say that we should get a good bang for the buck on this technology transition, not only because it's a substantial shrink, but also because a chunk of it -- a large chunk of it's happening in Taichung so we're actually transitioning capacity from 25-nanometer all the way down to 1X. So it's -- as we did with 20-nanometer in Hiroshima and Inotera, and a big chunk of that capacity at Inotera was a double hop from 30-nanometer to 20-nanometer, this will be a double hop from 25 to 1X at the Taichung fab and so there's a pretty good bang for the buck there."

The biggest change structurally in the market, though, really is the fact that the products are going in a much broader set of end markets or are much more broadly distributed. Now we're 3 or 4 years on from where we were in the last cycle and I think that does make a difference. On top of that -- and Mark, I'll add one more piece to that, which is, sort of a long-term trend that we talked about in the past in terms of slowing technology migrations means that competitors in the marketplace are likely doing math with numbers that are changing less rapidly than they used to be. So both from a demand and a supply perspective, as those numbers get smaller and the slope gets smaller and the rate of change, it gets a little bit easier to do the math and it keeps things in balance. And then finally, as you layer on what's going on with NAND right now from a demand perspective, just explosive, I think, is probably the right word in terms of demand and elastic as well. And so I think there's may be some insulation there that wasn't there last time around."

For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow",1143,"Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion.
In the first quarter, we saw an acceleration of the positive market conditions that began this fall. For the industry, supply is slowing, demand is strong in a number of key segments and inventory is at low levels. Prices have been strengthening on a like-for-like basis across all leading edge DRAM and NAND products and we see these trends continuing into the current quarter. To give you some perspective and pricing dynamics, after declining for roughly 18 months, PC DRAM ASPs are up 50% to 60% compared to the trough pricing driven by an improvement in demand, historically low inventory levels and the impact of supply shifts to other segments. In contrast, all other DRAM segments declined substantially less so in the same period and are recovering at a slower rate. Given the duration of the broad supply and demand tightness in the market, we are currently seeing improvements in quarter-over-quarter pricing trends in these non-PC segments.
Taking all these variables together, blended DRAM ASPs are essentially flat compared to the same period last year. With this in mind and as we look at our current quarter, operational execution is driving DRAM sales up more than $1 billion year-over-year while our cost of goods sold is up only about half this amount, driving substantial improvements in gross margins.
Product mix has a more significant impact on NAND's landscape, where we are also experiencing like-for-like pricing increases. However, we are also shifting our product portfolio to 3D and TLC NAND, which enables higher density and lower cost products that also have lower ASPs. Taken together, blended NAND ASPs are down approximately 10% year-over-year while gross margins are up meaningfully.
Turning to the industry outlook. We're currently -- we currently expect 2017 DRAM bit supply growth in the 15% to 20% range. This is based on an assumption that suppliers won't add significant wafer capacity to the industry but will continue to focus on process node migrations to enable cost reductions and actual supply growth. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 20% to 25%. We expect favorable supply demand dynamics to persist in 2017. For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 40% to 45%. 3D conversions continue to be a headwind to industry supply growth. This factor, along with strong demand for storage and mobile solutions, sets up for a well-balanced supply and demand dynamic in 2017.
I'll now provide a high-level overview of each of our business units and Ernie will follow with more details on their specific financial performances. In the Compute and Networking Business Unit, we experienced revenue growth as a result of strengthening -- or strengthened demand. We executed well to our 20-nanometer shipment plan and achieved key qualifications of 64-gigabyte LRDIMMs at multiple server customers. We also continued our strong performance in the graphics segment, where our GDDR5X technology leads competitors. In our Mobile Business Unit, the completion of our customer qualifications drove substantial revenue and profit growth this quarter. As noted last quarter, we continue to see the Chinese market driving mobile growth and higher memory content for smartphones. We had strong growth in our LPDRAM and mobile NAND product lines and are focused on new qualification opportunities as we see the mobile market as one of the strongest growth drivers of our business. Our embedded business was driven by strong demand across a variety of segments. Our NAND-based MCPs continue in business and machine-to-machine communications modules and our strong portfolio also brought us significant share in several new home automation and action camera platforms this quarter. We expect our new application-optimized SD cards to drive market share gains within both industrial and connected home segments.
Our automotive business had another excellent quarter. We're securing an increasing number of automotive design wins on our leading edge managed NAND and 20-nanometer DRAM products. We also see automotive demand for advanced memory technologies accelerating as more sophisticated ADAS systems come to market in the years ahead. Our Storage Business Unit continues to make progress, shifting our portfolio to advanced 3D NAND technologies. First, the 1,100 client SSDs we announced last quarter completed qualifications and we commenced volume shipments with several major customers. This complements our crucial MX300 consumer drive which is currently shipping at high volumes. Additionally, we announced our cloud-based 5100 SATA eSSD earlier this month, offering industry-leading performance in 8 terabyte capacities. All 3 of these SSDs are built with our TLC 3D NAND and illustrate our focused portfolio transition to this high-capacity, high-performance and cost-effective technology.
We continue to provide updates with respect to critical targets related to operational execution originally shared at our Analyst Day in August of 2015. Thus far, these milestones, including a big crossover on 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND and the SSD product release roadmap, have all been achieved on or ahead of schedule. Our 2 bit -- our 2-year bit growth and cost per bit targets remain on track and we continue to be focused on delivering to our commitments. Our focus in DRAM this year is primarily related to the deployment of our 1X nanometer technology. We're targeting meaningful output on 1X by the latter part of fiscal 2017. We expect to generate approximately 20% to 25% cost per bit reductions in fiscal 2017. Our cash cost for bit declines will be well above this range. For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen1 3D as well as TLC. We've also commenced production on our second generation 64-layer 3D technology and we're targeting meaningful output by the latter part of fiscal 2017. The 3D and TLC ramps will deliver 20% to 25% cost per bit improvement in fiscal 2017. This cost per bit includes the impact of expanding our SSD, eMCP and managed NAND solutions, which carry additional bill of materials and costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix.
Relative to 3D XPoint technology, we will be shipping our QuantX solutions for revenue in 2017 and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success.
This month, just after our quarter closed, we finalized the acquisition of Inotera in Taiwan, which we expect to continue to provide strategic and financial opportunities for the company. We're excited to welcome the Inotera team to Micron and look forward to realizing the benefits of the new operating model.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie."
289030,410555004,1105125,"Micron Technology, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","Micron Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Today, I'll first",1266,"Thank you, Mark. As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Today, I'll first discuss some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's results for the quarter and guidance for our fiscal second quarter.
DRAM represented 61% of our total revenue, with the following segmentation: mobile represented about 30%, up from 25% the prior quarter; the PC segment was in the mid-20% range; and the server business was in the high teens percent range. Specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the mid-20% range, down from the prior quarter. 
In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 32% of total revenue, with the following segmentation: consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented 40%, down from the prior quarter; mobile was in the low 20% range, up from the prior quarter, as we saw the continued impact of our completed customer qualifications. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-teens range, up from the prior quarter and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the 20% range.
Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit reported fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.47 billion, up 18% sequentially, primarily due to stronger demand and higher 20-nanometer shipments and a stronger pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating profit was $204 million or 14% of revenue. In the enterprise segment, we executed well in shipping 20-nanometer solutions to the market and qualified several lower-cost products at multiple customers. Cloud was CNBU's fastest-growing segment and Micron is now qualified on most high-volume sockets for the top customers in this segment. Demand is being driven by both our leading edge DDR4 solutions, as well as continuing need for DDR3. In graphics, we had continued share growth in GDDR with our major graphics customers. New graphics card launches and strong console sales sustained favorable demand for both GDDR5 and GDDR5X. In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer 4 gigabyte DDR3 and 8 gigabyte DDR4. We continue to see strong interest in our high-performance memory portfolio as well. Finally, within the client segment, ASP strength exceeded our expectations and solid execution on 20-nanometer drove improved shipments and cost reductions. The mobile business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.03 billion, up 54% sequentially, driven by completed customer qualifications and strong sales of LPDRAM and mobile NAND products in an improved pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating income was $89 million or 9% of revenue as we continued to ramp our 20-nanometer products and made substantial progress reducing higher-cost early production inventory. The Embedded Business Unit delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $578 million, up 13% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $178 million or 31% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by seasonally strong consumer business and record automotive revenue. Embedded ASP trends tend to be more stable compared to the broader compute and mobile markets but we are beginning to see the benefit of tightening supply demand in this business unit as well. Consumer revenue was up 25% sequentially, driven by home automation and camera application. In addition, our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continued to ramp into some 4K set-top box applications. The automotive business performed well, with revenue up 7% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. These solid results continue to be driven by strong and increasing demand for both DDR3 and e.MMC solutions for infotainment instrument cluster and LPDRAM for advanced driver systems applications. The industrial and multi-market business increased 6% sequentially, with a strong quarter for our NOR business combined with ramping our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see growing demand for our industrial grade managed NAND solutions. The storage business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $860 million, up 13% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 5% of revenue. During the quarter, SBU strengthened both the NAND and SSD product portfolios, having now entered fully ramped production and customer qualification of 3D TLC NAND clients and cloud drives. Our ramp of 3D TLC cost competitive products will position us to effectively participate more fully in this growth segment. SBU is also benefiting from the favorable supply demand balance in the industry, with like-for-like pricing improving for many products. Demand drivers look strong for the foreseeable future.
Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $3.97 billion, up 23% sequentially and driven by strong volume shipments for DRAM combined with increasing ASPs. Trade NAND shipments also increased as a result of the successful crossover of 3D production which occurred in the quarter and we experienced stable blended ASPs, with like-for-like ASPs trending up in many cases. Non-GAAP operating -- excuse me, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 26%, up from 19% in the prior quarter, driven by a strong pricing environment, particularly for DRAM and solid execution on cost per bit reductions. NAND cost reductions were driven by an ongoing ramp of 3D and the portfolio shifting to higher density TLC enabled solutions. Non-GAAP net income was $335 million or $0.32 per share.
Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 24% compared to the prior quarter as a result of an 18% increase in bit shipments and a 5% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the first quarter increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 28%, primarily driven by the strong pricing environment and continued 20-nanometer ramp. Our nonvolatile trade revenue increased 26% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 26% increase in bit shipments. ASPs were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter on a blended basis. Gross margin increased 6 percentage points sequentially to 23% as cost per bit was down 8%, benefiting from the 3D and TLC ramps. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $594 million, slightly below the lower end of our guided range, driven by lower prequalification expenses, lower legal costs and higher expense sharing credits. The company generated cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of $200 million over the last quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.3 billion. In the first fiscal quarter, capital expenditures, net of partner contributions, were approximately $1.18 billion.
Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.7 billion; gross margin in the range of 31% to 34%; operating expenses between $590 million and $640 million; operating income ranging between $800 million and $900 million; and EPS ranging between $0.58 and $0.68 per share based on 1,123,000,000 diluted shares.
Please note that as indicated earlier this month, we expect the impact from the Inotera acquisition to be accretive beginning this quarter. Specifically, for fiscal quarter 2, we expect the accretion to positively impact gross margins by low single-digit percentage and contribute approximately $0.02 to EPS. These impacts have already been included in the guidance I just provided and will not be further distinguished as we provide guidance in future quarters. From an operational perspective, we remain on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that was previously shared and we look forward to sharing more details on our progress and plans at our analyst conference on February 2.
With that, I will turn it back to Mark."

On average for the mobile market, probably moving to 2.4 gigabytes of DRAM and the high 30s, somewhere in the 35 to 40, maybe in the middle of that range, in terms of gigabytes of NAND. So now if you net that out, that's almost 20% DRAM bit growth per system and maybe a little north of 40% on NAND.

So first of all, let me say that comments that I make in the press are sometimes not in the full context of the discussion I had. I think one of the things to think about in terms of what might or might not happen in China is that these things do take time. Our investment cycles take place over periods of useful life of equipment 5 years so we think in the long term, when we think about investing in our business to make sure that we're being good stewards of the shareholders' money, but anything that would happen there is going to play out over many years, and having a crystal ball as to exactly how that will play out is difficult to say. Relative to what Micron has said about our interests in China, we have a great interest in doing business in China. We have large existing operations there, including back end operations, circuit design, product engineering activities as well as software and firmware activities. So we have a lot of activity in China already from an operations perspective and we have a large number of important customers over there. So we stay fully engaged with China and continue to expect to have strong relationships there and grow our business. Relative to whether we would undertake any expansion or licensing activity in China, what we said is really as it has been, which is our job is to look for opportunities to make Micron a stronger company, and we will continue to investigate lots of options about ways to generate shareholder value whether it's in China or any other part of the world. And that's just part of us being effective managers of the company and we'll continue to do that and if we can figure out things that make the company stronger, we'll always consider that in terms of the long-term benefits and act accordingly."

I'm wondering if you can talk about the 1X transition for you. It seems like there's 2 vectors where you might be able to close that gap. One, it just seems like a better strength for you than maybe your peers, and two, correct me if I'm wrong, but most of Rex Chip, I believe, is still a 25-nanometer. So it might seem to me that as you guys move to 1X, you'll have a bigger wafer start days at 1X than you had at 20 nanometers. Am I thinking about that the right way?

So that gap will continue to narrow with the forecast we've given you. Specifically, relative to 110 series, yes, it's a good strength we have. As I mentioned, we've got a number of different products coming. Some of them are bigger shrimps than others and we're pretty particularly excited about some of the ones that come later in the fiscal year that really drive out a lot of cost in die size as opposed to some of the ones that come earlier and fill value-added potential segments or specific power performance attributes that the customers are looking for. Beyond that, I think it's fair to say that we should get a good bang for the buck on this technology transition, not only because it's a substantial shrink, but also because a chunk of it -- a large chunk of it's happening in Taichung so we're actually transitioning capacity from 25-nanometer all the way down to 1X. So it's -- as we did with 20-nanometer in Hiroshima and Inotera, and a big chunk of that capacity at Inotera was a double hop from 30-nanometer to 20-nanometer, this will be a double hop from 25 to 1X at the Taichung fab and so there's a pretty good bang for the buck there."

Question really about the -- about where we are in the cycle right now. Things look really great on pricing. I wonder -- because you also, you mentioned on inventory, on the DRAM maintenance level, also looks good, do you have any comments on the inventory level of the customers? I'm wondering, particularly on the Chinese, Mark, I know you have been buying quite a lot of memory through this second half of 2016, and I'm just wondering if you're seeing any double ordering, any excess inventory on the customer side, anything at all that makes you a little bit concerned of excess inventory, either on the chip side or on the finished product side, especially on handsets?"

Certainly in most market segments, it's very, very tight and any time you have that, and customers start getting nervous about are they potentially going to go line down, et cetera, you always start to be concerned that people are just trying to get a little bit ahead of it and build an inventory. I think that's only natural. I think we're doing a pretty good job of trying to allocate this product where it's absolutely most needed and so I don't think too many people are building up too much inventory."

Because clearly, what happened in 2015 and '16 wasn't quite what we were hoping for in terms of supply-demand balance in pricing. I'm just wondering if you had any comments on what is different between the previous cycle. Clearly, the industry is a lot better than the past but the question is how much. And I'm just trying to ask if you have any particular thoughts of this time versus 2014 in particular."

The biggest change structurally in the market, though, really is the fact that the products are going in a much broader set of end markets or are much more broadly distributed. Now we're 3 or 4 years on from where we were in the last cycle and I think that does make a difference. On top of that -- and Mark, I'll add one more piece to that, which is, sort of a long-term trend that we talked about in the past in terms of slowing technology migrations means that competitors in the marketplace are likely doing math with numbers that are changing less rapidly than they used to be. So both from a demand and a supply perspective, as those numbers get smaller and the slope gets smaller and the rate of change, it gets a little bit easier to do the math and it keeps things in balance. And then finally, as you layer on what's going on with NAND right now from a demand perspective, just explosive, I think, is probably the right word in terms of demand and elastic as well. And so I think there's may be some insulation there that wasn't there last time around."
