I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the line for Q&A.
The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We ended the year with a solid fourth quarter. Market conditions throughout the world developed as we expected, and I'm very pleased with our continued strong execution. Growth in the Americas was very strong and broad-based. Europe had good growth in laboratory instruments, which was somewhat hidden by a decline in retail due to strong prior year comparisons. Sales in China and Brazil declined meaningfully in the quarter, while Russia's decline was modest. Growth in emerging markets outside these countries was solid. Overall, we continue to gain share through our field turbo program, Spinnaker marketing initiatives and our exciting product offering. 
With strong execution on our margin enhancement and productivity improvement program, we again had good margin expansion in the quarter. Despite the challenging currency environment in the quarter and for the full year 2015, we delivered 10% EPS growth, which equates to 15% before the estimated impact of currencies.
We are pleased with these results, particularly given the headwinds from currency and certain emerging markets. Equally important, we continue to make investments for growth, which position us well for 2016 and beyond.
Now let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."

Sales were $673.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 3% in local currency, and on $1.00 basis, sales decreased by 3% as currencies reduced sales by 6% in the quarter. If you turn now to Page 3 of the pre",1289,"Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $673.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 3% in local currency, and on $1.00 basis, sales decreased by 3% as currencies reduced sales by 6% in the quarter. 
If you turn now to Page 3 of the presentation, we outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 9% in the Americas. They were flat in Europe and declined by 2% in Asia/Rest of World as compared to the prior year. China was down 8% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Brazil was down 12%, while we saw some improvement in Russia as their sales decline was only 1%. Excluding these 3 countries, we had a growth of 5% in the quarter.
Turning to the next slide. We have full year sales, which also increased 3% in local currency. By region in 2015, local currency sales increased by 8% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and were flat in Asia/Rest of World. Brazil, Russia and China were down 11% in 2015. Excluding these countries -- 3 countries, we had a sales growth of 7% in local currency for the full year.
Turning now to Slide #5. We outline sales growth by product line. Laboratory had a growth of 6% in local currency, while Industrial was flat in the quarter and our food retailing business declined 8% in the fourth quarter. 
Full year sales growth is shown on the next slide. Laboratory increased by 7% in local currency, while Industrial was flat and our food retailing business grew by 2%.
Turning to now to Slide #7. Let me walk you through key items on the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins reached 58%, a 150 basis point increase over the prior year margin of 56.5%. We're, of course, very pleased with this increase. Currencies contributed about 80% to the increase and includes the benefit of the gain we have on the Swiss franc-euro hedges. In constant currency, our gross margins were up by 70 basis points. Pricing and material cost reductions contributed to the margin improvement. These improvements were offset in part by our investments in the field service organization.
R&D amounted to $31.1 million. That's a 3% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $177.4 million, which is constant with the prior year in local currency. Increased investments in our field service organization and employee benefit costs were offset by our cost-saving programs and lower variable compensation. Our adjusted operating income was $182.2 million in the quarter, and that's a 3% increase over the prior year amount of $176.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $7.8 million in the quarter. Excluding this headwind, operating profit increased by 8% in the quarter.
Our operating margins were 27.1%. That's an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. Currencies benefited margins by 50 basis points as the percentage impact of currency on sales was larger than the impact on operating profit. The core underlying margin improvement was approximately 130 bps. Incremental OP margins reached 75% before currencies this quarter, which is particularly impressive, given the meaningful investments we're making in our field turbo program. 
A couple of comments on the -- final comments on the P&L. Our amortization amounted to $8.0 million in the quarter. Our interest expense was $6.8 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. It was slightly less in the fourth quarter, and that added about $0.02 to our earnings in the quarter. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $27.8 million. That's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS was $4.65 per share, and that's an increase of 10% over the prior year amount of $4.24 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 15% in the quarter.
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $4.44 per share as compared to $4.17 per share, and reported EPS includes restructuring charges of $0.17 per share and $0.04 per share of purchased intangible amortization.
The next slide provides our full year results for 2015. Our local currency sales increased by 3%, while gross margins grew by 170 basis points. Currency benefited gross margins by about 90 basis points, resulting in a strong 80 basis point improvement on a constant currency basis. Operating profits increased by 5%, and margins, on a constant currency basis, increased by 120 bps. Incremental margins exceeded 50% for the full year. Our adjusted EPS grew by 10%, which reflects a growth of approximately 15%, excluding currency.
Now let's turn to cash flow. In the quarter, our free cash flow was $126.4 million or $4.60 per share. On a per share basis, that's a 23% increase over the prior year amount. We achieved further improvement in DSO, which was reduced to 39 days at the end of the year compared to 40 days in the prior year. Our ITO was 4.6. 
Full year free cash flow amounted to $364.8 million or $12.90 per share, which is an increase of 11%. We converted 100% of our adjusted net income to cash flow in 2015, and we're, of course, pleased with that. 
Now let's turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be very challenging, given the uncertainty in certain emerging markets. We expect market conditions to remain soft in our China Industrial business, and we don't expect to achieve growth in China for the full year. Russia appears to have bottomed, while Brazil has a ways to go. For the Rest of the World, we expect continued growth, but less than what we achieved in 2015, given economic forecasts and some tougher comps. We expect continued share gains globally driven by our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, our field turbo programs and a strong product pipeline. Taken all these factors together, we continue to expect local currency sales growth to be between 3% and 4% in 2016, and our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $14.10 to $14.30. This is a growth of 9% to 11%. We expect currencies to reduce earnings growth by about 1.5 points, which represents a growth of 10.5 to 12.5, excluding currencies. This guidance remains unchanged from what we reported on our last call.
Now let me turn to the first quarter. In the first quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4%, while our adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45 per share. We expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in the quarter by about 2.5%. Excluding the impact of currency, our guidance reflects an EPS growth of 9.5% to 11.5% in the quarter. 
A couple of additional comments on guidance. First, our sales guidance for the first quarter is at the top end of the range, principally due to comparisons in China. We expect China to have flattish local currency sales growth in Q1. While for the full year, we expect China sales growth to be down low single digits.
Let me cover currency. With respect to sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales growth in Q1 by about 4.5% and reduce it for the full year by about 3%. As already mentioned, we expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in 2016 by approximately 1.5% with the greater impact in the first half of the year.
Finally, let me comment on cash flow. We expect cash flow to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million for the full year, and we would expect to repurchase shares of approximately $500 million in 2016.
Okay. That's it from my side, and I want to turn it back over to Olivier."

Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab finished the year strong and had a great year. Sales growth for the quarter was 6% and for the full year was 7%.

Sales growth for the quarter was 6% and for the full year was 7%. Most product lines showed good growth. As mentioned in multiple occasions, our product pipeline in Lab is very strong. They were also a major beneficiary of the field turbo program. We expect continued solid growth in 2016. 
Industrial was flat in the quarter and for the full year. Product Inspection grew 6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Market dynamics for Product Inspection continue to be very good. We have strong leadership position, the most comprehensive offering in the market and very strong product pipeline, which positions us well for 2016 and beyond. 
Core Industrial declined 3% in the quarter and for the full year. In the quarter, we had good growth in the Americas and Europe also had growth while China declined. You can see that many peers to our core Industrial business are having struggles. In this light, we performed well and gained share. I expect more of the same in 2016. A challenging environment, but us performing relatively well and gaining some share.
Finally, retail declined 8% in the quarter. Americas and Asia had good growth, while Europe was down due to very strong quarter in the previous year. For the year, retail had growth of 2%. We would expect retail to be down modestly in 2016 due to timing of project activity. It is worth noting that retail had record levels of profit and profit margin in 2015, so we believe our strategy for retail is sound and well executed.
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe sales were flat in the quarter in line with our expectations, given the good growth in the prior year. I am pleased with the solid growth in Lab and core Industrial in Europe during the quarter. For the full year, sales growth in Europe was up 2%. Overall, we continue to execute well in this region, and our field turbo investment should help us continue to gain share. 
Americas had another excellent quarter with sales growth of 9%. We had good growth in most product lines, especially where we made field turbo investments. Our outlook for Americas remains solid, and although we will have tougher comparisons this year, we expect continued solid growth.
Asia/Rest of the World decreased 2% in the quarter while increased 5%, excluding China. As Bill mentioned, China declined 8% in the quarter. Lab was flat in the quarter in China, while Industrial was down 17%. The order picture was better for China Lab in the quarter, and we expect China Lab to grow in 2016. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, although we expect China sales to be down this year, but not to the level we saw in 2015.
Outside China, in the fourth quarter, we had very good growth in India and solid growth in Southeast Asia. We expect market conditions in Asia outside of China to remain solid in 2016.
Let me make some additional comments on 2016. Last year proved more challenging than we had anticipated, and it also demonstrated our resiliency and agility as we delivered solid financial results despite sizable sales declines in Brazil, Russia and China and significant currency headwinds. Our ability to navigate the various economic environments around the globe is the result of our long-standing core strategy and our discipline in executing them. These strategies, which we have talked about with you for many years, are well understood and embraced within the organization. We believe that [indiscernible] us for many years as 2015 gave us ample opportunities to show its benefit.
In 2016, you will see more of the same, that is, we are more than happy to stick to our core strategy and focus on execution when we come in every day.
Let me provide some additional details to give you a better understanding of our key priorities in 2016. First, the field turbo program has a good start in 2015, and we expect to add another 200 front-end resources in 2016. Importantly, we are funding these investments through the productivity improvement and cost management elsewhere in the business. The investments are aimed at underpenetrated markets and are yielding tangible results, as evidenced by our growth in 2015 outside of Brazil, Russia and China. Adding field resources is a high-leverage investment for us and particularly important, given our organic growth focus. 
Second, our Spinnaker sales and marketing program continue to drive share and productivity gains. We are now entering the fifth wave of Spinnaker, and one of the key focus areas for us in 2016 is to use data analytics to identify sales opportunities which are actionable. One example is an initiative for replacement of all products. Our installed base, consisting of millions of instruments, is a highly valuable assets to our franchise. Our marketing teams work diligently to clean and enrich the information stored about these instruments in our comprehensive database called iBase. Using data analytics, we can identify customers in our IBase who would benefit from having there all the products upgraded to newest generation, which can provide significantly more functionality and translates into real value for our customers. To be successful, data transparency down to the model level needs to be extracted from the iBase and targeted marketing campaigns develop. We support this initiative through telesales resources we have added to our field turbo program.
Key account management is another key priority for our Spinnaker marketing programs in 2016. We're further developing our top 100 key account program with a focus of further penetrating key customers in food, pharmaceuticals and chemical industry. As a market leader, we have a wide range of product and service solutions and a large direct sales force presence that enables us to be a true partner for our global customers with the various needs in many locations.
Third, we have a large number of new products introduced in 2015 and expect similar trends in 2016 as well. In particular, Balances, Analytical Instruments, Process Analytics, Automated Chemistry and Product Inspection have robust pipelines. We continue to lead at the market and technology advances that provides competitive edge to our customers and keep us at the forefront of innovation in our industry.
Finally, it is a core aspect of our word. You can even say it is part of our DNA to continuously look for ways to optimize our cost structure. This drive for continuous improvement is at the foundation of our franchise and gives us the resiliency and agility to remain successful, even when market conditions are not as favorable as we might have expected. Many productivity programs and cost initiatives in various areas add up to significant savings and efficiencies. These efforts include lean initiatives in manufacturing and back office, leveraging low-cost countries for R&D, marketing support and manufacturing and utilizing shared service centers for operational activities.
That covers my comments on our strategic focus in 2016. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We remain cautious on China and some of the other emerging markets as market conditions are challenging, and it will take some time for these markets to recover. Our priority in these countries is to protect margin and ensure resources are targeted to long-term growth opportunities. Our Auto businesses, which account for more than 80% of total sales, are performing well. Market demand is solid and we are leveraging our excellent product pipeline, proven sales and marketing programs and investment in field resources to gain share. Our margin enhancement and productivity initiatives are well on track that allow us to make additional growth in Mettler. We believe this positions us well for continued share gains in 2016 and beyond. 
I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And the high volatility that we just see in general in China is going on. What it's -- today, probably too early to really have a good outlook for China. We want to see kind of Chinese New Year and how the business starts after that. And we will certainly have a higher confidence level in our outlook when we talk next time about China.

And so we have a certain visibility about the big projects. And just the way it's coming together makes us believe that 2016 will be more difficult.

So we have efforts here that first we always include service in our quotes. And then we train and incentivize our salespeople to really also convert on that. That's an ongoing effort. And the big benefit comes when we accumulate all that contract business over many years. But in parallel, we have actually very significant efforts to go on the whole installed base and make sure that we can capture as much of the installed base on the service contract. So I want to make sure that we emphasize really both things. We are making good progress, but I want also to try to point that it's a journey. The service business, growing the service business, in particular, the contract business, is every quarter, every year, capturing a few hundreds of additional customers. It's not just a bold strategy that you can implement within 1 or 2 years."

We saw it actually pretty much across the business lines and across industry segments. And what we have seen is -- however, that across the different emerging markets there are big differences. We have seen actually emerging markets that did very well for us. And we talked about India, Mexico did well. Southeast Asia did actually well. So we have multiple emerging markets that did well last year. And I expect actually that this year, it's also going to be mixed. We're going to have emerging markets do well, and they're going to be emerging markets that will be more challenging. Partially, I would attribute also the good results that we had in certain emerging markets last year to an excellent performance of our local teams. I would, for example, highlight countries like Mexico and Southeast Asia that did really exceptionally well. And that's certainly also attributable to programs that we have in place. Some of the emerging markets, the economic environment might be a little more challenging, but we consciously want to invest in these markets because we believe also in the long term, I would name here, for example, Turkey but also Indonesia, Vietnam and so on, where you can see a certain cooldown from a macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, we continue to invest there because we feel we can win market share and in the long term, these economies will continue to develop well."

I think we need to differentiate here between resources and cost base that we have that is associated with producing products and with serving local markets. When we talk about the cost base that we had in Switzerland and the currency exposure,",228,"Yes. Okay. I think we need to differentiate here between resources and cost base that we have that is associated with producing products and with serving local markets. When we talk about the cost base that we had in Switzerland and the currency exposure, this wasn't the cost associated with serving Switzerland as a market, but actually in terms of having a cost base because we do R&D product development and production in Switzerland. And this is true for Switzerland. This is true for our manufacturing base in China and so on. But we don't have this strengthening of a currency that is a headwind except in Switzerland. And so this was specific to Switzerland. Now in the other markets of where we serve a country and there is a currency exposure, we do a little bit of cost measures, but typically it's more on the pricing side that we would actually work. And with one big exception, and that's China. In China, we have taken cost measures, not because of currency, but because of market dynamics. And there, it is very much about resource shifting. We have business lines that have -- that growth prospects and others. So probably not surprising, we have done restructuring in the Industrial business in China. As for the Lab business, we continue to invest into it, and we are adding resources."

So in that sense, it's not beta testing. It's already reality. We have these pilots, these Crusaders of teams out there that have gone good stuff that we are scaling up and rolling out. The scale-up takes place over about a year. We go normally with this more sophisticated levels to the countries that are more mature, and then we follow up with the other countries. There are a few things that we drive from the center rather than bottom-up from the units, like the Big Data analytics things. There are from the center.

And we're going to execute it in a very similar way as we did in the past of course, every year, getting a little bit more sophisticated. But the approaches that we use to it is very similar. And it's a line that I've used at many times, but the biggest obstacle for price increases are often not the customers, but our internal organization, salespeople.

The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We ended the year with a solid fourth quarter. Market conditions throughout the world developed as we expected, and I'm very pleased with our continued strong execution. Growth in the Americas was very strong and broad-based. Europe had good growth in laboratory instruments, which was somewhat hidden by a decline in retail due to strong prior year comparisons. Sales in China and Brazil declined meaningfully in the quarter, while Russia's decline was modest. Growth in emerging markets outside these countries was solid. Overall, we continue to gain share through our field turbo program, Spinnaker marketing initiatives and our exciting product offering. 
With strong execution on our margin enhancement and productivity improvement program, we again had good margin expansion in the quarter. Despite the challenging currency environment in the quarter and for the full year 2015, we delivered 10% EPS growth, which equates to 15% before the estimated impact of currencies.
We are pleased with these results, particularly given the headwinds from currency and certain emerging markets. Equally important, we continue to make investments for growth, which positions us well for 2016 and beyond.
Now let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."
31468,321425114,927542,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $673.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 3% in local currency. And on a dollar basis, sales decreased by 3% as currencies reduced sales by 6% in the quarter. If you turn now to Page 3 of the",1290,"Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $673.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 3% in local currency. And on a dollar basis, sales decreased by 3% as currencies reduced sales by 6% in the quarter. 
If you turn now to Page 3 of the presentation, we outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 9% in the Americas, they were flat in Europe and declined by 2% in Asia/Rest of World as compared to the prior year. China was down 8% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Brazil was down 12%, while we saw some improvement in Russia as their sales decline was only 1%. Excluding these 3 countries, we had a growth of 5% in the quarter.
Turning to the next slide. We have full year sales, which also increased 3% in local currency. By region in 2015, local currency sales increased by 8% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and were flat in Asia/Rest of World. Brazil, Russia and China were down 11% in 2015. Excluding these countries -- 3 countries, we had a sales growth of 7% in local currency for the full year.
Turning now to Slide #5, we outline sales growth by product line. Laboratory had a growth of 6% in local currency, while Industrial was flat in the quarter and our food retailing business declined 8% in the fourth quarter. 
Full year sales growth is shown on the next slide. Laboratory increased by 7% in local currency, while Industrial was flat and our food retailing business grew by 2%.
Turning now to Slide #7, let me walk you through key items on the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins reached 58%, a 150 basis point increase over the prior year margin of 56.5%. We're, of course, very pleased with this increase. Currencies contributed about 80% to the increase and includes the benefit of the gain we have on the Swiss franc-euro hedges. In constant currency, our gross margins were up by 70 basis points. Pricing and material cost reductions contributed to the margin improvement. These improvements were offset in part by our investments in the field service organization.
R&D amounted to $31.1 million. That's a 3% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $177.4 million, which is constant with the prior year in local currency. Increased investments in our field service organization and employee benefit costs were offset by our cost-saving programs and lower variable compensation. Our adjusted operating income was $182.2 million in the quarter, and that's a 3% increase over the prior year amount of $176.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $7.8 million in the quarter. Excluding this headwind, operating profit increased by 8% in the quarter.
Our operating margins were 27.1%. That's an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. Currencies benefited margins by 50 basis points as the percentage impact of currency on sales was larger than the impact on operating profit. The core underlying margin improvement was approximately 130 bps. Incremental OP margins reached 75% before currencies this quarter, which is particularly impressive given the meaningful investments we're making in our field turbo program. 
A couple of comments on the -- final comments on the P&L. Our amortization amounted to $8.0 million in the quarter. Our interest expense was $6.8 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. It was slightly less in the fourth quarter, and that added about $0.02 to our earnings in the quarter. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $27.8 million. That's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS was $4.65 per share, and that's an increase of 10% over the prior year amount of $4.24 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 15% in the quarter.
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $4.44 per share as compared to $4.17 per share, and reported EPS includes restructuring charges of $0.17 per share and $0.04 per share of purchased intangible amortization.
The next slide provides our full year results for 2015. Our local currency sales increased by 3%, while gross margins grew by 170 basis points. Currency benefited gross margins by about 90 basis points, resulting in a strong 80 basis point improvement on a constant currency basis. Operating profits increased by 5% and margins on a constant currency basis increased by 120 bps. Incremental margins exceeded 50% for the full year. Our adjusted EPS grew by 10%, which reflects a growth of approximately 15%, excluding currency.
Now let's turn to cash flow. In the quarter, our free cash flow was $126.4 million or $4.60 per share. On a per share basis, that's a 23% increase over the prior year amount. We achieved further improvement in DSO, which was reduced to 39 days at the end of the year compared to 40 days in the prior year. Our ITO was 4.6. 
Full year free cash flow amounted to $364.8 million or $12.90 per share, which is an increase of 11%. We converted 100% of our adjusted net income to cash flow in 2015 and we're, of course, pleased with that. 
Now let's turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be very challenging given the uncertainty in certain emerging markets. We expect market conditions to remain soft in our China Industrial business, and we don't expect to achieve growth in China for the full year. Russia appears to have bottomed, while Brazil has a ways to go. For the Rest of the World, we expect continued growth, but less than what we achieved in 2015 given economic forecasts and some tougher comps. We expect continued share gains globally driven by our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, our field turbo programs and a strong product pipeline. Taken all these factors together, we continue to expect local currency sales growth to be between 3% and 4% in 2016, and our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $14.10 to $14.30. This is a growth of 9% to 11%. We expect currencies to reduce earnings growth by about 1.5 points, which represents a growth of 10.5 to 12.5, excluding currencies. This guidance remains unchanged from what we reported on our last call.
Now let me turn to the first quarter. In the first quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4%, while our adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45 per share. We expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in the quarter by about 2.5%. Excluding the impact of currency, our guidance reflects an EPS growth of 9.5% to 11.5% in the quarter. 
A couple of additional comments on guidance. First, our sales guidance for the first quarter is at the top end of the range, principally due to comparisons in China. We expect China to have flattish local currency sales growth in Q1. While for the full year, we expect China sales growth to be down low single digits.
Let me cover currency. With respect to sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales growth in Q1 by about 4.5% and reduce it for the full year by about 3%. As already mentioned, we expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in 2016 by approximately 1.5%, with the greater impact in the first half of the year.
Finally, let me comment on cash flow. We expect cash flow to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million for the full year, and we would expect to repurchase shares of approximately $500 million in 2016.
Okay. That's it from my side, and now I want to turn it back over to Olivier."

Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab finished the year strong and had a great year. Sales growth for the quarter was 6% and for the full year was 7%.

Sales growth for the quarter was 6% and for the full year was 7%. Most product lines showed good growth. As mentioned in multiple occasions, our product pipeline in Lab is very strong. They were also a major beneficiary of the field turbo program. We expect continued solid growth in 2016. 
Industrial was flat in the quarter and for the full year. Product Inspection grew 6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Market dynamics for Product Inspection continue to be very good. We have strong leadership position, the most comprehensive offering in the market and a very strong product pipeline, which positions us well for 2016 and beyond. 
Core Industrial declined 3% in the quarter and for the full year. In the quarter, we had good growth in the Americas, and Europe also had growth while China declined. You can see that many peers to our core Industrial business are having struggles. In this light, we performed well and gained share. I expect more of the same in 2016. A challenging environment, but us performing relatively well and gaining some share.
Finally, retail declined 8% in the quarter. Americas and Asia had good growth, while Europe was down due to a very strong quarter in the previous year. For the year, retail had a growth of 2%. We would expect retail to be down modestly in 2016 due to timing of project activity. It is worth noting that retail had record levels of profit and profit margin in 2015, so we believe our strategy for retail is sound and well executed.
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe sales were flat in the quarter in line with our expectations given the good growth in the prior year. I am pleased with the solid growth in Lab and core Industrial in Europe during the quarter. For the full year, sales growth in Europe was up 2%. Overall, we continue to execute well in this region, and our field turbo investment should help us continue to gain share. 
Americas had another excellent quarter with sales growth of 9%. We had good growth in most product lines, especially where we made field turbo investments. Our outlook for Americas remains solid. And although we will have tougher comparisons this year, we expect continued solid growth.
Asia/Rest of the World decreased 2% in the quarter while increased 5%, excluding China. As Bill mentioned, China declined 8% in the quarter. Lab was flat in the quarter in China, while Industrial was down 17%. The order picture was better for China Lab in the quarter, and we expect China Lab to grow in 2016. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, although we expect China sales to be down this year, but not to the level we saw in 2015.
Outside China, in the fourth quarter, we had very good growth in India and solid growth in Southeast Asia. We expect market conditions in Asia outside of China to remain solid in 2016.
Let me make some additional comments on 2016. Last year proved more challenging than we had anticipated, and it also demonstrated our resiliency and agility as we delivered solid financial results despite sizable sales declines in Brazil, Russia and China and significant currency headwinds. Our ability to navigate the various economic environments around the globe is the result of our long-standing core strategy and our discipline in executing them. These strategies, which we have talked about with you for many years, are well understood and embraced within the organization. We believe that [indiscernible] for many years and 2015 gave us ample opportunities to show its benefit.
In 2016, you will see more of the same, that is, we are more than happy to stick to our core strategy and focus on execution when we come in every day.
Let me provide some additional details to give you a better understanding of our key priorities in 2016. First, the field turbo program had a good start in 2015, and we expect to add another 200 front-end resources in 2016. Importantly, we are funding these investments through the productivity improvement and cost measures elsewhere in the business. The investments are aimed at underpenetrated markets and are yielding tangible results, as evidenced by our growth in 2015 outside of Brazil, Russia and China. Adding field resources is a high-leverage investment for us and particularly important given our organic growth focus. 
Second, our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs continue to drive share and productivity gains. We are now entering the fifth wave of Spinnaker, and one of the key focus areas for us in 2016 is to use data analytics to identify sales opportunities which are actionable. One example is an initiative for replacement of old products. Our installed base, consisting of millions of instruments, is a highly valuable asset to our franchise. Our marketing teams work diligently to clean and enrich the information stored about these instruments in our comprehensive database called iBase. Using data analytics, we can identify customers in our iBase who would benefit from having there all the products upgraded to newest generation, which can provide significantly more functionality and translate into real value for our customers. To be successful, data transparency down to the model level needs to be extracted from the iBase and targeted marketing campaigns developed. We support this initiative through telesales resources we have added to our field turbo program.
Key account management is another key priority for our Spinnaker marketing programs in 2016. We're further developing our top 100 key account program with a focus of further penetrating key customers in food, pharmaceuticals and chemical industry. As a market leader, we have a wide range of product and service solutions and a large direct sales force presence that enables us to be a true partner for our global customers with adverse needs in many locations.
Third, we have a large number of new products introduced in 2015 and expect similar trends in 2016 as well. In particular, Balances, Analytical Instruments, Process Analytics, Automated Chemistry and Product Inspection have robust pipelines. We continue to lead at the market and technology advances and provide competitive edge to our customers and keep us at the forefront of innovation in our industry.
Finally, it is a core aspect of our culture. You can even say it is part of our DNA to continuously look for ways to optimize our cost structure. This drive for continuous improvement is at the foundation of our franchise and gives us the resiliency and agility to remain successful, even when market conditions are not as favorable as we might have expected. Many productivity programs and cost initiatives in various areas add up to significant savings and efficiencies. These efforts include lean initiatives in manufacturing and back office, leveraging low-cost countries for R&D, marketing support and manufacturing, and utilizing shared service centers for operational activities.
That covers my comments on our strategic focus in 2016. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We remain cautious on China and some of the other emerging markets as market conditions are challenging and it will take some time for these markets to recover. Our priority in these countries is to protect margin and ensure resources are targeted to long-term growth opportunities. Our Auto businesses, which account for more than 80% of total sales, are performing well. Market demand is solid and we are leveraging our excellent product pipeline, proven sales and marketing programs and investment in field resources to gain share. Our margin enhancement and productivity initiatives are well on track and allow us to make additional growth in Mettler. We believe this positions us well for continued share gains in 2016 and beyond.

I mean, I would qualify that to say, if you dig a layer deeper into that, you would see that, actually, some areas like food and chemical, are actually -- there is more -- those are the more positive ones, for example, within -- those are actually growth areas within U.S. PMI number as opposed to, for example, the oil and gas area or metals area are much more difficult at this time. A second area would be currency. I think we've all experienced together ourselves, the peer companies and you guys, how currencies can move things around. And we have an assumption based on where rates are basically today. And if those should continue, if the economy should continue, we would feel good about our guidance for 2016. And I would highlight, Olivier and I both feel that the things we can control, the execution of our business plan, are things that we feel very good about for 2016."

I do, on the Industrial piece, however, also expect that the challenge goes on in 2016. The challenge that we have experienced last year is that there is overcapacity in many of our end-user industries that we serve. That overcapacity remains, and the high volatility that we just see in general in China is going on. What it's today, probably too early to really have a good outlook for China. We want to see kind of Chinese New Year and how the business starts after that. And we will certainly have a higher confidence level in our outlook when we talk next time about China. So May time is certainly giving us then better visibility. We saw that also last year. The impact of how business does before and after Chinese New Year is actually quite important."

That's because we are talking about key accounts, and they plan their rollouts actually a couple of quarters in advance, and so we have a certain visibility about the big projects. And just the way it's coming together makes us believe that 2016 will be more difficult. But I want also to remind, the way we are running this retail from a strategic standpoint is really a focus also on profitability and not just on growth. And we accept, in that sense, also the volatility that we have in that business. But I did highlight in my prepared remarks that I'm really happy how the profitability is evolving of this business.

The projects or the field ambitions are very similar to last year in terms of the business priorities but, of course, the territories might be different.

I think actually it's more the geography than the industry. When we talk about Brazil and Russia and the challenges and the headwinds we had last year, it's actually very difficult to attribute that to a certain industry segment. We saw it actually pretty much across the business lines and across industry segments. And what we have seen is -- however, that across the different emerging markets, there are big differences. We have seen actually emerging markets that did very well for us. We talked about India, Mexico did well, Southeast Asia did actually well. So we have multiple emerging markets that did well last year. And I expect, actually, that this year, it's also going to be mixed. We're going to have emerging markets that do well and there will going to be emerging markets that will be more challenging. Partially, I would attribute also the good results that we had in certain emerging markets last year to an excellent performance of our local teams. I would, for example, highlight countries like Mexico and Southeast Asia that did really exceptionally well, and that's certainly also attributable to programs that we have in place. In some of the emerging markets, the economic environment might be a little bit more challenging, but we consciously want to invest in these markets because we believe also in the long term, I would name here, for example, Turkey but also Indonesia, Vietnam and so on, where you can see a certain cooldown from a macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, we continue to invest there because we feel we can win market share and, in the long term, these economies will continue to develop well."

I think we need to differentiate here between resources and cost base that we have that is associated with producing products and with serving local markets. When we talk about the cost base that we had in Switzerland and the currency exposure, this wasn't the cost associated with serving Switzerland as a market, but actually in terms of having a cost base because we do R&D, product development and production in Switzerland. And this is true for Switzerland, this is true for our manufacturing base in China and so on. But we don't have this strengthening of a currency that is a headwind except in Switzerland. And so this was specific to Switzerland. Now in the other markets of where we serve a country and there is a currency exposure, we do a little bit of cost measures, but typically it's more on the pricing side that we would actually work with one big exception, and that's China. In China, we have taken cost measures, not because of currency but because of market dynamics. And there, it is very much about resource shifting. We have business lines that have better growth prospects than others. So probably not surprising, we have done restructuring in the Industrial business in China. As for the Lab business, we continue to invest into it, and we are adding resources."

The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We ended the year with a solid fourth quarter. Market conditions throughout the world developed as we expected, and I'm very pleased with our continued strong execution. Growth in the Americas was very strong and broad-based. Europe had good growth in laboratory instruments, which was somewhat hidden by a decline in retail due to strong prior year comparisons. Sales in China and Brazil declined meaningfully in the quarter, while Russia's decline was modest. Growth in emerging markets outside these countries was solid. Overall, we continue to gain share through our field turbo program, Spinnaker marketing initiatives and our exciting product offering. 
With strong execution on our margin enhancement and productivity improvement program, we again had good margin expansion in the quarter. Despite the challenging currency environment in the quarter and for the full year 2015, we delivered 10% EPS growth, which equates to 15% before the estimated impact of currencies.
We are pleased with these results, particularly given the headwinds from currency and certain emerging markets. Equally important, we continue to make investments for growth, which position us well for 2016 and beyond.
Now let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."
31468,321425114,927608,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $673.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 3% in local currency. And on a dollar basis, sales decreased by 3% as currencies reduced sales by 6% in the quarter. If you turn now to Page 3 of the",1290,"Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $673.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 3% in local currency. And on a dollar basis, sales decreased by 3% as currencies reduced sales by 6% in the quarter. 
If you turn now to Page 3 of the presentation, we outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 9% in the Americas, they were flat in Europe and declined by 2% in Asia/Rest of World as compared to the prior year. China was down 8% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Brazil was down 12%, while we saw some improvement in Russia as their sales decline was only 1%. Excluding these 3 countries, we had a growth of 5% in the quarter.
Turning to the next slide. We have full year sales, which also increased 3% in local currency. By region in 2015, local currency sales increased by 8% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and were flat in Asia/Rest of World. Brazil, Russia and China were down 11% in 2015. Excluding these countries -- 3 countries, we had a sales growth of 7% in local currency for the full year.
Turning now to Slide #5, we outline sales growth by product line. Laboratory had a growth of 6% in local currency, while Industrial was flat in the quarter and our food retailing business declined 8% in the fourth quarter. 
Full year sales growth is shown on the next slide. Laboratory increased by 7% in local currency, while Industrial was flat and our food retailing business grew by 2%.
Turning now to Slide #7, let me walk you through key items on the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins reached 58%, a 150 basis point increase over the prior year margin of 56.5%. We're, of course, very pleased with this increase. Currencies contributed about 80% to the increase and includes the benefit of the gain we have on the Swiss franc-euro hedges. In constant currency, our gross margins were up by 70 basis points. Pricing and material cost reductions contributed to the margin improvement. These improvements were offset in part by our investments in the field service organization.
R&D amounted to $31.1 million. That's a 3% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $177.4 million, which is constant with the prior year in local currency. Increased investments in our field service organization and employee benefit costs were offset by our cost-saving programs and lower variable compensation. Our adjusted operating income was $182.2 million in the quarter, and that's a 3% increase over the prior year amount of $176.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $7.8 million in the quarter. Excluding this headwind, operating profit increased by 8% in the quarter.
Our operating margins were 27.1%. That's an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. Currencies benefited margins by 50 basis points as the percentage impact of currency on sales was larger than the impact on operating profit. The core underlying margin improvement was approximately 130 bps. Incremental OP margins reached 75% before currencies this quarter, which is particularly impressive given the meaningful investments we're making in our field turbo program. 
A couple of comments on the -- final comments on the P&L. Our amortization amounted to $8.0 million in the quarter. Our interest expense was $6.8 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. It was slightly less in the fourth quarter, and that added about $0.02 to our earnings in the quarter. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $27.8 million. That's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS was $4.65 per share, and that's an increase of 10% over the prior year amount of $4.24 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 15% in the quarter.
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $4.44 per share as compared to $4.17 per share, and reported EPS includes restructuring charges of $0.17 per share and $0.04 per share of purchased intangible amortization.
The next slide provides our full year results for 2015. Our local currency sales increased by 3%, while gross margins grew by 170 basis points. Currency benefited gross margins by about 90 basis points, resulting in a strong 80 basis point improvement on a constant currency basis. Operating profits increased by 5% and margins on a constant currency basis increased by 120 bps. Incremental margins exceeded 50% for the full year. Our adjusted EPS grew by 10%, which reflects a growth of approximately 15%, excluding currency.
Now let's turn to cash flow. In the quarter, our free cash flow was $126.4 million or $4.60 per share. On a per share basis, that's a 23% increase over the prior year amount. We achieved further improvement in DSO, which was reduced to 39 days at the end of the year compared to 40 days in the prior year. Our ITO was 4.6. 
Full year free cash flow amounted to $364.8 million or $12.90 per share, which is an increase of 11%. We converted 100% of our adjusted net income to cash flow in 2015 and we're, of course, pleased with that. 
Now let's turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be very challenging given the uncertainty in certain emerging markets. We expect market conditions to remain soft in our China Industrial business, and we don't expect to achieve growth in China for the full year. Russia appears to have bottomed, while Brazil has a ways to go. For the Rest of the World, we expect continued growth, but less than what we achieved in 2015 given economic forecasts and some tougher comps. We expect continued share gains globally driven by our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, our field turbo programs and a strong product pipeline. Taken all these factors together, we continue to expect local currency sales growth to be between 3% and 4% in 2016, and our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $14.10 to $14.30. This is a growth of 9% to 11%. We expect currencies to reduce earnings growth by about 1.5 points, which represents a growth of 10.5 to 12.5, excluding currencies. This guidance remains unchanged from what we reported on our last call.
Now let me turn to the first quarter. In the first quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4%, while our adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45 per share. We expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in the quarter by about 2.5%. Excluding the impact of currency, our guidance reflects an EPS growth of 9.5% to 11.5% in the quarter. 
A couple of additional comments on guidance. First, our sales guidance for the first quarter is at the top end of the range, principally due to comparisons in China. We expect China to have flattish local currency sales growth in Q1. While for the full year, we expect China sales growth to be down low single digits.
Let me cover currency. With respect to sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales growth in Q1 by about 4.5% and reduce it for the full year by about 3%. As already mentioned, we expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in 2016 by approximately 1.5%, with the greater impact in the first half of the year.
Finally, let me comment on cash flow. We expect cash flow to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million for the full year, and we would expect to repurchase shares of approximately $500 million in 2016.
Okay. That's it from my side, and now I want to turn it back over to Olivier."

Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab finished the year strong and had a great year. Sales growth for the quarter was 6% and for the full year was 7%.

Sales growth for the quarter was 6% and for the full year was 7%. Most product lines showed good growth. As mentioned in multiple occasions, our product pipeline in Lab is very strong. They were also a major beneficiary of the field turbo program. We expect continued solid growth in 2016. 
Industrial was flat in the quarter and for the full year. Product Inspection grew 6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Market dynamics for Product Inspection continue to be very good. We have strong leadership position, the most comprehensive offering in the market and a very strong product pipeline, which positions us well for 2016 and beyond. 
Core Industrial declined 3% in the quarter and for the full year. In the quarter, we had good growth in the Americas, and Europe also had growth while China declined. You can see that many peers to our core Industrial business are having struggles. In this light, we performed well and gained share. I expect more of the same in 2016. A challenging environment, but us performing relatively well and gaining some share.
Finally, retail declined 8% in the quarter. Americas and Asia had good growth, while Europe was down due to a very strong quarter in the previous year. For the year, retail had a growth of 2%. We would expect retail to be down modestly in 2016 due to timing of project activity. It is worth noting that retail had record levels of profit and profit margin in 2015, so we believe our strategy for retail is sound and well executed.
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe sales were flat in the quarter in line with our expectations given the good growth in the prior year. I am pleased with the solid growth in Lab and core Industrial in Europe during the quarter. For the full year, sales growth in Europe was up 2%. Overall, we continue to execute well in this region, and our field turbo investment should help us continue to gain share. 
Americas had another excellent quarter with sales growth of 9%. We had good growth in most product lines, especially where we made field turbo investments. Our outlook for Americas remains solid. And although we will have tougher comparisons this year, we expect continued solid growth.
Asia/Rest of the World decreased 2% in the quarter while increased 5%, excluding China. As Bill mentioned, China declined 8% in the quarter. Lab was flat in the quarter in China, while Industrial was down 17%. The order picture was better for China Lab in the quarter, and we expect China Lab to grow in 2016. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, although we expect China sales to be down this year, but not to the level we saw in 2015.
Outside China, in the fourth quarter, we had very good growth in India and solid growth in Southeast Asia. We expect market conditions in Asia outside of China to remain solid in 2016.
Let me make some additional comments on 2016. Last year proved more challenging than we had anticipated, and it also demonstrated our resiliency and agility as we delivered solid financial results despite sizable sales declines in Brazil, Russia and China and significant currency headwinds. Our ability to navigate the various economic environments around the globe is the result of our long-standing core strategies and our discipline in executing them. These strategies, which we have talked about with you for many years, are well understood and embraced within the organization. We believe that [indiscernible] for many years and 2015 gave us ample opportunities to show its benefit.
In 2016, you will see more of the same, that is, we are more than happy to stick to our core strategy and focus on execution when we come in every day.
Let me provide some additional details to give you a better understanding of our key priorities in 2016. First, the field turbo program had a good start in 2015, and we expect to add another 200 front-end resources in 2016. Importantly, we are funding these investments through the productivity improvements and cost measures elsewhere in the business. The investments are aimed at underpenetrated markets and are yielding tangible results, as evidenced by our growth in 2015 outside of Brazil, Russia and China. Adding field resources is a high-leverage investment for us and particularly important given our organic growth focus. 
Second, our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs continue to drive share and productivity gains. We are now entering the fifth wave of Spinnaker, and one of the key focus areas for us in 2016 is to use data analytics to identify sales opportunities which are actionable. One example is an initiative for replacement of old products. Our installed base, consisting of millions of instruments, is a highly valuable asset to our franchise. Our marketing teams work diligently to cleanse and enrich the information stored about these instruments in our comprehensive database called iBase. Using data analytics, we can identify customers in our iBase who would benefit from having there all the products upgraded to newest generation, which can provide significantly more functionality and translate into real value for our customers. To be successful, data transparency down to the model level needs to be extracted from the iBase and targeted marketing campaigns developed. We support this initiative through telesales resources we have added to our field turbo program.
Key account management is another key priority for our Spinnaker marketing programs in 2016. We're further developing our top 100 key account program with a focus of further penetrating key customers in food, pharmaceuticals and chemical industry. As a market leader, we have a wide range of product and service solutions and a large direct sales force presence that enables us to be a true partner for our global customers with diverse needs in many locations.
Third, we have a large number of new products introduced in 2015 and expect similar trends in 2016 as well. In particular, Balances, Analytical Instruments, Process Analytics, Automated Chemistry and Product Inspection have robust pipelines. We continue to lead at the market and technology advances that provide competitive edge to our customers and keep us at the forefront of innovation in our industry.
Finally, it is a core aspect of our culture. You can even say it is part of our DNA to continuously look for ways to optimize our cost structure. This drive for continuous improvement is at the foundation of our franchise and gives us the resiliency and agility to remain successful, even when market conditions are not as favorable as we might have expected. Many productivity programs and cost initiatives in various areas add up to significant savings and efficiencies. These efforts include lean initiatives in manufacturing and back office, leveraging low-cost countries for R&D, marketing support and manufacturing, and utilizing shared service centers for operational activities.
That covers my comments on our strategic focus in 2016. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We remain cautious on China and some of the other emerging markets as market conditions are challenging and it will take some time for these markets to recover. Our priority in these countries is to protect margin and ensure resources are targeted to long-term growth opportunities. Our Auto businesses, which account for more than 80% of total sales, are performing well. Market demand is solid and we are leveraging our excellent product pipeline, proven sales and marketing programs and investment in field resources to gain share. Our margin enhancement and productivity initiatives are well on track and allow us to make additional growth investments. We believe this positions us well for continued share gains in 2016 and beyond. 
I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions."

I do, on the Industrial piece, however, also expect that the challenge goes on in 2016. The challenge that we have experienced last year is that there is overcapacity in many of our end-user industries that we serve. That overcapacity remains, and the high volatility that we just see in general in China is going on. What -- it's today, probably too early to really have a good outlook for China. We want to see kind of Chinese New Year and how the business starts after that. And we will certainly have a higher confidence level in our outlook when we talk next time about China. So May time is simply giving us then better visibility. We saw that also last year. The impact of how business does before and after Chinese New Year is actually quite important."

For 2016, we expect also some declines in food retail. That's because we are talking about key accounts, and they plan their rollouts actually a couple of quarters in advance, and so we have a certain visibility about the big projects. And just the way it's coming together makes us believe that 2016 will be more difficult. But I want also to remind, the way we are running this retail from a strategic standpoint is really a focus also on profitability and not just on growth. And we accept, in that sense, also the volatility that we have in that business. But I did highlight in my prepared remarks that I'm really happy how the profitability is evolving of this business.

We do that in a differentiated way across the world. We do differentiate it across the product lines.

I think actually it's more the geography than the industry. When we talk about Brazil and Russia and the challenges and the headwinds we had last year, it's actually very difficult to attribute that to a certain industry segment. We saw it actually pretty much across the business lines and across industry segments. And what we have seen is -- however, that across the different emerging markets, there are big differences. We have seen actually emerging markets that did very well for us. We talked about India, Mexico did well, Southeast Asia did actually well. So we have multiple emerging markets that did well last year. And I expect, actually, that this year, it's also going to be mixed. We're going to have emerging markets that do well and there are going to be emerging markets that will be more challenging. Partially, I would attribute also the good results that we had in certain emerging markets last year to an excellent performance of our local teams. I would, for example, highlight countries like Mexico and Southeast Asia that did really exceptionally well, and that's certainly also attributable to programs that we have in place. Some of the emerging markets, the economic environment might be a little bit more challenging, but we consciously want to invest in these markets because we believe also in the long term, I would name here, for example, Turkey but also Indonesia, Vietnam and so on, where you can see a certain cooldown from a macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, we continue to invest there because we feel we can win market share and, in the long term, these economies will continue to develop well."

I think we need to differentiate here between resources and cost base that we have that is associated with producing products and with serving local markets. When we talk about the cost base that we had in Switzerland and the currency exposure, this wasn't the cost associated with serving Switzerland as a market, but actually in terms of having a cost base because we do R&D, product development and production in Switzerland. And this is true for Switzerland, this is true for our manufacturing base in China and so on. But we don't have this strengthening of a currency that is a headwind except in Switzerland. And so this was specific to Switzerland. Now in the other markets of where we serve a country and there is a currency exposure, we do a little bit of cost measures, but typically it's more on the pricing side that we would actually work with one big exception, and that's China. In China, we have taken cost measures, not because of currency but because of market dynamics. And there, it is very much about resource shifting. We have business lines that have better growth prospects than others. So probably not surprising, we have done restructuring in the Industrial business in China.

The long-term trends are very favorable across the world for this business segment. And we are extremely well positioned. But there are temporary things happening. For example, China, we clearly see that also the food industry is holding back. There is an overcapacity, and the whole food industry is challenged right now in China, also in terms of margins. So you see the big foreign companies, but also local companies like Master Kong is one, cutting back significantly on their CapEx, and that impacts our Product Inspection business. While in U.S., for example, we have very good dynamic and we have very good growth, for example, last year. So I would say globally, long term, very favorable; short term, we need to differentiate by geography. In terms of our market position, we are -- have an excellent position because we are the leader in all the core technologies. We are a leader across the globe as typically we have competitors that are more regional and typically in one or the other technology. In terms of technology development, the checkweighing and metal detection business is a relatively mature technology. The X-ray technology is -- has still an adoption rate that is growing, meaning that not all the production lines are equipped today with X-ray technology even in Western markets as, for example, metal detection that's a more mature technology and have been widely applied, and so we live also quite some replacement business. And then the fourth technology is Vision Inspection. Vision Inspection has multiple applications, but that's one that is more developing. It's more at an early stage. And also for us, it's still smaller and will, hopefully, develop well over the next 5, 10 years."

I will have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. 
The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We had a solid start to the year with our first quarter results. Local currency sales increased 4%. We had another quarter of good growth in America, while Europe came in a little weaker than expected. Emerging markets growth was solid, and we are pleased that we had sales growth in China in the quarter. With strong execution and the benefit of productivity initiatives, we achieved good growth in EPS, which increased 9% in the quarter. This equates to 11.5% growth excluding the impact of currency. We are pleased with these results and that the year is off to a good start.
Now let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."
31468,330163498,974649,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Olivier, and hello to everybody. Sales were $539.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 1% as currency reduced sales by 3% in the quarter.Turning to Page 3 of the presenta",1141,"Thanks, Olivier, and hello to everybody. Sales were $539.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 1% as currency reduced sales by 3% in the quarter.
Turning to Page 3 of the presentation, we'll outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 6% in the Americas and 4% in Asia/Rest of World and were flat in Europe. Regarding the Europe number, we may have underestimated a little the impact of Easter being in March this year versus April last year. April should -- Europe should do better in the second quarter. 
China had sales growth of 6% in the quarter, which is better than we expected.
Turning to Slide #4. We outlined sales growth by product line. Laboratory had local currency growth of 5%. industrial increased 2%, and food retailing was up 5%. All comparisons are versus the prior year quarter.
Turning to the next slide, let me walk you through the key items in the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 55.6% as compared to 55.8% in the prior year. We're pleased with the good -- continued good contributions from pricing and from our material cost reduction programs. Offsetting this were negative mix and some targeted investments in our service business. Currency was neutral to gross margins in the quarter. As a reminder, gross margins had a very tough comp. In Q1 last year, our gross margins were up 270 basis points, of which 170 basis points of the increase was on a constant currency basis. 
R&D amounted to $29 million. That's a 5% increase in local currency, while SG&A amounted to $168.9 million, and that's an increase of 1% in local currency over the prior year. Investments in our field turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost-saving initiatives. Adjusted operating income amounted to $102 million in the quarter. That's a 5% increase over the prior year amount of $97.3 million. Reduced operating profit -- currency reduced operating profit by $2 million. Absent currency headwinds, growth in operating income would have been 7%. Our operating margin was 18.9%. That's a 70 basis point increase over the prior year. 
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $8.4 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $6.6 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.4 million, which is a 4.7% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.46 per share, a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $2.25 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 11.5% in the quarter. On a reported basis EPS was $2.40 as compared to $2.19 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.02 of restructuring charges.
Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $29.1 million as compared to $41.3 million in to the prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and further improvement in DSO, which was reduced by 1 day to 43 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6. The decline in cash flow versus the prior year is due primarily to the timing of working capital items, which were somewhat impacted by Easter falling in March this year as compared to April last year. We are on target for the full year goal.
Now let me turn to guidance. We're raising our full year local currency sales guidance to 4% versus the 3% to 4% guidance we provided in February. This reflects a better view on China overall, somewhat offset by an expectation that Europe could be a little weaker than we expected. Overall, we feel very good about our product offering and our sales execution, in fact, better than we did 3 months ago. We also have raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.25 per share to $4.35 per share, and that's a growth of 10% to 11%. This compares to the previous guidance of 9% to 11% or $4.10 to $4 -- $14.30 per share.
Let me provide some additional background on our guidance for the remainder of the year. We now estimate that currency will have minimum impact on EPS for the full year. Previously, we had estimated that currency would be a headwind to EPS growth for the last 3 quarters of this year of approximately 1% or about $0.11 per share. Now we estimate a positive $0.04 impact over the last 3 quarters. We expect to have continued gross margin expansion for the full year but at a lower rate than we originally assumed. For the coming 3 quarters, year-over-year gross profit margins should be up about 40 -- about 50 basis points on average.
We also plan to expand our field turbo program further in the second half of this year as compared to our original assumption. We like the program's results so far and believe the environment is improving. This will offset some of the productivity gains we have and you saw in our Q1 results. 
One final item. Our share count will be a little higher than maybe your models had, given our recent stock price performance year-to-date. This is a smaller adjustment to our forecast. It reduces EPS by approximately $0.06, but since you're updating your models, we thought it was worth mentioning. To incorporate these factors, we are raising the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.10. We now assume EPS will increase 10% to 11% as compared to the 9% to 11% previously.
Now let's look at the second quarter. We expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4% and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.09 to $3.14. This reflects a growth rate of 10% to 12%. We do not expect currency to meaningfully impact EPS growth in the second quarter. In terms of currency sales -- currency impact on sales growth, we would expect currency to reduce sales growth by 1.5% in the second quarter and 1% for the full year. 
One final miscellaneous item. In the second quarter, we're going to take a noncash pension accounting charge of approximately $8 million related to a lump sum offering to former employees of our U.S. plan. This plan is frozen. In fact it's been frozen for a long time, and the timing was advantageous to cash out divested portion of these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company as we used pension plan assets to fund the payments.
Okay. That's it from my side, and now I want to turn it back over to Olivier."

Let me start with summary comments of business conditions. lab had good growth with 5% local currency sales growth, which is on top of strong growth in the prior year. Pipette and AutoChem had very strong growth, while balances also had good growth. Good product pipeline, benefit of field turbo investments and continued strong sales marketing program are well contributing to strong lab performance. Spending by our biopharma customers were strong. 
industrial increased 2% in the quarter, driven by Product Inspection, which was up 7%. Product Inspection has good growth in most regions, and we continue to benefit from solid market condition and very strong competitive advantages in this market. Core industrial was down slightly in the quarter. Finally, retail was up 5% with strong performance in the Americas and Asia, offset by decline in Europe. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas increased 6% with good growth in most product lines. Core industrial was now modestly, however, it was again strong comparisons in the prior year period of 8%. We continue to feel good about our growth in the Americas, but they will face tougher comparisons, particularly in the back half of the year. Europe sales growth was flat in the quarter, a little weaker than we expected. We had good growth in lab and Product Inspection but declines in core industrial and strong decline in retail. As mentioned earlier, there was some impact of Easter holiday timing. Asia/Rest of World had growth of 4% in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, China had growth of 6%. While we are pleased with the good start, overall economic environment remains challenging in China. In particular, overcapacity remains in the industrial sector, which will take time to resolve. However, we are seeing good results in market segments such as life sciences. We had -- we have had recent wins in our Process Analytics and pipette business since with research organizations such as the CDC and China National Biotech Corporate. Our technology centered on intelligent sensors and Process Analytics and our systems and pipettes helps us beat competition. Our industrial team also had some successes. For example, we received an important order at the new pharmaceutical facility to provide a comprehensive solution to integrate formulation software with the bench count. These are a couple of small examples, but I thought they're worth sharing as they demonstrate that the price of our product offering provides as good opportunities to target the growth segments of the Chinese market even when many segments struggle.
I recently visited Southeast Asia and had business reviews with our teams from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines. I'm impressed with the good growth we are at achieving in this region despite economic conditions, which are challenging. We have strong management teams with proven success capitalizing of field turbo investment and our spend at sales service and marketing initiatives. I'm pleased how we continued to create and develop market organizations in new countries. Recent examples include Turkey, Indonesia, Philippines, New Zealand. All of these markets delivered strong results as we benefit from our direct presence. Our international customers really value our direct presence in these countries, particularly customers of our product inspections, Process Analytics and lab business. 
Those are all my comments on business trends. I wanted to spend a few minutes a day providing an update on our Automated Chemistry business. AutoChem provides enabling technology and software to develop and transfer scale chemistry into commercial processes. We are the clear market leaders in automated lab reactors and associated analytical tools that analyze chemical reactions in realtime. Our solutions provide customers increased R&D productivity, better products and process quality and ensure commercial processes deliver higher yield at lower cost. Driven by the reality that biopharma and chemical companies are increased -- are under ever-increasing pressure to bring products markets -- to market faster, customers have increased their adoption of our AutoChem technology to increase R&D productivity. AutoChem had excellent sales growth in 2015, driven by increased adoption of our technology by our traditional customers combined with greater penetration in the biopharma large molecule segment.
The prospect for Automated Chemistry remains strong, and we estimate the majority of potential users still use in-house engineered solutions, which have fundamental limitations. We're increasingly seeing the adoption of our EC Max and Opti Max as an enabling platform for automated lab reactors and are making great inroads in migrating chemists, engineers and biopharma scientists to adopt this technology to substantially improve productivity.
Expanding our product offering is core to our market leadership in this segment. As our technology gains greater adoption, we see continued opportunity to provide a wider range of solutions. For example, we fill the gap in our offering with the plug-and-play control unit that provides automation for already installed manual high-volume low-cost reaction system. has an easy-to-use interface that enhances data capture, increases automation and reinforces our automated lab reactors as the tool of choice in chemical development labs. This month, we will also introduce a new software package, which reduces process complexity, including for data analysis which allows the tool to be used by non-experts. Our market-leading technology, combined with the larger service force in this market, provides excellent competitive advantages for us. Our spend in sales and marketing programs along with field turbo resources are positioning us well for further growth. For those of you that will be attending our investor meeting in July, you will have an opportunity to hear a little more about this business and see firsthand some of our innovative technology for this market.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We feel good about the start to 2016 but remain cautious of the global economy, given the uncertainties that exist. Our initiatives are well on track as we expect to continue to benefit from our strong product pipeline, field turbo investments, spend up in sales and marketing program and our margin and productivity measures. Our focus is on execution and driving above-market growth.
I want now to ask the operator to open the questions for us."

And just as a reminder, we talked to you little bit last quarter about how we have done some things in terms of the sales teams to try to get them in the field a little bit more. Often in the early part of the year, we have sales meetings, training sessions, things, and so we did expect to do -- frankly in our original models, we thought Q1 would be the best quarter of the year. And at this stage, we feel like we're going to get full year growth, and that's an improvement, probably low single-digit growth, maybe a little upside to that but low single-digit growth for the full year. That compares to a low single-digit decline that we would have guided you to before. If you look at the different pieces of business, of course, our lab business did particularly well during the quarter. It had solid growth and -- but even our industrial business showed some signs of improving. If I were to look at order entry, maybe the lab numbers were a little bit better than the order entry. And then the other piece of the surprise was our retail business did well in China. That's always a little bit lumpy there as it is in other parts of the world as well. So we expect another positive number in China next quarter, maybe not quite as good as what we saw this quarter. And I think maybe in 3 months, we can give you guys a better sense if it's the bottom or if we could see more lumpiness going forward. There's still a lot of fundamental issues in China around overcapacity and some fragility and some of the financial markets, but it's nice to get some good surprises there in China. We haven't had them in a long time, and we'll take that, and we feel like the team executed real well, particularly vis-à-vis competition."

So Europe -- if I look kind of at multiyear growth rates, I'm not sure if your comment -- I think your comment maybe applies on 2-year growth rates, but I think a little bit less so if you were to look at 3-year growth rates, Dan. So maybe at this point, Q2 might be one of the better quarters for Europe, given what moved to between March and April.

The second is I would comment on the fact that it wasn't that long ago that we were talking to you about we had last year in our China core industrial business, we had 20% decline for the full year last year, and it varied between minus 7 and minus 23. And while I'm not sure we're going to get growth in core industrial for the full year in China, it's pretty clear to me it won't be that kind of number and just now that we're this far into the year, we feel a little bit better than that. In terms of what we see in terms of activity with customers, Olivier commented on some of the progress we're making, particularly in the life science area, so we do see money getting awarded there.

And I'm kind of looking at Mary, too, to make sure I quote some of the numbers right, but I think I understand So the first comment is gross margin came in a little less than our model, probably a little bit less than some of your guys models in Q1. If we look at now the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our best estimate at this point would be on a currency-neutral basis or actually, I think, there's maybe only 10 basis points anyway difference between actual and constant currency. But looking at something like 50 basis points on average in the remaining 3 quarters of the year could be a little bit better than something in that range. That, of course, is a good number, and so we're happy with that number but I think the comparison little bit. If you look at what that means in terms of our full year model, it means they be a little bit less gross profit margin for the full year than most people were expecting, so that's kind of maybe a slight negative. Slight positive is that we put the midpoint of our sales guidance up from by 50 basis points. The next item is that you could see in our operating expenses that our various cost savings, cost reengineering initiatives continue to go well. Our operating expenses, as we view it internally, were only up about 1% in the quarter despite having, I think, 250 more field personnel between sales and service than we had in Q1 a year ago, so we feel good about that and partly because we're happy with how the field turbo programs are going. Olivier mentioned we're starting to approve already a few more field turbos that will start to add a little bit of operating expense growth more than we had in the original model in the second half of the year. And then the final [indiscernible] thing is that we had a -- the share price has performed well recently and that for most of you guys will probably have some impact on us spending $0.5 billion on share repurchases. We'll get a few less shares purchased because of that. That impact for us, at least in our model, was about $0.06. And of course, one of the bigger impacts, Steve, is that if you look at where currencies are as of yesterday, I guess, as compared to what we told you in February and you look at that over the last 3 quarters of the year, I say the last 3 quarters because the first quarter is already behind us, we estimated about $0.15 per share impact as the delta between those 2, that's a positive delta. So taking all those things together, that's how we got to this $0.10 per share movement in terms of the midpoint of our guidance."

And if I look at within the lab product categories titration, for example, is one of our highest gross margin products that some of their sales move a little bit into the latter part of the year due to some new product introductions. And then the service was the other half of the kind of the negative. And in service, we just -- Olivier talked about that earlier. We really see service as an important part of our growth in terms of profit going forward, but also it's just one of the great competitive barriers and advantages that we want to build on, and we invested a little bit more in service technicians.

I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. 
The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We had a solid start to the year with our first quarter results. Local currency sales increased 4%. We had another quarter of good growth in America while Europe came in a little weaker than expected. Emerging markets growth was solid, and we are pleased that we had sales growth in China in the quarter. 
With strong execution and the benefit of productivity initiatives, we achieved good growth in EPS, which increased 9% in the quarter. This equates to 11.5% growth, excluding the impact of currency. We are pleased with these results and that the year is off to a good start.
Now let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."
31468,330163498,974912,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Olivier, and hello to everybody. Sales were $539.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 1% as currencies reduced sales by 3% in the quarter.Turning to Page 3 of the presen",1143,"Thanks, Olivier, and hello to everybody. Sales were $539.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 1% as currencies reduced sales by 3% in the quarter.
Turning to Page 3 of the presentation, we'll outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 6% in the Americas and 4% in Asia/Rest of World and were flat in Europe. Regarding the Europe number, we may have underestimated a little the impact of Easter being in March this year versus April last year. April should -- Europe should do better in the second quarter. China had sales growth of 6% in the quarter, which is better than we expected.
Turning to Slide #4, we outlined sales growth by product line. Laboratory had local currency growth of 5%, industrial increased 2% and food retailing was up 5%. All comparisons are versus the prior year quarter.
Turning to the next slide, let me walk you through the key items in the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 55.6% as compared to 55.8% in the prior year. We're pleased with the good -- continued good contributions from pricing and from our material cost reduction programs. Offsetting this were negative mix and some targeted investments in our service business. Currency was neutral to gross margins in the quarter. As a reminder, gross margins had a very tough comp. In Q1 last year, our gross margins were up 270 basis points, of which 170 basis points of the increase was on a constant currency basis. 
R&D amounted to $29 million, that's a 5% increase in local currency, while SG&A amounted to $168.9 million, and that's an increase of 1% in local currency over the prior year. Investments in our field turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost-saving initiatives. Adjusted operating income amounted to $102 million in the quarter. That's a 5% increase over the prior year amount of $97.3 million. Reduced operating profit -- currency reduced operating profit by $2 million. Absent currency headwinds, growth in operating income would've been 7%. Our operating margin was 18.9%. That's a 70 basis point increase over the prior year. 
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $8.4 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $6.6 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.4 million, which is a 4.7% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.46 per share, a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $2.25 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 11.5% in the quarter. On a reported basis EPS was $2.40 as compared to $2.19 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.02 of restructuring charges.
Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $29.1 million as compared to $41.3 million in to the prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and further improvement in DSO, which was reduced by one day to 43 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6. The decline in cash flow versus the prior year is due primarily to the timing of working capital items, which was somewhat impacted by Easter falling in March this year as compared to April last year. We are on target for the full year goal.
Now let me turn to guidance. We're raising our full year local currency sales guidance to 4% versus the 3% to 4% guidance we provided in February. This reflects a better view on China overall, somewhat offset by an expectation that Europe could be a little weaker than we expected. Overall, we feel very good about our product offering and our sales execution, in fact, better than we did 3 months ago. We also have raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.25 per share to $4.35 per share, and that's a growth of 10% to 11%. This compares to the previous guidance of 9% to 11% or $4.10 (sic) [ $14.10 ] to $4 -- $14.30 per share.
Let me provide some additional background at our guidance for the remainder of the year. We now estimate that currency will have minimum impact on EPS for the full year. Previously, we had estimated that currency would be a headwind to EPS growth for the last 3 quarters of this year of approximately 1% or about $0.11 per share. Now we estimate a positive $0.04 impact over the last 3 quarters. We expect to have continued gross margin expansion for the full year, but at a lower rate than we originally assumed. For the coming 3 quarters, year-over-year gross profit margins should be up about 40 -- or sorry, 50 basis points on average. We also plan to expand our field turbo program further in the second half of this year as compared to our original assumption. We like the program's results so far and believe the environment is improving. This will offset some of the productivity gains we have and you saw in our Q1 results. 
One final item. Our share count will be a little higher than maybe your models had, given our recent stock price performance year-to-date. This is a smaller adjustment to our forecast. It reduces EPS by approximately $0.06. But since you're updating your models, we thought it was worth mentioning. To incorporate these factors, we are raising the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.10. We now assume EPS will increase 10% to 11% as compared to the 9% to 11% previously.
Now let's look at the second quarter. We expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4% and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.09 to $3.14. This reflects a growth rate of 10% to 12%. We do not expect currency to meaningfully impact EPS growth in the second quarter. In terms of currency sales -- currency impact on sales growth, we would expect currency to reduce sales growth by 1.5% in the second quarter and 1% for the full year. 
One final miscellaneous item. In the second quarter, we're going to take a noncash pension accounting charge of approximately $8 million related to a lump sum offering to former employees of our U.S. plan. This plan is frozen. In fact, it's been frozen for a long time, and the timing was advantageous to cash-out divested portion of these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company as we used pension plan assets to fund the payments.
Okay. That's it from my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier."

Lab had good growth with 5% local currency sales growth, which is on top of strong growth in prior year. Pipette and AutoChem had very strong growth while Balances also had good growth. Good product pipeline, benefit of field turbo investments and continued strong sales marketing programs, are well contributing to strong lab performance. Spending by our biopharma customers was strong. Industrial increased 2% in the quarter, driven by Product Inspection, which was up 7%. Product Inspection has good growth in most regions, and we continue to benefit from solid market condition and very strong competitive advantages in this market. Core industrial was down slightly in the quarter. Finally, retail was up 5% with strong performance in the Americas and Asia, offset by decline in Europe. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas increased 6% with good growth in most product lines. Core industrial was down modestly, however, it was against strong comparisons in the prior year period of 8%. We continue to feel good about our growth in the Americas, but they will face tougher comparisons, particularly in the back half of the year. 
Europe sales growth was flat in the quarter, a little weaker than we expected. We had good growth in lab and Product Inspection but declines in core industrial and strong decline in retail. As mentioned earlier, there was some impact of Easter holiday timing. 
Asia/Rest of the World had growth of 4% in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, China had growth of 6%. While we are pleased with the good start, overall economic environment remains challenging in China. In particular, overcapacity remains in the industrial sector, which will take time to resolve. However, we are seeing good results in market segments, such as life sciences. 
We had -- we have had recent wins in our Process Analytics and pipette business since -- with research organizations, such as the CDC and China National Biotec Corporate. Our technology is centered on intelligent sensors and process analytics, and our LiteTouch systems and pipettes helped us beat competition. 
Our industrial team also have some successes. For example, we received an important order at the new pharmaceutical facility to provide a comprehensive solution to integrate formulation software with the bench and floor scales. These are only a couple of small examples, but I thought worth sharing as they demonstrate that the breadth of our product offering provides us good opportunities to target the growth segments of the Chinese market even when many segments struggle.
I recently visited Southeast Asia and had business reviews with our teams from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines. I'm impressed with the good growth we're achieving in this region despite economic conditions, which are challenging. We have strong management teams with proven success capitalizing on field turbo investments and our Spinnaker sales service and marketing initiatives. 
I'm pleased how we continued to create and develop market organizations in new countries. Recent examples include Turkey, Indonesia, Philippines, New Zealand. All of these markets delivered strong results as we benefit from our direct presence. Our international customers really value our direct presence in these countries, particularly customers of our Product Inspections, Process Analytics and lab business. 
Those are all my comments on business trends. I wanted to spend a few minutes today providing an update on our Automated Chemistry business. AutoChem provides enabling technology and software to develop and transfer bench scale chemistry into commercial processes. We are the clear market leaders in automated lab reactors and associated analytical tools that analyze chemical reactions in real time. Our solutions provide customers increased R&D productivity, better products and process quality and ensure commercial processes, deliver higher yields at lower costs.
 Driven by the reality that biopharma and chemical companies are under ever-increasing pressure to bring products markets -- to market faster, customers have increased their adoption of our AutoChem technology to increase R&D productivity. AutoChem had excellent sales growth in 2015, driven by increased adoption of our technology by our traditional customers, combined with greater penetration in the biopharma large molecule segment.
The prospect for Automated Chemistry remained strong as we estimate the majority of potential users still use in-house engineered solutions, which have fundamental limitations. We're increasingly seeing the general adoption of our EasyMax and OptiMax as the enabling platforms for automated lab reactors and are making great inroads in migrating chemists, engineers and biopharma scientists to adopt this technology to substantially improve productivity.
Expanding our product offering is core to our market leadership in this segment. As our technology gains greater adoption, we see continued opportunity to provide a wider range of solutions. For example, we fill the gap in our offering with the plug-and-play control unit that provides automation for already-installed manual high-volume, low-cost reaction systems. RX-10 has an easy-to-use interface that enhances data capture, increases automation and reinforces our automated lab reactors as the tool of choice in chemical development labs. This month, we will also introduce a new software package, which reduces process complexity, including for data analysis, which allows the tool to be used by non-experts. 
Our market-leading technology, combined with the largest service force in this market, provides excellent competitive advantages for us. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs, along with field turbo resources, are positioning us well for further growth. For those of you that will be attending our Investor Meeting in July, you will have an opportunity to hear a little more about this business and see firsthand some of our innovative technology for this market.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We feel good about the start to 2016 but remain cautious on the global economy, given the uncertainties that exist. Our initiatives are well on track, and we expect to continue to benefit from our strong product pipeline, field turbo investments, Spinnaker sales and marketing programs and our margin and productivity measures. Our focus is on execution and driving above-market growth.
I want now to ask the operator to open the questions for us."

And just as a reminder, we talked to you little bit last quarter about how we had done some things in terms of the sales teams to try to get them in the field a little bit more. Often in the early part of the year, we have sales meetings, training sessions, things, and so we did expect to do that -- frankly, in our original models, we thought Q1 would be the best quarter of the year. And at this stage, we feel like we're going to get full year growth, and that's an improvement, probably low single-digit growth, maybe a little upside to day, but low single-digit growth for the full year. That compares to a low single-digit decline that we would've guided you to before. If we look at the different pieces of business, of course, our lab business did particularly well during the quarter. It had solid growth and -- but even our industrial business showed some signs of improving. If I were to look at order entry, maybe the lab numbers were a little bit better than the order entry. And then the other piece of the surprise was our retail business did well in China. That's always a little bit lumpy there as it is in other parts of the world as well. So we expect another positive number in China next quarter, maybe not quite as good as what we saw this quarter. And I think maybe in 3 months, we can give you guys a better sense if it's the bottom or if we could see more lumpiness going forward. There's still a lot of fundamental issues in China around overcapacity and some fragility in some of the financial markets, but it's nice to get some good surprises there in China. We hadn't had them in a long time, and we'll take that, and we feel like the team executed real well, particularly vis-à-vis competition."

And I am kind of looking at Mary, too, to make sure I quote some of the numbers right, but I think I understand you. So the first comment is gross profit margin came in little less than our model, probably a little bit less than some of your guys' models in Q1. If we look at now the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our best estimate at this point would be on a currency-neutral basis, or actually, I think there's maybe only 10 basis points, anyway, difference between actual and constant currency, but look at something like 50 basis points, on average, in the remaining 3 quarters of the year could be little bit better than that, but something in that range. That, of course, is a good number, and so we're happy with that number, but -- I think it compares a little bit. And if you look at what that means in terms of our full year model, it means maybe a little bit less gross profit margin for the full year than most people were expecting. So that's kind of maybe a slight negative. A slight positive is that we put the midpoint of our sales guidance up from -- by 50 basis points. The next item is that you could see in our operating expenses that our various cost savings, cost reengineering initiatives continue to go well. Our operating expenses, as we view it internally, were only up about 1% in the quarter despite having, I think, 250 more field personnel between sales and service than we had in Q1 a year ago. So we feel good about that and partly because we're happy with how the field turbo program's going. Olivier mentioned that we're starting to approve already a few more field turbos that'll start to add a little bit of operating expense growth more than we had in the original model in the second half of the year. And then the final minor thing is that we had a -- the share price has performed well recently and that -- for most of you guys will probably have some impact on us spending $0.5 billion on share repurchases. We'll get a few less shares purchased because of that. That impact for us, at least in our model, was about $0.06. And of course, one of the bigger impacts, Steve, is that if you look at where currencies are as of yesterday, I guess, as compared to what we told you in February and you look at that over the last 3 quarters of the year, I say the last 3 quarters because, of course, the first quarter is already behind us, we estimated about a $0.15 per share impact as the delta between those 2, and of course, that's a positive delta. So taking all those things together, that's how we got to this $0.10 per share movement in terms of the midpoint of our guidance."

That translates to 20 bps in terms of year-on-year movement in gross profit margin. Then the rest is kind of equally split between a mix topic, a series of little mix things kind of adding up. So maybe kind of some of the highlight ones were a little less sales than -- in terms of the overall composition, a less European direct sales and a little less Southeast Asian sales, and those are 2 highly profitable markets. And if I look at within the lab product categories, titration, for example, is one of our highest gross margin products that, for some of their sales, move a little bit into the latter part of the year due to some new product introductions. And then the service was the other half of the kind of the negative. And in service, we just -- Olivier talked about it earlier. We really see service as an important part of our growth in terms of profit going forward, but also, it's just one of the great competitive barriers and advantages that we want to build on. And we invested a little bit more in service technicians. Usually takes service technicians, depends on product category, but 2 to 4 quarters to be breakeven, and we added a few more in a couple of very targeted areas that are going to help us.

The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We had a solid start to the year with our first quarter results. Local currency sales increased 4%. We had another quarter of good growth in America while Europe came in a little weaker than expected. Emerging markets growth was solid, and we are pleased that we had sales growth in China in the quarter. 
With strong execution and the benefit of productivity initiatives, we achieved good growth in EPS, which increased 9% in the quarter. This equates to 11.5% growth, excluding the impact of currency. We are pleased with these results and that the year is off to a good start.
Now let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."

Sales were $539.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 1% as currencies reduced sales by 3% in the quarter.Turning to Page 3 of the presen",1142,"Thanks, Olivier, and hello to everybody. Sales were $539.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 1% as currencies reduced sales by 3% in the quarter.
Turning to Page 3 of the presentation, we'll outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 6% in the Americas and 4% in Asia/Rest of World and were flat in Europe. Regarding the Europe number, we may have underestimated a little the impact of Easter being in March this year versus April last year. April should -- Europe should do better in the second quarter. China had sales growth of 6% in the quarter, which is better than we expected.
Turning to Slide #4, we outlined sales growth by product line. Laboratory had local currency growth of 5%, industrial increased 2% and food retailing was up 5%. All comparisons are versus the prior year quarter.
Turning to the next slide, let me walk you through the key items in the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 55.6% as compared to 55.8% in the prior year. We're pleased with the good -- continued good contributions from pricing and from our material cost reduction programs. Offsetting this were negative mix and some targeted investments in our service business. Currency was neutral to gross margins in the quarter. As a reminder, gross margins had a very tough comp. In Q1 last year, our gross margins were up 270 basis points, of which 170 basis points of the increase was on a constant currency basis. 
R&D amounted to $29 million. That's a 5% increase in local currency. While SG&A amounted to $168.9 million, and that's an increase of 1% in local currency over the prior year. Investments in our field turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost-saving initiatives. Adjusted operating income amounted to $102 million in the quarter. That's a 5% increase over the prior year amount of $97.3 million. Reduced operating profit -- currency reduced operating profit by $2 million. Absent currency headwinds, growth in operating income would've been 7%. Our operating margin was 18.9%. That's a 70 basis point increase over the prior year. 
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $8.4 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $6.6 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.4 million, which is a 4.7% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.46 per share, a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $2.25 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 11.5% in the quarter. On a reported basis EPS was $2.40 as compared to $2.19 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.02 of restructuring charges.
Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $29.1 million as compared to $41.3 million in the prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and further improvement in DSO, which was reduced by one day to 43 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6. The decline in cash flow versus the prior year is due primarily to the timing of working capital items, which was somewhat impacted by Easter falling in March this year as compared to April last year. We are on target for the full year goal.
Now let me turn to guidance. We're raising our full year local currency sales guidance to 4% versus the 3% to 4% guidance we provided in February. This reflects a better view on China overall, somewhat offset by an expectation that Europe could be a little weaker than we expected. Overall, we feel very good about our product offering and our sales execution, in fact, better than we did 3 months ago. We also have raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.25 per share to $4.35 per share, and that's a growth of 10% to 11%. This compares to the previous guidance of 9% to 11% or $4.10 (sic) [ $14.10 ] to $4 -- $14.30 per share.
Let me provide some additional background at our guidance for the remainder of the year. We now estimate that currency will have minimum impact on EPS for the full year. Previously, we had estimated that currency would be a headwind to EPS growth for the last 3 quarters of this year of approximately 1% or about $0.11 per share. Now we estimate a positive $0.04 impact over the last 3 quarters. We expect to have continued gross margin expansion for the full year, but at a lower rate than we originally assumed. For the coming 3 quarters, year-over-year gross profit margins should be up about 40 -- or sorry, 50 basis points on average. We also plan to expand our field turbo program further in the second half of this year as compared to our original assumption. We like the program's results so far and believe the environment is improving. This will offset some of the productivity gains we have and you saw in our Q1 results. 
One final item. Our share count will be a little higher than maybe your models had, given our recent stock price performance year-to-date. This is a smaller adjustment to our forecast. It reduces EPS by approximately $0.06. But since you're updating your models, we thought it was worth mentioning. To incorporate these factors, we are raising the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.10. We now assume EPS will increase 10% to 11% as compared to the 9% to 11% previously.
Now let's look at the second quarter. We expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4% and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.09 to $3.14. This reflects a growth rate of 10% to 12%. We do not expect currency to meaningfully impact EPS growth in the second quarter. In terms of currency sales -- currency impact on sales growth, we would expect currency to reduce sales growth by 1.5% in the second quarter and 1% for the full year. 
One final miscellaneous item. In the second quarter, we're going to take a noncash pension accounting charge of approximately $8 million related to a lump sum offering to former employees of our U.S. plan. This plan is frozen. In fact, it's been frozen for a long time, and the timing was advantageous to cash-out divested portion of these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company as we used pension plan assets to fund the payments.
Okay. That's it from my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier."

Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had good growth, with 5% local currency sales growth, which is on top of strong growth in prior year.

Lab had good growth, with 5% local currency sales growth, which is on top of strong growth in prior year. Pipette and AutoChem had very strong growth, while Balances also had good growth. Good product pipeline, benefit of field turbo investments and continued strong sales marketing programs, are well contributing to strong lab performance. Spending by our biopharma customers was strong. Industrial increased 2% in the quarter, driven by Product Inspection, which was up 7%. Product Inspection had good growth in most regions, and we continue to benefit from solid market condition and very strong competitive advantages in this market. Core industrial was down slightly in the quarter. Finally, retail was up 5% with strong performance in the Americas and Asia, offset by decline in Europe. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas increased 6%, with good growth in most product lines. Core industrial was down modestly, however, it was against strong comparisons in the prior year period of 8%. We continue to feel good about our growth in the Americas, but they will face tougher comparisons, particularly in the back half of the year. 
Europe sales growth was flat in the quarter, a little weaker than we expected. We had good growth in lab and Product Inspection but declines in core industrial and strong decline in retail. As mentioned earlier, there was some impact of Easter holiday timing. 
Asia/Rest of the World had growth of 4% in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, China had growth of 6%. While we are pleased with the good start, overall economic environment remains challenging in China. In particular, overcapacity remains in the industrial sector, which will take time to resolve. However, we are seeing good results in market segments, such as life sciences. 
We had -- we have had recent wins in our Process Analytics and pipette business since -- with research organizations, such as the CDC and China National Biotec Corporate. Our technology is centered on intelligent sensors and process analytics, and our LiteTouch systems and pipettes helped us beat competition. 
Our industrial team also have some successes. For example, we received an important order at the new pharmaceutical facility to provide a comprehensive solution to integrate formulation software with the bench and floor scales. These are only a couple of small examples, but I thought worth sharing as they demonstrate that the breadth of our product offering provides us good opportunities to target the growth segments of the Chinese market even when many segments struggle.
I recently visited Southeast Asia and had business reviews with our teams from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines. I'm impressed with the good growth we are achieving in this region despite economic conditions, which are challenging. We have strong management teams with proven success capitalizing on field turbo investments and our Spinnaker sales service and marketing initiatives. 
I'm pleased how we continued to create and develop market organizations in new countries. Recent examples include Turkey, Indonesia, Philippines, New Zealand. All of these markets delivered strong results as we benefit from our direct presence. Our international customers really value our direct presence in these countries, particularly customers of our Product Inspections, Process Analytics and Lab businesses. 
Those are all my comments on business trends. I wanted to spend a few minutes today providing an update on our Automated Chemistry business. AutoChem provides enabling technology and software to develop and transfer bench scale chemistry into commercial processes. We are the clear market leaders in automated lab reactors and associated analytical tools that analyze chemical reactions in real time. Our solutions provide customers increased R&D productivity, better products and process quality and ensure commercial processes deliver higher yields at lower costs.
Driven by the reality that biopharma and chemical companies are under ever-increasing pressure to bring products markets -- to market faster, customers have increased their adoption of our AutoChem technology to increase R&D productivity. AutoChem had excellent sales growth in 2015, driven by increased adoption of our technology by our traditional customers, combined with greater penetration in the biopharma large molecule segment.
The prospect for Automated Chemistry remained strong as we estimate the majority of potential users still use in-house engineered solutions, which have fundamental limitations. We're increasingly seeing the general adoption of our EasyMax and OptiMax as the enabling platforms for automated lab reactors and are making great inroads in migrating chemists, engineers and biopharma scientists to adopt this technology to substantially improve productivity.
Expanding our product offering is core to our market leadership in this segment. As our technology gains greater adoption, we see continued opportunities to provide a wider range of solutions. For example, we fill the gap in our offering with the plug-and-play control unit that provides automation for already-installed manual high-volume, low-cost reaction systems. RX-10 has an easy-to-use interface that enhances data capture, increases automation and reinforces our automated lab reactors as the tool of choice in chemical development labs. This month, we will also introduce a new software package, which reduces process complexity, including for data analysis, which allows the tool to be used by non-experts. 
Our market-leading technology, combined with the largest service force in this market, provides excellent competitive advantages for us. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs, along with field turbo resources, are positioning us well for further growth. For those of you that will be attending our Investor Meeting in July, you will have an opportunity to hear a little more about this business and see firsthand some of our innovative technology for this market.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We feel good about the start to 2016 but remain cautious on the global economy, given the uncertainties that exist. Our initiatives are well on track, and we expect to continue to benefit from our strong product pipeline, field turbo investments, Spinnaker sales and marketing programs and our margin and productivity measures. Our focus is on execution and driving above-market growth.
I want now to ask the operator to open the questions for us."

And just as a reminder, we talked to you little bit last quarter about how we had done some things in terms of the sales teams to try to get them in the field a little bit more. Often in the early part of the year, we have sales meetings, training sessions, things, and so we did expect to do that -- frankly, in our original models, we thought Q1 would be the best quarter of the year. And at this stage, we feel like we're going to get full year growth, and that's an improvement, probably low single-digit growth, maybe a little upside to that, but low single-digit growth for the full year. That compares to a low single-digit decline that we would've guided you to before. If we look at the different pieces of the business, of course, our Lab business did particularly well during the quarter. It had solid growth and -- but even our Industrial business showed some signs of improving. If I were to look at order entry, maybe the lab numbers were a little bit better than the order entry. And then the other piece of the surprise was our retail business did well in China. That's always a little bit lumpy there as it is in other parts of the world as well. So we expect another positive number in China next quarter, maybe not quite as good as what we saw this quarter. And I think maybe in 3 months, we can give you guys a better sense if it's the bottom or if we could see more lumpiness going forward. There's still a lot of fundamental issues in China around overcapacity and some fragility in some of the financial markets, but it's nice to get some good surprises there in China. We hadn't had them in a long time, and we'll take that, and we feel like the team executed real well, particularly vis-à-vis competition."

We have -- service generates, actually, both group average profitability. So service is a strategic priority for us. We have given a lot of attention to service in the recent years, and we'll continue do so. In recent years, we had to invest heavily in service related to harmonizing our service product offering across the world, and we wanted also to streamline our processes. We want to prepare service also to bring it to our Blue Ocean platform, and more recently, we thought to invest now in service in the growth area and so also about adding telesales people to sell service contracts and also have better coverage. So the investment goes there. We see actually good results. We were happy to see that in Q1, service in consumer was actually up 6%, so as you can see, higher than what we had on products. And I am optimistic that we will continue to do well in service, and so the investment and the attention that business gets is well deserved."

And I am kind of looking at Mary, too, to make sure I quote some of the numbers right, but I think I understand you. So the first comment is gross profit margin came in little less than our model, probably a little bit less than some of your guys' models in Q1. If we look at now the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our best estimate at this point would be on a currency-neutral basis, or actually, I think there's maybe only 10 basis points, anyway, difference between actual and constant currency. But look at something like 50 basis points, on average, in the remaining 3 quarters of the year could be little bit better than that, but something in that range. That, of course, is a good number, and so we're happy with that number, but I think it compares a little bit. And if you look at what that means in terms of our full year model, it means maybe a little bit less gross profit margin for the full year than most people were expecting. So that's kind of maybe a slight negative. A slight positive is that we took the midpoint of our sales guidance up from -- by 50 basis points. The next item is that you could see in our operating expenses that our various cost savings, cost reengineering initiatives continue to go well. Our operating expenses, as we view it internally, were only up about 1% in the quarter despite having, I think, 250 more field personnel between sales and service than we had in Q1 a year ago. So we feel good about that and partly because we're happy with how the field turbo program's going. Olivier mentioned that we're starting to approve already a few more field turbos that'll start to add a little bit of operating expense growth more than we had in the original model in the second half of the year. And then a final minor thing is that we had a -- the share price has performed well recently and that, for most of you guys, will probably have some impact on us spending $0.5 billion on share repurchases. We'll get a few less shares purchased because of that. That impact for us, at least in our model, was about $0.06. And of course, one of the bigger impacts, Steve, is that if you look at where currencies are as of yesterday, I guess, as compared to what we told you in February and you look at that over the last 3 quarters of the year, I say the last 3 quarters because, of course, the first quarter is already behind us, we estimated about a $0.15 per share impact as the delta between those 2, and of course, that's a positive delta. So taking all those things together, that's how we got to this $0.10 per share movement in terms of the midpoint of our guidance."

So in terms of the -- your question on gross profit margin, so we -- maybe I can give the overall picture. So the overall picture, 180 basis points price realization, that translates to about plus 80 bps on gross margin. Material costs were down 120 bps. That translates to 20 bps in terms of year-on-year movement in gross profit margin. Then the rest is kind of equally split between a mix topic, a series of little mix things kind of adding up. So maybe kind of some of the highlight ones were a little less sales than -- in terms of the overall composition, a less European direct sales and a little less Southeast Asian sales, and those are 2 highly profitable markets. And if I look at within the lab product categories, titration, for example, is one of our highest gross margin products, that some of their sales, move a little bit into the latter part of the year due to some new product introductions. And then the service was the other half of the kind of the negative. And in service, we just -- Olivier talked about it earlier. We really see service as an important part of our growth in terms of profit going forward, but also it's just one of the great competitive barriers and advantages that we want to build on. And we invested a little bit more in service technicians. It usually takes service technicians, depends on product category, but 2 to 4 quarters to be breakeven, and we added a few more in a couple of very targeted areas that are going to help us. And they very much fit in with how we made some of our field turbo investments and so we very much support those."

I saw that very nicely in our results from our pipette business and Automated Chemistry that are strongly exposed to that market and did extremely well.

The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales growth was 6% in the quarter and better-than-expected. We continue to generate a very solid growth in the America. Asia / Rest of World, including China, had very good growth. Europe growth was solid. With the benefit of our margin and cause initiatives, we had good growth in margins, which contributed to excellent growth in the earnings-per-share. Cash flow was also strong in the quarter. We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year. We will cover this shortly, but let me now turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."

Sales were $608.3 million in the quarter, and that's an increase of 6% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter.

On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. 
On Slide #4, which show local currency sales growth for the quarter. Sales grew by 6% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 8% in Asia / Rest of World. 
On the next slide, we show local currency sales growth of 5%. On a year-to-date basis, that includes the Americas at 6%, Europe at 2% and Asia / Rest of World has increased 6% in the first half. 
Starting on Slide #6, we'll outline sales by product area. Laboratory had very good growth with local currency sales, up 10%, industrial increased by 3% and food retail declined by 2%. All these comparisons are of course to the prior year. 
On the next slide, you will see our year-to-date sales summary by product line. Lab has grown 7% in the first half, industrial 3% and food retail increased by 1%. 
Now I'd like to turn to Slide #8 and walk through the rest of the P&L. Our gross margins were 57.1%, that's a 160 basis-point improvement over the prior year amount of 55.5%. We are very happy with the strong performance in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our gross margins have increased in line with the expectations we had for our expansion for the full year. 
Pricing, material costs and mix all contributed to the increase in the quarter and was partly offset by some additional targeted investments in our service business. Currency had no impact on gross margins in the quarter. 
R&D amounted to $30.7 million in the quarter, and that's a 5% increase in local currency. SG&A was $187.8 million, that's a 9% increase in local currency over the prior year. Investment in our field turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost-saving initiatives. 
Adjusted operating income was $129.1 million in the quarter, that's a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $118.3 million. Currency reduced operating profits by approximately $800,000 in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margins were 21.2%, a 90 basis-point increase over the prior year and, of course, a level of which we were pleased with. 
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $8.7 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $6.9 million. Our effective tax rate was 24%. You'll notice our reported tax rate was lower at 22.9%, which is due to the tax impact of the one-time pension charge, which I'll cover in a minute. 
Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.1 million, which is a 4.6% decline from the prior year amount and reflects the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22 per share, that's a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $2.80 per share. 
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $2.93 per share as compared to $2.73 per share. As we mentioned on our last call during the quarter, we took a onetime, noncash pension settlement charge of $8 million before tax or $0.19 per share after tax. This relates to offering former employees of our U.S. plan a lump sum payout. The plan that we're talking about is frozen and the timing was advantageous to cash out divested proportion for these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company as we use pension plan assets to fund the payments. 
Reported EPS also includes $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.06 of restructuring charges. 
The next Slide shows the P&L for the first half of the year. We had local currency sales growth of 5%, operating income increased by 7% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 12%. Absent currencies, growth for the first half of the year would have been 14%. 
Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $108.9 million, which compares to $89.9 million in the prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO, which was reduced by 2 days to 38 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6. Cash flow for the 6 months was $138 million as compared to $131.3 million from the prior year. 
In the third quarter, we expect to complete the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the business called Troemner  which is focused in 2 areas: Weights and weighed calibration, cell as the manufacturing of basic lab equipment. We paid approximately 10x EBITDA for the business, and it should add about 1% to the sales on a full year basis. 
It's a unique strategic fit to our business, and we are very happy to be able to close the business shortly. Olivier will provide some additional background on Troemner shortly. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We are raising our full year local currency sales guidance to approximate 5% versus 4% previously. We estimate that Troemner will contribute about 50 basis points of sales growth for the half-year, so for 2016, Or to say it different, we raised our organic growth expectations for the full year by 50 basis points to approximately 4.5%. We've also raised our EPS guidance, and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.40 per share to $14.50, which represents a growth rate of 11% to 12%. This compares to previous guidance of 10% to 11% EPS growth or $14.25 per share to $14.35 per share. We are raising the midpoint of our guidance by $0.15 to reflect our strong performance, as well as the acquisition of Troemner.
With respect to the third quarter, we expect local currency sales growth between 5% and 6%. This includes about 75 basis points of growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $3.65 per share to $3.70 per share, which is a growth rate of 12% to 13%. 
In terms of currency, let me first comment on sales growth. We would expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 2% in the third quarter and 2% for the full year. In terms of the impact of currency on EPS, we do not expect it to have a meaningful impact on Q3 or for the full year. 
That's it from my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier."

Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had very good growth in the quarter with 10% increasing. Pipette analytical instruments and process analytics had excellent growth, with balances and auto also had good growth. Growth was strong across all regions and reflects our robust product pipeline, benefit of field turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs. 
Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be very favorable. Industrial increased 3% in the quarter, driven by a 6% increase in core industrial. Growth in core industrial was particularly strong in the Americas, which benefited from some project activities in transportation and logistics. We also had growth in core industrial in Europe and Asia, including China. 
Product expansion was down slightly in the quarter. This business continues to perform well, but was impacted by timing of some activity and a strong comparison from the prior year. Product Inspection have strong order growth in the quarter, and we expect good sales growth in Q3. 
Finally, sales declined 2% in retail. This was pretty much as expected. We had growth in Europe and Asia, but decline in the Americas against good growth in the prior year. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid with 6% growth. We had very good growth in lab and industrial, while sales declined in retail. Demand continues to be solid in the Americas, but tougher comps will impact the second half. 
Europe grew 4% in the quarter, an improvement over the first quarter, which we think was in part due to timing of the Easter holiday. Lab had excellent growth in Europe, while quarter industrial and retail also grew. Product Inspection was down, which would improve in the quarter. 
Asia / Rest of World had growth of 8% in the quarter. China is very well and better than we expected as compared to the last time we spoke. Lab growth in China was double digits, with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We are pleased with the performance, which reflects some improving demand and also the benefit of our actions to  reduce -- to redirect resources to fast-growing market segment. While industrial in China had modest growth, the fact is that overcapacity in industrial manufacturing sector remains. 
While we're also pleased with our results in China, we expect growth in the second half to be in the mid-single digit range. 
Let me make some comments on service, which grew 5% in the quarter and on an year-to-date basis. Service represents about 23% of total sales, and it is a competitive advantage and an important source of revenue growth. This is the fifth year in a row, which service growth is outpacing product growth. Although this might not occur each and every quarter, over the medium term, we expect service growth to exceed product growth. We have a service force of approximately 2,600 personnel which is, by far, larger than our direct competitor. Our service team is specialized by product area, and we have made significant investments, including training of tools, which supports the daily activity. 
Core to our service growth, strategy is increasing the percentage of our installed base under service contract and increasing the amount of service sold at a point of product sale. The long-term objective interchange mix of our service business to be largely contract business versus great fix. Today, contract represent approximately 1/3 of our service sales. There are several reasons why this migration is a strategic imperative, including the increasing quality of our products, reducing the need for repair, contract work -- sorry, and on the other half, contract work is all easily planned. So therefore, our technicians can be more productive. And finally, our study show that service contracts leads to higher levels of cost customer satisfaction, and therefore, retention. 
The globalization and harmonization of our service offering, which we undertook several years ago, led the groundwork to drive the contract business. Our marketing campaigns under Spinnaker initiative and our field turbo investments are helping to drive this strength. Overall, we continue to make very good progress. We believe service is one of our most important competitive advantage and should continue to be an important source of sales and profit growth. 
Those are all my comments on business plan. I now want to provide some context to our acquisition of Troemner. Located in the Philadelphia area, Troemner is a U.S. market leader for weights and weights calibration and a great strategic fit to our leadership position in Europe. Together, we are now the global leader in this niche market. Weights and weight recalibration services is an attractive market. It has a strong barriers to entry as it requires very specialized know-how and expertise. We have 14 calibration labs worldwide, and the acquisition Troemner firmly positions us as the U.S. market leader. Troemner is a very strong brand in U.S. based on its word class metrology competence and solid infrastructure. 
Service, which consists primarily of weight calibration is almost 20% of Troemner business and growing quite well. This is an attractive business as customers must calibrate weights on a regular basis and have few players have the expertise to do it correctly. This is a good example of the kind of service business that fits well into our goal and of moving our service business to more contract value-added service. 
Troemner is also a provider of basic lab product such as [indiscernible] mixers and shakers, which will be a good strategic fit to all house offering. As a reminder, all houses is our second brand used for indirect distribution for laboratory products of certain industrial weighing products. 
Troemner will help us strengthen the life science portfolio for All House, which we have worked to expand over the last few years in terms of channel presence and product portfolio. We also believe we can further expand this equipment offering internationally, particularly in emerging markets. We think this is a great opportunity to extend the offering of Ohaus. Troemner would add about 1% to sales growth with similar margins to our own. We anticipate synergy potential from top line growth, as well as potential in operational synergies. We expect to complete the acquisition shortly and have already begun integration plan. We believe this is a solid strategic acquisition, and are excited about the potential development in this attractive market segment. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We have kept our comments brief, as we will see many of you tomorrow at our Investor Meeting. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for question. 
We are very pleased with strong results in the second quarter. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is good, but we acknowledge the uncertainty in the global economy. Our focus remains on fact that we can control, namely the successful execution of our initiatives. We feel very good about our new product launches, field turbo investment, Spinnaker marketing initiatives and productivity measures. We believe with that unit strong execution, we can continue to gain share. I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And it was interesting for us to see when we started through the details of our numbers. And we saw really good growth, of course, in the government sector when it came to lab. We also saw across the board a very good growth with multinationals. And that's an interesting comment in a sense that if you look over the last 3 years, the percentage of our total sales in China going to multinational has shrunk, but now we see a nice rebound in the first half of the year across product categories, and I think that, this famous comment that we talked about for a multinational company, they can do further for replacement cycle for a while on our products, but eventually it bounces back. And I think we see that a little bit there. It's probably less than the product side, but much more return to the normal replacement cycle. In terms of the order entry, the order entry was similarly positive to what we saw in the sales side. So it was a solid number, it wasn't -- it's not that we -- it's purely the order entry would make us cautious about the second half.  But just the realities of that still a market with some instability in it, and I think, I was remaining cautious makes sense. But I actually felt what we just shared with you about multinational was one of the more positive reading that we had in our data coming out of China."

The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales growth was 6% in the quarter and better than we expected. We continue to generate very solid growth in the America. Asia / Rest of World, including China, had very good growth. Europe growth was solid. With the benefit of our margin and cause initiatives, we had good growth in margins, which contributed to excellent growth in our earnings per share. Cash flow was also strong in the quarter. We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year. We will cover this shortly, but let me now turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."

Sales were $608.3 million in the quarter, and that's an increase of 6% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter.

On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. 
On Slide #4, which show local currency sales growth for the quarter, sales grew by 6% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 8% in Asia / Rest of World. 
On the next slide, we show local currency sales growth of 5%. On a year-to-date basis, that includes the Americas at 6%, Europe at 2% and Asia / Rest of World has increased 6% in the first half. 
Starting page -- on Slide #6, we'll outline sales by product area. Laboratory had very good growth with local currency sales up 10%, industrial increased by 3% and food retail declined by 2%. All these comparisons are, of course, to the prior year. 
On the next slide, you'll see our year-to-date sales summary by product line. Lab has grown 7% in the first half, industrial 3% and food retail increased by 1%. 
Now I'd like to turn to Slide #8 and walk through the rest of the P&L. Our gross margins were 57.1%, that's a 160 basis-point improvement over the prior year amount of 55.5%. We are very happy with the strong performance in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our gross margins have increased in line with the expectations we had for our expansion for the full year. 
Pricing, material cost and mix all contributed to the increase in the quarter and was partly offset by some additional targeted investments in our service business. Currency had no impact on gross margins in the quarter. 
R&D amounted to $30.7 million in the quarter, and that's a 5% increase in local currency. SG&A was $187.8 million, that's a 9% increase in local currency over the prior year. Investment in our field turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost saving initiatives. 
Adjusted operating income was $129.1 million in the quarter, that's a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $118.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $800,000 in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margins were 21.2%, a 90 basis point increase over the prior year and, of course, a level of which we are pleased with. 
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $8.7 million in the quarter while interest expense was $6.9 million. Our effective tax rate was 24%. You'll notice our reported tax rate was lower at 22.9%, which is due to the tax impact of the one-time pension charge, which I'll cover in a minute. 
Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.1 million, which is a 4.6% decline from the prior year amount and reflects the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22 per share, that's a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $2.80 per share. 
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $2.93 per share as compared to $2.73 per share. As we mentioned on our last call, during the quarter, we took a onetime, noncash pension settlement charge of $8 million before tax or $0.19 per share after tax. This relates to offering former employees of our U.S. plan a lump sum payout. The plan that we're talking about is frozen and the timing was advantageous to cash out divested proportion for these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company as we used pension plan assets to fund the payments. 
Reported EPS also includes $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.06 of restructuring charges. 
The next Slide shows the P&L for the first half of the year. We had local currency sales growth of 5%, operating income increased by 7% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 12%. Absent currencies, growth for the first half of the year would have been 14%. 
Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $108.9 million, which compares to $89.9 million in the prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO, which was reduced by 2 days to 38 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6. Cash flow for the 6 months was $138 million as compared to $131.3 million in the prior year. 
In the third quarter, we expect to complete the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the business called Troemner which is focused in 2 areas: weights and weigh calibration as well as the manufacturing of basic lab equipment. We paid approximately 10x EBITDA for the business, and it should add about 1% to sales on a full year basis. 
It's a unique strategic fit with our business, and we're very happy to be able to close the business shortly. Olivier will provide some additional background on Troemner shortly. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We're raising our full year local currency sales guidance to approximately 5% versus 4% previously. We estimate that Troemner will contribute about 50 basis points of sales growth for the half year, so for 2016. Or to say it different, we raised our organic growth expectations for the full year by 50 basis points to approximately 4.5%. We've also raised our EPS guidance, and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.40 per share to $14.50, which represents a growth rate of 11% to 12%. This compares to previous guidance of 10% to 11% EPS growth or $14.25 per share to $14.35 per share. We are raising the midpoint of our guidance by $0.15 to reflect our strong performance as well as the acquisition of Troemner.
With respect to the third quarter, we expect local currency sales growth between 5% and 6%. This includes about 75 basis points of growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $3.65 per share to $3.70 per share, which is a growth rate of 12% to 13%. 
In terms of currency, let me first comment on sales growth. We would expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 2% in the third quarter and 2% for the full year. In terms of the impact of currency on EPS, we do not expect it to have a meaningful impact on Q3 or for the full year. 
That's it from my side. And I now want to turn it back to Olivier."

Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had very good growth in the quarter with 10% increasing. Pipette analytical instruments and process analytics had excellent growth with balances and AutoChem also had good growth",1202,"Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had very good growth in the quarter with 10% increasing. Pipette analytical instruments and process analytics had excellent growth with balances and AutoChem also had good growth. Growth was strong across all regions and reflects our robust product pipeline, benefit of field turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs. 
Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be very favorable. Industrial increased 3% in the quarter, driven by a 6% increase in core industrial. Growth in core industrial was particularly strong in the Americas, which benefited from some project activity in transportation and logistics. We also had growth in core industrial in Europe and Asia, including China. 
Product Inspection was down slightly in the quarter. This business continues to perform well, but was impacted by timing of some activity and a strong comparison from the prior year. Product Inspection have strong order growth in the quarter, and we expect good sales growth in Q3. 
Finally, sales declined 2% in retail. This was pretty much as expected. We had growth in Europe and Asia, but decline in the Americas against good growth in the prior year. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid with 6% growth. We had very good growth in lab and industrial, while sales declined in retail. Demand continues to be solid in the Americas, but tougher comps will impact the second half. 
Europe grew 4% in the quarter, an improvement over the first quarter, which we think was in part due to timing of Easter holiday. Lab had excellent growth in Europe while core industrial and retail also grew. Product Inspection was down, which would improve in the quarter. 
Asia / Rest of the World had growth of 8% in the quarter. China did very well and better than we expected as compared to the last time we spoke. Lab growth in China was double digits with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We are pleased with the performance, which reflects some improving demand and also the benefit of our actions to reduce -- redirect resources to faster-growing market segment. While industrial in China had modest growth, the fact is that overcapacity in the industrial manufacturing sector remains. 
While we're also pleased with our results in China, we expect growth in the second half to be in the mid-single digit range. 
Let me make some comments on service, which grew 5% in the quarter and on an year-to-date basis. Service represents about 23% of total sales, and it is a key competitive advantage and an important source of revenue growth. This is the fifth year in a row with service growth is outpacing product growth. Although this might not occur each and every quarter, over the medium term, we expect service growth to exceed product growth. We have a service force of approximately 2,600 personnel which is, by far, larger than our direct competitor. Our service team is specialized by product area, and we have made significant investments, including training of tools, which supports the daily activity. 
Core to our service growth strategy is increasing the percentage of our installed base under service contract and increasing the amount of service sold at a point of product sale. The long-term objective is to change the mix of our service business to be largely contract business versus great fix. Today, contract represent approximately 1/3 of our service sales. There are several reasons why this migration is a strategic imperative, including the increasing quality of our products, reducing the need for repair, contract work -- sorry, and on the other half, contract work is more usually planned. And therefore, our technicians can be more productive. And finally, our studies show that service contracts leads to high levels of cost -- customer satisfaction, and therefore, retention. 
The globalization and harmonization of our service offering, which we undertook several years ago, led the groundwork to drive the contract business. Our marketing campaigns under the Spinnaker initiative and our field turbo investments are helping to drive this strength [ph]. Overall, we continue to make very good progress. We believe service is one of our most important competitive advantage and should continue to be an important source of sales and profit growth. 
Those are all my comments on business strength. I now want to provide some context to our acquisition of Troemner. Located in the Philadelphia area, Troemner is the U.S. market leader for weights and weight calibration and a great strategic fit to our leadership position in Europe. Together, we are now the global leader in this niche market. Weights and weight recalibration services is an attractive market. It has a strong barriers to entry as it requires very specialized know-how and expertise. We have 14 calibration labs worldwide, and the acquisition of Troemner firmly positions us as the U.S. market leader. Troemner is a very strong brand in U.S. based on its word class metrology competence and solid infrastructure. 
Service, which consists primarily of weight calibration, is almost 20% of Troemner's business and growing quite well. This is an attractive business as customers must calibrate weights on a regular basis and only a very few players have the expertise to do it correctly. This is a good example of the kind of service business that fits well into our goal of moving our service business to more contract value-added service. 
Troemner is also a provider of basic lab product such as stirrers, mixers and shakers, which will be a good strategic fit to Ohaus offering. As a reminder, Ohaus is our second brand used for indirect distribution for laboratory products of certain industrial weighing products. 
Troemner will help us strengthen the life science portfolio for Ohaus, which we have worked to expand over the last few years in terms of channel presence and product portfolio. We also believe we can further expand this equipment offering internationally, particularly in emerging markets. We think this is a great opportunity to extend the offering of Ohaus. Troemner would add about 1% to sales growth with similar margins to our own. We anticipate synergy potential from top line growth as well as potential in operational synergies. We expect to complete the acquisition shortly and have already begun integration plan. We believe this is a solid strategic acquisition and are excited about the potential development in this attractive market segment. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We have kept our comments brief as we will see many of you tomorrow at our Investor Meeting. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for question. 
We are very pleased with strong results in the second quarter. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is good, but we acknowledge the uncertainty in the global economy. Our focus remains on factors we can control, namely successful execution of our initiatives. We feel very good about our new product launches, field turbo investment, Spinnaker marketing initiatives and productivity measures. We believe with continued strong execution, we can continue to gain share. I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And you'll see a little bit of that going forward. In terms of our incremental margin, I continue to think that numbers in the mid, high 30s are very realistic and, frankly, absent the adjustment incentive comp in the current quarter, which won't the impact full year numbers in a material way would've been there."

Maybe one interesting insight we might give you is that I know there's been some articles that some of the GDP growth has come from leveraging up further some of the state-owned enterprises and regional governments. And it was interesting for us to see when we sorted through the details of our numbers that we saw really good growth, of course, in the government sector when it came to lab. But we also saw across the board very good growth with multinationals. And that's an interesting comment in the sense that if you look over the last 3 years, the percentage of our total sales in China going to multinationals has shrunk. But now we see a nice rebound in the first half of the year across product categories, and I think that -- this famous comment that we talked about of -- for a multinational company, they can defer the replacement cycle for a while on our products, but eventually, it bounces back. And I think we see that a little bit there. It's probably a little less than the project side, but much more return to the normal replacement cycle. In terms of the order entry, order entry was similarly positive to what we saw in the sales side. So it was a solid number. It wasn't -- it's not that we -- that purely the order entry would make us cautious about the second half. It's just the realities of that, it's still a market with some instability in it, and I think us remaining cautious makes sense. But I actually felt what we just shared with you about multinational was one of the more positive readings that we had in our data coming out of China."

I will start with the summary of the quarter, and then the Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. 
The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales growth was 6% in the quarter and better than we expected. We continue to generate very solid growth in the America. Asia / Rest of World, including China, had very good growth. Europe growth was solid. With the benefit of our margin and  initiatives we had good growth in margins, which contributed to excellent growth in our earnings per share. Cash flow was also strong in the quarter. We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year. We will cover this shortly, but let me now turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."
31468,370342373,1016879,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $608.3 million in the quarter, and that's an increase of 6% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter.

On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. 
On Slide #4, which show local currency sales growth for the quarter, sales grew by 6% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 8% in Asia / Rest of World. 
On the next slide, we show local currency sales growth of 5%. On a year-to-date basis, that includes the Americas at 6%, Europe at 2% and Asia / Rest of World has increased 6% in the first half. 
Starting page -- on Slide #6, we'll outline sales by product area. Laboratory had very good growth with local currency sales up 10%, industrial increased by 3% and food retail declined by 2%. All these comparisons are, of course, to the prior year. 
On the next slide, you'll see our year-to-date sales summary by product line. Lab has grown 7% in the first half, industrial 3% and food retail increased by 1%. 
Now I'd like to turn to Slide #8 and walk through the rest of the P&L. Our gross margins were 57.1%, that's a 160 basis-point improvement over the prior year amount of 55.5%. We are very happy with the strong performance in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our gross margins have increased in line with the expectations we had for our expansion for the full year. 
Pricing, material cost and mix all contributed to the increase in the quarter and was partly offset by some additional targeted investments in our service business. Currency had no impact on gross margins in the quarter. 
R&D amounted to $30.7 million in the quarter, and that's a 5% increase in local currency. SG&A was $187.8 million, that's a 9% increase in local currency over the prior year. Investment in our field turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost saving initiatives. 
Adjusted operating income was $129.1 million in the quarter, that's a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $118.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $800,000 in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margins were 21.2%, a 90 basis point increase over the prior year and, of course, a level of which we are pleased with. 
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $8.7 million in the quarter while interest expense was $6.9 million. Our effective tax rate was 24%. You'll notice our reported tax rate was lower at 22.9%, which is due to the tax impact of the one-time pension charge, which I'll cover in a minute. 
Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.1 million, which is a 4.6% decline from the prior year amount and reflects the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22 per share, that's a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $2.80 per share. 
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $2.93 per share as compared to $2.73 per share. As we mentioned on our last call, during the quarter, we took a onetime, noncash pension settlement charge of $8 million before tax or $0.19 per share after tax. This relates to offering former employees of our U.S. plan a lump sum payout. The plan that we're talking about is frozen and the timing was advantageous to cash out divested proportion for these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company as we used pension plan assets to fund the payments. 
Reported EPS also includes $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.06 of restructuring charges. 
The next Slide shows the P&L for the first half of the year. We had local currency sales growth of 5%, operating income increased by 7% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 12%. Absent currencies, growth for the first half of the year would have been 14%. 
Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $108.9 million, which compares to $89.9 million in the prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO, which was reduced by 2 days to 38 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6. Cash flow for the 6 months was $138 million as compared to $131.3 million in the prior year. 
In the third quarter, we expect to complete the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the business called Troemner which is focused in 2 areas: weights and weigh calibration as well as the manufacturing of basic lab equipment. We paid approximately 10x EBITDA for the business, and it should add about 1% to sales on a full year basis. 
It's a unique strategic fit with our business, and we're very happy to be able to close the business shortly. Olivier will provide some additional background on Troemner shortly. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We're raising our full year local currency sales guidance to approximately 5% versus 4% previously. We estimate that Troemner will contribute about 50 basis points of sales growth for the half year, so for 2016. Or to say it different, we raised our organic growth expectations for the full year by 50 basis points to approximately 4.5%. We've also raised our EPS guidance, and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.40 per share to $14.50, which represents a growth rate of 11% to 12%. This compares to previous guidance of 10% to 11% EPS growth or $14.25 per share to $14.35 per share. We are raising the midpoint of our guidance by $0.15 to reflect our strong performance as well as the acquisition of Troemner.
With respect to the third quarter, we expect local currency sales growth between 5% and 6%. This includes about 75 basis points of growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $3.65 per share to $3.70 per share, which is a growth rate of 12% to 13%. 
In terms of currency, let me first comment on sales growth. We would expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 2% in the third quarter and 2% for the full year. In terms of the impact of currency on EPS, we do not expect it to have a meaningful impact on Q3 or for the full year. 
That's it from my side. And I now want to turn it back to Olivier."
31468,370342373,1016879,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had very good growth in the quarter with 10% increasing.

Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had very good growth in the quarter with 10% increasing. Pipette analytical instruments and process analytics had excellent growth with balances and AutoChem also had good growth. Growth was strong across all regions and reflects our robust product pipeline, benefit of field turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs. 
Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be very favorable. Industrial increased 3% in the quarter, driven by a 6% increase in core industrial. Growth in core industrial was particularly strong in the Americas, which benefited from some project activity in transportation and logistics. We also had growth in core industrial in Europe and Asia, including China. 
Product Inspection was down slightly in the quarter. This business continues to perform well, but was impacted by timing of some activity and a strong comparison from the prior year. Product Inspection have strong order growth in the quarter, and we expect good sales growth in Q3. 
Finally, sales declined 2% in retail. This was pretty much as expected. We had growth in Europe and Asia, but decline in the Americas against good growth in the prior year. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid with 6% growth. We had very good growth in lab and industrial, while sales declined in retail. Demand continues to be solid in the Americas, but tougher comps will impact the second half. 
Europe grew 4% in the quarter, an improvement over the first quarter, which we think was in part due to timing of Easter holiday. Lab had excellent growth in Europe while core industrial and retail also grew. Product Inspection was down, which would improve in the quarter. 
Asia / Rest of the World had growth of 8% in the quarter. China did very well and better than we expected as compared to the last time we spoke. Lab growth in China was double digits with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We are pleased with the performance, which reflects some improving demand and also the benefit of our actions to reduce -- redirect resources to faster-growing market segment. While industrial in China had modest growth, the fact is that overcapacity in the industrial manufacturing sector remains. 
While we're also pleased with our results in China, we expect growth in the second half to be in the mid-single digit range. 
Let me make some comments on service, which grew 5% in the quarter and on an year-to-date basis. Service represents about 23% of total sales, and it is a key competitive advantage and an important source of revenue growth. This is the fifth year in a row with service growth is outpacing product growth. Although this might not occur each and every quarter, over the medium term, we expect service growth to exceed product growth. We have a service force of approximately 2,600 personnel which is, by far, larger than our direct competitor. Our service team is specialized by product area, and we have made significant investments, including training of tools, which supports the daily activity. 
Core to our service growth strategy is increasing the percentage of our installed base under service contract and increasing the amount of service sold at a point of product sale. The long-term objective is to change the mix of our service business to be largely contract business versus great fix. Today, contract represent approximately 1/3 of our service sales. There are several reasons why this migration is a strategic imperative, including the increasing quality of our products, reducing the need for repair, contract work -- sorry, and on the other half, contract work is more usually planned. And therefore, our technicians can be more productive. And finally, our studies show that service contracts leads to high levels of cost -- customer satisfaction, and therefore, retention. 
The globalization and harmonization of our service offering, which we undertook several years ago, led the groundwork to drive the contract business. Our marketing campaigns under the Spinnaker initiative and our field turbo investments are helping to drive this strength. Overall, we continue to make very good progress. We believe service is one of our most important competitive advantage and should continue to be an important source of sales and profit growth. 
Those are all my comments on business strength. I now want to provide some context to our acquisition of Troemner. Located in the Philadelphia area, Troemner is the U.S. market leader for weights and weight calibration and a great strategic fit to our leadership position in Europe. Together, we are now the global leader in this niche market. Weights and weight recalibration services is an attractive market. It has a strong barriers to entry as it requires very specialized know-how and expertise. We have 14 calibration labs worldwide, and the acquisition of Troemner firmly positions us as the U.S. market leader. Troemner is a very strong brand in U.S. based on its word class metrology competence and solid infrastructure. 
Service, which consists primarily of weight calibration, is almost 20% of Troemner's business and growing quite well. This is an attractive business as customers must calibrate weights on a regular basis and only a very few players have the expertise to do it correctly. This is a good example of the kind of service business that fits well into our goal of moving our service business to more contract value-added service. 
Troemner is also a provider of basic lab product such as stirrers, mixers and shakers, which will be a good strategic fit to Ohaus offering. As a reminder, Ohaus is our second brand used for indirect distribution for laboratory products of certain industrial weighing products. 
Troemner will help us strengthen the life science portfolio for Ohaus, which we have worked to expand over the last few years in terms of channel presence and product portfolio. We also believe we can further expand this equipment offering internationally, particularly in emerging markets. We think this is a great opportunity to extend the offering of Ohaus. Troemner would add about 1% to sales growth with similar margins to our own. We anticipate synergy potential from top line growth as well as potential in operational synergies. We expect to complete the acquisition shortly and have already begun integration plan. We believe this is a solid strategic acquisition and are excited about the potential development in this attractive market segment. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We have kept our comments brief as we will see many of you tomorrow at our Investor Meeting. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for question. 
We are very pleased with strong results in the second quarter. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is good, but we acknowledge the uncertainty in the global economy. Our focus remains on factors we can control, namely successful execution of our initiatives. We feel very good about our new product launches, field turbo investment, Spinnaker marketing initiatives and productivity measures. We believe with continued strong execution, we can continue to gain share. I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

If we look out to next quarter, the comp will be 7%, so I think our view is that lab will grow well, the 2-year growth rate will continue to be in a similar kind of range to what we have on a year-to-date basis and specifically in terms of end markets and the you mentioned, biopharma spending is good. It should continue to be good but comps do matter a bit."

But now we see a nice rebound in the first half of the year across product categories, and I think that -- this famous comment that we talked about of -- for a multinational company, they can defer the replacement cycle for a while on our products, but eventually, it bounces back. And I think we see that a little bit there. It's probably a little less than the project side, but much more return to the normal replacement cycle. In terms of the order entry, order entry was similarly positive to what we saw in the sales side. So it was a solid number. It wasn't -- it's not that we -- that purely the order entry would make us cautious about the second half. It's just the realities of that, it's still a market with some instability in it, and I think us remaining cautious makes sense. But I actually felt what we just shared with you about multinational was one of the more positive readings that we had in our data coming out of China."

The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales growth was 6% in the quarter and better than we expected. We continue to generate very solid growth in the America. Asia / Rest of World, including China, had very good growth. Europe growth was solid. With the benefit of our margin and  initiatives we had good growth in margins, which contributed to excellent growth in our earnings per share. Cash flow was also strong in the quarter. We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year. We will cover this shortly, but let me now turn it to Bill to cover the numbers."
31468,370342373,1017663,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $608.3 million in the quarter, and that's an increase of 6% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter.

On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. 
On Slide #4, which show local currency sales growth for the quarter, sales grew by 6% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 8% in Asia / Rest of World. 
On the next slide, we show local currency sales growth of 5%. On a year-to-date basis, that includes the Americas at 6%, Europe at 2% and Asia / Rest of World has increased 6% in the first half. 
Starting page -- on Slide #6, we'll outline sales by product area. Laboratory had very good growth with local currency sales up 10%, industrial increased by 3% and food retail declined by 2%. All these comparisons are, of course, to the prior year. 
On the next slide, you'll see our year-to-date sales summary by product line. Lab has grown 7% in the first half, industrial 3% and food retail increased by 1%. 
Now I'd like to turn to Slide #8 and walk through the rest of the P&L. Our gross margins were 57.1%, that's a 160 basis-point improvement over the prior year amount of 55.5%. We are very happy with the strong performance in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our gross margins have increased in line with the expectations we had for our expansion for the full year. 
Pricing, material cost and mix all contributed to the increase in the quarter and was partly offset by some additional targeted investments in our service business. Currency had no impact on gross margins in the quarter. 
R&D amounted to $30.7 million in the quarter, and that's a 5% increase in local currency. SG&A was $187.8 million, that's a 9% increase in local currency over the prior year. Investment in our field turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost saving initiatives. 
Adjusted operating income was $129.1 million in the quarter, that's a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $118.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $800,000 in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margins were 21.2%, a 90 basis point increase over the prior year and, of course, a level of which we are pleased with. 
A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $8.7 million in the quarter while interest expense was $6.9 million. Our effective tax rate was 24%. You'll notice our reported tax rate was lower at 22.9%, which is due to the tax impact of the one-time pension charge, which I'll cover in a minute. 
Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.1 million, which is a 4.6% decline from the prior year amount and reflects the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22 per share, that's a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $2.80 per share. 
On a reported basis, earnings per share were $2.93 per share as compared to $2.73 per share. As we mentioned on our last call, during the quarter, we took a onetime, noncash pension settlement charge of $8 million before tax or $0.19 per share after tax. This relates to offering former employees of our U.S. plan a lump sum payout. The plan that we're talking about is frozen and the timing was advantageous to cash out divested proportion for these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company as we used pension plan assets to fund the payments. 
Reported EPS also includes $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.06 of restructuring charges. 
The next Slide shows the P&L for the first half of the year. We had local currency sales growth of 5%, operating income increased by 7% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 12%. Absent currencies, growth for the first half of the year would have been 14%. 
Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $108.9 million, which compares to $89.9 million in the prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO, which was reduced by 2 days to 38 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6. Cash flow for the 6 months was $138 million as compared to $131.3 million in the prior year. 
In the third quarter, we expect to complete the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the business called Troemner which is focused in 2 areas: weights and weigh calibration as well as the manufacturing of basic lab equipment. We paid approximately 10x EBITDA for the business, and it should add about 1% to sales on a full year basis. 
It's a unique strategic fit with our business, and we're very happy to be able to close the business shortly. Olivier will provide some additional background on Troemner shortly. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We're raising our full year local currency sales guidance to approximately 5% versus 4% previously. We estimate that Troemner will contribute about 50 basis points of sales growth for the half year, so for 2016. Or to say it different, we raised our organic growth expectations for the full year by 50 basis points to approximately 4.5%. We've also raised our EPS guidance, and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.40 per share to $14.50, which represents a growth rate of 11% to 12%. This compares to previous guidance of 10% to 11% EPS growth or $14.25 per share to $14.35 per share. We are raising the midpoint of our guidance by $0.15 to reflect our strong performance as well as the acquisition of Troemner.
With respect to the third quarter, we expect local currency sales growth between 5% and 6%. This includes about 75 basis points of growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $3.65 per share to $3.70 per share, which is a growth rate of 12% to 13%. 
In terms of currency, let me first comment on sales growth. We would expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 2% in the third quarter and 2% for the full year. In terms of the impact of currency on EPS, we do not expect it to have a meaningful impact on Q3 or for the full year. 
That's it from my side. And I now want to turn it back to Olivier."
31468,370342373,1017663,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mettler-Toledo International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had very good growth in the quarter with 10% increasing. Pipette analytical instruments and process analytics had excellent growth with balances and AutoChem also had good growth",1201,"Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had very good growth in the quarter with 10% increasing. Pipette analytical instruments and process analytics had excellent growth with balances and AutoChem also had good growth. Growth was strong across all regions and reflects our robust product pipeline, benefit of field turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs. 
Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be very favorable. Industrial increased 3% in the quarter, driven by a 6% increase in core industrial. Growth in core industrial was particularly strong in the Americas, which benefited from some project activity in transportation and logistics. We also had growth in core industrial in Europe and Asia, including China. 
Product Inspection was down slightly in the quarter. This business continues to perform well, but was impacted by timing of some activity and a strong comparison from the prior year. Product Inspection have strong order growth in the quarter, and we expect good sales growth in Q3. 
Finally, sales declined 2% in retail. This was pretty much as expected. We had growth in Europe and Asia, but decline in the Americas against good growth in the prior year. 
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid with 6% growth. We had very good growth in lab and industrial, while sales declined in retail. Demand continues to be solid in the Americas, but tougher comps will impact the second half. 
Europe grew 4% in the quarter, an improvement over the first quarter, which we think was in part due to timing of Easter holiday. Lab had excellent growth in Europe while core industrial and retail also grew. Product Inspection was down, which would improve in the quarter. 
Asia / Rest of the World had growth of 8% in the quarter. China did very well and better than we expected as compared to the last time we spoke. Lab growth in China was double digits with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We are pleased with the performance, which reflects some improving demand and also the benefit of our actions to reduce -- redirect resources to faster-growing market segment. While industrial in China had modest growth, the fact is that overcapacity in the industrial manufacturing sector remains. 
While we're also pleased with our results in China, we expect growth in the second half to be in the mid-single digit range. 
Let me make some comments on service, which grew 5% in the quarter and on an year-to-date basis. Service represents about 23% of total sales, and it is a key competitive advantage and an important source of revenue growth. This is the fifth year in a row with service growth is outpacing product growth. Although this might not occur each and every quarter, over the medium term, we expect service growth to exceed product growth. We have a service force of approximately 2,600 personnel which is, by far, larger than our direct competitor. Our service team is specialized by product area, and we have made significant investments, including training of tools, which supports the daily activity. 
Core to our service growth strategy is increasing the percentage of our installed base under service contract and increasing the amount of service sold at a point of product sale. The long-term objective is to change the mix of our service business to be largely contract business versus great fix. Today, contract represent approximately 1/3 of our service sales. There are several reasons why this migration is a strategic imperative, including the increasing quality of our products, reducing the need for repair, contract work -- sorry, and on the other half, contract work is more usually planned. And therefore, our technicians can be more productive. And finally, our studies show that service contracts leads to high levels of cost -- customer satisfaction, and therefore, retention. 
The globalization and harmonization of our service offering, which we undertook several years ago, led the groundwork to drive the contract business. Our marketing campaigns under the Spinnaker initiative and our field turbo investments are helping to drive this strength. Overall, we continue to make very good progress. We believe service is one of our most important competitive advantage and should continue to be an important source of sales and profit growth. 
Those are all my comments on business strength. I now want to provide some context to our acquisition of Troemner. Located in the Philadelphia area, Troemner is the U.S. market leader for weights and weight calibration and a great strategic fit to our leadership position in Europe. Together, we are now the global leader in this niche market. Weights and weight recalibration services is an attractive market. It has a strong barriers to entry as it requires very specialized know-how and expertise. We have 14 calibration labs worldwide, and the acquisition of Troemner firmly positions us as the U.S. market leader. Troemner is a very strong brand in U.S. based on its word class metrology competence and solid infrastructure. 
Service, which consists primarily of weight calibration, is almost 20% of Troemner's business and growing quite well. This is an attractive business as customers must calibrate weights on a regular basis and only a very few players have the expertise to do it correctly. This is a good example of the kind of service business that fits well into our goal of moving our service business to more contract value-added service. 
Troemner is also a provider of basic lab product such as stirrers, mixers and shakers, which will be a good strategic fit to Ohaus offering. As a reminder, Ohaus is our second brand used for indirect distribution for laboratory products of certain industrial weighing products. 
Troemner will help us strengthen the life science portfolio for Ohaus, which we have worked to expand over the last few years in terms of channel presence and product portfolio. We also believe we can further expand this equipment offering internationally, particularly in emerging markets. We think this is a great opportunity to extend the offering of Ohaus. Troemner would add about 1% to sales growth with similar margins to our own. We anticipate synergy potential from top line growth as well as potential in operational synergies. We expect to complete the acquisition shortly and have already begun integration plan. We believe this is a solid strategic acquisition and are excited about the potential development in this attractive market segment. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We have kept our comments brief as we will see many of you tomorrow at our Investor Meeting. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for question. 
We are very pleased with strong results in the second quarter. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is good, but we acknowledge the uncertainty in the global economy. Our focus remains on factors we can control, namely successful execution of our initiatives. We feel very good about our new product launches, field turbo investment, Spinnaker marketing initiatives and productivity measures. We believe with continued strong execution, we can continue to gain share. I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So if you look at our year-to-date number, we're plus 5% and we're saying, hey, by the end of the year, we should finish at 4.5% at the midpoint of the range and, I guess, closer to 5% at the high end of the range. So let's see how China and some of these comps play out. Biopharma has been a strong market for a while.

I think it's a bit of a -- a lot of economic data globally, it's a bit of a mixed picture. Maybe one interesting insight we might give you is that I know there's been some articles that some of the GDP growth has come from leveraging up further some of the state-owned enterprises and regional governments. And it was interesting for us to see when we sorted through the details of our numbers that we saw really good growth, of course, in the government sector when it came to lab. But we also saw across the board very good growth with multinationals. And that's an interesting comment in the sense that if you look over the last 3 years, the percentage of our total sales in China going to multinationals has shrunk. But now we see a nice rebound in the first half of the year across product categories, and I think that -- this famous comment that we talked about of -- for a multinational company, they can defer the replacement cycle for a while on our products, but eventually, it bounces back. And I think we see that a little bit there. It's probably a little less than the project side, but much more return to the normal replacement cycle. In terms of the order entry, order entry was similarly positive to what we saw in the sales side. So it was a solid number. It wasn't -- it's not that we -- that purely the order entry would make us cautious about the second half. It's just the realities of that, it's still a market with some instability in it, and I think us remaining cautious makes sense. But I actually felt what we just shared with you about multinational was one of the more positive readings that we had in our data coming out of China."

I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Will will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.
The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Let me start by saying it was a very good quarter and reflected strong strategy execution by our teams around the globe. Local currency sales growth was 9% in the quarter, with broad-based growth in all regions and most product lines. Demand in the Americas and Europe was very good. Asia/Rest of World did particularly well with good growth in China and strong growth in most other countries in this region. We are very happy with these results, which reflects solid market conditions and, as already mentioned, continued strong execution of our strategies. With the benefit of our margin and cost initiatives, we had good growth in margins which contributed to excellent growth in earnings per share. Cash flow was also quite good in the quarter. 
We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year and 2017.
Before I turn it over to Bill to cover the numbers, let me comment on the management changes that we announced today. Many of you have met Shawn Vadala most recently at our investor meeting in California in July. He has worked with Bill for almost 20 years and was promoted to CFO 3 years ago. Shawn is highly respected within our organization for his knowledge of our business and its processes as well as his business acumen. Shawn has been a key contributor to many of our margin enhancement programs. For example, pricing has been an important profit driver for us, and Shawn has led our efforts in pricing since the beginning. Shawn has also played an important role in helping effectively shape the resource allocations within the organization toward our strategic priorities of the faster-growing, more profitable businesses. Shawn has also worked closely with me to initiate our big data analytics program. For the next 12 months, we expect Shawn to continue to focus on his existing responsibilities, and we will gradually see him more on the Investor Relations front beginning in about a year from now.
Some of you have also met Oliver Wittorf at our investor meeting. Oliver has been with us for 13 years and has one of the most diverse careers within our management team. Oliver has held a number of important roles, including being head of operations for our Boston-based Process Analytics business. He was the project lead in China for our Blue Ocean program. And for the last few [ph] years, he has held our global supply chain team lead, which included our very successful procurement program and the establishment of our regional hubs. He will keep the supply chain responsibilities and take over daily responsibility for IT and Blue Ocean. He's ideally suited for this expanded role within the organization.
I am confident that both Shawn and Oliver have the experience and track record to be strong contributors to our executive team and to further the development of the finance, supply chain, IT and Blue Ocean functions within our organization. I have worked with both of them over many years and look forward to many more years with them in their expanded roles.
From an investor perspective, very little will change over the next 12 months, and Bill and Mary will remain your principal contacts. Bill will gradually reduce his time commitment and beginning in 2018, Bill will begin to hand over the Investor Relations activities to Shawn and into a smooth transition. Mary will continue in her role in Investor Relations and Treasury and will continue to be your day-to-day contact. 
Finally, I want to express how pleased I am that we have orchestrated a smooth and well-planned succession for Bill and that we can continue to leverage Bill's unique contribution to the company for another 2 years. Bill demonstrated his great leadership and nurturing his successes and also in working with me to make his gradual transition, which I'm very grateful for.
Let me hand it over now to Bill."

Further, happy to continue to serve this great company and help drive its development for the coming 2 years. And of course, I also look forward to working with all of you.
Now let me come back to the quarter and cover the financials. Sales were $650.6 million in the quarter. That's an increase in 9% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed about 1% to that growth. And on dollar basis, our sales grew by 8% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. 
On Slide #4, you have local currency sales growth for the third quarter. Our sales grew 7% in the Americas, 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia/Rest of World. Americas growth excluding Troemner was about 6%. 
In the next slide, we provide year-to-date local currency sales growth, which was 6%. By region, Americas had a growth of 7%, Europe is 4% and Asia/Rest of World has increased 8% on a year-to-date basis.
Now on to Slide #6. We outlined sales growth by product area for the quarter. Lab had good growth with local currency sales growth of 9%, of which approximately 2% was from Troemner. Industrial increased by 8%, and food retail increased by 13%. All these comparisons are versus the prior year. 
The next slide summarizes year-to-date sales by product line. Lab had local currency sales growth of 8%; industrial, 5%; and food retailing, 6%. 
Now to Slide #8. Let me walk you through the key items in our P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 56.8%. That's a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year amount of 56.2%. Pricing and material costs decreased as pricing increases and material cost decreases contributed to the improved margin, which was offset in part by some targeted investments in our service business as well as an unfavorable mix.
R&D amounted to $30.1 million. That's a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $187.7 million. That's an increase of 8% in local currency over the prior year. Higher variable comp largely explained by assumed higher performance against our budget targets as well as investments in our field turbo program were offset by cost savings in other parts of the business. 
Adjusted operating income was $151.7 million in the quarter. That's a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $134.3 million. Currencies benefited operating profit by $1.5 million. And yes, that was not a typo. We had a currency benefit this quarter. The first one in sometime. Adjusted operating margins were 23.3%. That's 110 basis point increase over the prior year. 
A couple of comments to the P&L. Our amortization was $9.1 million, while our interest expense was $7.2 million. Our effective tax rate continue to be 24%. Our fully diluted shares for the quarter were 26.9 million. That's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.89 per share, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $3.26 per share. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $3.77 as compared to $3.16 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of restructuring, $0.05 of purchased intangible asset amortization and $0.03 of acquisition transaction costs related to Troemner.
The next slide shows the year-to-date P&L. We have local currency sales growth of 6%. Operating income increased by 9%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 15%.
Now taking a look at cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $125.6 million as compared to $107.1 million in the prior year. We remain pleased with working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO. ITO was 4.6, which was flat with last quarter. Cash flow on a year-to-date basis amounted to $263.7 million. That's an increase of 16% on a per share basis. For the year, we expect free cash flow in the $380 million range.
Now let's turn to guidance. We're raising our full year 2016 local currency sales guidance to approximately 6% versus 5% previously. This reflects organic growth of approximately 5.5% and about 50 basis points of sales growth from the Troemner acquisition. We have also raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.61 per share to $14.66 per share. That's a growth of approximately 13%. This compares to our previous guidance of 11% to 12% growth or $4.40 to $4.50 per share.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5%. This includes approximately 1% growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $5.80 to $5.13. This reflects a growth rate of 9% to 10%.
Now let's turn to 2017. We're coming off a very strong third quarter, and we have expectations for a solid Q4 as well. We believe we are executing well. We have a strong product pipeline. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs as well as our field turbo investments are yielding tangible results. These factors are within our control, and we feel confident about them. Offsetting these positives are some lingering questions regarding global economy. In particular, we see continued risk in China, some uncertainty in Europe, and we will face tougher comps, for example, in our lab business as well as the Americas.
Taking account these factors, we expect local currency sales growth to be about 5% in 2017. This will include 50 basis points from the Troemner acquisition. This will -- should result in adjusted EPS in the range of $16.05 to $16.25 per share, and that's a growth rate of 10% to 11%. We expect currency to reduce adjusted EPS growth by about 1% in 2017. 
In terms of quarterly guidance for 2017, as usual, we'll provide that on our upcoming calls. However, I know you'll be updating our model, and I just want to point out that we will have a tough comp in Q3 next year, given the very strong results that we are reporting today.
In terms of currency impact on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales by about 1.5% in the fourth quarter. This will result in a 2% impact on sales growth for the full year 2016. And in 2017, currency should reduce sales by about 1.5%. 
Finally, in terms of cash flow next year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $390 million range. This reflects a 6% growth on a per share basis, which is below our normal target and has to do with higher capital expenditures. As we explained last year, our CapEx levels in '16 and '17 are higher due to facility expansions related to our product inspection businesses as well as the facility consolidation we're doing in Switzerland. These expansions will amount to approximately $55 million in 2017. We built into our assumptions $500 million of share repurchases next year, which is the same amount as we did this year.
Okay. That's it for my side, and then I want to take it back to Olivier."

Let me start with summary comment on business conditions. Lab had a very good growth in the quarter. All product lines performed well.

Lab had a very good growth in the quarter. All product lines performed well. Our strong product pipeline benefit of improved investments continued strong sales and marketing programs are all contributing to favorable results. Spending by our bio pharma customers continues to be favorable. While government and academia was not strong in the west, it's not a big segment for us. Industrial was strong and unexpected in the quarter, including core industrial, which increased mid-single digits. Core industrial was particularly strong in Asia/Rest of World but was up in China as well. In the Americas and Europe, we benefited from some projects in transportation and logistics, but the core industrial markets remained difficult. 
Product Inspection was up strongly in the quarter, with particularly good growth in Americas and Europe. We continue to penetrate large multinational food companies as the supply of choice as they seek to standardize the Product Inspection equipment. We have made some good inroads over the last 12 to 24 months, and we expect good results in the fourth quarter as well as. 
Finally, retail increased 13% in the quarter, much better than we had expected as our projects moved forward for Q4. We had good growth in all regions. We would expect retail to be down in the fourth quarter.
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid. Bio pharma and food were our strongest segments. Lab had growth against strong comparisons in the prior year. Product Inspection retail did very well in the quarter with a number of large projects. Core industrial also had growth and benefited from some project activity in transportation and logistics, but as expected, many industrial segments remain weak. 
Europe's growth exceeded expectation. Similar to the U.S., biopharma and food were good segments. Lab and Product Inspection benefited from these trends. Core industrial benefited from some transport -- transportation and logistics activities but similar to the U.S., many industrial segments were weak. Finally, retail also has very good growth and as was already mentioned, was partially due to some projects moving from Q4 to Q3.
Asia/Rest of World grew double digits in the quarter. Last growth in China was again in double digits, with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We continue to be very pleased with this performance, which reflects good demand, particularly in life sciences as well as the benefit of our actions to redirect resources to faster growing market segments. Industrial in China had modest growth as we continue to be impacted by the overcapacity in the industrial manufacturing sector. We're seeing good growth in certain industrial markets such as chemical pharma and OEM, but this is being overshadowed by weakness in markets such as cement and metals. 
One final comment on the business. Service grew 6% in the quarter. 
Those are all my comments on current business trends. Now let me provide a broader update on our strategy and how it continues to evolve and positions us well for the next year and beyond.
Let me start with our sales and marketing strategy. At our Investor Day in July, we discussed one of our new initiatives in this area, and that is our efforts to generate lead and better focus our sales efforts by leveraging data. Our data sources include our compact database, our installed base of instruments, hits on NT.com and increasingly rich data streams from Blue Ocean as well as some third-party data. We are becoming more sophisticated in how we use this data to target incremental growth. We are in the early stages of developing the potential big data that we already see opportunities our current strategy and identify new sources of growth and sales productivity.
As shared at the Investor Day, we are using big data to help us identify where customers are investing, account locations that need more focus on cross-selling and the likely effective means to succeed. We also recently launched Spinnaker 5, which is focused on increased sales productivity. The tools from Spinnaker 5 are being used to help units, refine the channel strategy, more effectively balance the resources between field and inside sales and achieve better results in account penetration and cross-selling.
Finally, we have started our next wave of field turbo and expect to add 200 additional field resources in 2017. We believe the first waves of this field turbo program have been effective in helping us gain share.
We talk to you a lot about sales and marketing but, our share gains will not be possible without an excellent product pipeline. It continues to be very strong, particular on the lab and Product Inspection side. Let me give you one example from our waning Pipette business. As a reminder, we have proprietary pipettes with superior economic design and which each have an embedded chip for tracking. The team is now launching smart step, an easy to use pipette asset management system. This instrument can store up to 4 pipettes and read the embedded RFID chip to immediately determine if the pipette is within the required calibration specification. For regulated labs in the pharma biotech industries, this is a major support tool that eliminates the time-consuming process of tracking calibration dates to verify the pipette is proper to use. Our pipette has long been known for the ability to provide reproducible data. Smartphones further helps our customers to ensure this data was generated on a verified pipette. We believe it will help drive our service business as well as lab conversion as more researchers seek to benefit from our RFID-enabled pipette. This is one on many new product launch that we presented of how we continue to drive value of our customers.
As you can see, we have much underway in terms of targeting top line growth. We also continue to make very good progress on our margin initiatives. Our pricing, productivity and supply chain initiatives continue to evolve and yield tangible results. There is a lot of work behind all of this, particularly in an organization as ours that has so many complexities. With continued diligence, we can move these initiatives to the next level.
That concludes our prepared remarks. In summary, we believe we are executing well, and market conditions are good enough for our customers to keep their replacement cycle. With the benefit of our growth initiatives, we believe we are continuing to gain share and continue to improve our margin. Assuming demand in our markets remain stable, we expect to continue to generate good sales and earnings growth.
I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions."

That business would have been maybe -- trying to do the math here, maybe 1.5 points less without the T&L projects. The T&L projects maybe weren't as close on our radar screens and frankly, they're a little bit smaller. The retail projects did move from Q4 into Q3, and that's the one that was in line with that reference coming little earlier than expected.

As we described before, for industry China, their segments do well, chemical food, difficult. But for costing and anticipating how the Chinese economy do overall is difficult. Our industrial business is particularly exposed to the cycles in China. And of course, we have also comparison topics. We have, for example, a very strong performance in biopharma, and highlights including also in Europe, and we're going to feel that next year. How will this evolve is, in that sense, has certain risks to it. Now on the upside, I would say China industry could actually clearly come strongly and expected. As I mentioned before, there is a high volatility on that front. So that's one. If biopharma continues to be that strong, we would benefit across many businesses. That would be really nice. And then there is a certain pent-up demand that we had always seen when overall economy strengthen and pent-up demand in CapEx where industrial would benefit. So that's another upside that I could see."

I was very pleased to hear that we are kind of winning marked position becoming leaders in pipette and pH in China, which is typically takes a couple of years and is very attractive because, of course, our businesses with great profitability, great consumable stream. So this is our examples. We had certainly many more from other countries, too. One that, for example, just to share. In India, we are so pleased to see how growth goes there. We talked a lot about made in India how this is helping. I mentioned that a little bit because for us, we always depend also that the industrial manufacturing is important and drives quality and drives to export industry and that's, for example, something that I could feel very strongly when I met the Indian team. We see it I want to say next year they are moving to a tax structure. And that puts, in the short term, impact our EBITDA  numbers.

So one of the things we're dealing with is we could maybe estimate what the full year impact was, but the nature of it would make our tax rate jump around quite a bit in the quarters.

Let me start with those, and I have Mary flipping me some lines as well as Shawn. So progression for quarter-to-quarter, I think we kind of mentioned in the conference call script that I think Q3 has got to be a tough comp a year from now. I think you can kind of play it out that way. Not all of it will -- if you look at incremental margins, it won't be as big of an issue there because of the high retail content. You can also assume that we get about 1% or so of sales growth from Troemner in the first 2 quarters, and that stops in Q3 and Q4. In terms of working days, I think the -- it's flat in Q3 of this year, and Q4 is minus 2 working days. And for 2017, I think there's, hey, a day difference that we have to stay more in Q1 of '17, and we catch it back up in Q2, and then it looks like there's one last day in Q3. But I don't think those should be so material. In terms of other things to think about, I can't think another one might be kind of timing of some of our Blue Ocean go-lives. I -- those don't jump out to me right now in terms of being particularly large units. So I think that, that shouldn't be so much of an issue. Hey, I -- yes, I think all of us are kind of nodding that those would be the key items. I think the one other item would be in response to like a follow-up to make sure it resonated with people. Ross asked earlier about this new accounting regulations surrounding accounting for the income tax benefits of stock options in excess of the value. I think that we're working on trying to estimate that impact now for the full year, but I do think the way the accounting rules are written, it will lead to quite a bit of volatility by quarter, and that's something that I think we're going to almost have to guide you quarter-by-quarter at this stage. And so I would maybe suggest people just leave it a typical Mettler flat 24 for now, and that's what we've given you in terms of guidance, but it will probably be an improved number when we talk to you in February, but we're still estimating what that will be.

So not all of them have the same payback time the investments that we do in Southeast Asia that will have faster paybacks and fortunately investments that I referred to in Automated Chemistry.

I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.
The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Let me start by saying it was a very good quarter, and it reflected strong strategy execution by our teams around the globe. Local currency sales growth was 9% in the quarter, with broad-based growth in all regions and most product lines. Demand in Americas and Europe was very good. Asia/Rest of World did particularly well with good growth in China and strong growth in most other countries in this region. We are very happy with these results, which reflect solid market conditions and, as already mentioned, continued strong execution of our strategies. With the benefit of our margin and cost initiatives, we had good growth in margins which contributed to excellent growth in earnings per share. Cash flow was also quite good in the quarter. 
We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year and 2017.
Before I turn it over to Bill to cover the numbers, let me comment on the management changes that we announced today. Many of you have met Shawn Vadala most recently at our investor meeting in California in July. He has worked with Bill for almost 20 years and was promoted to CFO 3 years ago. Shawn is highly respected within our organization for his knowledge of our business and its processes as well as his business acumen. Shawn has been a key contributor to many of our margin enhancement programs. For example, pricing has been an important profit driver for us, and Shawn has led our efforts in pricing since the beginning. Shawn has also played an important role in helping effectively shift the resource allocations within the organization toward our strategic priorities of the faster-growing, more profitable businesses. Shawn has also worked closely with me to initiate our big data analytics programs. For the next 12 months, we expect Shawn to continue to focus on his existing responsibilities, and you will gradually see him more on the Investor Relations front beginning in about a year from now.
Some of you have also met Oliver Wittorf at our investor meeting. Oliver has been with us for 13 years and has one of the most diverse MT careers within our management team. Oliver has held a number of important roles, including being head of operations for our Boston-based Process Analytics business. He was the project lead in China for our Blue Ocean program. And for the last few years, he has held our global supply chain team lead, which included our very successful procurement programs and the establishment of our regional hubs. He will keep his supply chain responsibilities and take over daily responsibility for IT and Blue Ocean. He's ideally suited for this expanded role within the organization.
I am confident that both Shawn and Oliver have the experience and track record to be strong contributors to our executive team and to further the development of the finance, supply chain, IT and Blue Ocean functions within our organization. I have worked with both of them over many years and look forward to many more years with them in their expanded roles.
From an investor perspective, very little will change over the next 12 months, and Bill and Mary will remain your principal contacts. Bill will gradually reduce his time commitment, and beginning in 2018, Bill will begin to hand over the Investor Relations activities to Shawn and ensure a smooth transition. Mary will continue in her role in Investor Relations and Treasury and continue to be your day-to-day contact. 
Finally, I want to express how pleased I am that we have orchestrated a smooth and well-planned succession for Bill and that we can continue to leverage Bill's unique contribution to the company for another 2 years. Bill demonstrated his great leadership in nurturing his successor and also in working with me to make this gradual transition, which I'm very grateful for.
Let me hand it over now to Bill."

I'm pleased about the transition that we put in place and proud that we have developed these 2 strong highly capable leaders in Shawn and Oliver. Further, I am happy to continue to serve this great company and help drive its development for the coming 2 years. And of course, I also look forward to working with all of you.
Now let me come back to the quarter and cover the financials. Sales were $650.6 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 9% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed about 1% to that growth. On a dollar basis, our sales grew by 8% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. 
On Slide #4, you have local currency sales growth for the third quarter. Our sales grew 7% in the Americas, 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia/Rest of World. Americas growth excluding Troemner was about 6%. 
On the next slide, we provide year-to-date local currency sales growth, which was 6%. By region, Americas had a growth of 7%, Europe is 4% and Asia/Rest of World has increased 8% on a year-to-date basis.
Now on to Slide #6. We outlined sales growth by product area for the quarter. Lab had good growth with local currency sales growth of 9%, of which approximately 2% was from Troemner. Industrial increased by 8%, and food retail increased by 13%. All these comparisons are versus the prior year. 
The next slide summarizes year-to-date sales by product line. Lab had local currency sales growth of 8%; industrial, 5%; and food retailing, 6%. 
Now to Slide #8. Let me walk you through the key items in our P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 56.8%. That's a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year amount of 56.2%. Pricing and material costs decreased as pricing increases and material cost decreases contributed to the improved margin, which was offset in part by some targeted investments in our service business as well as an unfavorable mix.
R&D amounted to $30.1 million. That's a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $187.7 million. That's an increase of 8% in local currency over the prior year. Higher variable comp largely explained by assumed higher performance against our budget targets as well as investments in our field turbo program were offset by cost savings in other parts of the business. 
Adjusted operating income was $151.7 million in the quarter. That's a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $134.3 million. Currencies benefited operating profit by $1.5 million. And yes, that was not a typo. We had a currency benefit this quarter. The first one in some time. Adjusted operating margins were 23.3%. That's 110 basis point increase over the prior year. 
A couple of comments to the P&L. Our amortization was $9.1 million, while our interest expense was $7.2 million. Our effective tax rate continue to be 24%. Our fully diluted shares for the quarter were 26.9 million. That's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.89 per share, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $3.26 per share. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $3.77 as compared to $3.16 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of restructuring, $0.05 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.03 of acquisition transaction costs related to Troemner.
The next slide shows the year-to-date P&L. We had local currency sales growth of 6%. Operating income increased by 9%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 15%.
Now taking a look at cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $125.6 million as compared to $107.1 million in the prior year. We remain pleased with working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO. ITO was 4.6, which was flat with last quarter. Cash flow on a year-to-date basis amounted to $263.7 million. That's an increase of 16% on a per share basis. For the year, we expect free cash flow in the $380 million range.
Now let's turn to guidance. We're raising our full year 2016 local currency sales guidance to approximately 6% versus 5% previously. This reflects organic growth of approximately 5.5% and about 50 basis points of sales growth from the Troemner acquisition. We have also raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.61 per share to $14.66 per share. That's a growth of approximately 13%. This compares to our previous guidance of 11% to 12% growth or $4.40 to $4.50 per share.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5%. This includes approximately 1% growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $5.08 to $5.13. This reflects a growth rate of 9% to 10%.
Now let's turn to 2017. We're coming off a very strong third quarter, and we have expectations for a solid Q4 as well. We believe we are executing well. We have a strong product pipeline. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs as well as our field turbo investments are yielding tangible results. These factors are within our control, and we feel confident about them. Offsetting these positives are some lingering questions regarding global economy. In particular, we see continued risk in China, some uncertainty in Europe, and we will face tougher comps, for example, in our lab business as well as the Americas.
Taking into account these factors, we expect local currency sales growth to be about 5% in 2017. This will include 50 basis points from the Troemner acquisition. This will -- should result in adjusted EPS in the range of $16.05 to $16.25 per share, and that's a growth rate of 10% to 11%. We expect currency to reduce adjusted EPS growth by about 1% in 2017. 
In terms of quarterly guidance for 2017, as usual, we'll provide that on our upcoming calls. However, I know you'll be updating your model. I just want to point out that we will have a tough comp in Q3 next year, given the very strong results that we are reporting today.
In terms of currency impact on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales by about 1.5% in the fourth quarter. This will result in a 2% impact on sales growth for the full year 2016. And in 2017, currency should reduce sales by about 1.5%. 
Finally, in terms of cash flow next year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $390 million range. This reflects a 6% growth on a per share basis, which is below our normal target and that has to do with higher capital expenditures. As we explained last year, our CapEx levels in '16 and '17 are higher due to facility expansions related to our product inspection businesses as well as a facility consolidation we're doing in Switzerland. These expansions will amount to approximately $55 million in 2017. We built into our assumptions $500 million of share repurchases next year, which is the same amount as we did this year.
Okay. That's it for my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier."

Lab had a very good growth in the quarter. All product lines performed well. Our strong product pipeline, benefit of field turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs are all contributing to favorable results. Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be favorable. While government and academia was not strong in the West, it's not a big segment for us. Industrial was stronger than unexpected in the quarter, including core industrial, which increased mid-single digits. Core industrial was particularly strong in Asia/Rest of the World but was up in China as well. In the Americas and Europe, we benefited from some projects in transportation and logistics, but the core industrial markets remained difficult. 
Product Inspection was up strongly in the quarter, with particularly good growth in Americas and Europe. We continue to penetrate large multinational food companies as the supplier of choice as they seek to standardize their Product Inspection equipment. We have made some good inroads over the last 12 to 24 months, and we expect good results in the fourth quarter as well. 
Finally, retail increased 13% in the quarter, much better than we had expected as some projects moved forward from Q4. We had good growth in all regions. We would expect retail to be down in the fourth quarter.
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid. Biopharma and food were our strongest segments. Lab had growth against strong comparisons in the prior year. Product Inspection retail did very well in the quarter with a number of large projects. Core industrial also had growth and benefited from some project activity in transportation and logistics, but as expected, many industrial segments remain weak. 
Europe's growth exceeded expectations. Similar to the U.S., biopharma and food were good segments. Lab and Product Inspection benefited from these trends. Core industrial benefited from some transport -- transportation and logistics activity but similar to the U.S., many industrial segments were weak. Finally, retail also had very good growth and as was already mentioned, was partially due to some projects moving from Q4 to Q3.
Asia/Rest of the World grew double digits in the quarter. Lab growth in China was again in double digits, with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We continue to be very pleased with this performance, which reflects good demand, particularly in life sciences, as well as the benefit of our actions to redirect resources to faster growing market segments. Industrial in China had modest growth as we continue to be impacted by the overcapacity in the industrial manufacturing sector. We're seeing good growth in certain industrial markets such as chemical pharma and OEM, but this is being overshadowed by weakness in markets such as cement and metals. 
One final comment on the business. Service grew 6% in the quarter. 
Those are all my comments on current business trends. Now let me provide a broader update on our strategy and how it continues to evolve and positions us well for the next year and beyond.
Let me start with our sales and marketing strategies. At our Investor Day in July, we discussed one of our new initiatives in this area, and that is our effort to generate leads and better focus our sales effort by leveraging big data. Our data sources include our compact database, our installed base of instruments, hits on NT.com and increasingly rich data streams from Blue Ocean as well as some third-party data. We are becoming more sophisticated in how we use this data to target incremental growth. We are in the early stages of developing the potential of big data, but we already see opportunities to refine our current strategy and identify new sources of growth and sales productivity.
As shared at the Investor Day, we are using big data to help us identify better where customers are investing, account locations that need more focus on cross-selling and the likely effect this means to succeed. We also recently launched Spinnaker 5, which is focused on increased sales productivity. The tools from Spinnaker 5 are being used to help units refine their channel strategy, more effectively balance their resources between field and inside sales and achieve better results in account penetration and cross-selling.
Finally, we have started our next wave of field turbo and expect to add 200 additional field resources in 2017. We believe the first waves of this field turbo program have been effective in helping us gain share.
We talk to you a lot about sales and marketing, but our share gains would not be possible without an excellent product pipeline. It continues to be very strong, particularly on the lab and Product Inspection side. Let me give you one example from our Rainin Pipette business. As a reminder, we have proprietary pipettes with superior economic design and which each have an embedded RFID chip for tracking. The team is now launching SmartStand, an easy to use pipette asset management system. This instrument can store up to 4 pipettes and reads the embedded RFID chip to immediately determine if the pipette is within required calibration specifications. For regulated labs in the pharma biotech industries, this is a major support tool that eliminates the manual and time-consuming process of tracking calibration dates to verify the pipette is proper to use. Our pipettes have long been known for the ability to provide reproducible data. SmartStand further helps our customers to ensure this data was generated on a verified pipette. We believe it will help drive our service business as well as lab conversions as more researchers seek to benefit from our RFID-enabled pipettes. This is only one new product launch, but representative of how we continue to drive value of our customers.
As you can see, we have much underway in terms of targeting top line growth. We also continue to make very good progress on our margin initiatives. Our pricing, productivity and supply chain initiatives continue to evolve and yield tangible results. There is a lot of work behind all of this, particularly in an organization as ours that has so many complexities. With continued diligence, we can move these initiatives to the next level.
That concludes our prepared remarks. In summary, we believe we are executing well, and market conditions are good enough for our customers to keep their replacement cycle. With the benefit of our growth initiatives, we believe we are continuing to gain share and continue to improve our margins. Assuming demand in our markets remain stable, we expect to continue to generate good sales and earnings growth.
I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions."

That business would have been maybe -- trying to do the math here in my head, maybe 1.5 points less without the T&L projects. The T&L projects maybe weren't as close on our radar screen and frankly, they're a little bit smaller. The retail projects did move from Q4 into Q3, and that's the one that we more had in mind with that reference to coming a little earlier than we expected. The T&L project, I think, largely came in -- I mean it was maybe in total a little better than we expected but wasn't so much different than we expected from a timing point of view."

So I think the good news on pricing is that the tools we have, the strategies we have, the products we get to apply pricing to continue to get better but it is a lower inflation environment globally.

But I also see some upside, in terms of Shawn and the team are putting together some new things in the area, for example, of services where I think we have some opportunity and also reaching out to some other countries. So I hope that there's a little bit of upside to that number, too."

But forecasting and anticipating how the Chinese economy do overall is difficult. And the industrial business is particularly exposed to the cycles in China. And of course, we have also comparison topics. We have, for example, a very strong performance in biopharma. I would here highlight including also in Europe, and we're going to feel that next year. How will this develop has, in that sense, a certain risk in it. Now on the upside, I would say China industry could actually clearly come strongly in and as we expect. As I mentioned before, there is a high volatility on that front. So that's one. If biopharma continues to be that strong, we would benefit across many businesses. That would be really nice. And then there is a certain pent-up demand that we had always seen when an overall economy strengthen and pent-up demand in CapEx where industrial would benefit in particular. So that's another upside that I could see."

One other highlight that we saw during this business review in China was our strengthening position in lab and in particular, actually pipette and pH. I was very pleased to hear that we are kind of winning market position and becoming leaders in pipette and pH in China, which is typically takes a couple of years and is very attractive because, of course, these are businesses with great profitability and great consumable streams. So this is our examples. We have certainly, many more from other countries, too. One that, for example, just to share. In India, we are so pleased to see how the growth goes there. We talked a lot about this made in India, how this is helping. I mentioned that a little bit because for us, we always depend also that the industrial manufacturing is important and drives quality and drives to export industry. And that's, for example, something that I could feel very strongly when I met the Indian team. We see it in our good numbers. One thing, next year they are moving to a VAT [ph] structure. And that could, in the short term, impact a little bit our numbers. So every country has something specific, and it was good to sense it. All in all, we came back from the tour in a very positive way. Extremely pleased by the plan.

And from a geographic standpoint, we have put some Southeast Asia where we're adding again quite a significant number of people in the context of building up Philippines, Indonesia. But it's relatively broad-based. I presented today to the board in the annual plan where we're adding turbos, and we had a geographic map and it was nice to see how well spread it is. And that's actually the strength of the program that we are working on many projects in parallel, and you have many managers that are also supervising and managing these."

Is there any impact from timing items in the third quarter that might actually impact 2017, given you mentioned some of those are actually items that were further out. The second piece would be selling days. Any selling day abnormalities, either actually in the third quarter or looking forward. And then the third part of my 3-parter is anything next year aside from the tough comp that we should consider as we think about the progression of incremental margins."

Let me start with those, and I have Mary flipping me some lines as well as Shawn. So progression for quarter-to-quarter, I think we kind of mentioned in the conference call script that I think Q3 has got to be a tough comp a year from now. I think you can kind of play it out that way. Not all of it will -- if you look at incremental margins, it won't be as big of an issue there because of the high retail content. You can also assume that we get about 1% or so of sales growth from Troemner in the first 2 quarters, and that stops in Q3 and Q4. In terms of working days, I think the -- it's flat in Q3 of this year, and Q4 it's minus 2 working days. And for 2017, hey, I think there's a day difference that we have a day more in Q1 of '17, and we catch it back up in Q2. And then it looks like there's one less day in Q3. But I don't think those should be so material. In terms of other things to think about, I can't think -- another one might be kind of timing of some of our Blue Ocean go-lives. I -- those don't jump out to me right now in terms of being particularly large units. So I think that, that shouldn't be so much of an issue. Hey, I -- yes, I think all of us are kind of nodding that those would be the key items. I think the one other item would be in response to like a follow-up to make sure it resonated with people. Ross asked earlier about this new accounting regulation surrounding accounting for the income tax benefits of stock options in excess of the actual [ph] value. I think that we're working on trying to estimate that impact now for the full year, but I do think the way the accounting rules are written, it will lead to quite a bit of volatility by quarter. And that's something that I think we're going to almost have to guide you quarter-by-quarter at this stage. And so I would maybe suggest people just leave it a typical Mettler flat 24 for now, and that's what we've given you in terms of guidance. But it will probably be an improved number when we talk to you in February, but we're still estimating what that will be. Did I get all the parts to your question, Steve?"

And yes, our business has slowed down, and it's certainly also associated with the Brexit discussions that we have.  Of course, our customer base is faced with uncertainty, and we see it in our business. What we also did, we have significant price increases that we implemented in the U.K. to offset, of course, the weakening of the pound. Now just talking about the pound, I want you to be aware that we have a net short position towards the pound, because we have 2 major manufacturing plants of our Product Inspection. So that's at least on the positive side for us. And we'll see how it further develops. Typically, when these kind of things happen in a country, you have, in the short term, an effect and then things rebalance. The second question about the field turbo. So we have these different ways, there are so many different projects that I described before. So not all of them have the same payback time. I would for example, expect the investments that we do in Southeast Asia that will have faster paybacks than for some investments that I referred to in Automated Chemistry. But all in all, we'd say we want to have them to reach a breakeven after a year. And kind of after 2 years, they should cover their initial investment. And that's also the beauty when we do these in waves but on a regular basis. The older waves kind of also help fund the new waves."

I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.
The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Let me start by saying it was a very good quarter, and it reflected strong strategy execution by our teams around the globe. Local currency sales growth was 9% in the quarter, with broad-based growth in all regions in most product lines. Demand in Americas and Europe was very good. Asia/Rest of World did particularly well with good growth in China and strong growth in most other countries in this region. We are very happy with these results, which reflect solid market conditions and, as already mentioned, continued strong execution of our strategies. With the benefit of our margin and cost initiatives, we had good growth in margins which contributed to excellent growth in earnings per share. Cash flow was also quite good in the quarter. 
We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year and 2017.
Before I turn it over to Bill to cover the numbers, let me comment on the management changes that we announced today. Many of you have met Shawn Vadala most recently at our investor meeting in California in July. He has worked with Bill for almost 20 years and was promoted to CFO 3 years ago. Shawn is highly respected within our organization for his knowledge of our business and its processes as well as his business acumen. Shawn has been a key contributor to many of our margin enhancement programs. For example, pricing has been an important profit driver for us, and Shawn has led our efforts in pricing since the beginning. Shawn has also played an important role in helping effectively shift the resource allocations within the organization toward our strategic priorities of the faster-growing, more profitable businesses. Shawn has also worked closely with me to initiate our big data analytics programs. For the next 12 months, we expect Shawn to continue to focus on his existing responsibilities, and you will gradually see him more on the Investor Relations front beginning in about a year from now.
Some of you have also met Oliver Wittorf at our investor meeting. Oliver has been with us for 13 years and has one of the most diverse MT careers within our management team. Oliver has held a number of important roles, including being head of operations for our Boston-based Process Analytics business. He was the project lead in China for our Blue Ocean program. And for the last few years, he has held our global supply chain team lead, which included our very successful procurement programs and the establishment of our regional hubs. He will keep his supply chain responsibilities and take over daily responsibility for IT and Blue Ocean. He's ideally suited for this expanded role within the organization.
I am confident that both Shawn and Oliver have the experience and track record to be strong contributors to our executive team and to further the development of the finance, supply chain, IT and Blue Ocean functions within our organization. I have worked with both of them over many years and look forward to many more years with them in their expanded roles.
From an investor perspective, very little will change over the next 12 months, and Bill and Mary will remain your principal contacts. Bill will gradually reduce his time commitment, and beginning in 2018, Bill will begin to hand over the Investor Relations activities to Shawn and ensure a smooth transition. Mary will continue in her role in Investor Relations and Treasury and continue to be your day-to-day contact. 
Finally, I want to express how pleased I am that we have orchestrated a smooth and well-planned succession for Bill and that we can continue to leverage Bill's unique contribution to the company for another 2 years. Bill demonstrated his great leadership in nurturing his successor and also in working with me to make this gradual transition, which I'm very grateful for.
Let me hand it over now to Bill."

Further, I am happy to continue to serve this great company and help drive its development for the coming 2 years. And of course, I also look forward to working with all of you.
Now let me come back to the quarter and cover the financials. Sales were $650.6 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 9% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed about 1% to that growth. On a dollar basis, our sales grew by 8% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. 
On Slide #4, you have local currency sales growth for the third quarter. Our sales grew 7% in the Americas, 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia/Rest of World. Americas growth excluding Troemner was about 6%. 
On the next slide, we provide year-to-date local currency sales growth, which was 6%. By region, Americas had a growth of 7%, Europe is 4% and Asia/Rest of World has increased 8% on a year-to-date basis.
Now on to Slide #6. We outlined sales growth by product area for the quarter. Lab had good growth with local currency sales growth of 9%, of which approximately 2% was from Troemner. Industrial increased by 8%, and food retail increased by 13%. All these comparisons are versus the prior year. 
The next slide summarizes year-to-date sales by product line. Lab had local currency sales growth of 8%; industrial, 5%; and food retailing, 6%. 
Now to Slide #8. Let me walk you through the key items in our P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 56.8%. That's a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year amount of 56.2%. Pricing and material costs decreased as pricing increases and material cost decreases contributed to the improved margin, which was offset in part by some targeted investments in our service business as well as an unfavorable mix.
R&D amounted to $30.1 million. That's a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $187.7 million. That's an increase of 8% in local currency over the prior year. Higher variable comp largely explained by assumed higher performance against our budget targets as well as investments in our field turbo program were offset by cost savings in other parts of the business. 
Adjusted operating income was $151.7 million in the quarter. That's a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $134.3 million. Currencies benefited operating profit by $1.5 million. And yes, that was not a typo. We had a currency benefit this quarter. The first one in some time. Adjusted operating margins were 23.3%. That's 110 basis point increase over the prior year. 
A couple of comments to the P&L. Our amortization was $9.1 million, while our interest expense was $7.2 million. Our effective tax rate continue to be 24%. Our fully diluted shares for the quarter were 26.9 million. That's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.89 per share, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $3.26 per share. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $3.77 as compared to $3.16 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of restructuring, $0.05 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.03 of acquisition transaction costs related to Troemner.
The next slide shows the year-to-date P&L. We had local currency sales growth of 6%. Operating income increased by 9%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 15%.
Now taking a look at cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $125.6 million as compared to $107.1 million in the prior year. We remain pleased with working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO. ITO was 4.6, which was flat with last quarter. Cash flow on a year-to-date basis amounted to $263.7 million. That's an increase of 16% on a per share basis. For the year, we expect free cash flow in the $380 million range.
Now let's turn to guidance. We're raising our full year 2016 local currency sales guidance to approximately 6% versus 5% previously. This reflects organic growth of approximately 5.5% and about 50 basis points of sales growth from the Troemner acquisition. We have also raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.61 per share to $14.66 per share. That's a growth of approximately 13%. This compares to our previous guidance of 11% to 12% growth or $4.40 to $4.50 per share.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5%. This includes approximately 1% growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $5.08 to $5.13. This reflects a growth rate of 9% to 10%.
Now let's turn to 2017. We're coming off a very strong third quarter, and we have expectations for a solid Q4 as well. We believe we are executing well. We have a strong product pipeline. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs as well as our field turbo investments are yielding tangible results. These factors are within our control, and we feel confident about them. Offsetting these positives are some lingering questions regarding global economy. In particular, we see continued risk in China, some uncertainty in Europe, and we will face tougher comps, for example, in our lab business as well as the Americas.
Taking into account these factors, we expect local currency sales growth to be about 5% in 2017. This will include 50 basis points from the Troemner acquisition. This will -- should result in adjusted EPS in the range of $16.05 to $16.25 per share, and that's a growth rate of 10% to 11%. We expect currency to reduce adjusted EPS growth by about 1% in 2017. 
In terms of quarterly guidance for 2017, as usual, we'll provide that on our upcoming calls. However, I know you'll be updating your model. I just want to point out that we will have a tough comp in Q3 next year, given the very strong results that we are reporting today.
In terms of currency impact on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales by about 1.5% in the fourth quarter. This will result in a 2% impact on sales growth for the full year 2016. And in 2017, currency should reduce sales by about 1.5%. 
Finally, in terms of cash flow next year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $390 million range. This reflects a 6% growth on a per share basis, which is below our normal target and that has to do with higher capital expenditures. As we explained last year, our CapEx levels in '16 and '17 are higher due to facility expansions related to our product inspection businesses as well as a facility consolidation we're doing in Switzerland. These expansions will amount to approximately $55 million in 2017. We built into our assumptions $500 million of share repurchases next year, which is the same amount as we did this year.
Okay. That's it for my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier."

Core industrial was particularly strong in Asia/Rest of the World but was up in China as well. In the Americas and Europe, we benefited from some projects in transportation and logistics, but the core industrial markets remained difficult. 
Product Inspection was up strongly in the quarter, with particularly good growth in Americas and Europe. We continue to penetrate large multinational food companies as the supplier of choice as they seek to standardize their Product Inspection equipment. We have made some good inroads over the last 12 to 24 months, and we expect good results in the fourth quarter as well. 
Finally, retail increased 13% in the quarter, much better than we had expected as some projects moved forward from Q4. We had good growth in all regions. We would expect retail to be down in the fourth quarter.
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid. Biopharma and food were our strongest segments. Lab had growth against strong comparisons in the prior year. Product Inspection retail did very well in the quarter with a number of large projects. Core industrial also had growth and benefited from some project activity in transportation and logistics, but as expected, many industrial segments remained weak. 
Europe's growth exceeded expectations. Similar to the U.S., biopharma and food were good segments. Lab and Product Inspection benefited from these trends. Core industrial benefited from some transport -- transportation and logistics activity but similar to the U.S., many industrial segments were weak. Finally, retail also had very good growth and as was already mentioned, was partially due to some projects moving from Q4 to Q3.
Asia/Rest of the World grew double digits in the quarter. Lab growth in China was again in double digits, with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We continue to be very pleased with this performance, which reflects good demand, particularly in life sciences, as well as the benefit of our actions to redirect resources to faster growing market segments. Industrial in China had modest growth as we continue to be impacted by the overcapacity in the industrial manufacturing sector. We're seeing good growth in certain industrial markets such as chemical pharma and OEM, but this is being overshadowed by weakness in markets such as cement and metals. 
One final comment on the business. Service grew 6% in the quarter. 
Those are all my comments on current business trends. Now let me provide a broader update on our strategy and how it continues to evolve and positions us well for the next year and beyond.
Let me start with our sales and marketing strategies. At our Investor Day in July, we discussed one of our new initiatives in this area, and that is our effort to generate leads and better focus our sales effort by leveraging big data. Our data sources include our compact database, our installed base of instruments, hits on mt.com and increasingly rich data streams from Blue Ocean as well as some third-party data. We are becoming more sophisticated in how we use this data to target incremental growth. We are in the early stages of developing the potential of big data, but we already see opportunities to refine our current strategy and identify new sources of growth and sales productivity.
As shared at the Investor Day, we are using big data to help us identify better where customers are investing, account locations that need more focus on cross-selling and the likely effect this means to succeed. We also recently launched Spinnaker 5, which is focused on increased sales productivity. The tools from Spinnaker 5 are being used to help units refine their channel strategy, more effectively balance their resources between field and inside sales and achieve better results in account penetration and cross-selling.
Finally, we have started our next wave of field turbo and expect to add 200 additional field resources in 2017. We believe the first waves of this field turbo program have been effective in helping us gain share.
We talk to you a lot about sales and marketing, but our share gains would not be possible without an excellent product pipeline. It continues to be very strong, particularly on the lab and Product Inspection side. Let me give you one example from our Rainin Pipette business. As a reminder, we have proprietary pipettes with superior economic design and which each have an embedded RFID chip for tracking. The team is now launching SmartStand, an easy to use pipette asset management system. This instrument can store up to 4 pipettes and reads the embedded RFID chip to immediately determine if the pipette is within required calibration specifications. For regulated labs in the pharma biotech industries, this is a major support tool that eliminates the manual and time-consuming process of tracking calibration dates to verify the pipette is proper to use. Our pipettes have long been known for the ability to provide reproducible data. SmartStand further helps our customers to ensure this data was generated on a verified pipette. We believe it will help drive our service business as well as lab conversions as more researchers seek to benefit from our RFID-enabled pipettes. This is only one new product launch, but representative of how we continue to drive value of our customers.
As you can see, we have much underway in terms of targeting top line growth. We also continue to make very good progress on our margin initiatives. Our pricing, productivity and supply chain initiatives continue to evolve and yield tangible results. There is a lot of work behind all of this, particularly in an organization as ours that has so many complexities. With continued diligence, we can move these initiatives to the next level.
That concludes our prepared remarks. In summary, we believe we are executing well, and market conditions are good enough for our customers to keep their replacement cycle. With the benefit of our growth initiatives, we believe we are continuing to gain share and continue to improve our margins. Assuming demand in our markets remain stable, we expect to continue to generate good sales and earnings growth.
I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions."

That business would have been maybe -- I'm trying to do the math here in my head, maybe 1.5 points less without the T&L projects. The T&L projects maybe weren't as close on our radar screen and frankly, they're a little bit smaller. The retail projects did move from Q4 into Q3, and that's the one that we more had in mind with that reference to coming a little earlier than we expected. The T&L project, I think, largely came in -- I mean it was maybe in total a little better than we expected but wasn't so much different than we expected from a timing point of view."

But forecasting and anticipating how the Chinese economy do overall is difficult. And the industrial business is particularly exposed to the cycles in China. And of course, we have also comparison topics. We have, for example, a very strong performance in biopharma. I would here highlight including also in Europe, and we're going to feel that next year. How will this develop has, in that sense, a certain risk in it. Now on the upside, I would say China industry could actually clearly come strongly in than we expected. As I mentioned before, there is a high volatility on that front. So that's one. If biopharma continues to be that strong, we would benefit across many businesses. That would be really nice. And then there is a certain pent-up demand that we had always seen when an overall economy strengthen and pent-up demand in CapEx where core industrial would benefit in particular. So that's another upside that I could see."

This is different to past changes, and past changes where really the whole team. And this time, it's few people that will retire age-wise, and so there is continuity in political leadership. One other highlight that we saw during this business review in China was our strengthening position in lab and in particular, actually pipette and pH. I was very pleased to hear that we are kind of winning market position and becoming leaders in pipette and pH in China, which is typically takes a couple of years and is very attractive because, of course, these are businesses with great profitability and great consumable streams. So this is our examples. We have certainly, many more from other countries, too. One that, for example, just to share. In India, we are so pleased to see how the growth goes there. We talked a lot about this made in India, how this is helping. I mentioned that a little bit because for us, we always depend also that the industrial manufacturing is important. It drives quality. It drives to export industry. And that's, for example, something that I could feel very strongly when I met the Indian team. We see it in our good numbers. One thing, next year they are moving to a VAT tax structure. And that could, in the short term, impact a little bit our numbers. So every country has something specific, and it was good to sense it. All in all, we came back from the tour in a very positive way. Extremely pleased by the plan. But also, and I think you referred to that a little bit, the macroeconomic and the governmental environment, we feel good about that."

So one of the things we would be dealing with is we could maybe estimate what the full year impact was, but the nature of it would make our tax rate jump around quite a bit in the quarters.

This is ongoing and in that sense, we have already benefit, but it's a long journey. This is -- the installed base is so huge and of course, customers don't instantly replace it just because we send the marketing materials or we sent over a salesperson with a dedicated value proposition. So I see that as one of many initiatives that we have in Spinnaker that help us drive further growth. We see already the benefit. It will continue to benefit us for many more years. And the same is true actually for the second initiative where we generate sales force targets based on big data analytics. This is something we started to pilot early in the year, and we have been scaling it up in Q2. We start to see the benefits, but we have many more years to go until we see saturation in the upside of that."

Let me start with those, and I have Mary flipping me some lines as well as Shawn. So progression for quarter-to-quarter, I think we kind of mentioned in the conference call script that I think Q3 has got to be a tough comp a year from now. I think you can kind of play it out that way. Not all of it will -- if you look at incremental margins, it won't be as big of an issue there because of the high retail content. You can also assume that we get about 1% or so of sales growth from Troemner in the first 2 quarters, and that stops in Q3 and Q4. In terms of working days, I think the -- it's flat in Q3 of this year, and Q4 it's minus 2 working days. And for 2017, I think there's a day difference that we have a day more in Q1 of '17, and we catch it back up in Q2. And then it looks like there's one less day in Q3. But I don't think those should be so material. In terms of other things to think about, I can't think -- another one might be kind of timing of some of our Blue Ocean go-lives. I -- those don't jump out to me right now in terms of being particularly large units. So I think that, that shouldn't be so much of an issue. I -- yes, I think all of us are kind of nodding that those would be the key items. I think the one other item would be in response to like a follow-up to make sure it resonated with people. Ross asked earlier about this new accounting regulation surrounding accounting for the income tax benefits of stock options in excess of the actual value. I think that we're working on trying to estimate that impact now for the full year, but I do think the way the accounting rules are written, it will lead to quite a bit of volatility by quarter. And that's something that I think we're going to almost have to guide you quarter-by-quarter at this stage. And so I would maybe suggest people just leave it a typical Mettler flat 24 for now, and that's what we've given you in terms of guidance. But it will probably be an improved number when we talk to you in February, but we're still estimating what that will be. Did I get all the parts to your question, Steve?"

What we also did, we have significant price increases that we implemented in the U.K. to offset, of course, the weakening of the pound. Now just talking about the pound, I want you to be aware that we have a net short position towards the pound, because we have 2 major manufacturing plants of our Product Inspection. So that's at least on the positive side for us. And we'll see how it further develops. Typically, when these kind of things happen in a country, you have, in the short term, an effect and then things rebalance. The second question about the field turbo. So we have these different ways, there are so many different projects that I described before. So not all of them have the same payback time. I would for example, expect the investments that we do in Southeast Asia that will have faster paybacks than for some investments that I referred to in Automated Chemistry. But all in all, we'd say we want to have them to reach a breakeven after a year. And kind of after 2 years, they should cover their initial investment. And that's also the beauty when we do these in waves but on a regular basis. The older waves kind of also help fund the new waves."

I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.
The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Let me start by saying it was a very good quarter, and it reflected strong strategy execution by our teams around the globe. Local currency sales growth was 9% in the quarter, with broad-based growth in all regions in most product lines. Demand in Americas and Europe was very good. Asia/Rest of World did particularly well with good growth in China and strong growth in most other countries in this region. We are very happy with these results, which reflect solid market conditions and, as already mentioned, continued strong execution of our strategies. With the benefit of our margin and cost initiatives, we had good growth in margins which contributed to excellent growth in earnings per share. Cash flow was also quite good in the quarter. 
We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year and 2017.
Before I turn it over to Bill to cover the numbers, let me comment on the management changes that we announced today. Many of you have met Shawn Vadala most recently at our investor meeting in California in July. He has worked with Bill for almost 20 years and was promoted to CFO 3 years ago. Shawn is highly respected within our organization for his knowledge of our business and its processes as well as his business acumen. Shawn has been a key contributor to many of our margin enhancement programs. For example, pricing has been an important profit driver for us, and Shawn has led our efforts in pricing since the beginning. Shawn has also played an important role in helping effectively shift the resource allocations within the organization toward our strategic priorities of the faster-growing, more profitable businesses. Shawn has also worked closely with me to initiate our big data analytics programs. For the next 12 months, we expect Shawn to continue to focus on his existing responsibilities, and you will gradually see him more on the Investor Relations front beginning in about a year from now.
Some of you have also met Oliver Wittorf at our investor meeting. Oliver has been with us for 13 years and has one of the most diverse MT careers within our management team. Oliver has held a number of important roles, including being head of operations for our Boston-based Process Analytics business. He was the project lead in China for our Blue Ocean program. And for the last few years, he has held our global supply chain team lead, which included our very successful procurement programs and the establishment of our regional hubs. He will keep his supply chain responsibilities and take over daily responsibility for IT and Blue Ocean. He's ideally suited for this expanded role within the organization.
I am confident that both Shawn and Oliver have the experience and track record to be strong contributors to our executive team and to further the development of the finance, supply chain, IT and Blue Ocean functions within our organization. I have worked with both of them over many years and look forward to many more years with them in their expanded roles.
From an investor perspective, very little will change over the next 12 months, and Bill and Mary will remain your principal contacts. Bill will gradually reduce his time commitment, and beginning in 2018, Bill will begin to hand over the Investor Relations activities to Shawn and ensure a smooth transition. Mary will continue in her role in Investor Relations and Treasury and continue to be your day-to-day contact. 
Finally, I want to express how pleased I am that we have orchestrated a smooth and well-planned succession for Bill and that we can continue to leverage Bill's unique contribution to the company for another 2 years. Bill demonstrated his great leadership in nurturing his successor and also in working with me to make this gradual transition, which I'm very grateful for.
Let me hand it over now to Bill."

I'm pleased about the transition that we put in place and proud that we have developed these 2 strong highly capable leaders in Shawn and Oliver. Further, I am happy to continue to serve this great company and help drive its development for the coming 2 years. And of course, I also look forward to working with all of you.
Now let me come back to the quarter and cover the financials. Sales were $650.6 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 9% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed about 1% to that growth. On a dollar basis, our sales grew by 8% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. 
On Slide #4, you have local currency sales growth for the third quarter. Our sales grew 7% in the Americas, 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia/Rest of World. Americas growth excluding Troemner was about 6%. 
On the next slide, we provide year-to-date local currency sales growth, which was 6%. By region, Americas had a growth of 7%, Europe is 4% and Asia/Rest of World has increased 8% on a year-to-date basis.
Now on to Slide #6. We outlined sales growth by product area for the quarter. Lab had good growth with local currency sales growth of 9%, of which approximately 2% was from Troemner. Industrial increased by 8%, and food retail increased by 13%. All these comparisons are versus the prior year. 
The next slide summarizes year-to-date sales by product line. Lab had local currency sales growth of 8%; industrial, 5%; and food retailing, 6%. 
Now to Slide #8. Let me walk you through the key items in our P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 56.8%. That's a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year amount of 56.2%. Pricing and material costs decreased as pricing increases and material cost decreases contributed to the improved margin, which was offset in part by some targeted investments in our service business as well as an unfavorable mix.
R&D amounted to $30.1 million. That's a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $187.7 million. That's an increase of 8% in local currency over the prior year. Higher variable comp largely explained by assumed higher performance against our budget targets as well as investments in our field turbo program were offset by cost savings in other parts of the business. 
Adjusted operating income was $151.7 million in the quarter. That's a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $134.3 million. Currencies benefited operating profit by $1.5 million. And yes, that was not a typo. We had a currency benefit this quarter. The first one in some time. Adjusted operating margins were 23.3%. That's 110 basis point increase over the prior year. 
A couple of comments to the P&L. Our amortization was $9.1 million, while our interest expense was $7.2 million. Our effective tax rate continue to be 24%. Our fully diluted shares for the quarter were 26.9 million. That's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.89 per share, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $3.26 per share. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $3.77 as compared to $3.16 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of restructuring, $0.05 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.03 of acquisition transaction costs related to Troemner.
The next slide shows the year-to-date P&L. We had local currency sales growth of 6%. Operating income increased by 9%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 15%.
Now taking a look at cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $125.6 million as compared to $107.1 million in the prior year. We remain pleased with working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO. ITO was 4.6, which was flat with last quarter. Cash flow on a year-to-date basis amounted to $263.7 million. That's an increase of 16% on a per share basis. For the year, we expect free cash flow in the $380 million range.
Now let's turn to guidance. We're raising our full year 2016 local currency sales guidance to approximately 6% versus 5% previously. This reflects organic growth of approximately 5.5% and about 50 basis points of sales growth from the Troemner acquisition. We have also raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.61 per share to $14.66 per share. That's a growth of approximately 13%. This compares to our previous guidance of 11% to 12% growth or $4.40 to $4.50 per share.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5%. This includes approximately 1% growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $5.08 to $5.13. This reflects a growth rate of 9% to 10%.
Now let's turn to 2017. We're coming off a very strong third quarter, and we have expectations for a solid Q4 as well. We believe we are executing well. We have a strong product pipeline. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs as well as our field turbo investments are yielding tangible results. These factors are within our control, and we feel confident about them. Offsetting these positives are some lingering questions regarding global economy. In particular, we see continued risk in China, some uncertainty in Europe, and we will face tougher comps, for example, in our lab business as well as the Americas.
Taking into account these factors, we expect local currency sales growth to be about 5% in 2017. This will include 50 basis points from the Troemner acquisition. This will -- should result in adjusted EPS in the range of $16.05 to $16.25 per share, and that's a growth rate of 10% to 11%. We expect currency to reduce adjusted EPS growth by about 1% in 2017. 
In terms of quarterly guidance for 2017, as usual, we'll provide that on our upcoming calls. However, I know you'll be updating your model. I just want to point out that we will have a tough comp in Q3 next year, given the very strong results that we are reporting today.
In terms of currency impact on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales by about 1.5% in the fourth quarter. This will result in a 2% impact on sales growth for the full year 2016. And in 2017, currency should reduce sales by about 1.5%. 
Finally, in terms of cash flow next year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $390 million range. This reflects a 6% growth on a per share basis, which is below our normal target and that has to do with higher capital expenditures. As we explained last year, our CapEx levels in '16 and '17 are higher due to facility expansions related to our product inspection businesses as well as a facility consolidation we're doing in Switzerland. These expansions will amount to approximately $55 million in 2017. We built into our assumptions $500 million of share repurchases next year, which is the same amount as we did this year.
Okay. That's it for my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier."

Lab had a very good growth in the quarter. All product lines performed well. Our strong product pipeline, benefit of field turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs are all contributing to favorable results. Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be favorable. While government and academia was not strong in the West, it's not a big segment for us. Industrial was stronger than unexpected in the quarter, including core industrial, which increased mid-single digits. Core industrial was particularly strong in Asia/Rest of the World but was up in China as well. In the Americas and Europe, we benefited from some projects in transportation and logistics, but the core industrial markets remained difficult. 
Product Inspection was up strongly in the quarter, with particularly good growth in Americas and Europe. We continue to penetrate large multinational food companies as the supplier of choice as they seek to standardize their Product Inspection equipment. We have made some good inroads over the last 12 to 24 months, and we expect good results in the fourth quarter as well. 
Finally, retail increased 13% in the quarter, much better than we had expected as some projects moved forward from Q4. We had good growth in all regions. We would expect retail to be down in the fourth quarter.
Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid. Biopharma and food were our strongest segments. Lab had growth against strong comparisons in the prior year. Product Inspection retail did very well in the quarter with a number of large projects. Core industrial also had growth and benefited from some project activity in transportation and logistics, but as expected, many industrial segments remained weak. 
Europe's growth exceeded expectations. Similar to the U.S., biopharma and food were good segments. Lab and Product Inspection benefited from these trends. Core industrial benefited from some transport -- transportation and logistics activity but similar to the U.S., many industrial segments were weak. Finally, retail also had very good growth and as was already mentioned, was partially due to some projects moving from Q4 to Q3.
Asia/Rest of the World grew double digits in the quarter. Lab growth in China was again in double digits, with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We continue to be very pleased with this performance, which reflects good demand, particularly in life sciences, as well as the benefit of our actions to redirect resources to faster growing market segments. Industrial in China had modest growth as we continue to be impacted by the overcapacity in the industrial manufacturing sector. We're seeing good growth in certain industrial markets such as chemical pharma and OEM, but this is being overshadowed by weakness in markets such as cement and metals. 
One final comment on the business. Service grew 6% in the quarter. 
Those are all my comments on current business trends. Now let me provide a broader update on our strategy and how it continues to evolve and positions us well for the next year and beyond.
Let me start with our sales and marketing strategies. At our Investor Day in July, we discussed one of our new initiatives in this area, and that is our effort to generate leads and better focus our sales effort by leveraging big data. Our data sources include our compact database, our installed base of instruments, hits on mt.com and increasingly rich data streams from Blue Ocean as well as some third-party data. We are becoming more sophisticated in how we use this data to target incremental growth. We are in the early stages of developing the potential of big data, but we already see opportunities to refine our current strategy and identify new sources of growth and sales productivity.
As shared at the Investor Day, we are using big data to help us identify better where customers are investing, account locations that need more focus on cross-selling and the likely effect this means to succeed. We also recently launched Spinnaker 5, which is focused on increased sales productivity. The tools from Spinnaker 5 are being used to help units refine their channel strategy, more effectively balance their resources between field and inside sales and achieve better results in account penetration and cross-selling.
Finally, we have started our next wave of field turbo and expect to add 200 additional field resources in 2017. We believe the first waves of this field turbo program have been effective in helping us gain share.
We talk to you a lot about sales and marketing, but our share gains would not be possible without an excellent product pipeline. It continues to be very strong, particularly on the lab and Product Inspection side. Let me give you one example from our Rainin Pipette business. As a reminder, we have proprietary pipettes with superior economic design and which each have an embedded RFID chip for tracking. The team is now launching SmartStand, an easy to use pipette asset management system. This instrument can store up to 4 pipettes and reads the embedded RFID chip to immediately determine if the pipette is within required calibration specifications. For regulated labs in the pharma biotech industries, this is a major support tool that eliminates the manual and time-consuming process of tracking calibration dates to verify the pipette is proper to use. Our pipettes have long been known for the ability to provide reproducible data. SmartStand further helps our customers to ensure this data was generated on a verified pipette. We believe it will help drive our service business as well as lab conversions as more researchers seek to benefit from our RFID-enabled pipettes. This is only one new product launch, but representative of how we continue to drive value of our customers.
As you can see, we have much underway in terms of targeting top line growth. We also continue to make very good progress on our margin initiatives. Our pricing, productivity and supply chain initiatives continue to evolve and yield tangible results. There is a lot of work behind all of this, particularly in an organization as ours that has so many complexities. With continued diligence, we can move these initiatives to the next level.
That concludes our prepared remarks. In summary, we believe we are executing well, and market conditions are good enough for our customers to keep their replacement cycle. With the benefit of our growth initiatives, we believe we are continuing to gain share and continue to improve our margins. Assuming demand in our markets remain stable, we expect to continue to generate good sales and earnings growth.
I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions."

That business would have been maybe -- I'm trying to do the math here in my head, maybe 1.5 points less without the T&L projects. The T&L projects maybe weren't as close on our radar screen and frankly, they're a little bit smaller. The retail projects did move from Q4 into Q3, and that's the one that we more had in mind with that reference to coming a little earlier than we expected. The T&L project, I think, largely came in -- I mean it was maybe in total a little better than we expected but wasn't so much different than we expected from a timing point of view."

But I also see some upside, in terms of Shawn and the team are putting together some new things in the area, for example, of services where I think we have some opportunity and also reaching out to some other countries.

But forecasting and anticipating how the Chinese economy do overall is difficult. And the industrial business is particularly exposed to the cycles in China. And of course, we have also comparison topics. We have, for example, a very strong performance in biopharma. I would here highlight including also in Europe, and we're going to feel that next year. How will this develop has, in that sense, a certain risk in it. Now on the upside, I would say China industry could actually clearly come strongly in than we expected. As I mentioned before, there is a high volatility on that front. So that's one. If biopharma continues to be that strong, we would benefit across many businesses. That would be really nice. And then there is a certain pent-up demand that we had always seen when an overall economy strengthen and pent-up demand in CapEx where core industrial would benefit in particular. So that's another upside that I could see."

But the guys are a little bit more optimistic this year because with the 2 top guys staying in place and a lot of people frankly worried about the Chinese economy that there'll be more emphasis to kind of keep growing.

This is different to past changes, and past changes where really the whole team. And this time, it's few people that will retire age-wise, and so there is continuity in political leadership. One other highlight that we saw during this business review in China was our strengthening position in lab and in particular, actually pipette and pH. I was very pleased to hear that we are kind of winning market position and becoming leaders in pipette and pH in China, which is typically takes a couple of years and is very attractive because, of course, these are businesses with great profitability and great consumable streams. So this is our examples. We have certainly, many more from other countries, too. One that, for example, just to share. In India, we are so pleased to see how the growth goes there. We talked a lot about this made in India, how this is helping. I mentioned that a little bit because for us, we always depend also that the industrial manufacturing is important. It drives quality. It drives to export industry. And that's, for example, something that I could feel very strongly when I met the Indian team. We see it in our good numbers. One thing, next year they are moving to a VAT tax structure. And that could, in the short term, impact a little bit our numbers. So every country has something specific, and it was good to sense it. All in all, we came back from the tour in a very positive way. Extremely pleased by the plan. But also, and I think you referred to that a little bit, the macroeconomic and the governmental environment, we feel good about that."

We have -- or sorry, the amount of it is in the $500 million range, and I think we have more than 50% now being under what we refer to as category management. So I think that number will climb a little bit. But I think the way we look at that is we're always trying to come up with new programs that can drive further savings in there. I think, we, this year will save a number in the high single-digit million range, and I think we should be able to deliver a number in that range again next year."

I guess just a couple of follow-ups here. Around the quarter itself, it looks like maybe about $0.05 in the quarter you didn't pass on to the full year. Is that just conservatism? Is that some of the pull forward? Maybe talk a little bit about that."

Specifically, I'm wondering and this is, I guess, a follow-up to Tim's question. Is there any impact from timing items in the third quarter that might actually impact 2017, given you mentioned some of those are actually items that were further out? The second piece would be selling days. Any selling day abnormalities, either actually in the third quarter or looking forward? And then the third part of my 3-parter is -- anything next year aside from the tough comp that we should consider as we think about the progression of incremental margins?"

Let me start with those, and I have Mary flipping me some lines as well as Shawn. So progression for quarter-to-quarter, I think we kind of mentioned in the conference call script that I think Q3 has got to be a tough comp a year from now. I think you can kind of play it out that way. Not all of it will -- if you look at incremental margins, it won't be as big of an issue there because of the high retail content. You can also assume that we get about 1% or so of sales growth from Troemner in the first 2 quarters, and that stops in Q3 and Q4. In terms of working days, I think the -- it's flat in Q3 of this year, and Q4 it's minus 2 working days. And for 2017, I think there's a day difference that we have a day more in Q1 of '17, and we catch it back up in Q2. And then it looks like there's one less day in Q3. But I don't think those should be so material. In terms of other things to think about, I can't think -- another one might be kind of timing of some of our Blue Ocean go-lives. I -- those don't jump out to me right now in terms of being particularly large units. So I think that, that shouldn't be so much of an issue. I -- yes, I think all of us are kind of nodding that those would be the key items. I think the one other item would be in response to like a follow-up to make sure it resonated with people. Ross asked earlier about this new accounting regulation surrounding accounting for the income tax benefits of stock options in excess of the actual value. I think that we're working on trying to estimate that impact now for the full year, but I do think the way the accounting rules are written, it will lead to quite a bit of volatility by quarter. And that's something that I think we're going to almost have to guide you quarter-by-quarter at this stage. And so I would maybe suggest people just leave it a typical Mettler flat 24 for now, and that's what we've given you in terms of guidance. But it will probably be an improved number when we talk to you in February, but we're still estimating what that will be. Did I get all the parts to your question, Steve?"

And yes, our business has slowed down, and it's certainly also associated with the Brexit discussions that we have.  Of course, our customer base is faced with uncertainty, and we see it in our business. What we also did, we have significant price increases that we implemented in the U.K. to offset, of course, the weakening of the pound. Now just talking about the pound, I want you to be aware that we have a net short position towards the pound, because we have 2 major manufacturing plants of our Product Inspection. So that's at least on the positive side for us. And we'll see how it further develops. Typically, when these kind of things happen in a country, you have, in the short term, an effect and then things rebalance. The second question about the field turbo. So we have these different ways, there are so many different projects that I described before. So not all of them have the same payback time. I would for example, expect the investments that we do in Southeast Asia that will have faster paybacks than for some investments that I referred to in Automated Chemistry. But all in all, we'd say we want to have them to reach a breakeven after a year. And kind of after 2 years, they should cover their initial investment. And that's also the beauty when we do these in waves but on a regular basis. The older waves kind of also help fund the new waves."
