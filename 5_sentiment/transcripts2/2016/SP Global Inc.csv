Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'll provide you an update on how we position McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. And let me begin with an overview of 2015. Revenue",2501,"Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'll provide you an update on how we position McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. 
And let me begin with an overview of 2015. Revenue increased 5% year-on-year with organic revenue increasing 3%. Adjusted total expenses increased 1%, adjusted operating profit increased 13%, adjusted operating margin increased 280 basis points and diluted adjusted EPS increased 17%. 
Margin improvement was a big story for the year. Our cost-reduction efforts and revenue growth combined for 280 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin for the second year in a row. Every business delivered at least 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Year-over-year, our revenue increased $262 million, 90% of this was pulled through to adjusted operating profit. I'm proud of this accomplishment as it is a testament to how well our employees control costs during the year. This cost efficiency was the main reason we were able to leverage our revenue growth into 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth. 
As we look at the company's financial performance over the last 4 years, the company has delivered consistent improvements in revenue, margin and EPS. Revenue from continuing operations has grown at a 9% compounded annual growth rate. Our adjusted margins have improved 960 basis points from 29.1% to 38.7%. And we've achieved global compounded annual growth rate in adjusted annual diluted earnings per share of 22%. 
In addition to delivering another year of strong financial performance, we continue to strengthen our franchises during 2015. The most important transaction of the year was the addition of SNL. We increasingly believe that the combination of SNL with S&P Capital IQ presents a compelling opportunity to create a powerful data and analytics business. In addition, we acquired Petromedia, strengthening Platts' existing position in the bunker market, launched Platts' Market DataDirect, a new service that delivers Platts' price assessments, historical and other reference data in a matter of seconds, positioned Capital IQ as a core content provider to Symphony Communication Services so that its customers can seamlessly access S&P Capital IQ company data; launched a suite of new fixed income indices, anchored by our flagship S&P 500 Bond Index, the first-ever index that tracks the debt of the S&P 500 companies and the first price and real-time throughout the day; and we entered into new and expanded exchange agreements in New Zealand, Mexico and Brazil. 
Beyond strengthening our businesses, there are a number of other key accomplishments in 2015. We consolidated the company headquarters into downtown New York, a move that brought corporate employees much closer to our operations; generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow, excluding legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries; returned $1.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends; successfully issued debt into the market after an 8-year absence; continued to make investments in compliance and risk management; and last week, increased the dividend by 9%, marking the 43rd consecutive year we increased. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results, where the company finished 2015 with solid earnings in a difficult debt-issuance environment. Revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue, however, only grew 1% as a result of revenue declines in S&P Ratings Services. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%, and fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 9%. The strength of our portfolio is evident in the fourth quarter as weak issuance at ratings was offset by solid revenue growth across the rest of the portfolio. This portfolio strength, coupled with progress on productivity initiatives, enabled the company to deliver 9% adjusted diluted EPS. 
Now let me turn to the individual businesses, and I'll start with S&P Capital IQ and SNL. In 2015, reported revenue increased 14% with organic growth, excluding revenue from SNL acquisition, increasing 7%. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 25%, and adjusted margin increased 200 basis points. With integration teams in place and synergy opportunities identified, we expect to deliver considerable adjusted margin improvements in this segment over the next few years. Jack will provide more details in a few minutes. 
In the fourth quarter, reported revenue increased 27%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 22% in the fourth quarter, and adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points. This margin decline was due to deal-related amortization. Excluding that amortization, fourth quarter margin actually increased 200 basis points from 21.3% in fourth quarter 2014 to 23.3% in 2015. 
Let me add a bit more color on fourth quarter revenue growth in the business lines. S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 9%, principally through a low teens increase in desktop revenue. SNL revenue increased 10% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, 2015 revenue was reduced by deferred revenue adjustment required under purchase accounting. Excluding this adjustment, revenue growth was 14%. Global risk services revenue increased 5%, led by RatingsXpress, which is increasingly used by customers to meet their regulatory reporting needs. And the smallest category, S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence revenue increased 4% overall with growth in Global Markets Intelligence and leveraged commentary data exceeding declines in equity research services. 
Let me turn to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. In 2015, revenue declined 1%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue for the year increased 3%. Adjusted operating profit grew 7%, and the adjusted operating margin increased 340 basis points to 47.2%, a noteworthy achievement. During the quarter, revenues decreased 7%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue decreased 4%. Adjusted operating profit decreased 3%, and adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 43.7%. 
While decreased expenses in the fourth quarter led to margin expansion, the big story during the quarter was weak global issuance. Non-transaction revenue in the quarter was flat. However, excluding ForEx, it increased 4% due to strength in CRISIL and in ratings valuation service revenue from elevated M&A activity. This was partially offset by the lower revenues associated with fewer new customers that were added in the quarter. Transaction weakness was caused by 26% decline in global issuance, partially offset by growth in bank loan ratings. Excluding ForEx, transaction revenue decreased 13%. 
Let's take a look at issuance. The 2 largest markets, the U.S. and Europe, both declined, capping a weak second half of the year for issuance. Fourth quarter issuance in the U.S. was down across the board. Investment grade decreased 17%, high yields, 41%; public finance was down 21%; and structured finance also declined 26%, with the only bright spot being RMBS. In Europe, investment grade decreased 15%; high yield, down 10%; and structured finance increased 11% with declines in every asset class, offset by growth in covered bonds. 
The rest of the world had even weaker issuance with Asia declining 47% and the Americas outside the U.S. declining 46%. In total, global bond issuance declined 26%, outpacing the 20% decline in the third quarter. 
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2015, this business delivered an 8% increase in revenue, a 12% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 200 basis point of adjusted margin improvement to 65.6%. Fourth quarter results were similar with a 7% increase in revenue, a 9% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 100 basis point of adjusted margin improvement. During the quarter, there was a modest decline in revenue from ETFs, offset by revenue from exchange-traded derivatives, mutual funds, OTC derivatives and data licenses. 
If we turn to the key business drivers, the ETF industry surpassed 2014 record inflows, setting a new record of $351 billion in 2015, a great trend. AUM based on our indices increased 9% sequentially from third quarter '15 to $815 billion, but below peak levels at the end of 2014. 
During the quarter, we continued to innovate, launching 233 new indices and 26 new ETFs based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Exchange-traded derivatives revenues growth was primarily driven by increased revenues from CME, partially offset by a decrease in exchange-traded derivative volumes based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. As you know, S&P Dow Jones Indices impacted by fluctuating markets, but continued inflows into passive investing, innovative new indices and efforts to partner with exchanges around the world bodes well for the long-term positioning of this business. 
On to commodities and commercial markets. The Eclipse NADA Used Car Guide and Petromedia acquisitions impacted revenue comparisons in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Adjusting for these items, organic revenue increased 6% in 2015. Adjusted operating profit increased 17%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 260 basis points to 36.9%. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue increased 8%, adjusted operating profit increased 20% and adjusted operating margin increased 240 basis points. Both Platts and J.D. Power delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth. J.D. revenue powers -- J.D. Power revenue was powered by its auto business with particular strength in its product. The evaluation of strategic alternatives for J.D. Power continues with considerable interest from third parties. 
Many of our upstream petroleum, natural gas and mining customers are pressured by low commodity prices, and this has impacted the revenue growth of the Platts business. Nevertheless, Platts delivered high single-digit revenue growth in this challenging environment. Organic revenue from the core subscription business grew with both petroleum and metals, ag and petrochemicals revenue increasing high single digits. Global Trading Services revenue increased double-digit, primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the steel index derivative activity. 
In summary, the company delivered solid revenue growth in a difficult market environment. More importantly, progress on our productivity initiatives was apparent with outstanding margin expansion delivered by every business in 2015. For the second year in a row, the company delivered adjusted operating margin improvement of 280 basis points. This accomplishment was the primary driver of the 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year. 
Now let me discuss the outlook for 2016, and I'd like to start with some thoughts from our economists. Major central banks moves in December may have disappointed or unnerved markets with the Federal Reserve raising rates and decisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan that appeared to disappoint or alarm in the market. However, monetary policy continues to provide a tailwind to economic expansion. Recent stock market volatility probably overstates the likelihood of a slump in global growth this year. These market moves appeared to be more sentiment than data-driven, with the exception obviously, the falling spot oil prices, which reflects changing supply fundamentals. In the 6.5 years or so since the global economy started to recover from the financial crisis, it has grown in real terms at an average of about 3.5% annually. S&P economists expect that trend to continue with a 3.6% global growth in 2016. Our economists expect real growth in China to continue to trend downward but to end up at 6.3% this year after growing by 6.9% in 2015. Growth in most of the developed world, and even much of the developing world, stands to be a bit higher this year than last, which adds up to a decent outcome for global growth. Excessive pessimism is not -- is probably not warranted. 
With this economic backdrop, we expect global debt shifts to decline 1% in 2016 and for spreads to widen. Within the U.S., we expect speculative-grade corporate issuers to see increasing borrowing costs in the coming quarters at the back of the Fed interest rate increase. While most higher-rated corporate entities should continue to have a favorable lending environment as investors pursue moderate yields while remaining more risk-averse. More favorable lending conditions in Europe, supported by continued monetary accommodation by the ECB, should result in increased bond and loan issuance in 2016. The central bank's recent measures combined with a softening in the regulatory stance may also bode well for higher issuance of securitized products with modest increases in borrowing from the public finance sector. 
Among the emerging markets, most regions are experiencing substantial stress from falling commodity prices, exchange-rated pressures from rising dollar, tighter lending conditions and a rising share of nonperforming loans. Two of the largest economies, Brazil and China, have been experiencing significant headwinds this year, and their market volatility is unlikely to subside in the near term. 
Now turning from macro factors to those items inside the company that we control. There are several areas of focus in 2016. Our revenue guidance for 2016 is from mid-to-high single-digit growth. While tepid issuance limits S&P Ratings Services growth, we'll benefit from 8 additional months of SNL in 2016. Beginning in 2016, we will report our financial results using a newly defined adjusted diluted EPS that excludes deal-related amortization that Jack will discuss in a moment. Incorporating this change, our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance is a range of $5 to $5.15. In 2016, we expect to generate considerable free cash flow, and our guidance is for approximately $1.3 billion. Please note that this cash flow guidance doesn't include the proceeds from the potential sale of J.D. Power. We're actively pursuing the sale of this business and have received considerable interest from a number of parties. 
The top operational priorities in the corporation will be the integration of S&P Capital IQ and SNL. 10 work streams are in place. And now that we have an inside look at SNL and the collective knowledge from both businesses, additional synergies have been identified. We have a goal to transform global risk services into a market leader. We have risk capabilities within S&P Rating Services, S&P Capital IQ and SNL and CRISIL that we brought to bear to create new credit products and services. I have challenged the organization to continue to expand our international footprint through better customer focus as well as collaboration across the company. And I've also challenged the company to deliver additional process improvements from automating elements of the ratings process, to improving data collection. There's ample opportunity to drive performance with process improvements and reengineering. We'll also continue to invest in compliance and risk management as well as firm-wide technology and data road map. Technology is at the heart of each business, and we need to evolve our technology in a thoughtful and coordinated manner. 
And now I'd like to conclude with some big news. The Board of Directors has proposed renaming the company S&P Global. This name better leverages the company's risk heritage and our powerful financial data and analytics brand while signaling that we have a strong global footprint and broad portfolio. The change will be effective, pending a shareholder vote on April 27. In addition to changing the name of the company, we will also be changing the names of some of our divisions. For example, S&P Capital IQ and SNL will be renamed S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. And now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer."

As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity",1952,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity around several items that impact our financial performance, and then we will open up the call for your questions. 
First, I will recap key financial results. As part of the review, I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization and discuss our new approach to key performance metrics. I will also review the impact from adjustments to earnings and update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. After that, I'll provide updates on our productivity initiatives and SNL integration. And finally, I will provide 2016 guidance. 
Let's start with a consolidated fourth quarter income statement. As Doug already commented on these items, there are just a couple of items I want to highlight. First, reported revenue grew 7%, benefiting in part from the first full quarter of SNL contribution. On a constant-currency basis, organic revenue grew 3%. Delivering overall top line growth was thanks to the strength and breadth of our portfolio as revenue from our largest business, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, was lower than last year due to the impact of weak global debt issuance. 
Second, expenses and margins were impacted by the step-up in deal-related amortization. I will discuss this item in more detail in just a moment. 
Third, the tax rate was considerably lower than a year ago largely due to improved profitability in several lower-tax jurisdictions outside the United States and favorable tax benefits from the ongoing resolution of prior year tax audits. 
Turning now to the full year. Both reported revenue and organic revenue on a constant-currency basis increased 5%. This was consistent with our guidance of mid-single-digit growth. The most impressive result is that total adjusted expenses increased only 1%. This is a direct result of the tangible progress on our 3-year cost-reduction plan, which I will discuss in a moment. As a result of cost productivity and a solid revenue growth, adjusted operating margin increased 280 points to 38.7%. The tax rate for the full year on an adjusted basis was 30.5%. As I just mentioned, this was due to improved profitability in lower-cost jurisdictions and the ongoing favorable outcomes from the resolution of certain prior year tax audits. 
And finally, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% [ph] and 17%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.53 is a couple of pennies ahead of our latest guidance. The average adjusted diluted shares outstanding decreased by over 1 million shares versus a year ago. The full impact of the 10 million shares that we repurchased during 2015 will be more evident in the 2016 share count. 
Now I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization. As a result of the SNL acquisition, the company's deal-related amortization expense has increased significantly. It will be approximately $98 million in 2016, just over half of which is related to the SNL acquisition. In the top section of the slide, you can see that we reported a fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating margin of 24.8% as deal-related amortization more than doubled. On the other hand, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating profit margins of 36.8%. The difference is not as pronounced on the full year results, which includes only 4 months of SNL-deal-related amortization expense. Here, the reported 2015 adjusted operating margin is 38.7%. However, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported 2015 adjusted operating profit margin of 39.9%. 
On this slide, we lay out the earnings per share impact of deal-related amortization expense on the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, there's an $0.08 per share difference between the reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.04 and the adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding deal-related amortization of $1.12. For the full year of 2015, the difference is $0.16. Now going forward, beginning in 2016, we will be excluding this deal-related amortization from our non-GAAP results. We think that this will enable investors to view our results in the same manner as management. In today's earnings release, we have provided the impact of this change to 2015 adjusted earnings by quarter, but you can adjust your models accordingly. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. In total, pretax adjustments to earnings from continuing operations totaled $54 million in the quarter. This consisted of $33 million of restructuring charges in S&P Capital IQ and SNL, corporate and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. There was $15 million in accruals for potential legal settlements and $6 million for acquisition-related costs associated with the SNL transaction. As you have seen in the past, these restructuring actions are targeted to produce tangible cost reductions. The majority of the actions were taken in S&P Capital IQ and SNL as this division begins the realization of its cost synergy plans. I will provide an update on these synergies in just a moment. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of the end of 2015, we had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $143 million of short-term debt in commercial paper. Going forward, we intend to tap into the short-term debt markets periodically to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. Our full year free cash flow was a negative $48 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements in related insurance recoveries. On that basis, year-to-date free cash flow was a positive $1.2 billion. This is consistent with our guidance of greater than $1.1 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company stepped up its share repurchase program and bought approximately 5 million shares, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 10 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, totaled to approximately $1.3 billion of cash returned to shareholders in 2015. This overall return of capital is in line with the past several years. Overall, we have returned approximately $6.4 billion over the last 5 years. The share repurchase program remains an important component of our overall capital allocation, and we anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, subject to market conditions. 
As most of you know, we initiated a 3-year productivity program that will conclude by the end of 2016. The target was initially $100 million when introduced in early 2014 and was increased to $140 million last year. As of the end of 2015, approximately 80% of that productivity target has been realized. Our progress is clearly evident in the margin progress that we have delivered over the past 2 years. We currently expect to complete these initiatives and deliver on the full $140 million target by the end of this year. 
Now let me provide an update on the integration of SNL. This was the first full quarter of our ownership of SNL. And given its importance, the integration has become a primary area of focus for the company. It is imperative that we combine S&P Capital IQ and SNL rapidly to capture synergies while minimizing disruption to the business, and most importantly, our customers. As Doug mentioned, 10 integration work streams are in place and efforts are well underway. We have a centralized integration management office that provides detailed tracking by initiative, identification of key issues and monitoring of these synergies. Both Doug and I work closely with Mike Chinn and his team to help ensure that these efforts receive the appropriate priority and support across the company. 
More importantly for investors, we are now on track to exceed the initial $70 million synergy target ahead of our original time line. When we announced the acquisition of SNL, we cited a target of $70 million of run rate EBITDA synergies by 2019. This was an estimate we arrived at by looking at SNL from the outside in. We now have had the opportunity to work directly with the new leadership team to consider what can be accomplished as we build and integrate S&P Capital IQ and SNL organizations. With this more informed inside look, we are now targeting $100 million of synergies by 2019. This increase is almost entirely cost-related, as we now expect about $70 million of cost synergies by 2018, and the balance revenue-related. Furthermore, we expect that more than 1/3 of the synergies will be realized in 2016. Taken in total, these synergies, the sustained growth across both legacy businesses, and the positive 8-month overlap on the acquisition should generate approximately 20% revenue growth in 2016 with profits, excluding the impact of deal-related amortization, growing twice as fast. 
Let me provide some additional guidance going into 2016. Overall, the strength and breadth of our portfolio better positions us to weather the volatility that we have experienced over the last couple of quarters, which has intensified a bit since the start of 2016. The promising outlook for S&P Capital IQ and SNL and continued growth at Platts supports our current assumption of mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth despite the weak start in debt issuance in the overall capital markets. We ancipitate maintaining the approximately 31% effective tax rate, generally in line with 2015. As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted earnings per share guidance will exclude the impact of deal-related amortization. On this basis, we are introducing adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.15, 7% to 10% growth off our 2015 adjusted earnings per share once the impact of deal-related amortization is excluded from both years. 
Despite the strong adjusted margin expansion expected at S&P Capital IQ and SNL, we are a bit cautious about further consolidated margin expansion in 2016. This caution is primarily based on the challenging market conditions, which may impact revenue growth and our 2 highest-margin business units, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and S&P Dow Jones Indices. And as a reminder, we have already made great progress on margins with the realization thus far of the $140 million productivity target. As a result, we would currently point to an overall margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, above the 39.9% adjusted operating margin, excluding deal-related amortization, in 2015. 
Capital investment is expected to be largely flat, in line with 2015. Our return of capital, last week, the company announced a 9% increase in our annual dividend to $1.44 per share. Our guidance considers continued share repurchases, although the timing can be impacted by market conditions. 
One clarification. This guidance assumes the inclusion of J.D. Power for the full year. As you can see in today's release, we have moved J.D. Power to an asset held for sale. As such, J.D. Power's results will be included until a sale is closed. Upon close, we currently anticipate using cash proceeds to repurchase shares and offset dilution. At that time, we will update you on any impact to our current outlook. 
Finally, we anticipate 2016 free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion, which excludes any additional impact from asset sales. 
In summary, we look for another year of growth in 2016. The strength of our portfolio, now augmented with SNL, positions us well to manage through this volatile market conditions. 
Now let me turn the call over to Chip Merritt to open it up for your questions."

More specifically, for Ratings, we do have, as Doug mentioned, the issuance outlook down a bit, down 1%. With that down volume, but maybe a bit of pricing, we would like to see some revenue growth in that business. However, I do suspect that may be a bit more weighted to the back half of the year, just kind of given issuance trends that we've seen in the fourth quarter that now appear to be continuing as we go into the first."

In terms of issuance, let me just give a few of the statistics from what we saw in the fourth quarter and a couple of the general trends. Clearly, as we reported, there was a large decrease in total corporate and governance. It decreased 29.3% in the fourth quarter, and there were some of the different categories, for instance, Latin America was down 60%, 68% overall. In January, we saw a continuation of that trend. The total corporate governance issuance was down about 26%. Financial institutions were down about 56%. But we put together our forecast, which you saw on Slide 26, which shows about a 1% decrease in 2016. We put that together with the combination of looking at the markets, what we expect to see from market issuance, scanning the market with investment banks and corporate banks, et cetera. We also look at the -- what is the maturity profile of debt that's already on balance sheet that's coming due. So we looked -- we do this forecast looking historically as well, what we see or the trends. If you look at that chart, you can see that 2014 was a peak year at $6 trillion of total issuance. And there's been a level, almost every year, 2012, '13, '15, a little bit over the $5 trillion level. The mix changes here and there, but we still believe that there would be somewhere in that range. It's just as Jack mentioned, it might be more in the second half of the year. There's another part of the markets, which you didn't ask a question, but I just want to mention as well, which is very important, which has to do with spreads. Spreads have recently widened significantly, especially at the lower end of the credit spread. Triple C type credits obviously more distressed credits and below have increased by over 400 basis points there to 12 25 spread range, whereas the AAA, AA level is still around the 100, 110 basis points. It barely budged over the year. In fact, as you've seen, U.S. treasuries have tightened. So the spread issue, where we see spreads going, there's a lot of volatility right now. We think that also plays into it, people's appetite for going out. It's not really related to the base rate. It's related to the spread. Anyway, long answer to your question, we are prepared in the business as necessary to manage our costs tightly through things like delaying hiring, looking at our bonus accruals as well as other investments that we might be making and things like technology and systems, et cetera. So we have certain flexibility we can build into our plan if we need to go through what could be a tough period. And one final comment. As you've heard me say many times in the past, we have a long-term optimism in this business. In fact, in all of our businesses. But we've always said that quarter by quarter, we could see some shaky quarters as markets response to certain conditions."

I you talked about margins for the year and hope that you would really control things with hiring and other things if things got tough.

Well, let me make a few -- maybe make a few comments about Ratings and then one broader point just on the math of the margins for 2016. I think our -- maybe the caution -- the cautionary view we're taking on margin expansion is not really based on cost management. I think our track record over the last few years would demonstrate that we work on that one. It's really more on the revenue side, and particularly kind of given the issuance trends we're seeing right now on Ratings. And we know how to manage cost in that business. Just think about it, last year in 2015, we were actually able to expand margins with revenue down. That doesn't happen all too often. So from a longer-term point of view, we do think margin expansion is certainly possible with revenue growth and continued cost control within the Ratings business. I just do -- I just want to be clear, though, we are not targeting any magical outside goal here. We're just trying to manage our business in terms of what we think is right for the Ratings business. But just one overall point on the margins itself. We said 50 basis points, but you also have to kind of remember the math in terms of the addition of SNL this year. SNL is going to add to the portfolio about $200 million. It's coming in sort of around mid-20s margin. You just do the math. That's diluted to the overall company margins of about 50 basis points. So if you were just to kind of look at it like-for-like and exclude the impact of the SNL acquisition, our full year -- our margin guidance is really more in the range of a full point, which frankly is not that different from what we did in 2014. I think we're 150 basis points last year. So I think it's not as different as it may look at -- kind of looking -- when you really in factor in the math of the acquisition."

In addition, there's another very important global trend about financial institutions. They're all looking at the optimal capital structure, in addition to the new rules related to capital, and there's this TLAC, which is total loss absorbing capacity, which is basically senior bonds, which have a certain level subordination to other senior debt depositors that we expect that banks are going to be issuing. In general, we think that there will be increases in structured finance, increases in financial services and financial situations, likely decrease in overall corporate issuance globally, but probably a larger increase in non-investment-grade overall, especially at the spread levels which I mentioned earlier.

So I think what the -- as some of the -- that has allowed us to really kind of be more -- to get more into -- just the cost synergies that relates to the G&A structure of the business. And we started to kind of then look at it -- we started to combine each of the core functions. It's leading to an opportunity over time to make the business overall more efficient, also driven by the fact that we just have enhanced scale as we bring these businesses together. Just as a reminder, I mean, the SNL business system and the S&P Cap IQ business are pretty similar. It's designed some pretty similar products. That leverage a great deal of data, some of which is common to both systems, and leveraging technology. So we're pleased with some of the opportunity to step up the synergies on the cost side and also the timing in which to bring some into 2016. And we're even more encouraged from a longer-term part of view about our ability to build a more efficient and more effective organization for the long term."

We do see, as you know, as seen especially in November, December and January, a lot of volatility at the deeper end of the credit curve with spreads widening incredibly up into the over 1,200 basis points for spread on the CCC, CC level. So we do see that spreads widened out. They're likely at some point to come back in.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to provide you with an update on how we've positioned McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. And let me begin with an overview",2509,"Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to provide you with an update on how we've positioned McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. 
And let me begin with an overview of 2015. Revenue increased 5% year-on-year with organic revenue increasing 3%. Adjusted total expenses increased 1%, adjusted operating profit increased 13%, adjusted operating margin increased 280 basis points and diluted adjusted EPS increased 17%. 
Margin improvement was a big story for the year. Our cost-reduction efforts and revenue growth combined for a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin for the second year in a row. Every business delivered at least 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Year-over-year, our revenue increased $262 million. 90% of this was pulled through to adjusted operating profit. I'm proud of this accomplishment as it is a testament to how well our employees controlled costs during the year. This cost efficiency was the main reason we were able to leverage our revenue growth into 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth. 
As we look at the company's financial performance over the last 4 years, the company has delivered consistent improvements in revenue, margin and EPS. Revenue from continuing operations has grown at a 9% compounded annual growth rate. Our adjusted margins have improved 960 basis points from 29.1% to 38.7%. And we've achieved global -- compounded annual growth rate in adjusted annual diluted earnings per share of 22%. 
In addition to delivering another year of strong financial performance, we continued to strengthen our franchises during 2015. The most important transaction of the year was the addition of SNL. We increasingly believe that the combination of SNL with S&P Capital IQ presents a compelling opportunity to create a powerful data and analytics business. In addition, we acquired Petromedia, strengthening Platts' existing position in the bunker market; launched Platts Market Data Direct, a new service that delivers Platts' price assessments, historical and other reference data in a matter of seconds; positioned Capital IQ as a core content provider to Symphony Communication Services so that its customers can seamlessly access S&P Capital IQ company data; launched a suite of new fixed income indices, anchored by our flagship S&P 500 Bond Index, the first-ever index that tracks the debt of the S&P 500 companies and the first priced in real-time throughout the day; and we entered into new and expanded exchange agreements in New Zealand, Mexico and Brazil. 
Beyond strengthening our businesses, there were a number of other key accomplishments in 2015. We consolidated the company headquarters into downtown New York, a move that brought corporate employees much closer to our operations; generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow, excluding legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries; returned $1.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends; successfully issued debt into the market after an 8-year absence; continued to make investments in compliance and risk management; and last week, increased the dividend by 9%, marking the 43rd consecutive year we increased. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results where the company finished 2015 with solid earnings in a difficult debt-issuance environment. Revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue, however, only grew 1% as a result of revenue declines in S&P Ratings Services. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%, and fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 9%. The strength of our portfolio is evident in the fourth quarter as weak issuance at Ratings was offset by solid revenue growth across the rest of the portfolio. This portfolio strength, coupled with progress on productivity initiatives, enabled the company to deliver 9% adjusted diluted EPS. 
Now let me turn to the individual businesses, and I'll start with S&P Capital IQ and SNL. In 2015, reported revenue increased 14% with organic growth excluding revenue from SNL acquisition increasing 7%, adjusted segment operating profit increased 25% and adjusted margin increased 200 basis points. With integration teams in place and synergy opportunities identified, we expect to deliver considerable adjusted margin improvements in this segment over the next few years. Jack will provide more details in a few minutes. 
In the fourth quarter, reported revenue increased 27%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 22% in the fourth quarter, and adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points. This margin decline was due to deal-related amortization. Excluding that amortization, fourth quarter margin actually increased 200 basis points from 21.3% in fourth quarter 2014 to 23.3% in 2015. 
Let me add a bit more color on fourth quarter revenue growth in the business lines. S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 9%, principally through a low teens increase in Desktop revenue. SNL revenue increased 10% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, 2015 revenue was reduced by deferred revenue adjustment required under purchase accounting. Excluding this adjustment, revenue growth was 14%. 
Global Risk Services revenue increased 5%, led by RatingsXpress, which is increasingly used by customers to meet their regulatory reporting needs. 
In the smallest category, S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence revenue increased 4% overall with growth in Global Markets Intelligence and Leveraged Commentary & Data exceeding declines in Equity Research Services. 
Let me turn to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. In 2015, revenue declined 1%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue for the year increased 3%. Adjusted operating profit grew 7%. And the adjusted operating margin increased 340 basis points to 47.2%, a noteworthy achievement. 
During the quarter, revenues decreased 7%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue decreased 4%. Adjusted operating profit decreased 3%. And adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 43.7%. 
While decreased expenses in the fourth quarter led to margin expansion, the big story during the quarter was weak global issuance. Nontransaction revenue in the quarter was flat. However, excluding ForEx, it increased 4% due to strength in CRISIL and in Rating Evaluation Service revenue from elevated M&A activity. This was partially offset by the lower revenue associated with fewer new customers that were added in the fourth quarter. Transaction weakness was caused by a 26% decline in global issuance, partially offset by growth in bank loan ratings. Excluding ForEx, transaction revenue decreased 13%. 
Let's take a look at issuance. The 2 largest markets, the U.S. and Europe, both declined capping a weak second half of the year for issuance. Fourth quarter issuance in the U.S. was down across-the-board. Investment grade decreased 17%; high yields, 41%; public finance was down 21%; and structured finance also declined 26% with the only bright spot being RMBS. In Europe, investment grade decreased 15%; high yield, down 10%; and structured finance increased 11% with declines in every asset class offset by growth in covered bonds. The rest of the world had even weaker issuance with Asia declining 47% and the Americas outside the U.S. declining 46%. In total, global bond issuance declined 26%, outpacing the 20% decline in the third quarter. 
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2015, this business delivered an 8% increase in revenue, a 12% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 200 basis point of adjusted margin improvement to 65.6%. Fourth quarter results were similar with a 7% increase in revenue, a 9% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 100 basis point of adjusted margin improvement. During the quarter, there was a modest decline in revenue from ETFs, offset by revenue from exchange-traded derivatives, mutual funds, OTC derivatives and data licenses. 
If we turn to the key business drivers. The ETF industry surpassed 2014 record inflows, setting a new record of $351 billion in 2015, a great trend. AUM based on our indices increased 9% sequentially from third quarter '15 to $815 billion, but below peak levels at the end of 2014. During the quarter, we continued to innovate, launching 233 new indices and 26 new ETFs based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Exchange-traded derivatives revenue growth was primarily driven by increased revenues from CME, partially offset by a decrease in exchange-traded derivative volumes based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. As you know, S&P Dow Jones Indices is impacted by fluctuating markets, but continued inflows into passive investing, innovative new indices and efforts to partner with exchanges around the world bodes well for the long-term positioning of this business. 
On to commodities and commercial markets. The Eclipse, NADA Used Car Guide and Petromedia acquisitions impacted revenue comparisons in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Adjusting for these items, organic revenue increased 6% in 2015. Adjusted operating profit increased 17%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 260 basis points to 36.9%. 
In the fourth quarter, organic revenue increased 8%, adjusted operating profit increased 20% and adjusted operating margin increased 240 basis points. Both Platts and J.D. Power delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth. J.D. revenue powers -- J.D. Power revenue was powered by its auto business with particular strength in its PIN product. The evaluation of strategic alternatives for J.D. Power continues with considerable interest from third parties. 
Many of our upstream petroleum, natural gas and mining customers are pressured by low commodity prices and this has impacted the revenue growth of the Platts business. Nevertheless, Platts delivered high single-digit revenue growth in this challenging environment. Organic revenue from the core subscription business grew with both Petroleum and Metals, Ag & Petrochemicals revenue increasing high single digits. Global Trading Services revenue increased double-digit, primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from The Steel Index derivative activity. 
In summary. The company delivered solid revenue growth in a difficult market environment. More importantly, progress on our productivity initiatives was apparent with outstanding margin expansion delivered by every business in 2015. For the second year in a row, the company delivered adjusted operating margin improvement of 280 basis points. This accomplishment was the primary driver of the 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year. 
Now let me discuss the outlook for 2016 and I'd like to start with some thoughts from our economists. Major central banks moves in December may have disappointed or unnerved markets with the Fed Reserve raising rates and decisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan that appeared to disappoint or alarm the markets. However, monetary policy continues to provide a tailwind to economic expansion. Recent stock market volatility probably overstates the likelihood of a slump in global growth this year. These market moves appear to be more sentiment than data-driven with the exception obviously the falling spot oil prices, which reflects changing supply fundamentals. In the 6.5 years or so since the global economy started to recover from the financial crisis, it has grown in real terms at an average of about 3.5% annually. S&P economists expect that trend to continue with a 3.6% global growth in 2016. Our economists expect real growth in China to continue to trend downward, but to end up at 6.3% this year after growing by 6.9% in 2015. Growth in most of the developed world and even much of the developing world stands to be a bit higher this year than last, which adds up to a decent outcome for global growth. Excessive pessimism is not -- is probably not warranted. 
With this economic backdrop, we expect global debt shifts to decline 1% in 2016 and for spreads to widen. Within the U.S., we expect speculative-grade corporate issuers to see increasing borrowing costs in the coming quarters at the back of the fed interest rate increase while most higher-rated corporate entities should continue to have a favorable lending environment as investors pursue moderate yields while remaining more risk-averse. More favorable lending conditions in Europe, supported by continued monetary accommodation by the ECB, should result in increased bond and loan issuance in 2016. The central banks' recent measures combined with the softening in the regulatory stance may also bode well for higher issuance of securitized products with modest increases in borrowing from the public finance sector. 
Among the emerging markets, most regions are experiencing substantial stress from falling commodity prices, exchange-rated pressures from rising dollar, tighter lending conditions and a rising share of nonperforming loans. Two of the largest economies, Brazil and China, have been experiencing significant headwinds this year and their market volatility is unlikely to subside in the near term. 
Now turning from macro factors to those items inside the company that we control. There are several areas of focus in 2016. Our revenue guidance for 2016 is from mid- to high single-digit growth. While tepid issuance limits S&P Ratings Services growth, we'll benefit from 8 additional months of SNL in 2016. Beginning in 2016, we will report our financial results using a newly defined adjusted diluted EPS that excludes deal-related amortization that Jack will discuss in a moment. Incorporating this change, our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance is a range of $5 to $5.15. In 2016, we expect to generate considerable free cash flow and our guidance is for approximately $1.3 billion. Please note that this cash flow guidance doesn't include the proceeds from the potential sale of J.D. Power. We're actively pursuing the sale of this business and have received considerable interests from a number of parties. 
The top operational priorities within the corporation will be the integration of S&P Capital IQ and SNL. 10 work streams are in place, and now that we have an inside look at SNL and the collective knowledge from both businesses, additional synergies have been identified. We have a goal to transform Global Risk Services into a market leader. We have risk capabilities within S&P Ratings Services, S&P Capital IQ and SNL and CRISIL that we brought to bear to create new credit products and services. 
I've challenged the organization to continue to expand our international footprint through better customer focus as well as collaboration across the company. And I've also challenged the company to deliver additional process improvements. From automating elements of the ratings process to improving data collection, there's ample opportunity to drive performance with process improvements and reengineering. 
We'll also continue to invest in compliance and risk management as well as firm-wide technology and data road map. Technology is at the heart of each business and we need to evolve our technology in a thoughtful and coordinated manner. 
And now I'd like to conclude with some big news. The Board of Directors has proposed renaming the company, S&P Global. This name better leverages the company's rich heritage and our powerful financial data and analytics brand while signaling that we have a strong global footprint and broad portfolio. The change will be effective pending a shareholder vote on April 27. In addition to changing the name of the company, we'll also be changing the names of some of our divisions. For example, S&P Capital IQ and SNL will be renamed S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. And now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer."

As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity",1957,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity around several items that impact our financial performance, and then we will open up the call for your questions. 
First, I will recap key financial results. As part of the review, I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization and discuss our new approach to key performance metrics. I will also review the impact from adjustments to earnings and update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. After that, I will provide updates on our productivity initiatives and SNL integration. And finally, I will provide 2016 guidance. 
Let's start with the consolidated fourth quarter income statement. As Doug already commented on these items, there are just a couple items I want to highlight. First, reported revenue grew 7%, benefiting in part from the first full quarter of SNL contribution. On a constant-currency basis, organic revenue grew 3%. Delivering overall top line growth was thanks to the strength and breadth of our portfolio as revenue from our largest business, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, was lower than last year due to the impact of weak global debt issuance. 
Second, expenses and margins were impacted by the step-up in deal-related amortization. I will discuss this item in more detail in just a moment. 
Third, the tax rate was considerably lower than a year ago largely due to improved profitability in several lower-tax jurisdictions outside the United States and favorable tax benefits from the ongoing resolution of prior year tax audits. 
Turning now to the full year. Both reported revenue and organic revenue on a constant-currency basis increased 5%. This was consistent with our guidance of mid-single-digit growth. The most impressive result is that total adjusted expenses increased only 1%. This is a direct result of the tangible progress on our 3-year cost-reduction plan, which I will discuss in a moment. As a result of cost productivity and a solid revenue growth, adjusted operating margin increased 280 points to 38.7%. The tax rate for the full year on an adjusted basis was 30.5%. As I just mentioned, this was due to improved profitability in lower-cost jurisdictions and the ongoing favorable outcomes from the resolution of certain prior year tax audits. And finally, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% and 17%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.53 is a couple of pennies ahead of our latest guidance. The average adjusted diluted shares outstanding decreased by over 1 million shares versus a year ago. The full impact of the 10 million shares that we repurchased during 2015 will be more evident in the 2016 share count. 
Now I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization. As a result of the SNL acquisition, the company's deal-related amortization expense has increased significantly. It will be approximately $98 million in 2016, just over half of which is related to the SNL acquisition. In the top section of the slide, you can see that we reported a fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating margin of 24.8% (sic) [ 34.8% ] as deal-related amortization more than doubled. On the other hand, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating profit margins of 36.8%. The difference is not as pronounced on the full year results, which includes only 4 months of SNL-deal-related amortization expense. Here, the reported 2015 adjusted operating margin is 38.7%. However, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported 2015 adjusted operating profit margin of 39.9%. 
On this slide, we lay out the earnings per share impact of deal-related amortization expense on the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, there is an $0.08 per share difference between the reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.04 and the adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding deal-related amortization of $1.12. For the full year of 2015, the difference is $0.16. Now going forward, beginning in 2016, we will be excluding this deal-related amortization from our non-GAAP results. We think that this will enable investors to view our results in the same manner as management. In today's earnings release, we have provided the impact of this change to 2015 adjusted earnings by quarter so you can adjust your models accordingly. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. In total, pretax adjustments to earnings from continuing operations totaled $54 million in the quarter. This consisted of $33 million of restructuring charges in S&P Capital IQ and SNL, corporate and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. There was $15 million in accruals for potential legal settlements and $6 million for acquisition-related costs associated with the SNL transaction. As you have seen in the past, these restructuring actions are targeted to produce tangible cost reductions. The majority of the actions were taken in S&P Capital IQ and SNL as this division begins the realization of its cost synergy plans. I'll provide an update on these synergies in just a moment. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of the end of 2015, we had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $143 million of short-term debt in commercial paper. Going forward, we intend to tap into the short-term debt markets periodically to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. 
Our full year free cash flow was a negative $48 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, year-to-date free cash flow was a positive $1.2 billion. This is consistent with our guidance of greater than $1.1 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company stepped up its share repurchase program and bought approximately 5 million shares, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 10 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, totaled to approximately $1.3 billion of cash returned to shareholders in 2015. This overall return of capital is in line with the past several years. Overall, we have returned approximately $6.4 billion over the last 5 years. The share repurchase program remains an important component of our overall capital allocation and we anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, subject to market conditions. 
As most of you know, we initiated a 3-year productivity program that will conclude by the end of 2016. The target was initially $100 million when introduced in early 2014 and was increased to $140 million last year. As of the end of 2015, approximately 80% of that productivity target has been realized. Our progress is clearly evident in the margin progress that we have delivered over the past 2 years. We currently expect to complete these initiatives and deliver on the full $140 million target by the end of this year. 
Now let me provide an update on the integration of SNL. This was the first full quarter of our ownership of SNL, and given its importance, the integration has become a primary area of focus for the company. It is imperative that we combine S&P Capital IQ and SNL rapidly to capture synergies while minimizing disruption to the business, and most importantly, our customers. As Doug mentioned, 10 integration work streams are in place and efforts are well underway. We have a centralized integration management office that provides detailed tracking by initiative, identification of key issues and monitoring of these synergies. Both Doug and I work closely with Mike Chinn and his team to help ensure that these efforts receive the appropriate priority and support across the company. More importantly for investors, we are now on track to exceed the initial $70 million synergy target ahead of our original time line. 
When we announced the acquisition of SNL, we cited a target of $70 million of run rate EBITDA synergies by 2019. This was an estimate we arrived at by looking at SNL from the outside in. We now have had the opportunity to work directly with the new leadership team to consider what can be accomplished as we build and integrate S&P Capital IQ and SNL organizations. With this more informed inside look, we are now targeting $100 million of synergies by 2019. This increase is almost entirely cost-related as we now expect about $70 million of cost synergies by 2018 and the balance revenue-related. Furthermore, we expect that more than 1/3 of the synergies will be realized in 2016. Taken in total, these synergies, the sustained growth across both legacy businesses and the positive 8-month overlap on the acquisition should generate approximately 20% revenue growth in 2016 with profits, excluding the impact of deal-related amortization, growing twice as fast. 
Let me provide some additional guidance going into 2016. Overall, the strength and breadth of our portfolio better positions us to weather the volatility that we have experienced over the last couple of quarters, which has intensified a bit since the start of 2016. The promising outlook for S&P Capital IQ and SNL and continued growth at Platts supports our current assumption of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth despite the weak start in debt issuance in the overall capital markets. 
We anticipate maintaining the approximately 31% effective tax rate, generally in line with 2015. 
As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted earnings per share guidance will exclude the impact of deal-related amortization. On this basis, we are introducing adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.15, 7% to 10% growth off our 2015 adjusted earnings per share once the impact of deal-related amortization is excluded from both years. 
Despite the strong adjusted margin expansion expected at S&P Capital IQ and SNL, we are a bit cautious about further consolidated margin expansion in 2016. This caution is primarily based on the challenging market conditions, which may impact revenue growth in our 2 highest-margin business units, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and S&P Dow Jones Indices. And as a reminder, we have already made great progress on margins with the realization thus far of the $140 million productivity target. As a result, we would currently point to an overall margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, above the 39.9% adjusted operating margin excluding deal-related amortization in 2015. 
Capital investment is expected to be largely flat, in line with 2015. 
On return of capital. Last week, the company announced a 9% increase in our annual dividend to $1.44 per share. Our guidance considers continued share repurchases, although the timing can be impacted by market conditions. 
One clarification. This guidance assumes the inclusion of J.D. Power for the full year. As you can see in today's release, we have moved J.D. Power to an asset held for sale. As such, J.D. Power's results will be included until its sale is closed. Upon close, we currently anticipate using cash proceeds to repurchase shares and offset dilution. At that time, we will update you on any impact to our current outlook. 
Finally, we anticipate 2016 free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion, which excludes any additional impact from asset sales. 
In summary. We look for another year of growth in 2016. The strength of our portfolio, now augmented with SNL, positions us well to manage through these volatile market conditions. 
Now let me turn the call over to Chip Merritt to open it up for your questions."

More specifically, for Ratings, we do have, as Doug mentioned, the issuance outlook down a bit, down 1%. With that down volume, but maybe a bit of pricing, we would like to see some revenue growth in that business. However, I do suspect that may be a bit more weighted to the back half of the year, just kind of given the issuance trends that we've seen in the fourth quarter that now appear to be continuing as we go into the first."

In terms of issuance, let me just give a few of the statistics from what we saw in the fourth quarter and a couple of the general trends. Clearly, as we reported, there was a large decrease in total corporate and governance. It decreased 29.3% in the fourth quarter. And there were some of the different categories, for instance, in Latin America, it was down 60%, 68% overall. In January, we saw a continuation of that trend. The total corporate governance issuance, down about 26%. Financial institutions were down about 56%. But we put together our forecast, which you saw on Slide 26, which shows about a 1% decrease in 2016. We put that together with the combination of looking at the markets, what we expect to see from market issuance, scanning the market with investment banks and corporate banks, et cetera. We also look at the -- what is the maturity profile of debt that's already on balance sheets that's coming due. So we looked -- do this forecast looking historically as well, what we see -- or the trends. If you look at that chart, you can see that 2014 was a peak year at $6 trillion of total issuance. And there's been a level, almost every year, 2012, '13, '15, a little bit over the $5 trillion level. The mix changes here and there, but we still believe that there would be somewhere in that range. It's just as Jack mentioned, it might be more in the second half of the year. There's another part of the markets, which you didn't ask a question, but I just want to mention as well, which is very important, which has to do with spreads. Spreads have recently widened significantly, especially in the lower end of the credit spread. CCC-type credits, obviously more distressed credits and below, have increased by over 400 basis points there to 12%, 25% [ph] spread range, whereas the AAA, AA level is still around the 100, 110 basis points. It barely budged over the year. In fact, as you've seen, U.S. treasuries have tightened. So the spread issue, where we see spreads going, it's -- there's a lot of volatility right now. We think that also plays into it, people's appetite for going out. It's not really related to the base rate. It's related to the spread. Anyway, long answer to your question, we are prepared in the business if necessary to manage our costs tightly through things like delaying hiring, looking at our bonus accruals as well as other investments that we might be making in things like technology and systems, et cetera. So we have certain flexibility we can build into our plan if we need to go through what could be a tough period. And one final comment. As you've heard me say many times in the past, we have a long-term optimism in this business, in fact, in all of our businesses. But we've always said that quarter by quarter, we could see some shaky quarters as markets respond to certain conditions."

[ph] Let me make a few -- maybe make a few comments about Ratings and then one broader point just on the math of the margins for 2016. I think our -- maybe the caution view -- the cautionary view we're taking on margin expansion is not really based on cost management. I think our track record over the last few years would demonstrate that we're on that one. It's really more on the revenue side and particularly kind of given the issuance trends that we're seeing right now on Ratings. And we know how to manage cost in that business. Just to think about it, last year in 2015, we were actually able to expand margins with revenue down. That doesn't happen all too often. So from a longer-term point of view, we do think margin expansion is certainly possible with revenue growth and continued cost control within the Ratings business. I just do -- I just want to be clear, though, we are not targeting any magical outside goal here. We're just trying to manage our business in terms of what we think is right for the Ratings business. But just one overall point on the margins itself. We said 50 basis points, but you also have to kind of remember the math in terms of the addition of SNL this year. SNL is going to add to the portfolio about $200 million. It's coming in sort of around mid-20s margin. You just do the math. That's diluted to the overall company margins of about 50 basis points. So if you were just to kind of look at like-for-like and exclude the impact of the SNL acquisition, our full year -- our margin guidance is really more in the range of 1 full point, which frankly is not that different than what we did in 2014. We -- I think we're 150 basis points last year. So I think it's not as different as it may look -- kind of looking -- when you really do factor in the math of the acquisition."

They want to have a more capital markets. There's also -- the EU has what they call the Capital Markets Union. And one of the things they want to do is have more credit flow to SMEs and small financial institutions. So they think that the structured finance market is one of those. We agree that, that is going to be a slight growth area in 2016. In addition, there's another very important global trend about financial institutions. They're all looking at the optimal capital structure, in addition to the new rules related to capital. And there's this TLAC, which is total loss absorbing capacity, which is basically senior bonds which have a certain level of subordination to other senior debt depositors that we expect that banks are going to be issuing. So in general, we think that there will be increases in structured finance, increases in financial services and financial situations, likely decrease in overall corporate issuance globally, but probably a larger increase in noninvestment grade overall, especially at the spread levels which I mentioned earlier.

We did a scan of best practices, and our board decided that we should adopt what we call the 3-3-20-20 rule, which means 20 investors -- up to 20 investors that own up to -- that own 3% of the shares or more for at least 3 years would be allowed to elect or to -- not elect, but to propose up to 2 or up to 20% of the board directors in a proxy. So we felt it was a good practice and something that is becoming consistent in good governance across the corporates in the United States and we decided to adopt that."

And we started to kind of then look at it -- we started to combine each of the core functions. It's leading to an opportunity over time to make the business overall more efficient, also driven by the fact that we just have enhanced scale as we bring these businesses together. Just as a reminder, I mean, the SNL business system and the S&P Cap IQ business is similar -- are pretty similar. It's designed some pretty similar products. That leveraged a great deal of data, some of which is common to both systems and leveraging some common technology. So we're pleased with some of the opportunity to step up the synergies on the cost side and also the timing in which to bring some into 2016. But we're -- and we're even more encouraged, from a longer-term point of view, about our ability to build a more efficient and more effective organization for the long term."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to provide you with an update on how we've positioned McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. And let me begin with an overview",2512,"Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to provide you with an update on how we've positioned McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. 
And let me begin with an overview of 2015. Revenue increased 5% year-on-year with organic revenue increasing 3%. Adjusted total expenses increased 1%, adjusted operating profit increased 13%, adjusted operating margin increased 280 basis points and diluted adjusted EPS increased 17%. 
Margin improvement was a big story for the year. Our cost-reduction efforts and revenue growth combined for a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin for the second year in a row. Every business delivered at least 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Year-over-year, our revenue increased $262 million. 90% of this was pulled through to adjusted operating profit. I'm proud of this accomplishment as it is testament to how well our employees controlled costs during the year. This cost efficiency was the main reason we were able to leverage our revenue growth into 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth. 
As we look at the company's financial performance over the last 4 years, the company has delivered consistent improvements in revenue, margin and EPS. Revenue from continuing operations has grown at a 9% compounded annual growth rate. Our adjusted margins have improved 960 basis points from 29.1% to 38.7%. And we've achieved a global -- a compounded annual growth rate in adjusted annual diluted earnings per share of 22%. 
In addition to delivering another year of strong financial performance, we continued to strengthen our franchises during 2015. The most important transaction of the year was the addition of SNL. We increasingly believe that the combination of SNL with S&P Capital IQ presents a compelling opportunity to create a powerful data and analytics business. In addition, we acquired Petromedia, strengthening Platts' existing position in the bunker market; launched Platts Market Data Direct, a new service that delivers Platts' price assessments, historical and other reference data in a matter of seconds; positioned Capital IQ as a core content provider to Symphony Communication Services so that its customers can seamlessly access S&P Capital IQ company data; launched a suite of new fixed income indices, anchored by our flagship S&P 500 Bond Index, the first-ever index that tracks the debt of the S&P 500 companies and the first priced in real-time throughout the day; and we entered into new or expanded exchange agreements in New Zealand, Mexico and Brazil. 
Beyond strengthening our businesses, there were a number of other key accomplishments in 2015. We consolidated the company headquarters into downtown New York, a move that brought corporate employees much closer to our operations; generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow, excluding legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries; returned $1.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends; successfully issued debt into the market after an 8-year absence; continued to make investments in compliance and risk management; and last week, increased the dividend by 9%, marking the 43rd consecutive yearly increase. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results where the company finished 2015 with solid earnings in a difficult debt-issuance environment. Revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue, however, only grew 1% as a result of revenue declines in S&P Ratings Services. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%, and fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 9%. The strength of our portfolio is evident in the fourth quarter as weak issuance at Ratings was offset by solid revenue growth across the rest of the portfolio. This portfolio strength, coupled with progress on productivity initiatives, enabled the company to deliver 9% adjusted diluted EPS. 
Now let me turn to the individual businesses, and I'll start with S&P Capital IQ and SNL. In 2015, reported revenue increased 14% with organic growth excluding revenue from SNL acquisition increasing 7%, adjusted segment operating profit increased 25% and the adjusted margin increased 200 basis points. With integration teams in place and synergy opportunities identified, we expect to deliver considerable adjusted margin improvements in this segment over the next few years. Jack will provide more details in a few minutes. 
In the fourth quarter, reported revenue increased 27%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 22% in the fourth quarter, and the adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points. This margin decline was due to deal-related amortization. Excluding that amortization, fourth quarter margin actually increased 200 basis points from 21.3% in fourth quarter 2014 to 23.3% in 2015. 
Let me add a bit more color on fourth quarter revenue growth in the business lines. S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 9%, principally through a low teens increase in Desktop revenue. SNL revenue increased 10% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, 2015 revenue was reduced by deferred revenue adjustments required under purchase accounting. Excluding this adjustment, revenue growth was 14%. 
Global Risk Services revenue increased 5%, led by RatingsXpress, which is increasingly used by customers to meet their regulatory reporting needs. 
In the smallest category, S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence revenue increased 4% overall with growth in Global Markets Intelligence and Leveraged Commentary & Data exceeding declines in Equity Research Services. 
Let me turn to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. In 2015, revenue declined 1%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue for the year increased 3%. Adjusted operating profit grew 7%. And the adjusted operating margin increased 340 basis points to 47.2%, a noteworthy achievement. 
During the quarter, revenue decreased 7%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue decreased 4%. Adjusted operating profit decreased 3%. And adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 43.7%. 
While decreased expenses in the fourth quarter led to margin expansion, the big story during the quarter was weak global issuance. Nontransaction revenue in the quarter was flat. However, excluding ForEx, it increased 4% due to strength in CRISIL and in Rating Evaluation Service revenue from elevated M&A activity. This was partially offset by the lower revenue associated with fewer new customers that were added in the fourth quarter. Transaction weakness was caused by a 26% decline in global issuance, partially offset by growth in bank loan ratings. Excluding ForEx, transaction revenue decreased 13%. 
Let's take a look at issuance. The 2 largest markets, the U.S. and Europe, both declined capping a weak second half of the year for issuance. Fourth quarter issuance in the U.S. was down across-the-board. Investment grade decreased 17%; high yields, 41%; public finance was down 21%; and structured finance also declined 26% with the only bright spot being RMBS. In Europe, investment grade decreased 15%; high yield, down 10%; and structured finance increased 11% with declines in every asset class offset by growth in covered bonds. The rest of the world had even weaker issuance with Asia declining 47% and the Americas outside the U.S. declining 46%. In total, global bond issuance declined 26%, outpacing the 20% decline in the third quarter. 
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2015, this business delivered an 8% increase in revenue, a 12% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 200 basis point of adjusted margin improvement to 65.6%. Fourth quarter results were similar with a 7% increase in revenue, a 9% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 100 basis point of adjusted margin improvement. During the quarter, there was a modest decline in revenue from ETFs, offset by revenue from exchange-traded derivatives, mutual funds, OTC derivatives and data licenses. 
If we turn to the key business drivers. The ETF industry surpassed 2014 record inflows, setting a new record of $351 billion in 2015, a great trend. AUM based on our indices increased 9% sequentially from third quarter '15 to $815 billion, but below peak levels at the end of 2014. During the quarter, we continued to innovate, launching 233 new indices and 26 new ETFs based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Exchange-traded derivatives revenue growth was primarily driven by increased revenues from CME, partially offset by a decrease in exchange-traded derivative volumes based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. As you know, S&P Dow Jones Indices is impacted by fluctuating markets, but continued inflows into passive investing, innovative new indices and efforts to partner with exchanges around the world bodes well for the long-term positioning of this business. 
On to commodities and commercial markets. The Eclipse, NADA Used Car Guide and Petromedia acquisitions impacted revenue comparisons in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Adjusting for these items, organic revenue increased 6% in 2015. Adjusted operating profit increased 17%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 260 basis points to 36.9%. 
In the fourth quarter, organic revenue increased 8%, adjusted operating profit increased 20% and adjusted operating margin increased 240 basis points. Both Platts and J.D. Power delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth. J.D. revenue powers -- J.D. Power revenue was powered by its auto business with particular strength in its PIN product. The evaluation of strategic alternatives for J.D. Power continues with considerable interest from third parties. 
Many of our upstream petroleum, natural gas and mining customers are pressured by low commodity prices and this has impacted the revenue growth of the Platts business. Nevertheless, Platts delivered high single-digit revenue growth in this challenging environment. Organic revenue from the core subscription business grew with both Petroleum and Metals, Ag and Petrochemicals revenue increasing high single digits. Global Trading Services revenue increased double-digit, primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from The Steel Index derivative activity. 
In summary. The company delivered solid revenue growth in a difficult market environment. More importantly, progress on our productivity initiatives was apparent with outstanding margin expansion delivered by every business in 2015. For the second year in a row, the company delivered adjusted operating margin improvement of 280 basis points. This accomplishment was the primary driver of the 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year. 
Now let me discuss the outlook for 2016 and I'd like to start with some thoughts from our economists. Major central banks moves in December may have disappointed or unnerved markets with the Federal Reserve raising rates and decisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan that appeared to disappoint or alarm the markets. However, monetary policy continues to provide a tailwind to economic expansion. Recent stock market volatility probably overstates the likelihood of a slump in global growth this year. These market moves appear to be more sentiment than data-driven with the exception obviously the falling spot oil prices, which reflects changing supply fundamentals. In the 6.5 years or so since the global economy started to recover from the financial crisis, it has grown in real terms at an average of about 3.5% annually. S&P economists expect that trend to continue with a 3.6% global growth in 2016. Our economists expect real growth in China to continue to trend downward, but to end up at 6.3% this year after growing by 6.9% in 2015. Growth in most of the developed world and even much of the developing world stands to be a bit higher this year than last, which adds up to a decent outcome for global growth. Excessive pessimism is not -- is probably not warranted. 
With this economic backdrop, we expect global debt issuance to decline 1% in 2016 and for spreads to widen. Within the U.S., we expect speculative-grade corporate issuers to see increasing borrowing costs in the coming quarters at the back of the Fed interest rate increase while most higher-rated corporate entities should continue to have a favorable lending environment as investors pursue moderate yields while remaining more risk-averse. More favorable lending conditions in Europe, supported by continued monetary accommodation by the ECB, should result in increased bond and loan issuance in 2016. The central banks' recent measures combined with the softening in the regulatory stance may also bode well for higher issuance of securitized products with modest increases in borrowing from the public finance sector. 
Among the emerging markets, most regions are experiencing substantial stress from falling commodity prices, exchange-rated pressures from a rising dollar, tighter lending conditions and a rising share of nonperforming loans. Two of the largest economies, Brazil and China, have been experiencing significant headwinds this year and their market volatility is unlikely to subside in the near term. 
Now turning from macro factors to those items inside the company that we control. There are several areas of focus in 2016. Our revenue guidance for 2016 is from mid- to high single-digit growth. While tepid issuance limits S&P Ratings Services growth, we'll benefit from 8 additional months of SNL in 2016. Beginning in 2016, we will report our financial results using a newly defined adjusted diluted EPS that excludes deal-related amortization that Jack will discuss in a moment. Incorporating this change, our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance is a range of $5 to $5.15. In 2016, we expect to generate considerable free cash flow and our guidance is for approximately $1.3 billion. Please note that this cash flow guidance doesn't include the proceeds from the potential sale of J.D. Power. We're actively pursuing the sale of this business and have received considerable interest from a number of parties. 
The top operational priority in the corporation will be the integration of S&P Capital IQ and SNL. Ten work streams are in place, and now that we have an inside look at SNL and the collective knowledge from both businesses, additional synergies have been identified. We have a goal to transform Global Risk Services into a market leader. We have risk capabilities within S&P Ratings Services, S&P Capital IQ and SNL and CRISIL that we brought to bear to create new credit products and services. 
I've challenged the organization to continue to expand our international footprint through better customer focus as well as collaboration across the company. And I've also challenged the company to deliver additional process improvements. From automating elements of the ratings process to improving data collection, there's ample opportunity to drive performance with process improvements and reengineering. 
We'll also continue to invest in compliance and risk management as well as firm-wide technology and data road map. Technology is at the heart of each business and we need to evolve our technology in a thoughtful and coordinated manner. 
And now I'd like to conclude with some big news. The Board of Directors has proposed renaming the company, S&P Global. This name better leverages the company's rich heritage and our powerful financial data and analytics brands while signaling that we have a strong global footprint and broad portfolio. The change will be effective pending a shareholder vote on April 27. In addition to changing the name of the company, we'll also be changing the names of some of our divisions. For example, S&P Capital IQ and SNL will be renamed S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call the morning. And now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer."

As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity",1961,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity around several items that impact our financial performance, and then we will open up the call for your questions. 
First, I will recap key financial results. As part of the review, I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization and discuss our new approach to key performance metrics. I will also review the impact from adjustments to earnings and update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. After that, I will provide updates on our productivity initiatives and SNL integration. And finally, I will provide 2016 guidance. 
Let's start with the consolidated fourth quarter income statement. As Doug already commented on these items, there are just a couple items I want to highlight. First, reported revenue grew 7%, benefiting in part from the first full quarter of SNL contribution. On a constant-currency basis, organic revenue grew 3%. Delivering overall top line growth was thanks to the strength and breadth of our portfolio as revenue from our largest business, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, was lower than last year due to the impact of weak global debt issuance. 
Second, expenses and margins were impacted by the step-up in deal-related amortization. I will discuss this item in more detail in just a moment. 
Third, the tax rate was considerably lower than a year ago largely due to improved profitability in several lower-tax jurisdictions outside the United States and favorable tax benefits from the ongoing resolution of prior year tax audits. 
Turning now to the full year. Both reported revenue and organic revenue on a constant currency basis increased 5%. This was consistent with our guidance of mid-single digit growth. The most impressive result is that total adjusted expenses increased only 1%. This is a direct result of the tangible progress on our 3-year cost reduction plan, which I will discuss in a moment. As a result of cost productivity and a solid revenue growth, adjusted operating margin increased 280 points to 38.7%. The tax rate for the full year on an adjusted basis was 30.5%. As I just mentioned, this was due to improved profitability in lower-cost jurisdictions and the ongoing favorable outcomes from the resolution of certain prior year tax audits. And finally, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% and 17%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.53 is a couple of pennies ahead of our latest guidance. The average adjusted diluted shares outstanding decreased by over 1 million shares versus a year ago. The full impact of the 10 million shares that we repurchased during 2015 will be more evident in the 2016 share count. 
Now I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization. As a result of the SNL acquisition, the company's deal-related amortization expense has increased significantly. It will be approximately $98 million in 2016, just over half of which is related to the SNL acquisition. In the top section of the slide, you can see that we reported a fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating margin of 24.8% (sic) [ 34.8% ] as deal-related amortization more than doubled. On the other hand, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating profit margins of 36.8%. The difference is not as pronounced on the full year results, which includes only 4 months of SNL deal-related amortization expense. Here, the reported 2015 adjusted operating margin is 38.7%. However, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported 2015 adjusted operating profit margin of 39.9%. 
On this slide, we lay out the earnings per share impact of deal-related amortization expense on the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, there is an $0.08 per share difference between the reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.04 and the adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding deal-related amortization of $1.12. For the full year of 2015, the difference is $0.16. Now going forward, beginning in 2016, we will be excluding this deal-related amortization from our non-GAAP results. We think that this will enable investors to view our results in the same manner as management. In today's earnings release, we have provided the impact of this change to 2015 adjusted earnings by quarter so you can adjust your models accordingly. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. In total, pretax adjustments to earnings from continuing operations totaled $54 million in the quarter. This consisted of $33 million of restructuring charges in S&P Capital IQ and SNL, Corporate and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. There was $15 million in accruals for potential legal settlements and $6 million for acquisition-related costs associated with the SNL transaction. As you have seen in the past, these restructuring actions are targeted to produce tangible cost reductions. The majority of the actions were taken in S&P Capital IQ and SNL as this division begins the realization of its cost synergy plans. I'll provide an update on these synergies in just a moment. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of the end of 2015, we had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $143 million of short-term debt in commercial paper. Going forward, we intend to tap into the short-term debt markets periodically to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. 
Our full year free cash flow was a negative $48 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, year-to-date free cash flow was a positive $1.2 billion. This is consistent with our guidance of greater than $1.1 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company stepped up its share repurchase program and bought approximately 5 million shares, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 10 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, totaled to approximately $1.3 billion of cash returned to shareholders in 2015. This overall return of capital is in line with the past several years. Overall, we have returned approximately $6.4 billion over the last 5 years. The share repurchase program remains an important component of our overall capital allocation and we anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, subject to market conditions. 
As most of you know, we initiated a 3-year productivity program that will conclude by the end of 2016. The target was initially $100 million when introduced in early 2014 and was increased to $140 million last year. As of the end of 2015, approximately 80% of that productivity target has been realized. Our progress is clearly evident in the margin progress that we have delivered over the past 2 years. We currently expect to complete these initiatives and deliver on the full $140 million target by the end of this year. 
Now let me provide an update on the integration of SNL. This was the first full quarter of our ownership of SNL, and given its importance, the integration has become a primary area of focus for the company. It is imperative that we combine S&P Capital IQ and SNL rapidly to capture synergies while minimizing disruption to the business, and most importantly, our customers. As Doug mentioned, 10 integration work streams are in place and efforts are well underway. We have a centralized integration management office that provides detailed tracking by initiative, identification of key issues and monitoring of these synergies. Both Doug and I work closely with Mike Chinn and his team to help ensure that these efforts receive the appropriate priority and support across the company. More importantly for investors, we are now on track to exceed the initial $70 million synergy target ahead of our original time line. 
When we announced the acquisition of SNL, we cited a target of $70 million of run rate EBITDA synergies by 2019. This was an estimate we arrived at by looking at SNL from the outside in. We now have had the opportunity to work directly with the new leadership team to consider what can be accomplished as we build and integrate S&P Capital IQ and SNL organizations. With this more informed inside look, we are now targeting $100 million of synergies by 2019. This increase is almost entirely cost-related as we now expect about $70 million of cost synergies by 2018 and the balance revenue-related. Furthermore, we expect that more than 1/3 of the synergies will be realized in 2016. Taken in total, these synergies, the sustained growth across both legacy businesses and the positive 8-month overlap on the acquisition should generate approximately 20% revenue growth in 2016 with profits, excluding the impact of deal-related amortization, growing twice as fast. 
Let me provide some additional guidance going into 2016. Overall, the strength and breadth of our portfolio better positions us to weather the volatility that we have experienced over the last couple of quarters, which has intensified a bit since the start of 2016. The promising outlook for S&P Capital IQ and SNL and continued growth at Platts supports our current assumption of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth despite the weak start in debt issuance in the overall capital markets. 
We anticipate maintaining the approximately 31% effective tax rate, generally in line with 2015. 
As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted earnings per share guidance will exclude the impact of deal-related amortization. On this basis, we are introducing adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.15, 7% to 10% growth off our 2015 adjusted earnings per share once the impact of deal-related amortization is excluded from both years. 
Despite the strong adjusted margin expansion expected at S&P Capital IQ and SNL, we are a bit cautious about further consolidated margin expansion in 2016. This caution is primarily based on the challenging market conditions, which may impact revenue growth in our 2 highest-margin business units, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and S&P Dow Jones Indices. And as a reminder, we have already made great progress on margins with the realization thus far of the $140 million productivity target. As a result, we would currently point to an overall margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, above the 39.9% adjusted operating margin excluding deal-related amortization in 2015. 
Capital investment is expected to be largely flat, in line with 2015. 
On return of capital. Last week, the company announced a 9% increase in our annual dividend to $1.44 per share. Our guidance considers continued share repurchases, although the timing can be impacted by market conditions. 
One clarification. This guidance assumes the inclusion of J.D. Power for the full year. As you can see in today's release, we have moved J.D. Power to an asset held for sale. As such, J.D. Power's results will be included until a sale is closed. Upon close, we currently anticipate using cash proceeds to repurchase shares and offset dilution. At that time, we will update you on any impact to our current outlook. 
Finally, we anticipate 2016 free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion, which excludes any additional impact from asset sales. 
In summary. We look for another year of growth in 2016. The strength of our portfolio, now augmented with SNL, positions us well to manage through these volatile market conditions. 
Now let me turn the call over to Chip Merritt to open it up for your questions."

With that down volume, but maybe a bit of pricing, we would like to see some revenue growth in that business. However, I do suspect that may be a bit more weighted to the back half of the year, just kind of given the issuance trends that we've seen in the fourth quarter that now appear to be continuing as we go into the first."

In terms of issuance, let me just give a few of the statistics from what we saw in the fourth quarter and a couple of the general trends. Clearly, as we reported, there was a large decrease in total corporate and governance. It decreased 29.3% in the fourth quarter. And there were some of the different categories, for instance, in Latin America, it was down 60%, 68% overall. In January, we saw a continuation of that trend. The total corporate governance issuance, down about 26%. Financial institutions were down about 56%. But we put together our forecast, which you saw on Slide 26, which shows about a 1% decrease in 2016. We put that together with the combination of looking at the markets, what we expect to see from market issuance, scanning the market with investment banks and corporate banks, et cetera. We also look at the -- what is the maturity profile of debt that's already on balance sheets that's coming due. So we looked -- do this forecast looking historically as well, what we see are the trends. If you look at that chart, you can see that 2014 was a peak year at $6 trillion of total issuance. And there's been a level, almost every year, 2012, '13, '15, a little bit over the $5 trillion level. The mix changes here and there, but we still believe that there would be somewhere in that range. It's just as Jack mentioned, it might be more in the second half of the year. There's another part of the markets, which you didn't ask a question, but I just want to mention as well, which is very important, which has to do with spreads. Spreads have recently widened significantly, especially in the lower end of the credit spread. CCC-type credits, obviously more distressed credits and below, have increased by over 400 basis points. They're at a 12 25 spread range, whereas the AAA, AA level is still around the 100, 110 basis points. It barely budged over the year. In fact, as you've seen, U.S. treasuries have tightened. So the spread issue, where we see spreads going, it's -- there's a lot of volatility right now. We think that also plays into it, people's appetite for going out. It's not really related to the base rate. It's related to the spreads. Anyway, long answer to your question, we are prepared in the business, as necessary, to manage our costs tightly through things like delaying hiring, looking at our bonus accruals as well as other investments that we might be making in things like technology and systems, et cetera. So we have certain flexibility we can build into our plan if we need to go through what could be a tough period. And one final comment. As you've heard me say many times in the past, we have a long-term optimism in this business, in fact, in all of our businesses. But we've always said that quarter-by-quarter, we could see some shaky quarters as markets respond to certain conditions."

Let me make a few -- maybe a few comments about Ratings and then one broader point just on the math of the margins for 2016. I think our -- maybe the caution view -- the cautionary view we're taking on margin expansion is not really based on cost management. I think our track record over the last few years would demonstrate that we're on that one. It's really more on the revenue side and particularly kind of given the issuance trends that we're seeing right now on Ratings. And we know how to manage cost in that business. Just to think about it, last year in 2015, we were actually able to expand margins with revenue down. That doesn't happen all too often. So from a longer-term point of view, we do think margin expansion is certainly possible with revenue growth and continued cost control within the Ratings business. I just do -- I just want to be clear, though, we are not targeting any magical outside goal here. We're just trying to manage our business in terms of what we think is right for the Ratings business. But just one overall point on the margins itself. We said 50 basis points, but you also have to kind of remember the math in terms of the addition of SNL this year. SNL is going to add to the portfolio about $200 million. It's coming in sort of around a mid-20s margin. You just do the math. That's diluted to the overall company margins of about 50 basis points. So if you were just to kind of look at like-for-like and exclude the impact of the SNL acquisition, our full year -- our margin guidance is really more in the range of 1 full point, which frankly is not that different than what we did in 2014. We -- I think we're 150 basis points last year. So I think it's not as different as it may look -- kind of looking -- when you really do factor in the math of the acquisition."

They want to have a more active capital markets. There's also -- the EU has what they call the Capital Markets Union. And one of the things they want to do is have more credit flow to SMEs and small financial institutions. So they think that the structured finance market is one of those. We agree that, that is going to be a slight growth area in 2016. In addition, there's another very important global trend about financial institutions. They're all looking at the optimal capital structure, in addition to the new rules related to capital. And there's this TLAC, which is total loss absorbing capacity, which is basically senior bonds which have a certain level of subordination to other senior debt depositors that we expect that banks are going to be issuing. So in general, we think that there will be increases in structured finance, increases in financial services and financial institutions, likely a decrease in overall corporate issuance globally, but probably a larger increase in noninvestment grade overall, especially at the spread levels which I mentioned earlier.

There has been a movement in United States in terms of governance and business practices related to boards to allow long-term shareholders to have access to the proxy for electing board members. There's a movement. There are certain shareholders, activists that have been trying to have boards take a look at this. So we took a very careful look at it. We looked across. We did a scan of the industry. We did a scan of best practices, and our board decided that we should adopt what we call the 3-3-20-20 rule, which is that 20 investors -- up to 20 investors that own up to -- that own 3% of the shares or more for at least 3 years would be allowed to elect or to -- not elect, but to propose up to 2 or up to 20% of the board directors in a proxy.

It's leading to an opportunity over time to make the business overall more efficient, also driven by the fact that we just have enhanced scale as we bring these businesses together. Just as a reminder, I mean, the SNL business system and the S&P Cap IQ business is similar -- are pretty similar. It's designing some pretty similar products that leverage a great deal of data, some of which is common to both systems and leveraging some common technology. So we're pleased with some more of the opportunity to step up the synergies on the cost side and also the timing in which to bring some into 2016. But we're -- and we're even more encouraged, from a longer-term point of view, about our ability to build a more efficient and more effective organization for the long term."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to provide you with an update on how we've positioned McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. And let me begin with an overview",2512,"Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to provide you with an update on how we've positioned McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. 
And let me begin with an overview of 2015. Revenue increased 5% year-on-year with organic revenue increasing 3%. Adjusted total expenses increased 1%, adjusted operating profit increased 13%, adjusted operating margin increased 280 basis points and diluted adjusted EPS increased 17%. 
Margin improvement was a big story for the year. Our cost-reduction efforts and revenue growth combined for a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin for the second year in a row. Every business delivered at least 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Year-over-year, our revenue increased $262 million. 90% of this was pulled through to adjusted operating profit. I'm proud of this accomplishment as it is testament to how well our employees controlled costs during the year. This cost efficiency was the main reason we were able to leverage our revenue growth into 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth. 
As we look at the company's financial performance over the last 4 years, the company has delivered consistent improvements in revenue, margin and EPS. Revenue from continuing operations has grown at a 9% compounded annual growth rate. Our adjusted margins have improved 960 basis points from 29.1% to 38.7%. And we've achieved a global -- a compounded annual growth rate in adjusted annual diluted earnings per share of 22%. 
In addition to delivering another year of strong financial performance, we continued to strengthen our franchises during 2015. The most important transaction of the year was the addition of SNL. We increasingly believe that the combination of SNL with S&P Capital IQ presents a compelling opportunity to create a powerful data and analytics business. In addition, we acquired Petromedia, strengthening Platts' existing position in the bunker market; launched Platts Market Data Direct, a new service that delivers Platts' price assessments, historical and other reference data in a matter of seconds; positioned Capital IQ as a core content provider to Symphony Communication Services so that its customers can seamlessly access S&P Capital IQ company data; launched a suite of new fixed income indices, anchored by our flagship S&P 500 Bond Index, the first-ever index that tracks the debt of the S&P 500 companies and the first priced in real-time throughout the day; and we entered into new or expanded exchange agreements in New Zealand, Mexico and Brazil. 
Beyond strengthening our businesses, there were a number of other key accomplishments in 2015. We consolidated the company headquarters into downtown New York, a move that brought corporate employees much closer to our operations; generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow, excluding legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries; returned $1.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends; successfully issued debt into the market after an 8-year absence; continued to make investments in compliance and risk management; and last week, increased the dividend by 9%, marking the 43rd consecutive yearly increase. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results where the company finished 2015 with solid earnings in a difficult debt-issuance environment. Revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue, however, only grew 1% as a result of revenue declines in S&P Ratings Services. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%, and fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 9%. The strength of our portfolio is evident in the fourth quarter as weak issuance at Ratings was offset by solid revenue growth across the rest of the portfolio. This portfolio strength, coupled with progress on productivity initiatives, enabled the company to deliver 9% adjusted diluted EPS. 
Now let me turn to the individual businesses, and I'll start with S&P Capital IQ and SNL. In 2015, reported revenue increased 14% with organic growth excluding revenue from SNL acquisition increasing 7%, adjusted segment operating profit increased 25% and the adjusted margin increased 200 basis points. With integration teams in place and synergy opportunities identified, we expect to deliver considerable adjusted margin improvements in this segment over the next few years. Jack will provide more details in a few minutes. 
In the fourth quarter, reported revenue increased 27%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 22% in the fourth quarter, and the adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points. This margin decline was due to deal-related amortization. Excluding that amortization, fourth quarter margin actually increased 200 basis points from 21.3% in fourth quarter 2014 to 23.3% in 2015. 
Let me add a bit more color on fourth quarter revenue growth in the business lines. S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 9%, principally through a low teens increase in Desktop revenue. SNL revenue increased 10% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, 2015 revenue was reduced by deferred revenue adjustments required under purchase accounting. Excluding this adjustment, revenue growth was 14%. 
Global Risk Services revenue increased 5%, led by RatingsXpress, which is increasingly used by customers to meet their regulatory reporting needs. 
In the smallest category, S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence revenue increased 4% overall with growth in Global Markets Intelligence and Leveraged Commentary & Data exceeding declines in Equity Research Services. 
Let me turn to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. In 2015, revenue declined 1%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue for the year increased 3%. Adjusted operating profit grew 7%. And the adjusted operating margin increased 340 basis points to 47.2%, a noteworthy achievement. 
During the quarter, revenue decreased 7%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue decreased 4%. Adjusted operating profit decreased 3%. And adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 43.7%. 
While decreased expenses in the fourth quarter led to margin expansion, the big story during the quarter was weak global issuance. Nontransaction revenue in the quarter was flat. However, excluding ForEx, it increased 4% due to strength in CRISIL and in Rating Evaluation Service revenue from elevated M&A activity. This was partially offset by the lower revenue associated with fewer new customers that were added in the fourth quarter. Transaction weakness was caused by a 26% decline in global issuance, partially offset by growth in bank loan ratings. Excluding ForEx, transaction revenue decreased 13%. 
Let's take a look at issuance. The 2 largest markets, the U.S. and Europe, both declined capping a weak second half of the year for issuance. Fourth quarter issuance in the U.S. was down across-the-board. Investment grade decreased 17%; high yields, 41%; public finance was down 21%; and structured finance also declined 26% with the only bright spot being RMBS. In Europe, investment grade decreased 15%; high yield, down 10%; and structured finance increased 11% with declines in every asset class offset by growth in covered bonds. The rest of the world had even weaker issuance with Asia declining 47% and the Americas outside the U.S. declining 46%. In total, global bond issuance declined 26%, outpacing the 20% decline in the third quarter. 
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2015, this business delivered an 8% increase in revenue, a 12% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 200 basis point of adjusted margin improvement to 65.6%. Fourth quarter results were similar with a 7% increase in revenue, a 9% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 100 basis point of adjusted margin improvement. During the quarter, there was a modest decline in revenue from ETFs, offset by revenue from exchange-traded derivatives, mutual funds, OTC derivatives and data licenses. 
If we turn to the key business drivers. The ETF industry surpassed 2014 record inflows, setting a new record of $351 billion in 2015, a great trend. AUM based on our indices increased 9% sequentially from third quarter '15 to $815 billion, but below peak levels at the end of 2014. During the quarter, we continued to innovate, launching 233 new indices and 26 new ETFs based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Exchange-traded derivatives revenue growth was primarily driven by increased revenues from CME, partially offset by a decrease in exchange-traded derivative volumes based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. As you know, S&P Dow Jones Indices is impacted by fluctuating markets, but continued inflows into passive investing, innovative new indices and efforts to partner with exchanges around the world bodes well for the long-term positioning of this business. 
On to commodities and commercial markets. The Eclipse, NADA Used Car Guide and Petromedia acquisitions impacted revenue comparisons in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Adjusting for these items, organic revenue increased 6% in 2015. Adjusted operating profit increased 17%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 260 basis points to 36.9%. 
In the fourth quarter, organic revenue increased 8%, adjusted operating profit increased 20% and adjusted operating margin increased 240 basis points. Both Platts and J.D. Power delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth. J.D. revenue powers -- J.D. Power revenue was powered by its auto business with particular strength in its PIN product. The evaluation of strategic alternatives for J.D. Power continues with considerable interest from third parties. 
Many of our upstream petroleum, natural gas and mining customers are pressured by low commodity prices and this has impacted the revenue growth of the Platts business. Nevertheless, Platts delivered high single-digit revenue growth in this challenging environment. Organic revenue from the core subscription business grew with both Petroleum and Metals, Ag and Petrochemicals revenue increasing high single digits. Global Trading Services revenue increased double-digit, primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from The Steel Index derivative activity. 
In summary. The company delivered solid revenue growth in a difficult market environment. More importantly, progress on our productivity initiatives was apparent with outstanding margin expansion delivered by every business in 2015. For the second year in a row, the company delivered adjusted operating margin improvement of 280 basis points. This accomplishment was the primary driver of the 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year. 
Now let me discuss the outlook for 2016 and I'd like to start with some thoughts from our economists. Major central banks moves in December may have disappointed or unnerved markets with the Federal Reserve raising rates and decisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan that appeared to disappoint or alarm the markets. However, monetary policy continues to provide a tailwind to economic expansion. Recent stock market volatility probably overstates the likelihood of a slump in global growth this year. These market moves appear to be more sentiment than data-driven with the exception obviously the falling spot oil prices, which reflects changing supply fundamentals. In the 6.5 years or so since the global economy started to recover from the financial crisis, it has grown in real terms at an average of about 3.5% annually. S&P economists expect that trend to continue with a 3.6% global growth in 2016. Our economists expect real growth in China to continue to trend downward, but to end up at 6.3% this year after growing by 6.9% in 2015. Growth in most of the developed world and even much of the developing world stands to be a bit higher this year than last, which adds up to a decent outcome for global growth. Excessive pessimism is not -- is probably not warranted. 
With this economic backdrop, we expect global debt issuance to decline 1% in 2016 and for spreads to widen. Within the U.S., we expect speculative-grade corporate issuers to see increasing borrowing costs in the coming quarters at the back of the Fed interest rate increase while most higher-rated corporate entities should continue to have a favorable lending environment as investors pursue moderate yields while remaining more risk-averse. More favorable lending conditions in Europe, supported by continued monetary accommodation by the ECB, should result in increased bond and loan issuance in 2016. The central banks' recent measures combined with the softening in the regulatory stance may also bode well for higher issuance of securitized products with modest increases in borrowing from the public finance sector. 
Among the emerging markets, most regions are experiencing substantial stress from falling commodity prices, exchange-rated pressures from a rising dollar, tighter lending conditions and a rising share of nonperforming loans. Two of the largest economies, Brazil and China, have been experiencing significant headwinds this year and their market volatility is unlikely to subside in the near term. 
Now turning from macro factors to those items inside the company that we control. There are several areas of focus in 2016. Our revenue guidance for 2016 is from mid- to high single-digit growth. While tepid issuance limits S&P Ratings Services growth, we'll benefit from 8 additional months of SNL in 2016. Beginning in 2016, we will report our financial results using a newly defined adjusted diluted EPS that excludes deal-related amortization that Jack will discuss in a moment. Incorporating this change, our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance is a range of $5 to $5.15. In 2016, we expect to generate considerable free cash flow and our guidance is for approximately $1.3 billion. Please note that this cash flow guidance doesn't include the proceeds from the potential sale of J.D. Power. We're actively pursuing the sale of this business and have received considerable interest from a number of parties. 
The top operational priority in the corporation will be the integration of S&P Capital IQ and SNL. 10 work streams are in place, and now that we have an inside look at SNL and the collective knowledge from both businesses, additional synergies have been identified. We have a goal to transform Global Risk Services into a market leader. We have risk capabilities within S&P Ratings Services, S&P Capital IQ and SNL and CRISIL that we brought to bear to create new credit products and services. 
I've challenged the organization to continue to expand our international footprint through better customer focus as well as collaboration across the company. And I've also challenged the company to deliver additional process improvements. From automating elements of the ratings process to improving data collection, there's ample opportunity to drive performance with process improvements and reengineering. 
We'll also continue to invest in compliance and risk management as well as firm-wide technology and data road map. Technology is at the heart of each business and we need to evolve our technology in a thoughtful and coordinated manner. 
And now I'd like to conclude with some big news. The Board of Directors has proposed renaming the company, S&P Global. This name better leverages the company's rich heritage and our powerful financial data and analytics brands while signaling that we have a strong global footprint and broad portfolio. The change will be effective pending a shareholder vote on April 27. In addition to changing the name of the company, we'll also be changing the names of some of our divisions. For example, S&P Capital IQ and SNL will be renamed S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call the morning. And now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer."

As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity",1961,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity around several items that impact our financial performance, and then we will open up the call for your questions. 
First, I will recap key financial results. As part of the review, I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization and discuss our new approach to key performance metrics. I will also review the impact from adjustments to earnings and update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. After that, I will provide updates on our productivity initiatives and SNL integration. And finally, I will provide 2016 guidance. 
Let's start with the consolidated fourth quarter income statement. As Doug already commented on these items, there are just a couple items I want to highlight. First, reported revenue grew 7%, benefiting in part from the first full quarter of SNL contribution. On a constant-currency basis, organic revenue grew 3%. Delivering overall top line growth was thanks to the strength and breadth of our portfolio as revenue from our largest business, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, was lower than last year due to the impact of weak global debt issuance. 
Second, expenses and margins were impacted by the step-up in deal-related amortization. I will discuss this item in more detail in just a moment. 
Third, the tax rate was considerably lower than a year ago largely due to improved profitability in several lower-tax jurisdictions outside the United States and favorable tax benefits from the ongoing resolution of prior year tax audits. 
Turning now to the full year. Both reported revenue and organic revenue on a constant currency basis increased 5%. This was consistent with our guidance of mid-single digit growth. The most impressive result is that total adjusted expenses increased only 1%. This is a direct result of the tangible progress on our 3-year cost reduction plan, which I will discuss in a moment. As a result of cost productivity and a solid revenue growth, adjusted operating margin increased 280 points to 38.7%. The tax rate for the full year on an adjusted basis was 30.5%. As I just mentioned, this was due to improved profitability in lower-cost jurisdictions and the ongoing favorable outcomes from the resolution of certain prior year tax audits. And finally, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% and 17%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.53 is a couple of pennies ahead of our latest guidance. The average adjusted diluted shares outstanding decreased by over 1 million shares versus a year ago. The full impact of the 10 million shares that we repurchased during 2015 will be more evident in the 2016 share count. 
Now I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization. As a result of the SNL acquisition, the company's deal-related amortization expense has increased significantly. It will be approximately $98 million in 2016, just over half of which is related to the SNL acquisition. In the top section of the slide, you can see that we reported a fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating margin of 24.8% (sic) [ 34.8% ] as deal-related amortization more than doubled. On the other hand, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating profit margins of 36.8%. The difference is not as pronounced on the full year results, which includes only 4 months of SNL deal-related amortization expense. Here, the reported 2015 adjusted operating margin is 38.7%. However, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported 2015 adjusted operating profit margin of 39.9%. 
On this slide, we lay out the earnings per share impact of deal-related amortization expense on the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, there is an $0.08 per share difference between the reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.04 and the adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding deal-related amortization of $1.12. For the full year of 2015, the difference is $0.16. Now going forward, beginning in 2016, we will be excluding this deal-related amortization from our non-GAAP results. We think that this will enable investors to view our results in the same manner as management. In today's earnings release, we have provided the impact of this change to 2015 adjusted earnings by quarter so you can adjust your models accordingly. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. In total, pretax adjustments to earnings from continuing operations totaled $54 million in the quarter. This consisted of $33 million of restructuring charges in S&P Capital IQ and SNL, Corporate and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. There was $15 million in accruals for potential legal settlements and $6 million for acquisition-related costs associated with the SNL transaction. As you have seen in the past, these restructuring actions are targeted to produce tangible cost reductions. The majority of the actions were taken in S&P Capital IQ and SNL as this division begins the realization of its cost synergy plans. I'll provide an update on these synergies in just a moment. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of the end of 2015, we had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $143 million of short-term debt in commercial paper. Going forward, we intend to tap into the short-term debt markets periodically to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. 
Our full year free cash flow was a negative $48 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, year-to-date free cash flow was a positive $1.2 billion. This is consistent with our guidance of greater than $1.1 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company stepped up its share repurchase program and bought approximately 5 million shares, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 10 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, totaled to approximately $1.3 billion of cash returned to shareholders in 2015. This overall return of capital is in line with the past several years. Overall, we have returned approximately $6.4 billion over the last 5 years. The share repurchase program remains an important component of our overall capital allocation and we anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, subject to market conditions. 
As most of you know, we initiated a 3-year productivity program that will conclude by the end of 2016. The target was initially $100 million when introduced in early 2014 and was increased to $140 million last year. As of the end of 2015, approximately 80% of that productivity target has been realized. Our progress is clearly evident in the margin progress that we have delivered over the past 2 years. We currently expect to complete these initiatives and deliver on the full $140 million target by the end of this year. 
Now let me provide an update on the integration of SNL. This was the first full quarter of our ownership of SNL, and given its importance, the integration has become a primary area of focus for the company. It is imperative that we combine S&P Capital IQ and SNL rapidly to capture synergies while minimizing disruption to the business, and most importantly, our customers. As Doug mentioned, 10 integration work streams are in place and efforts are well underway. We have a centralized integration management office that provides detailed tracking by initiative, identification of key issues and monitoring of these synergies. Both Doug and I work closely with Mike Chinn and his team to help ensure that these efforts receive the appropriate priority and support across the company. More importantly for investors, we are now on track to exceed the initial $70 million synergy target ahead of our original time line. 
When we announced the acquisition of SNL, we cited a target of $70 million of run rate EBITDA synergies by 2019. This was an estimate we arrived at by looking at SNL from the outside in. We now have had the opportunity to work directly with the new leadership team to consider what can be accomplished as we build and integrate S&P Capital IQ and SNL organizations. With this more informed inside look, we are now targeting $100 million of synergies by 2019. This increase is almost entirely cost-related as we now expect about $70 million of cost synergies by 2018 and the balance revenue-related. Furthermore, we expect that more than 1/3 of the synergies will be realized in 2016. Taken in total, these synergies, the sustained growth across both legacy businesses and the positive 8-month overlap on the acquisition should generate approximately 20% revenue growth in 2016 with profits, excluding the impact of deal-related amortization, growing twice as fast. 
Let me provide some additional guidance going into 2016. Overall, the strength and breadth of our portfolio better positions us to weather the volatility that we have experienced over the last couple of quarters, which has intensified a bit since the start of 2016. The promising outlook for S&P Capital IQ and SNL and continued growth at Platts supports our current assumption of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth despite the weak start in debt issuance in the overall capital markets. 
We anticipate maintaining the approximately 31% effective tax rate, generally in line with 2015. 
As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted earnings per share guidance will exclude the impact of deal-related amortization. On this basis, we are introducing adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.15, 7% to 10% growth off our 2015 adjusted earnings per share once the impact of deal-related amortization is excluded from both years. 
Despite the strong adjusted margin expansion expected at S&P Capital IQ and SNL, we are a bit cautious about further consolidated margin expansion in 2016. This caution is primarily based on the challenging market conditions, which may impact revenue growth in our 2 highest-margin business units, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and S&P Dow Jones Indices. And as a reminder, we have already made great progress on margins with the realization thus far of the $140 million productivity target. As a result, we would currently point to an overall margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, above the 39.9% adjusted operating margin excluding deal-related amortization in 2015. 
Capital investment is expected to be largely flat, in line with 2015. 
On return of capital. Last week, the company announced a 9% increase in our annual dividend to $1.44 per share. Our guidance considers continued share repurchases, although the timing can be impacted by market conditions. 
One clarification. This guidance assumes the inclusion of J.D. Power for the full year. As you can see in today's release, we have moved J.D. Power to an asset held for sale. As such, J.D. Power's results will be included until a sale is closed. Upon close, we currently anticipate using cash proceeds to repurchase shares and offset dilution. At that time, we will update you on any impact to our current outlook. 
Finally, we anticipate 2016 free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion, which excludes any additional impact from asset sales. 
In summary. We look for another year of growth in 2016. The strength of our portfolio, now augmented with SNL, positions us well to manage through these volatile market conditions. 
Now let me turn the call over to Chip Merritt to open it up for your questions."

With that down volume, but maybe a bit of pricing, we would like to see some revenue growth in that business. However, I do suspect that may be a bit more weighted to the back half of the year, just kind of given the issuance trends that we've seen in the fourth quarter that now appear to be continuing as we go into the first."

In terms of issuance, let me just give a few of the statistics from what we saw in the fourth quarter and a couple of the general trends. Clearly, as we reported, there was a large decrease in total corporate and governance. It decreased 29.3% in the fourth quarter. And there were some of the different categories, for instance, in Latin America, it was down 60%, 68% overall. In January, we saw a continuation of that trend. The total corporate governance issuance, down about 26%. Financial institutions were down about 56%. But we put together our forecast, which you saw on Slide 26, which shows about a 1% decrease in 2016. We put that together with the combination of looking at the markets, what we expect to see from market issuance, scanning the market with investment banks and corporate banks, et cetera. We also look at the -- what is the maturity profile of debt that's already on balance sheets that's coming due. So we looked -- do this forecast looking historically as well, what we see are the trends. If you look at that chart, you can see that 2014 was a peak year at $6 trillion of total issuance. And there's been a level, almost every year, 2012, '13, '15, a little bit over the $5 trillion level. The mix changes here and there, but we still believe that there would be somewhere in that range. It's just as Jack mentioned, it might be more in the second half of the year. There's another part of the markets, which you didn't ask a question, but I just want to mention as well, which is very important, which has to do with spreads. Spreads have recently widened significantly, especially in the lower end of the credit spread. CCC-type credits, obviously more distressed credits and below, have increased by over 400 basis points. They're at a 12 25 spread range, whereas the AAA, AA level is still around the 100, 110 basis points. It barely budged over the year. In fact, as you've seen, U.S. treasuries have tightened. So the spread issue, where we see spreads going, it's -- there's a lot of volatility right now. We think that also plays into it, people's appetite for going out. It's not really related to the base rate. It's related to the spreads. Anyway, long answer to your question, we are prepared in the business, as necessary, to manage our costs tightly through things like delaying hiring, looking at our bonus accruals as well as other investments that we might be making in things like technology and systems, et cetera. So we have certain flexibility we can build into our plan if we need to go through what could be a tough period. And one final comment. As you've heard me say many times in the past, we have a long-term optimism in this business, in fact, in all of our businesses. But we've always said that quarter-by-quarter, we could see some shaky quarters as markets respond to certain conditions."

Let me make a few -- maybe a few comments about Ratings and then one broader point just on the math of the margins for 2016. I think our -- maybe the caution view -- the cautionary view we're taking on margin expansion is not really based on cost management. I think our track record over the last few years would demonstrate that we're on that one. It's really more on the revenue side and particularly kind of given the issuance trends that we're seeing right now on Ratings. And we know how to manage cost in that business. Just to think about it, last year in 2015, we were actually able to expand margins with revenue down. That doesn't happen all too often. So from a longer-term point of view, we do think margin expansion is certainly possible with revenue growth and continued cost control within the Ratings business. I just do -- I just want to be clear, though, we are not targeting any magical outside goal here. We're just trying to manage our business in terms of what we think is right for the Ratings business. But just one overall point on the margins itself. We said 50 basis points, but you also have to kind of remember the math in terms of the addition of SNL this year. SNL is going to add to the portfolio about $200 million. It's coming in sort of around a mid-20s margin. You just do the math. That's diluted to the overall company margins of about 50 basis points. So if you were just to kind of look at like-for-like and exclude the impact of the SNL acquisition, our full year -- our margin guidance is really more in the range of 1 full point, which frankly is not that different than what we did in 2014. We -- I think we're 150 basis points last year. So I think it's not as different as it may look -- kind of looking -- when you really do factor in the math of the acquisition."

They want to have a more active capital markets. There's also -- the EU has what they call the Capital Markets Union. And one of the things they want to do is have more credit flow to SMEs and small financial institutions. So they think that the structured finance market is one of those. We agree that, that is going to be a slight growth area in 2016. In addition, there's another very important global trend about financial institutions. They're all looking at the optimal capital structure, in addition to the new rules related to capital. And there's this TLAC, which is total loss absorbing capacity, which is basically senior bonds which have a certain level of subordination to other senior debt depositors that we expect that banks are going to be issuing. So in general, we think that there will be increases in structured finance, increases in financial services and financial institutions, likely a decrease in overall corporate issuance globally, but probably a larger increase in noninvestment grade overall, especially at the spread levels which I mentioned earlier.

We did a scan of the industry. We did a scan of best practices, and our board decided that we should adopt what we call the 3-3-20-20 rule, which is that 20 investors -- up to 20 investors that own up to -- that own 3% of the shares or more for at least 3 years would be allowed to elect or to -- not elect, but to propose up to 2 or up to 20% of the board directors in a proxy.

Just as a reminder, I mean, the SNL business system and the S&P Cap IQ business is similar -- are pretty similar. It's designing some pretty similar products that leverage a great deal of data, some of which is common to both systems and leveraging some common technology. So we're pleased with some more of the opportunity to step up the synergies on the cost side and also the timing in which to bring some into 2016.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to provide you with an update on how we've positioned McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. And let me begin with an overview",2512,"Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to provide you with an update on how we've positioned McGraw Hill Financial for continued growth and performance. 
And let me begin with an overview of 2015. Revenue increased 5% year-on-year with organic revenue increasing 3%. Adjusted total expenses increased 1%, adjusted operating profit increased 13%, adjusted operating margin increased 280 basis points and diluted adjusted EPS increased 17%. 
Margin improvement was a big story for the year. Our cost-reduction efforts and revenue growth combined for a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin for the second year in a row. Every business delivered at least 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Year-over-year, our revenue increased $262 million. 90% of this was pulled through to adjusted operating profit. I'm proud of this accomplishment as it is testament to how well our employees controlled costs during the year. This cost efficiency was the main reason we were able to leverage our revenue growth into 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth. 
As we look at the company's financial performance over the last 4 years, the company has delivered consistent improvements in revenue, margin and EPS. Revenue from continuing operations has grown at a 9% compounded annual growth rate. Our adjusted margins have improved 960 basis points from 29.1% to 38.7%. And we've achieved a global -- a compounded annual growth rate in adjusted annual diluted earnings per share of 22%. 
In addition to delivering another year of strong financial performance, we continued to strengthen our franchises during 2015. The most important transaction of the year was the addition of SNL. We increasingly believe that the combination of SNL with S&P Capital IQ presents a compelling opportunity to create a powerful data and analytics business. In addition, we acquired Petromedia, strengthening Platts' existing position in the bunker market; launched Platts Market Data Direct, a new service that delivers Platts' price assessments, historical and other reference data in a matter of seconds; positioned Capital IQ as a core content provider to Symphony Communication Services so that its customers can seamlessly access S&P Capital IQ company data; launched a suite of new fixed income indices, anchored by our flagship S&P 500 Bond Index, the first-ever index that tracks the debt of the S&P 500 companies and the first priced in real-time throughout the day; and we entered into new or expanded exchange agreements in New Zealand, Mexico and Brazil. 
Beyond strengthening our businesses, there were a number of other key accomplishments in 2015. We consolidated the company headquarters into downtown New York, a move that brought corporate employees much closer to our operations; generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow, excluding legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries; returned $1.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends; successfully issued debt into the market after an 8-year absence; continued to make investments in compliance and risk management; and last week, increased the dividend by 9%, marking the 43rd consecutive yearly increase. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results where the company finished 2015 with solid earnings in a difficult debt-issuance environment. Revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue, however, only grew 1% as a result of revenue declines in S&P Ratings Services. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%, and fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 9%. The strength of our portfolio is evident in the fourth quarter as weak issuance at Ratings was offset by solid revenue growth across the rest of the portfolio. This portfolio strength, coupled with progress on productivity initiatives, enabled the company to deliver 9% adjusted diluted EPS. 
Now let me turn to the individual businesses, and I'll start with S&P Capital IQ and SNL. In 2015, reported revenue increased 14% with organic growth excluding revenue from SNL acquisition increasing 7%, adjusted segment operating profit increased 25% and the adjusted margin increased 200 basis points. With integration teams in place and synergy opportunities identified, we expect to deliver considerable adjusted margin improvements in this segment over the next few years. Jack will provide more details in a few minutes. 
In the fourth quarter, reported revenue increased 27%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 22% in the fourth quarter, and the adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points. This margin decline was due to deal-related amortization. Excluding that amortization, fourth quarter margin actually increased 200 basis points from 21.3% in fourth quarter 2014 to 23.3% in 2015. 
Let me add a bit more color on fourth quarter revenue growth in the business lines. S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 9%, principally through a low teens increase in Desktop revenue. SNL revenue increased 10% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, 2015 revenue was reduced by deferred revenue adjustments required under purchase accounting. Excluding this adjustment, revenue growth was 14%. 
Global Risk Services revenue increased 5%, led by RatingsXpress, which is increasingly used by customers to meet their regulatory reporting needs. 
In the smallest category, S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence revenue increased 4% overall with growth in Global Markets Intelligence and Leveraged Commentary & Data exceeding declines in Equity Research Services. 
Let me turn to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. In 2015, revenue declined 1%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue for the year increased 3%. Adjusted operating profit grew 7%. And the adjusted operating margin increased 340 basis points to 47.2%, a noteworthy achievement. 
During the quarter, revenue decreased 7%. However, excluding ForEx, revenue decreased 4%. Adjusted operating profit decreased 3%. And adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 43.7%. 
While decreased expenses in the fourth quarter led to margin expansion, the big story during the quarter was weak global issuance. Nontransaction revenue in the quarter was flat. However, excluding ForEx, it increased 4% due to strength in CRISIL and in Rating Evaluation Service revenue from elevated M&A activity. This was partially offset by the lower revenue associated with fewer new customers that were added in the fourth quarter. Transaction weakness was caused by a 26% decline in global issuance, partially offset by growth in bank loan ratings. Excluding ForEx, transaction revenue decreased 13%. 
Let's take a look at issuance. The 2 largest markets, the U.S. and Europe, both declined capping a weak second half of the year for issuance. Fourth quarter issuance in the U.S. was down across-the-board. Investment grade decreased 17%; high yields, 41%; public finance was down 21%; and structured finance also declined 26% with the only bright spot being RMBS. In Europe, investment grade decreased 15%; high yield, down 10%; and structured finance increased 11% with declines in every asset class offset by growth in covered bonds. The rest of the world had even weaker issuance with Asia declining 47% and the Americas outside the U.S. declining 46%. In total, global bond issuance declined 26%, outpacing the 20% decline in the third quarter. 
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2015, this business delivered an 8% increase in revenue, a 12% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 200 basis point of adjusted margin improvement to 65.6%. Fourth quarter results were similar with a 7% increase in revenue, a 9% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 100 basis point of adjusted margin improvement. During the quarter, there was a modest decline in revenue from ETFs, offset by revenue from exchange-traded derivatives, mutual funds, OTC derivatives and data licenses. 
If we turn to the key business drivers. The ETF industry surpassed 2014 record inflows, setting a new record of $351 billion in 2015, a great trend. AUM based on our indices increased 9% sequentially from third quarter '15 to $815 billion, but below peak levels at the end of 2014. During the quarter, we continued to innovate, launching 233 new indices and 26 new ETFs based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Exchange-traded derivatives revenue growth was primarily driven by increased revenues from CME, partially offset by a decrease in exchange-traded derivative volumes based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. As you know, S&P Dow Jones Indices is impacted by fluctuating markets, but continued inflows into passive investing, innovative new indices and efforts to partner with exchanges around the world bodes well for the long-term positioning of this business. 
On to commodities and commercial markets. The Eclipse, NADA Used Car Guide and Petromedia acquisitions impacted revenue comparisons in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Adjusting for these items, organic revenue increased 6% in 2015. Adjusted operating profit increased 17%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 260 basis points to 36.9%. 
In the fourth quarter, organic revenue increased 8%, adjusted operating profit increased 20% and adjusted operating margin increased 240 basis points. Both Platts and J.D. Power delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth. J.D. revenue powers -- J.D. Power revenue was powered by its auto business with particular strength in its PIN product. The evaluation of strategic alternatives for J.D. Power continues with considerable interest from third parties. 
Many of our upstream petroleum, natural gas and mining customers are pressured by low commodity prices and this has impacted the revenue growth of the Platts business. Nevertheless, Platts delivered high single-digit revenue growth in this challenging environment. Organic revenue from the core subscription business grew with both Petroleum and Metals, Ag and Petrochemicals revenue increasing high single digits. Global Trading Services revenue increased double-digit, primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from The Steel Index derivative activity. 
In summary. The company delivered solid revenue growth in a difficult market environment. More importantly, progress on our productivity initiatives was apparent with outstanding margin expansion delivered by every business in 2015. For the second year in a row, the company delivered adjusted operating margin improvement of 280 basis points. This accomplishment was the primary driver of the 17% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year. 
Now let me discuss the outlook for 2016 and I'd like to start with some thoughts from our economists. Major central banks moves in December may have disappointed or unnerved markets with the Federal Reserve raising rates and decisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan that appeared to disappoint or alarm the markets. However, monetary policy continues to provide a tailwind to economic expansion. Recent stock market volatility probably overstates the likelihood of a slump in global growth this year. These market moves appear to be more sentiment than data-driven with the exception obviously the falling spot oil prices, which reflects changing supply fundamentals. In the 6.5 years or so since the global economy started to recover from the financial crisis, it has grown in real terms at an average of about 3.5% annually. S&P economists expect that trend to continue with a 3.6% global growth in 2016. Our economists expect real growth in China to continue to trend downward, but to end up at 6.3% this year after growing by 6.9% in 2015. Growth in most of the developed world and even much of the developing world stands to be a bit higher this year than last, which adds up to a decent outcome for global growth. Excessive pessimism is not -- is probably not warranted. 
With this economic backdrop, we expect global debt issuance to decline 1% in 2016 and for spreads to widen. Within the U.S., we expect speculative-grade corporate issuers to see increasing borrowing costs in the coming quarters at the back of the Fed interest rate increase while most higher-rated corporate entities should continue to have a favorable lending environment as investors pursue moderate yields while remaining more risk-averse. More favorable lending conditions in Europe, supported by continued monetary accommodation by the ECB, should result in increased bond and loan issuance in 2016. The central banks' recent measures combined with the softening in the regulatory stance may also bode well for higher issuance of securitized products with modest increases in borrowing from the public finance sector. 
Among the emerging markets, most regions are experiencing substantial stress from falling commodity prices, exchange-rated pressures from a rising dollar, tighter lending conditions and a rising share of nonperforming loans. Two of the largest economies, Brazil and China, have been experiencing significant headwinds this year and their market volatility is unlikely to subside in the near term. 
Now turning from macro factors to those items inside the company that we control. There are several areas of focus in 2016. Our revenue guidance for 2016 is from mid- to high single-digit growth. While tepid issuance limits S&P Ratings Services growth, we'll benefit from 8 additional months of SNL in 2016. Beginning in 2016, we will report our financial results using a newly defined adjusted diluted EPS that excludes deal-related amortization that Jack will discuss in a moment. Incorporating this change, our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance is a range of $5 to $5.15. In 2016, we expect to generate considerable free cash flow and our guidance is for approximately $1.3 billion. Please note that this cash flow guidance doesn't include the proceeds from the potential sale of J.D. Power. We're actively pursuing the sale of this business and have received considerable interest from a number of parties. 
The top operational priority in the corporation will be the integration of S&P Capital IQ and SNL. 10 work streams are in place, and now that we have an inside look at SNL and the collective knowledge from both businesses, additional synergies have been identified. We have a goal to transform Global Risk Services into a market leader. We have risk capabilities within S&P Ratings Services, S&P Capital IQ and SNL and CRISIL that we brought to bear to create new credit products and services. 
I've challenged the organization to continue to expand our international footprint through better customer focus as well as collaboration across the company. And I've also challenged the company to deliver additional process improvements. From automating elements of the ratings process to improving data collection, there's ample opportunity to drive performance with process improvements and reengineering. 
We'll also continue to invest in compliance and risk management as well as firm-wide technology and data road map. Technology is at the heart of each business and we need to evolve our technology in a thoughtful and coordinated manner. 
And now I'd like to conclude with some big news. The Board of Directors has proposed renaming the company, S&P Global. This name better leverages the company's rich heritage and our powerful financial data and analytics brands while signaling that we have a strong global footprint and broad portfolio. The change will be effective pending a shareholder vote on April 27. In addition to changing the name of the company, we'll also be changing the names of some of our divisions. For example, S&P Capital IQ and SNL will be renamed S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call the morning. And now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer."

As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity",1961,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you just heard, we made great progress in 2015, expanding on our portfolio and product capabilities while simultaneously streamlining the cost base. Today, I want to provide additional clarity around several items that impact our financial performance, and then we will open up the call for your questions. 
First, I will recap key financial results. As part of the review, I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization and discuss our new approach to key performance metrics. I will also review the impact from adjustments to earnings and update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. After that, I will provide updates on our productivity initiatives and SNL integration. And finally, I will provide 2016 guidance. 
Let's start with the consolidated fourth quarter income statement. As Doug already commented on these items, there are just a couple items I want to highlight. First, reported revenue grew 7%, benefiting in part from the first full quarter of SNL contribution. On a constant-currency basis, organic revenue grew 3%. Delivering overall top line growth was thanks to the strength and breadth of our portfolio as revenue from our largest business, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, was lower than last year due to the impact of weak global debt issuance. 
Second, expenses and margins were impacted by the step-up in deal-related amortization. I will discuss this item in more detail in just a moment. 
Third, the tax rate was considerably lower than a year ago largely due to improved profitability in several lower-tax jurisdictions outside the United States and favorable tax benefits from the ongoing resolution of prior year tax audits. 
Turning now to the full year. Both reported revenue and organic revenue on a constant currency basis increased 5%. This was consistent with our guidance of mid-single digit growth. The most impressive result is that total adjusted expenses increased only 1%. This is a direct result of the tangible progress on our 3-year cost reduction plan, which I will discuss in a moment. As a result of cost productivity and a solid revenue growth, adjusted operating margin increased 280 points to 38.7%. The tax rate for the full year on an adjusted basis was 30.5%. As I just mentioned, this was due to improved profitability in lower-cost jurisdictions and the ongoing favorable outcomes from the resolution of certain prior year tax audits. And finally, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% and 17%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.53 is a couple of pennies ahead of our latest guidance. The average adjusted diluted shares outstanding decreased by over 1 million shares versus a year ago. The full impact of the 10 million shares that we repurchased during 2015 will be more evident in the 2016 share count. 
Now I want to highlight the impact of deal-related amortization. As a result of the SNL acquisition, the company's deal-related amortization expense has increased significantly. It will be approximately $98 million in 2016, just over half of which is related to the SNL acquisition. In the top section of the slide, you can see that we reported a fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating margin of 24.8% (sic) [ 34.8% ] as deal-related amortization more than doubled. On the other hand, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted operating profit margins of 36.8%. The difference is not as pronounced on the full year results, which includes only 4 months of SNL deal-related amortization expense. Here, the reported 2015 adjusted operating margin is 38.7%. However, if deal-related amortization expense were excluded, we would have reported 2015 adjusted operating profit margin of 39.9%. 
On this slide, we lay out the earnings per share impact of deal-related amortization expense on the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, there is an $0.08 per share difference between the reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.04 and the adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding deal-related amortization of $1.12. For the full year of 2015, the difference is $0.16. Now going forward, beginning in 2016, we will be excluding this deal-related amortization from our non-GAAP results. We think that this will enable investors to view our results in the same manner as management. In today's earnings release, we have provided the impact of this change to 2015 adjusted earnings by quarter so you can adjust your models accordingly. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. In total, pretax adjustments to earnings from continuing operations totaled $54 million in the quarter. This consisted of $33 million of restructuring charges in S&P Capital IQ and SNL, Corporate and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. There was $15 million in accruals for potential legal settlements and $6 million for acquisition-related costs associated with the SNL transaction. As you have seen in the past, these restructuring actions are targeted to produce tangible cost reductions. The majority of the actions were taken in S&P Capital IQ and SNL as this division begins the realization of its cost synergy plans. I'll provide an update on these synergies in just a moment. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of the end of 2015, we had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $143 million of short-term debt in commercial paper. Going forward, we intend to tap into the short-term debt markets periodically to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. 
Our full year free cash flow was a negative $48 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, year-to-date free cash flow was a positive $1.2 billion. This is consistent with our guidance of greater than $1.1 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company stepped up its share repurchase program and bought approximately 5 million shares, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 10 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, totaled to approximately $1.3 billion of cash returned to shareholders in 2015. This overall return of capital is in line with the past several years. Overall, we have returned approximately $6.4 billion over the last 5 years. The share repurchase program remains an important component of our overall capital allocation and we anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, subject to market conditions. 
As most of you know, we initiated a 3-year productivity program that will conclude by the end of 2016. The target was initially $100 million when introduced in early 2014 and was increased to $140 million last year. As of the end of 2015, approximately 80% of that productivity target has been realized. Our progress is clearly evident in the margin progress that we have delivered over the past 2 years. We currently expect to complete these initiatives and deliver on the full $140 million target by the end of this year. 
Now let me provide an update on the integration of SNL. This was the first full quarter of our ownership of SNL, and given its importance, the integration has become a primary area of focus for the company. It is imperative that we combine S&P Capital IQ and SNL rapidly to capture synergies while minimizing disruption to the business, and most importantly, our customers. As Doug mentioned, 10 integration work streams are in place and efforts are well underway. We have a centralized integration management office that provides detailed tracking by initiative, identification of key issues and monitoring of these synergies. Both Doug and I work closely with Mike Chinn and his team to help ensure that these efforts receive the appropriate priority and support across the company. More importantly for investors, we are now on track to exceed the initial $70 million synergy target ahead of our original time line. 
When we announced the acquisition of SNL, we cited a target of $70 million of run rate EBITDA synergies by 2019. This was an estimate we arrived at by looking at SNL from the outside in. We now have had the opportunity to work directly with the new leadership team to consider what can be accomplished as we build and integrate S&P Capital IQ and SNL organizations. With this more informed inside look, we are now targeting $100 million of synergies by 2019. This increase is almost entirely cost-related as we now expect about $70 million of cost synergies by 2018 and the balance revenue-related. Furthermore, we expect that more than 1/3 of the synergies will be realized in 2016. Taken in total, these synergies, the sustained growth across both legacy businesses and the positive 8-month overlap on the acquisition should generate approximately 20% revenue growth in 2016 with profits, excluding the impact of deal-related amortization, growing twice as fast. 
Let me provide some additional guidance going into 2016. Overall, the strength and breadth of our portfolio better positions us to weather the volatility that we have experienced over the last couple of quarters, which has intensified a bit since the start of 2016. The promising outlook for S&P Capital IQ and SNL and continued growth at Platts supports our current assumption of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth despite the weak start in debt issuance in the overall capital markets. 
We anticipate maintaining the approximately 31% effective tax rate, generally in line with 2015. 
As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted earnings per share guidance will exclude the impact of deal-related amortization. On this basis, we are introducing adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.15, 7% to 10% growth off our 2015 adjusted earnings per share once the impact of deal-related amortization is excluded from both years. 
Despite the strong adjusted margin expansion expected at S&P Capital IQ and SNL, we are a bit cautious about further consolidated margin expansion in 2016. This caution is primarily based on the challenging market conditions, which may impact revenue growth in our 2 highest-margin business units, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and S&P Dow Jones Indices. And as a reminder, we have already made great progress on margins with the realization thus far of the $140 million productivity target. As a result, we would currently point to an overall margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, above the 39.9% adjusted operating margin excluding deal-related amortization in 2015. 
Capital investment is expected to be largely flat, in line with 2015. 
On return of capital. Last week, the company announced a 9% increase in our annual dividend to $1.44 per share. Our guidance considers continued share repurchases, although the timing can be impacted by market conditions. 
One clarification. This guidance assumes the inclusion of J.D. Power for the full year. As you can see in today's release, we have moved J.D. Power to an asset held for sale. As such, J.D. Power's results will be included until a sale is closed. Upon close, we currently anticipate using cash proceeds to repurchase shares and offset dilution. At that time, we will update you on any impact to our current outlook. 
Finally, we anticipate 2016 free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion, which excludes any additional impact from asset sales. 
In summary. We look for another year of growth in 2016. The strength of our portfolio, now augmented with SNL, positions us well to manage through these volatile market conditions. 
Now let me turn the call over to Chip Merritt to open it up for your questions."

With that down volume, but maybe a bit of pricing, we would like to see some revenue growth in that business. However, I do suspect that may be a bit more weighted to the back half of the year, just kind of given the issuance trends that we've seen in the fourth quarter that now appear to be continuing as we go into the first."

In terms of issuance, let me just give a few of the statistics from what we saw in the fourth quarter and a couple of the general trends. Clearly, as we reported, there was a large decrease in total corporate and governance. It decreased 29.3% in the fourth quarter. And there were some of the different categories, for instance, in Latin America, it was down 60%, 68% overall. In January, we saw a continuation of that trend. The total corporate governance issue was down about 26%. Financial institutions were down about 56%. But we put together our forecast, which you saw on Slide 26, which shows about a 1% decrease in 2016. We put that together with the combination of looking at the markets, what we expect to see from market issuance, scanning the market with investment banks and corporate banks, et cetera. We also look at the -- what is the maturity profile of debt that's already on balance sheets that's coming due. So we looked -- do this forecast looking historically as well, what we see are the trends. If you look at that chart, you can see that 2014 was a peak year at $6 trillion of total issuance. And there's been a level, almost every year, 2012, '13, '15, a little bit over the $5 trillion level. The mix changes here and there, but we still believe that there would be somewhere in that range. It's just as Jack mentioned, it might be more in the second half of the year. There's another part of the markets, which you didn't ask a question, but I just want to mention as well, which is very important, which has to do with spreads. Spreads have recently widened significantly, especially in the lower end of the credit spread. CCC-type credits, obviously more distressed credits and below, have increased by over 400 basis points. They're at a 12 25 spread range, whereas the AAA, AA level is still around the 100, 110 basis points. It barely budged over the year. In fact, as you've seen, U.S. treasuries have tightened. So the spread issue, where we see spreads going, it's -- there's a lot of volatility right now. We think that also plays into it, people's appetite for going out. It's not really related to the base rate. It's related to the spreads. Anyway, long answer to your question, we are prepared in the business, as necessary, to manage our costs tightly through things like delaying hiring, looking at our bonus accruals as well as other investments that we might be making in things like technology and systems, et cetera. So we have certain flexibility we can build into our plan if we need to go through what could be a tough period. And one final comment. As you've heard me say many times in the past, we have a long-term optimism in this business, in fact, in all of our businesses. But we've always said that quarter-by-quarter, we could see some shaky quarters as markets respond to certain conditions."

Let me make a few -- maybe a few comments about Ratings and then one broader point just on the math of the margins for 2016. I think our -- maybe the caution view -- the cautionary view we're taking on margin expansion is not really based on cost management. I think our track record over the last few years would demonstrate that we're on that one. It's really more on the revenue side and particularly kind of given the issuance trends that we're seeing right now on Ratings. And we know how to manage cost in that business. Just to think about it, last year in 2015, we were actually able to expand margins with revenue down. That doesn't happen all too often. So from a longer-term point of view, we do think margin expansion is certainly possible with revenue growth and continued cost control within the Ratings business. I just do -- I just want to be clear, though, we are not targeting any magical outside goal here. We're just trying to manage our business in terms of what we think is right for the Ratings business. But just one overall point on the margins itself. We said 50 basis points, but you also have to kind of remember the math in terms of the addition of SNL this year. SNL is going to add to the portfolio about $200 million. It's coming in sort of around a mid-20s margin. You just do the math. That's diluted to the overall company margins of about 50 basis points. So if you were just to kind of look at like-for-like and exclude the impact of the SNL acquisition, our full year -- our margin guidance is really more in the range of 1 full point, which frankly is not that different than what we did in 2014. We -- I think we're 150 basis points last year. So I think it's not as different as it may look -- kind of looking -- when you really do factor in the math of the acquisition."

And one of the things they want to do is have more credit flow to SMEs and small financial institutions. So they think that the structured finance market is one of those. We agree that, that is going to be a slight growth area in 2016. In addition, there's another very important global trend about financial institutions. They're all looking at the optimal capital structure, in addition to the new rules related to capital. And there's this TLAC, which is total loss absorbing capacity, which is basically senior bonds which have a certain level of subordination to other senior debt depositors that we expect that banks are going to be issuing. So in general, we think that there will be increases in structured finance, increases in financial services and financial institutions, likely a decrease in overall corporate issuance globally, but probably a larger increase in noninvestment grade overall, especially at the spread levels which I mentioned earlier.

We did a scan of best practices, and our board decided that we should adopt what we call the 3-3-20-20 rule, which is that 20 investors -- up to 20 investors that own up to -- that own 3% of the shares or more for at least 3 years would be allowed to elect or to -- not elect, but to propose up to 2 or up to 20% of the board directors in a proxy.

It's designing some pretty similar products that leverage a great deal of data, some of which is common to both systems and leveraging some common technology.

We have a view that our business -- in fact, all of our businesses, we want to increase our focus on commercial activities, on customer relationships. We think it's part of our customer focus as well as part of our growth strategy. So Chris and the team are focused on doing 2 things. First of all, ensuring that we have high-quality relationships with all of our investors as well as our issuers, identifying markets where we could find new issuers or new pockets that credit services could be increased. In addition to that, we have another mandate, which is to look at other products and services that we could be providing to our issuers and to investors that could be coming out of the Ratings business, so things like Rating Evaluation Services and other types of analytical tools that might be valuable to the market. So Chris has a mandate to build out a sales team and a commercial team. He's absolutely 100% totally on the other side of the firewall from our analytical teams. And that was one of the other reasons we wanted to bring in somebody new to reinforce that firewall between our commercial activities and our analytical activities. So we have high expectations of that team, and we're very pleased that he came on board.
I think we might have a last question."

This morning, Jack and I will review our first quarter results. More broadly, however, I want to share the progress made to the company, as we increasingly focus on providing essential benchmarks, data and analytics to the financial and commodity markets.
Let me begin with the highlights of the first quarter. 
The strength of our portfolio was displayed as we delivered solid EPS growth despite weak global debt issuance. We completed our portfolio refinement with announcements that we have reached definitive agreements to sell J.D. Power for $1.1 billion to X group and Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluation Inc. and Credit Market Analysis to Intercontinental Exchange. 
A top priority in 2016 is the integration of SNL. We made tremendous strides with both the integration and the progress on important synergy targets.
We delivered 130 basis point improvement in the company's adjusted operating profit margin. Our share repurchases resulted in a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of 9 million shares over the past year. 
And finally, we are prepared for changing the name of the company to S&P Global tomorrow. This new name better reflects the company's global footprint in premium portfolio.
Now let's take a closer look at the first quarter results. 
While reported revenue grew 5%, organic revenue on a constant currency basis was unchanged. Weakness in S&P Ratings Services revenue was offset by growth in every other business, with particular strength in Platts and SNL. 
The company delivered 130 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as the result of the addition of SNL and tremendous progress made towards achieving SNL integration synergy target.
Margin improvement and share repurchases enabled the company to record an 8% increase in adjusted diluted EPS.
In the first quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in margins, except for Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. What it most notable, however, is the financial improvement in Market Intelligence.
Now let me turn to the individual businesses and I'll start with Market Intelligence. For division reporting purposes, we have branded S&P Capital IQ and SNL as S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
In the first quarter, revenue increased 27%, primarily due to addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 81%. And the adjusted operating margin advanced 900 basis points to 13.3%.
In 2016, successful integration of SNL was the top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL. And we recognized we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver return a on that investment. Our first quarter progress demonstrates our resolve to achieve these important targets. Most of the cost savings in the first quarter were the result of decreased staffing levels. Going forward, we will continue to target additional longer lead time synergies. Some of these items will require an investment.
Let me add a bit more color on first quarter revenue growth in the Market Intelligence business line. 
In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7%, principally through a high single-digit increase in desktop revenue. In addition, SNL revenue increased 13% compared to first quarter 2015, prior to our acquisition of SNL.
Global Risk Services revenue increased 8%, led by double-digit Ratings Express growth, which is increasingly used by customers to meet their regulatory reporting needs.
In the smallest category, Research and Advisory, revenue decreased 9% due to declines in equity research services.
Now let me turn to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. 
During the quarter, revenue decreased 9%. The ForEx impact was negligible. Adjusted operating profit decreased 12%, and the adjusted operating margin decreased 160 basis points to 45.6%. The results were driven by a slow start to global issuance in the quarter. While January and February had anemic global issuance, however, market conditions improved late in the quarter and March had the largest monthly debt issuance in the past year. Adjusted expenses declined 6%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and legal expenses.
The non-transaction revenue in the quarter increased 3%, or 5% excluding ForEx, with strength in surveillance fees in CRISIL partially offset by declines in rating evaluation service. Weak transaction revenue was caused by a 14% decline in global issuance, including a 64% decrease in global high-yield issuance, partially offset by a midteens growth in bank loan rating. The high-yield market has been particularly volatile and weak, with weak transaction volumes since the third quarter last year.
Let's take a look at issuance. 
U.S. issuance declined 24%, EMEA declined 10% and the Americas ex-U.S. declined 27%. Only Asia reported an increase in issuance with an 8% gain. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year decline in global issuance. 
If we look more closely at the largest markets, first quarter issuance in U.S. was down across the board year-on-year. Investment grade decreased 13%; high-yield, down 61%; public finance was down 9%; and structured finance also declined 40%, with declines in every asset class.
In Europe, investment grade decreased 3%. High yield was down 68%, while structured finance increased 7%, with growth in covered bonds. And in Asia, investment grade increased 10%. High yield was down 39%, and structured finance increased 4% due to RMBS and covered bonds.
During the quarter, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services issued its annual global refinancing study. This yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming 5 years. This chart illustrates data from the 2015 and 2016 studies. The 5-year period in the 2016 study showed a $600 billion increase in the total debt maturing versus the 2015 study. We used this study, along with other market-based data, that forecasts an anticipate issuance.
Taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high-yield maturities. Over the next 5 years, the level of high-yield debt maturity significantly increases each year, which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years.
Yesterday, Standard & Poor's issued their latest global issuance forecast. We still expect overall global issuance in 2016 to finish slightly lower than the level seen in 2015, with a decline of about 2%. Interest rate assumption in the U.S. have been pared back, which should give a boost to speculative grade issuers, though through the remainder of the year. However, the decline of the previous 3 months is expected to weigh down global trends.
During -- sorry, turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Revenue increased to 5%. Adjusted operating profit increased 5%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 67.7%. 
During the quarter, strength in revenue associated with exchange traded derivative activity and data licenses was partially offset by weakness in average ETF, AUM and OTC derivatives.
If we turn to the key business drivers, market volatility, particularly early in the quarter, resulted in increased trading activity of the exchange traded derivative. The average daily volume of the exchange traded derivative products based on S&P Dow Jones Indices increased 29%. Two key products, the S&P 500 futures and the CBOE volatility index assets and futures, known as the mix, had volume increases of 29% and 43%, respectively.
The exchange traded product industry continues to show strength, recording inflows of $70 billion in the first quarter. Despite AUM, based on S&P Dow Jones Indices, reaching $828 billion at the quarter-end, the highest since year-end 2014, average AUM during the quarter decreased 5% year-over-year. It's a testament to our business model and product scope. And with the year-over-year declines in ETF average AUM, increased volatility has generated sufficient trading related revenue to enable S&P Dow Jones Indices to deliver a top line growth.
On to Commodities & Commercial markets. 
Organic revenue increased 8% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide in acquisition. Adjusted operating profit increased 21%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 42.2%. Strength in Global Trading Services held Platts delivered revenue growth of 10%. Clearly, the biggest news is we announced that we have a reached a definitive agreement to sell J.D. Power, with an expected close in the third quarter. J.D. Power is an iconic brand and and his team has built a strong business over the past decade as part of McGraw Hill Financial. We wish and all of the J.D. Power employees a continued success.
Turning to our Platts. 
Global Trading Services booked double-digit revenue gains, primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and exchanges. This license revenue tends to be erratic from quarter-to-quarter based on trading activity. The core subscription business delivered high single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector, which had midteens growth due to strength in market data for oil price assessment, shipping data and forward price curve products.
Metals, agriculture and petrochemicals revenue grew mid-single digit, primarily to strength in the Singapore Exchange listed iron ore contracts. Over the course of the year, we anticipate revenue growth will moderate as low oil prices have led to consolidations and restructuring in the oil and energy industry.
On the business development front, we have great news. Mexico has entered into an exclusive agreement with Platts to utilize its oil and natural gas price data in the nation's pricing formula as part of the energy reform policy. Mexico is one of the largest exporters of gas globally. That's vast resources of oil and gas and influences flow patterns not just in North America, but around the world.
In closing, the breadth of our portfolio enabled the company to weather weaker -- to weather market volatility and still deliver solid results. With the strength of our portfolio, we are off to good start in 2016, and our adjusted diluted did EPS guidance remains unchanged at $5 to $5.15. While we made progress with the integration of SNL, it remains a top priority for the company, with much more to do. The next time I speak with you, we'll be named S&P Global with SPGI as our new ticker symbol, that's SPGI. We'll be ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday to mark the occasion.
With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call this morning, and I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer."

First, I will recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings and outline a reporting change we made to bring greater clarity to the disclosure of our recurring revenue. Then I will update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And wrapping up, I will provide some color on our guidance.
Let's start with the consolidated first quarter income statement. There are just a couple items I like to highlight. 
As you've just heard from Doug, we are off to a good start in 2016 despite weak bond issuance, which resulted in a year-on-year revenue decline at S&P Ratings Services. The balance of the portfolio, excluding Ratings, delivered strong 18% top line growth, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Taken in total, reported revenue grew 5%. We have faced several quarters in a row of relatively weak global issuance. And once again, thanks to the strength and breadth of our portfolio, combined with the timely addition of SNL Financial, we were able to sustain top line growth.
Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points, led by the outstanding profit growth and margin improvement in Market Intelligence. This division recorded an adjusted margin of 30%, an improvement of 9 points versus a year ago. This was driven by a strong topline growth, realized cost synergies and the addition of SNL profits. Looking forward, we anticipate Market Intelligence adjusted margins to generally continue in this new range.
Adjusted margins across Commodities & Commercial also improved almost 3 points. Interest expense was up over $24 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year. This stepped up level of interest expense will continue to create a difficult year-over-year [indiscernible] until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in over a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustain topline growth, margin improvement and share count reduction delivered an 8% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. 
Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled $15 million in the quarter. The first item consisted of a $24 million technology-related noncash impairment charge in Market Intelligence. This write-down is based on a change in strategy. The division was working towards sourcing certain data internally. Now have secured this data more economically from an outside source and are shutting down our internal capabilities. The second item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. And the last item is primarily disposition-related costs incurred to sell J.D. Power. Also, as Chip pointed out earlier in the call, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release.
At Exhibit 6 of today's press release tables, we have modified the way that we report recurring revenue to provide investors with more granularity in understanding our revenue mix. 
In the past, we reported ETFs and mutual fund assets under management based licensing revenue in S&P Dow Jones Indices as non-subscription revenue. Because of the ongoing nature of this revenue, we are now classifying them as assets linked fees. Admittedly, there were some volatility in assets under management, but the nature of this revenue stream is not as transaction-oriented as bond issuance. With this modified classification, more than 70% of our revenue is largely recurring in nature.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. 
At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90% was held outside the United States. We also have $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $472 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a drawdown on our current facility. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will fluctuate as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs.
Our first quarter free cash flow was $84 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements in related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first quarter free cash flow was $192 million. As a reminder, the first quarter free cash flow is seasonally weak due to the payment of annual incentives.
Now I want to return -- review our return of capital. 
During the quarter, the company bought approximately 2.2 million shares for $200 million. These purchases, combined with our dividend, totaled to approximately $296 million of cash return to shareholders in the quarter. The share repurchase program remains an important component of the company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate leveraging share repurchases to help mitigate the dilution from our recently announced asset sales, subject to market conditions.
Now let me provide some additional guidance perspective on our 2016 guidance. 
At this time, we are leaving all of our 2016 guidance unchanged, and it's summarized on this slide. This guidance continues to include the full year results of J.D. Power, S&P Securities Evaluation and Credit Market Analysis, all of which are pending sale. We will update guidance as necessary once these transactions are closed. While we will likely need to adjust our revenue guidance based on the timing of the divestiture of these assets, we anticipate using cash proceeds and ongoing share repurchase activity to mitigate the earnings per share dilution.
So in summary, we are off to a good start in 2016. The strength of our portfolio, with its high proportion of recurring revenue, combined with the continued progress on our cost-reduction programs, positions us well to manage through this volatile market conditions.
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for the Q&A session."

The sale, the pricing business is maybe a little bit more late in the third, early fourth, that would be sort of the timing that we're currently considering. In terms of the dilution for this year, for J.D. Power, if you assume sort of a midyear close, the EPS dilution is -- it would probably be roughly a dime. And at this point, I think our assumption we could use ongoing share purchase activity, combined with proceeds from sale, to largely mitigate the dilution within the year. And again, I think because the other the price of businesses will be a bit more back end loaded, I don't think it's going to be a big issue for at this point in time in terms of what we see for 2016."

We generally see that there is a high demand for data across the financial institutions, and increasingly, as well as corporate. Corporates also are managing balance sheets and have more and more requirements for data and analytics. There are a lot of different tools which are available. And one of our goals is to ensure that the kinds of products and services that we provide, whether it's our ratings, ratings information that goes through our Risk Services business, or more importantly, the S&P Capital IQ and SNL products that are used in many different ways, are tied and linked to the needs of the different constituencies that we are working with. So we've been forecasting, there is a combination of volume growth that we're continuing to see in a positive sense, as well as pricing in different ways that we can increase our growth. Remember that when we bought SNL, one of the deal theses for us was that we're also going to be able to see more international growth for the SNL product. We're in the very early stages of that. We are seeing some pilots here and there that are starting to pay off, but as part of our integration plan is to pursue the international aspects of SNL. And it's very early days at that, but that's another component that we're driving for our growth."

We have looked at the forward approach to what we think 2016 issuance is going to be. When we did our last call, we said that we thought it'd be down about 1% for the year. We've adjusted that now that it should be down about 2% for the year. In terms of components, industrials or you want to call them non-financials should be down about 6% to 10%. Financial services is one of the bright spots. There are a lot of needs for TLAC or a total loss absorbing capacity for banks around the globe, as well as some different programs which is attracting financial services issuance. Structured finance is likely to be down 4% to 9%. And public finance in the U.S. is also going to be down 8% to 12%. International public finance will be up a little bit 3% or 4%. But net-net, we expect that the total year issuance will be down about 2% to 2.3% for the entire year, and that's after a very, very weak first quarter, as you know. We've seen in April so far issuance that stayed similar to the March, especially on investment grade. Investment grade has stayed quite strong. Noninvestment grade issuance is still fairly weak into this second quarter. Throughout the year, we're going to continue to follow all the same management disciplines we've talked about in the past, having to do with being having a very aggressive commercial strategy, managing our costs in a way that are very prudent, while meeting all of our goals and objectives related to investments in technology and more efficiency in our business, as well as meeting of all our risk and compliance standards.

There is also what I would call bank originated securitization, which are traditional ABS products. It's credit cards, it's auto loans, things like that. Those continued to be very strong. Banks are all actively managing their balance sheet to have the optimal level of capital. So those types of issuances, bank specific have been a very, very busy, very, very important. The areas where we're seeing, I guess more, I guess I'd use the word volatility in issuance, which means it's going up and down, is in traditional RMBS, which has been quite weak, as well as CMBS. We do see a robust pipeline of CMBS deals right now, but we didn't see that 3 weeks ago, 6 weeks ago and 12 weeks ago. So the CMBS market is a little bit more volatile. It's one of the swing factors. There has been some tightening of the spreads on CMBS deals in United States over the last couple of weeks, and we do think that we're seeing -- because of that, we're getting a stronger pipeline. Anyway, just to give you of you a view again, again, bank, issuance, covered banks, bank-oriented securitization should be stronger, more steady. And then things like RMBS, CMBS around the globe, we're seeing more volatility in that. But we expect towards -- our expectations on this forecast also take into account refinancing. And there are certain refinancing of securitizations as well that are coming in through the second half of the year that we think will also come in the market."

We know obviously we have to do something to reduce the dilution from the sale of those businesses. So we do anticipate some pick up at this point in time as we look to the back half of the year. And then in terms of the leverage question, I think you've seen over the last year that we are methodically putting a little bit more debt into the balance sheet. We had 2 very successful bond raises last year. You've seen that we have used our short-term borrowing capabilities to flex, to continue to buy back relatively heavy in the Q1 timeframe, which is a time that we're a little -- we tend to be a little bit short in U.S. cash, but we know we have that flexibility on using short-term debt to sustain the program.

One, if you look at just the performance of the legacy S&P Cap IQ business last year in 2015, the lowest margin point of the year was Q1, and the legacy S&P Cap IQ business did improve their margins to sort of the mid-20 range and we look at the sec and third. So the run rate of the legacy S&P Cap IQ business was getting better. Then you overlay the profits from the SNL acquisition. Those 2 -- those were just significant, and combined with both businesses, growing very nicely on the top line. Then you start to layer in the synergies, and the synergies, we had given guidance earlier that we thought about 1/3 of the $100 million of the total synergies will be achieved in 2016, and I can tell you, we're very much on pace to deliver that based on what we've seen in the first quarter. So synergies did have a role in the expansion here, but it wasn't the only driver. And then in terms of the nature of what we saw in the first quarter, it was more G&A-related, and I think these longer-term cost opportunities around data, technology, commercial, et cetera, are more down the line.

We continue to invest in it aggressively, but we're also looking very cautiously at what kind of trends we're going to see in the industry overall. Just as an unrelated information, in the default in from the information from the Ratings business, there has been 67 defaults so far this year, of which, most of those, there were 16 of those were in the oil and gas industry and there were 9 from metals, mining and steel industry.

We are not quite sure where all of these different initiatives are going to land, but we have seen corporate investment grade issuance in Europe, even though it was weak, it seems to be picking up a little bit, so we expect there could be some pick up there. When it comes to rating evaluation Services, rating evaluation services is more linked to activity of IPOs, companies that are going to be going to the market for the first time and want to have a benchmark or some sort of an ability to know how they rate. We also see rating evaluation services that are done from M&A transaction. So what drives rating evaluation services is not necessarily issuance. It's much more related to IPOs, M&A activity, those are the links that are more important than that. And as you know, during the quarter, both IPOs and M&A, there were some big M&A headline deals, but there were not as much smaller M&A deals. And in addition to that, the IPO of the leader was a very, very weak. So some of those correlation factors were week.

But at the end of the day, they are not something that we believe was a core focus in terms of investment, in terms of growth. So given their size, we thought it was prudent to really focus Market Intelligence going forward, particularly with the SNL transaction, but there was that we had more than enough things to work on where we had larger more strategic scale position. So that was sort of the logic. In total, on an annualized basis, they're roughly $100 million in revenue, so that's why, and in terms of the dependent -- depending on the timing of the close, we'll see what the impact is to 2016.

So a part of that technology intangible was put up at the time of the acquisition. And the other half related to ongoing software developments at that point. And so that's why it was a little bit larger than normal for us, but I don't -- at this point in time, I don't anticipate an ongoing stream of this sort of -- we don't capitalize that much as it relates to software development in general, so I think the magnitude here, it will be fairly modest as we look forward."

This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management.
The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measure and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
In addition, I want to remind you that we now exclude deal-related amortization from our non-GAAP results.
Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events.

I would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of McGraw Hill Financial should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company.
We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors. And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 438-1247 subsequent to this call.

  Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. This morning, Jack and I will review our first quarter results. More broadly, however, I want to share the progress made at the company, as we increasingly focus on providing essential benchmarks, data and analytics to the financial and commodity markets.
Let me begin with the highlights of the first quarter.
The strength of our portfolio was displayed as we delivered solid EPS growth despite weak global debt issuance. We completed our portfolio refinement with announcements that we have reached definitive agreements to sell J.D. Power for $1.1 billion to XIO Group, and Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluation Inc. and Credit Market Analysis to Intercontinental Exchange.
A top priority in 2016 is the integration of SNL. We made tremendous strides with both the integration and the progress on important synergy targets.
We delivered 130 basis point improvement in the company's adjusted operating profit margin. Our share repurchases resulted in a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of 9 million shares over the past year.
And finally, we are prepared for change in the name of the company to S&P Global tomorrow. This new name better reflects the company's global footprint in premium portfolio.
Now let's take a closer look at the first quarter results.
While reported revenue grew 5%, organic revenue on a constant currency basis was unchanged. Weakness in S&P Ratings Services revenue was offset by growth in every other business, with particular strength in Platts and SNL.
The company delivered 130 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as a result of the addition of SNL and tremendous progress made towards achieving SNL integration synergy targets.
Margin improvement and share repurchases enabled the company to record an 8% increase in adjusted diluted EPS.
In the first quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in margins, except for Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. What it most notable, however, is the financial improvement in Market Intelligence.
Now let me turn to the individual businesses and I'll start with Market Intelligence. For division reporting purposes, we have branded S&P Capital IQ and SNL as S&P Global Market Intelligence.
In the first quarter, revenue increased 27%, primarily due to addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 81%. And the adjusted operating margin advanced 900 basis points to 13.3%.
In 2016, successful integration of SNL was the top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL. We recognized that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver a return on that investment. Our first quarter progress demonstrates our resolve to achieve these important targets. Most of the cost savings in the first quarter were the result of decreased staffing levels. Going forward, we will continue to target additional longer lead time synergies. Some of these items will require an investment.
Let me add a bit more color on first quarter revenue growth in the Market Intelligence business line.
In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7%, principally through a high single-digit increase in desktop revenue. In addition, SNL revenue increased 13% compared to first quarter 2015, prior to our acquisition of SNL.
Global Risk Services revenue increased 8%, led by double-digit Ratings Express growth, which is increasingly used by customers to meet their regulatory reporting needs.
In the smallest category, Research and Advisory, revenue decreased 9% due to declines in equity research services.
Now let me turn to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.
During the quarter, revenue decreased 9%. The ForEx impact was negligible. Adjusted operating profit decreased 12%, and the adjusted operating margin decreased 160 basis points to 45.6%. The results were driven by a slow start to global issuance in the quarter. While January and February had anemic global issuance, however, market conditions improved late in the quarter and March had the largest monthly debt issuance in the past year. Adjusted expenses declined 6%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and legal expenses.
The non-transaction revenue in the quarter increased 3%, or 5% excluding ForEx, with strength in surveillance fees and CRISIL partially offset by declines in Rating Evaluation Service. Weak transaction revenue was caused by a 14% decline in global issuance, including a 64% decrease in global high-yield issuance, partially offset by mid-teens growth in bank loan rating. The high-yield market has been particularly volatile and weak, with weak transaction volumes since the third quarter last year.
Let's take a look at issuance. 
U.S. issuance declined 24%, EMEA declined 10% and the Americas ex-U.S. declined 27%. Only Asia reported an increase in issuance with an 8% gain. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year decline in global issuance.
If we look more closely at the largest markets, first quarter issuance in U.S. was down across the board year-on-year. Investment grade decreased 13%; high-yield, down 61%; public finance was down 9%; and structured finance also declined 40%, with declines in every asset class.
In Europe, investment grade decreased 3%. High yield was down 68%, while structured finance increased 7%, with growth in covered bonds. And in Asia, investment grade increased 10%. High yield was down 39%, and structured finance increased 4% due to RMBS and covered bonds.
During the quarter, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services issued its annual global refinancing study. This yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming 5 years. This chart illustrates data from the 2015 and 2016 studies. The 5-year period in the 2016 study shows a $600 billion increase in the total debt maturing versus the 2015 study. We used this study, along with other market-based data, that forecasts an anticipate issuance.
Taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high-yield maturities. Over the next 5 years, the level of high-yield debt maturity significantly increases each year, which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years.
Yesterday, Standard & Poor's issued their latest global issuance forecast. We still expect overall global issuance in 2016 to finish slightly lower than the level seen in 2015, with a decline of about 2%. Interest rate assumption in the U.S. have been pared back, which should give a boost to speculative grade issuers, though through the remainder of the year. However, the decline of the previous 3 months is expected to weigh down global trends.
During -- sorry, turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Revenue increased 5%. Adjusted operating profit increased 5%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 67.7%.
During the quarter, strength in revenue associated with exchange-traded derivative activity and data licenses was partially offset by weakness in average ETF, AUM and OTC derivatives.
If we turn to the key business drivers, market volatility, particularly early in the quarter, resulted in increased trading activity of the exchange-traded derivative. The average daily volume of the exchange-traded derivative products based on S&P Dow Jones Indices increased 29%. Two key products, the E-mini S&P 500 Futures and the CBOE Volatility Index options and futures, known as the  VIX, had volume increases of 29% and 43%, respectively.
The exchange-traded product industry continues to show strength, recording inflows of $70 billion in the first quarter. Despite AUM, based on S&P Dow Jones Indices, reaching $828 billion at the quarter-end, the highest since year-end 2014, average AUM during the quarter decreased 5% year-over-year. It's a testament to our business model and product scope. And with the year-over-year declines in ETF average AUM, increased volatility has generated sufficient trading-related revenue to enable S&P Dow Jones Indices to deliver top line growth.
On to Commodities & Commercial markets.
Organic revenue increased 8% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide in Petromedia acquisition. Adjusted operating profit increased 21%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 42.2%. Strength in Global Trading Services helped Platts deliver revenue growth of 10%. Clearly, the biggest news is the announcement that we have reached a definitive agreement to sell J.D. Power, with an expected close in the third quarter. J.D. Power is an iconic brand. And Fin O'Neill and his team have built a strong business over the past decade as part of McGraw Hill Financial. We wish Fin and all of the J.D. Power employees a continued success.
Turning to our Platts.
Global Trading Services booked double-digit revenue gains, primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE exchanges. This license revenue tends to be erratic from quarter-to-quarter based on trading activity. The core subscription business delivered high single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector, which had mid-teens growth due to strength in market data for oil price assessment, shipping data and forward price curve products.
Metals, Agriculture & Petrochemicals revenue grew mid-single digit, primarily to strength at the Singapore Exchange-listed TSI Iron Ore contract. Over the course of the year, we anticipate revenue growth will moderate as low oil prices have led to consolidations and restructuring in the oil and energy industry.
On the business development front, we have great news. Mexico has entered into an exclusive agreement with Platts to utilize its oil and natural gas price data in the nation's pricing formula as part of the energy reform policy. Mexico is one of the largest exporters of gas globally. There is a vast resource of the oil and gas and influences flow patterns not just in North America, but around the world.
In closing, the breadth of our portfolio enabled the company to weather weaker -- to weather market volatility and still deliver solid results. With the strength of our portfolio, we are off to a good start in 2016, and our adjusted diluted EPS guidance remains unchanged at $5 to $5.15. While we made progress with the integration of SNL, it remains a top priority for the company, with much more to do. The next time I speak with you, we'll be named S&P Global with SPGI as our new ticker symbol, that's S-P-G-I. We'll be ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday to mark the occasion.
With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. And now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer."

  Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. 
First, I will recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings and outline a reporting change we made to bring greater clarity to the disclosure of our recurring revenue. Then I will update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And wrapping up, I will provide some color on our guidance.
Let's start with the consolidated first quarter income statement. There are just a couple items I want to highlight.
As you've just heard from Doug, we are off to a good start in 2016 despite weak bond issuance, which resulted in a year-on-year revenue decline at S&P Ratings Services. The balance of the portfolio, excluding Ratings, delivered strong 18% top line growth, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Taken in total, reported revenue grew 5%. We have faced several quarters in a row of relatively weak global issuance. And once again, thanks to the strength and breadth of our portfolio, combined with the timely addition of SNL Financial, we were able to sustain top line growth.
Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points, led by the outstanding profit growth and margin improvement in Market Intelligence. This division recorded an adjusted margin of 30%, an improvement of 9 points versus a year ago. This was driven by a strong topline growth, realized cost synergies and the addition of SNL profits. Looking forward, we anticipate Market Intelligence adjusted margins to generally continue in this new range.
Adjusted margins across Commodities & Commercial also improved almost 3 points. Interest expense was up over $24 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year. This stepped up level of interest expense will continue to create a difficult year-over-year [indiscernible] until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in over a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustain top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction delivered an 8% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business.
Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled $15 million in the quarter. The first item consisted of a $24 million technology-related noncash impairment charge in Market Intelligence. This write-down is based on a change in strategy. The division was working towards sourcing certain data internally. Now we have secured this data more economically from an outside source and are shutting down our internal capabilities. The second item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. And the last item is primarily disposition-related costs incurred to sell J.D. Power. Also, as Chip pointed out earlier in the call, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release.
At Exhibit 6 of today's press release tables, we have modified the way that we report recurring revenue to provide investors with more granularity in understanding our revenue mix.
In the past, we reported ETFs and mutual fund assets under management based licensing revenue in S&P Dow Jones Indices as non-subscription revenue. Because of the ongoing nature of this revenue, we are now classifying them as assets-linked fees. Admittedly, there were some volatility in assets under management, but the nature of this revenue stream is not as transaction-oriented as bond issuance. With this modified classification, more than 70% of our revenue is largely recurring in nature.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. 
At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $472 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a drawdown on our current facility. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will fluctuate as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs.
Our first quarter free cash flow was $84 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first quarter free cash flow was $192 million. As a reminder, the first quarter free cash flow is seasonally weak due to the payment of annual incentives.
Now I want to return -- review our return of capital.
During the quarter, the company bought approximately 2.2 million shares for $200 million. These purchases, combined with our dividend, totaled to approximately $296 million of cash return to shareholders in the quarter. The share repurchase program remains an important component of the company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate leveraging share repurchases to help mitigate the dilution from our recently announced asset sales, subject to market conditions.
Now let me provide some additional guidance perspective on our 2016 guidance.
At this time, we are leaving all of our 2016 guidance unchanged, and it's summarized on this slide. This guidance continues to include the full year results of J.D. Power, S&P Securities Evaluation and Credit Market Analysis, all of which are pending sale. We will update guidance as necessary once these transactions are closed. While we will likely need to adjust our revenue guidance based on the timing of the divestiture of these assets, we anticipate using cash proceeds and ongoing share repurchase activity to mitigate the earnings per share dilution.
So in summary, we are off to a good start in 2016. The strength of our portfolio, with its high proportion of recurring revenue, combined with the continued progress on our cost-reduction programs, positions us well to manage through this volatile market conditions.
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for the Q&A session."

  First of all, on the first part of your question, Manav, this is Jack. I don't think there is anything unusual about the closing conditions within these transactions. I suspect -- I think, I do anticipate that perhaps J.D. Power may close a bit sooner. I would point to the middle or early third quarter. The sale, the pricing businesses maybe a little bit more late in the third, early fourth, that would be sort of the timing that we're currently considering. In terms of the dilution for this year, for J.D. Power, if you assume sort of a midyear close, the EPS dilution is -- it would probably be roughly $0.10. And at this point, I think our assumption we could use ongoing share purchase activity, combined with proceeds from sale, to largely mitigate the dilution within the year. And again, I think because of the other -- the other is the pricing businesses will be a bit more backend loaded, I don't think it's going to be a big issue for -- at this point in time, in terms of what we see for 2016."

So during the quarter, we've continued to invest for the long run in the business. It's very important for us to continue to invest in technology, to ensure that we're meeting all of the global regulatory requirements. But we, at the same time, have also been able to ensure that we have the right level of staffing for the level of transactions that are coming out. We have an opportunity to look at the -- our accrual for our bonuses at the end of the year.

  Yes. So first of all, we've been looking very carefully at the broader set of demands and information requirements from our customers, going out to meet with banks with buy-side/sell-side, in addition, digging deeper into different classes of people within those organizations, so portfolio managers, investment managers, risk managers, CFOs, treasurers, et cetera. We generally see that there is a high demand for data across the financial institutions, and increasingly, as well as corporates. Corporates also are managing balance sheets and have more and more requirements for data and analytics. There are a lot of different tools which are available. And one of our goals is to ensure that the kinds of products and services that we provide, whether it's our ratings, ratings information that goes through our Risk Services business, or more importantly, the S&P Capital IQ and SNL products that are used in many different ways, are tied and linked to the needs of the different constituencies that we are working with. So we've been forecasting, there is a combination of volume growth that we're continuing to see in a positive sense, as well as pricing in different ways that we can increase our growth. Remember that when we bought SNL, one of the deal theses for us was that we're also going to be able to see more international growth for the SNL product. We're in the very early stages of that. We are seeing some pilots here and there that are starting to pay off, but it's part of our integration plan is to pursue the international aspects of SNL. And it's very early days at that, but that's another component that we're driving for our growth."

  Let me give you, start by just a little bit of an outlook. We gave you a quick slide on that in our slides we just gave you. We have looked at the forward approach to what we think 2016 issuance is going to be. When we did our last call, we said that we thought it'd be down about 1% for the year. We've adjusted that now that it should be down about 2% for the year. In terms of components, industrials or you want to call them non-financials should be down about 6% to 10%. Financial services is one of the bright spots. There are a lot of needs for TLAC or a total loss absorbing capacity for banks around the globe, as well as some different programs which is attracting financial services issuance. Structured finance is likely to be down 4% to 9%. And public finance in the U.S. is also going to be down 8% to 12%. International public finance will be up a little bit 3% or 4%. But net-net, we expect that the total year issuance will be down about 2% to 2.3% for the entire year, and that's after a very, very weak first quarter, as you know. We've seen in April, so far, issuance that stayed similar to the March, especially on investment grade. Investment grade has stayed quite strong. Noninvestment grade issuance is still fairly weak into this second quarter. Throughout the year, we're going to continue to follow all the same management disciplines we've talked about in the past, having to do with being having a very aggressive commercial strategy, managing our costs in a way that are very prudent, while meeting all of our goals and objectives related to investments in technology and more efficiency in our business, as well as meeting all of our risk and compliance standards. As you see, we've kept our guidance at the same level despite having started off with a weak first quarter because we believe that, in addition to what we've seen across all of our businesses, that we've got conditions to maintain that same level of guidance."

But particularly now, as we now have the benefits of bringing together the scale benefits of SNL with our legacy S&P Cap IQ businesses, we think over time, we'll have a much more compelling product offering, particularly as we move forward. On the margin question, well, obviously, we're very, very pleased with the step-up to approximately 30% margins in the business. I think that's generally the new range for the business for 2016. But I would think over the long term, as we continue to realize synergies, which we obviously make progress on, but we continue to have a good number ahead of us, we think that there is some upside to the margin as we go into '17 and beyond."

  Yes, a couple things. So first of all, there have been -- we continue to see a very strong covered bond market in Europe and in Asia. There's also what I would call bank-originated securitization, which are traditional ABS products. It's credit cards, it's auto loans, things like that. Those continue to be very strong. Banks are all actively managing their balance sheets to have the optimal level of capital. So those types of issuances, bank specific, have been very, very busy, very, very important. The areas where we're seeing more, I guess, I'd use the word volatility in issuance, which means it's going up and down, is in traditional RMBS, which has been quite weak, as well as CMBS. We do see a robust pipeline of CMBS deals right now, but we didn't see that 3 weeks ago, 6 weeks ago and 12 weeks ago. So the CMBS market is a little bit more volatile. It's one of the swing factors. There has been some tightening of the spreads on CMBS deals in the United States over the last couple of weeks, and we do think that we're seeing -- because of that, we're getting a stronger pipeline. Anyway, so just to give you a view again, bank issuance, covered bonds, bank-oriented securitization should be stronger, more steady. And then things like RMBS, CMBS around the globe, we're seeing more volatility in that. But we expect towards -- our expectations on this forecast also take into account refinancing. And there are certain refinancing of securitizations as well that are coming in through the second half of the year that we think will also come to the market."

And we have pilot programs in Asia and in EMEA that we've started launching. I think that it would be better if you gave us a few more months before we started thinking about what kind of disclosure and what kind of progress we would talk about on that. But just you didn't ask the question, but to talk a little bit about what that progress is, we mentioned in our remarks that a lot of that progress has been around initial cost reductions based on people leaving the organization. And there's other synergies, which will start coming through that have longer tails and maybe require some investments in areas like technology operations. And then the top line, as we've said, will probably take a little bit longer overall. And when we gave our guidance in the last quarterly call, we updated it, and we said that the revenue synergies, we're going to probably take a little bit longer, more along the original thesis that we had produced, which was around between now and 2019."

So that's a nice growth business for us, but it was really high growth in the first quarter, kind of given the volatility that was there. So I'm not sure that it will be there every quarter or quite heartened by the progress. There was a bit of ForEx benefit to the margin improvement. So I'd say about 1/3 of margin improvement was we did get some ForEx benefit. But in general, where we think that -- I think there's -- that's very solid right now."

  That's a general range, Peter, in terms of based plan assumptions. I think that has to be -- based on our current view, I think going back to what we said earlier, I think it has to be -- we have to flex that upwards, as we certainly get at least into the back half of the year, kind of given the proceeds from the asset sales that we see coming. And obviously, we need to do something to reduce the dilution from the sale of those businesses. So we do anticipate some pickup at this point in time as we look to the back half of the year. And then in terms of the leverage question, I think you've seen over the last year that we are methodically putting a little bit more debt into the balance sheet. We had 2 very successful bond raises last year. You've seen that we have used our short-term borrowing capabilities to flex, to continue to buy back relatively heavy in the Q1 timeframe, which is a time that we're a little -- we tend to be a little bit short in U.S. cash. But we know we have that flexibility on using short-term debt to sustain the program. And we're going to -- we're not -- when we acknowledged that we still have more borrowing flexibilities that we'll consider in terms of the pacing of future activity."

  There's a couple of components. It is a big -- obviously a big improvement in the margins. So it is -- maybe it's important to comment on a couple important pieces here. One, if you look at just the performance of the legacy S&P Cap IQ business last year in 2015, the lowest margin point of the year was Q1. And the legacy S&P Cap IQ business did improve their margins to sort of the mid-20 range and when you looked into the second and third. So the run rate of the legacy S&P Cap IQ business was getting better. Then you overlay the profits from the SNL acquisition. Those 2 -- those were just significant and, combined with both businesses, growing very nicely on the top line. Then you start to layer in the synergies, and the synergies, we had given guidance earlier that we thought about 1/3 of the $100 million of total synergies would be achieved in 2016. And I can tell you, we're very much on pace to deliver that based on what we've seen in the first quarter. So synergies did have a role in the expansion here, but it wasn't the only driver. And then in terms of the nature of what we saw in the first quarter, it was more G&A-related. And I think these longer-term cost opportunities around data, technology, commercial, et cetera, are more down the line. So that's some of the work that we have ahead of us."

We want to have the right kind of culture around the organization of understanding the importance of customers and customer data and analytics. In addition to that, we have a buy in and approach for each of our businesses to hire new organizations or upgrade or promote people within the organization to have these commercial organizations that are focused on the markets. They're doing a new approach or an upgraded approach to market sizing, to market segmentation, et cetera. Each of the businesses now are very far along with those processes. Although I'd say that we don't necessarily have all of the people in place, I do think it's part of our ongoing approach to growing the business. We think the top line growth is the best way to improve our margins and to improve the business overall, and as well as having a portfolio now which has very scalable global businesses. So we are making a lot of progress in that area. We have very strong sales heads in Ratings, in our Indices business.

We expect, over time, there could be some challenges towards the end of the year on some of the renewals coming up. So we do -- we're very aware that we're not in an environment that's a robust high growth, high-investment environment in the oil and petroleum industry overall. As Jack mentioned, one of the reasons that our earnings were so robust is because of our trading, our transaction services businesses in that area. So Platts has been a fantastic growth business for us. We like the business. We continue to invest in it aggressively, but we are also looking very cautiously at what kind of trends we're going to see in the industry overall. Just as an unrelated information, in the default from the information from the Ratings business, there's been 67 defaults so far this year, of which most of those -- there were 16 of those that were in the oil and gas industry, and there were 9 from metals, mining and steel industry. So it's been a large number of those that the defaulters have been in, in that industry, something that we also watch carefully to see any kind of correlation across our businesses that we can use to pick up for our forecasting."

  Yes, it is right. The information, the benchmark side has always been classified in recurring revenue. The derivative trading remains in the transaction side because that can be very volatile. As we just looked at the revenue stream we have from assets under management, while there is some volatility there, it's not like it goes to 0, like nothing ever -- it's not as volatile as -- that you ever see in bond issuance. So that's why we broke it out as a third category because it does -- we do believe that it has sort of different revenue characteristics.

  I just had a quick question on Ratings. It seems like the maturities, especially in high yield, are increasing as we look forward. But you mentioned that the Rating Evaluation Services and kind of the disintermediation driver has been decreasing. So I was curious if this ECB announcement about purchasing corporate bonds is having any impact on either one of these. Maybe it's starting to drive Rating Evaluation Services or maybe it's causing some of these upcoming maturities in high yield to be pulled forward into this year. Just any thoughts on that topic?"

  Yes. On the first one, I'm going to answer the second part of your question first, to the ECB. We've seen that the ECB's approach to being able to purchase very large portions of new bond issuance, we expect that, that could have some positive impact on issuance. At the same time, there's -- the ECB also has some liquidity programs that's providing the banks that make it actually attractive for them to keep assets on their balance sheet. So there might be some increase in loan activity. We're not quite sure where all of these different initiatives are going to land, but we have seen corporate investment grade issuance in Europe. Even though it was weak, it seems to be picking up a little bit. So we expect there could be some pickup there. When it comes to Rating Evaluation Services, Rating Evaluation Services is more linked to activity of IPOs,  that are going to be -- going to the market for the first time and want to have a benchmark or some sort of an ability to know how they rate. We also see Rating Evaluation Services that are done from M&A transactions. So what drives Rating Evaluation Services is not necessarily issuance, it's much more related to IPOs, to M&A activity. Those are the links that are more important on that. And as you know, during the quarter, both IPOs and M&A, there were some big M&A headline deals, but there was not as much smaller M&A deals. And in addition to that, the IPO activity was very, very weak. So some of those correlation factors were weak. So we watch RES. It's a business for us that we actually use sometimes as a leading indicator for M&A activity itself."

They are not -- I wouldn't classify it as high growth, but I would say solid growth, very sticky, good margins. But at the end of the day, they are not something that was a core focus in terms of investment, in terms of growth. So given their size, we thought it was prudent to really focus Market Intelligence going forward, particularly with the SNL transaction, that there was -- that we had more than enough things to work on, where we had larger, more strategic scale position. So that was sort of the logic of it. They are -- in total, on an annualized basis, they're roughly $100 million in revenue. So that's why, in terms of depending on the timing of the close, we'll see what the impact is to 2016. And we're just working through all the final closing conditions and regulatory approvals, and that's why we do anticipate to close a little bit later in the year."

So a part of that technology intangible was put up at the time of the acquisition and the other half related to ongoing software developments at that point. And so that's why it was a little bit larger than normal for us, but I don't -- at this point in time, I don't anticipate an ongoing stream of these sort of -- we don't capitalize that much as it relates to software development in general.

This morning, Jack and I will review our first quarter results. More broadly, however, I want to share the progress made at the company, as we increasingly focus on providing essential benchmarks, data and analytics to the financial and commodity markets.
Let me begin with the highlights of the first quarter.
The strength of our portfolio was displayed as we delivered solid EPS growth despite weak global debt issuance. We completed our portfolio refinement with announcements that we have reached definitive agreements to sell J.D. Power for $1.1 billion to XIO Group, and Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluation Inc. and Credit Market Analysis to Intercontinental Exchange.
A top priority in 2016 is the integration of SNL. We made tremendous strides with both the integration and the progress on important synergy targets.
We delivered 130 basis point improvement in the company's adjusted operating profit margin. Our share repurchases resulted in a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of 9 million shares over the past year.
And finally, we are prepared for changing the name of the company to S&P Global tomorrow. This new name better reflects the company's global footprint in premium portfolio.
Now let's take a closer look at the first quarter results.
While reported revenue grew 5%, organic revenue on a constant currency basis was unchanged. Weakness in S&P Ratings Services revenue was offset by growth in every other business, with particular strength in Platts and SNL.
The company delivered 130 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as a result of the addition of SNL and tremendous progress made towards achieving SNL integration synergy targets.
Margin improvement and share repurchases enabled the company to record an 8% increase in adjusted diluted EPS.
In the first quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in margins, except for Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. What it most notable, however, is the financial improvement in Market Intelligence.
Now let me turn to the individual businesses and I'll start with Market Intelligence. For division reporting purposes, we have rebranded S&P Capital IQ and SNL as S&P Global Market Intelligence.
In the first quarter, revenue increased 27%, primarily due to addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 81%. And the adjusted operating margin advanced 900 basis points to 30.3%.
In 2016, successful integration of SNL was the top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL. We recognized that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver a return on that investment. Our first quarter progress demonstrates our resolve to achieve these important targets. Most of the cost savings in the first quarter were the result of decreased staffing levels. Going forward, we will continue to target additional longer lead time synergies. Some of these items will require an investment.
Let me add a bit more color on first quarter revenue growth in the Market Intelligence business line.
In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7%, principally through a high single-digit increase in desktop revenue. In addition, SNL revenue increased 13% compared to first quarter 2015, prior to our acquisition of SNL.
Global Risk Services revenue increased 8%, led by double-digit Ratings Express growth, which is increasingly used by customers to meet their regulatory reporting needs.
In the smallest category, Research and Advisory, revenue decreased 9% due to declines in equity research services.
Now let me turn to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.
During the quarter, revenue decreased 9%. The ForEx impact was negligible. Adjusted operating profit decreased 12%, and the adjusted operating margin decreased 160 basis points to 45.6%. The results were driven by a slow start to global issuance in the quarter. While January and February had anemic global issuance, however, market conditions improved late in the quarter and March had the largest monthly debt issuance in the past year. Adjusted expenses declined 6%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and legal expenses.
The non-transaction revenue in the quarter increased 3%, or 5% excluding ForEx, with strength in surveillance fees and CRISIL partially offset by declines in Rating Evaluation Service. Weak transaction revenue was caused by a 14% decline in global issuance, including a 64% decrease in global high-yield issuance, partially offset by mid-teens growth in bank loan rating. The high-yield market has been particularly volatile and weak, with weak transaction volumes since the third quarter last year.
Let's take a look at issuance. 
U.S. issuance declined 24%, EMEA declined 10% and the Americas ex-U.S. declined 27%. Only Asia reported an increase in issuance with an 8% gain. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year decline in global issuance.
If we look more closely at the largest markets, first quarter issuance in U.S. was down across the board year-on-year. Investment grade decreased 13%; high-yield, down 61%; public finance was down 9%; and structured finance also declined 40%, with declines in every asset class.
In Europe, investment grade decreased 3%. High yield was down 68%, while structured finance increased 7%, with growth in covered bonds. And in Asia, investment grade increased 10%. High yield was down 39%, and structured finance increased 4% due to RMBS and covered bonds.
During the quarter, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services issued its annual global refinancing study. This yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming 5 years. This chart illustrates data from the 2015 and 2016 studies. The 5-year period in the 2016 study shows a $600 billion increase in the total debt maturing versus the 2015 study. We used this study, along with other market-based data, that forecasts an anticipate issuance.
Taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high-yield maturities. Over the next 5 years, the level of high-yield debt maturity significantly increases each year, which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years.
Yesterday, Standard & Poor's issued their latest global issuance forecast. We still expect overall global issuance in 2016 to finish slightly lower than the level seen in 2015, with a decline of about 2%. Interest rate assumption in the U.S. have been pared back, which should give a boost to speculative grade issuers, though through the remainder of the year. However, the decline of the previous 3 months is expected to weigh down global trends.
During -- sorry, turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Revenue increased 5%. Adjusted operating profit increased 5%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 67.7%.
During the quarter, strength in revenue associated with exchange-traded derivative activity and data licenses was partially offset by weakness in average ETF, AUM and OTC derivatives.
If we turn to the key business drivers, market volatility, particularly early in the quarter, resulted in increased trading activity of the exchange-traded derivative. The average daily volume of the exchange-traded derivative products based on S&P Dow Jones Indices increased 29%. Two key products, the E-mini S&P 500 Futures and the CBOE Volatility Index options and futures, known as the VIX, had volume increases of 29% and 43%, respectively.
The exchange-traded product industry continues to show strength, recording inflows of $70 billion in the first quarter. Despite AUM, based on S&P Dow Jones Indices, reaching $828 billion at the quarter-end, the highest since year-end 2014, average AUM during the quarter decreased 5% year-over-year. It's a testament to our business model and product scope. And with the year-over-year declines in ETF average AUM, increased volatility has generated sufficient trading-related revenue to enable S&P Dow Jones Indices to deliver top line growth.
On to Commodities & Commercial markets.
Organic revenue increased 8% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide in Petromedia acquisition. Adjusted operating profit increased 21%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 42.2%. Strength in Global Trading Services helped Platts deliver revenue growth of 10%. Clearly, the biggest news is the announcement that we have reached a definitive agreement to sell J.D. Power, with an expected close in the third quarter. J.D. Power is an iconic brand. And Fin O'Neill and his team have built a strong business over the past decade as part of McGraw Hill Financial. We wish Fin and all of the J.D. Power employees a continued success.
Turning to our Platts.
Global Trading Services booked double-digit revenue gains, primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE exchanges. This license revenue tends to be erratic from quarter-to-quarter based on trading activity. The core subscription business delivered high single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector, which had mid-teens growth due to strength in market data for oil price assessment, shipping data and forward price curve products.
Metals, Agriculture & Petrochemicals revenue grew mid-single digit, primarily to strength at the Singapore Exchange-listed TSI Iron Ore contract. Over the course of the year, we anticipate revenue growth will moderate as low oil prices have led to consolidations and restructuring in the oil and energy industry.
On the business development front, we have great news. Mexico has entered into an exclusive agreement with Platts to utilize its oil and natural gas price data in the nation's pricing formula as part of the energy reform policy. Mexico is one of the largest exporters of gas globally. There is a vast resource of the oil and gas and influences flow patterns not just in North America, but around the world.
In closing, the breadth of our portfolio enabled the company to weather weaker -- to weather market volatility and still deliver solid results. With the strength of our portfolio, we are off to a good start in 2016, and our adjusted diluted EPS guidance remains unchanged at $5 to $5.15. While we made progress with the integration of SNL, it remains a top priority for the company, with much more to do. The next time I speak with you, we'll be named S&P Global with SPGI as our new ticker symbol, that's S-P-G-I. We'll be ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday to mark the occasion.
With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. And now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer."

First, I will recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings and outline a reporting change we made to bring greater clarity to the disclosure of our",980,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. 
First, I will recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings and outline a reporting change we made to bring greater clarity to the disclosure of our recurring revenue. Then I will update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And wrapping up, I will provide some color on our guidance.
Let's start with the consolidated first quarter income statement. There are just a couple items I want to highlight.
As you've just heard from Doug, we are off to a good start in 2016 despite weak bond issuance, which resulted in a year-on-year revenue decline at S&P Ratings Services. The balance of the portfolio, excluding Ratings, delivered strong 18% top line growth, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Taken in total, reported revenue grew 5%. We have faced several quarters in a row of relatively weak global issuance. And once again, thanks to the strength and breadth of our portfolio, combined with the timely addition of SNL Financial, we were able to sustain top line growth.
Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points, led by the outstanding profit growth and margin improvement in Market Intelligence. This division recorded an adjusted margin of 30%, an improvement of 9 points versus a year ago. This was driven by a strong topline growth, realized cost synergies and the addition of SNL profits. Looking forward, we anticipate Market Intelligence adjusted margins to generally continue in this new range.
Adjusted margins across Commodities & Commercial also improved almost 3 points. Interest expense was up over $24 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year. This stepped up level of interest expense will continue to create a difficult year-over-year [indiscernible] until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in over a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustain top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction delivered an 8% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business.
Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled $15 million in the quarter. The first item consisted of a $24 million technology-related noncash impairment charge in Market Intelligence. This write-down is based on a change in strategy. The division was working towards sourcing certain data internally. Now we have secured this data more economically from an outside source and are shutting down our internal capabilities. The second item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. And the last item is primarily disposition-related costs incurred to sell J.D. Power. Also, as Chip pointed out earlier in the call, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release.
At Exhibit 6 of today's press release tables, we have modified the way that we report recurring revenue to provide investors with more granularity in understanding our revenue mix.
In the past, we reported ETFs and mutual fund assets under management based licensing revenue in S&P Dow Jones Indices as non-subscription revenue. Because of the ongoing nature of this revenue, we are now classifying them as assets-linked fees. Admittedly, there were some volatility in assets under management, but the nature of this revenue stream is not as transaction-oriented as bond issuance. With this modified classification, more than 70% of our revenue is largely recurring in nature.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. 
At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $472 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a drawdown on our credit facility. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will fluctuate as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs.
Our first quarter free cash flow was $84 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first quarter free cash flow was $192 million. As a reminder, the first quarter free cash flow is seasonally weak due to the payment of annual incentives.
Now I want to return -- review our return of capital.
During the quarter, the company bought approximately 2.2 million shares for $200 million. These purchases, combined with our dividend, totaled to approximately $296 million of cash returned to shareholders in the quarter. The share repurchase program remains an important component of the company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate leveraging share repurchases to help mitigate the dilution from our recently announced asset sales, subject to market conditions.
Now let me provide some additional guidance perspective on our 2016 guidance.
At this time, we are leaving all of our 2016 guidance unchanged, and it's summarized on this slide. This guidance continues to include the full year results of J.D. Power, S&P Securities Evaluation and Credit Market Analysis, all of which are pending sale. We will update guidance as necessary once these transactions are closed. While we will likely need to adjust our revenue guidance based on the timing of the divestiture of these assets, we anticipate using cash proceeds and ongoing share repurchase activity to mitigate the earnings per share dilution.
So in summary, we are off to a good start in 2016. The strength of our portfolio, with its high proportion of recurring revenue, combined with the continued progress on our cost-reduction programs, positions us well to manage through these volatile market conditions.
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for the Q&A session."

The sale, the pricing businesses maybe a little bit more late in the third, early fourth, that would be sort of the timing that we're currently considering. In terms of the dilution for this year, for J.D. Power, if you assume sort of a midyear close, the EPS dilution is -- it would probably be roughly $0.10. And at this point, I think our assumption we could use ongoing share purchase activity, combined with proceeds from sale, to largely mitigate the dilution within the year. And again, I think because of the other -- the other is the pricing businesses will be a bit more backend loaded, I don't think it's going to be a big issue for -- at this point in time, in terms of what we see for 2016."

So first of all, we've been looking very carefully at the broader set of demands and information requirements from our customers, going out to meet with banks with buy-side/sell-side, in addition, digging deeper into different classes of people within those organizations, so portfolio managers, investment bankers, risk managers, CFOs, treasurers, et cetera. We generally see that there is a high demand for data across the financial institutions, and increasingly, as well as corporates. Corporates also are managing balance sheets and have more and more requirements for data and analytics. There are a lot of different tools which are available. And one of our goals is to ensure that the kinds of products and services that we provide, whether it's our ratings, ratings information that goes through our Risk Services business, or more importantly, the S&P Capital IQ and SNL products that are used in many different ways, are tied and linked to the needs of the different constituencies that we are working with. So we've been forecasting, there is a combination of volume growth that we're continuing to see in a positive sense, as well as pricing in different ways that we can increase our growth. Remember that when we bought SNL, one of the deal pieces for us was that we're also going to be able to see more international growth for the SNL product. We're in the very early stages of that. We are seeing some pilots here and there that are starting to pay off, but it's part of our integration plan is to pursue the international aspects of SNL. And it's very early days at that, but that's another component that we're driving for our growth."

We have looked at the forward approach to what we think 2016 issuance is going to be. When we did our last call, we said that we thought it'd be down about 1% for the year. We've adjusted that now that it should be down about 2% for the year. In terms of components, industrials or you want to call them non-financials should be down about 6% to 10%. Financial services is one of the bright spots. There are a lot of needs for TLAC or a total loss absorbing capacity for banks around the globe, as well as some different programs which is attracting financial services issuance. Structured finance is likely to be down 4% to 9%. And public finance in the U.S. is also going to be down 8% to 12%. International public finance will be up a little bit 3% or 4%. But net-net, we expect that the total year issuance will be down about 2% to 2.3% for the entire year, and that's after a very, very weak first quarter, as you know. We've seen in April, so far, issuance that stayed similar to the March, especially on investment grade. Investment grade has stayed quite strong. Noninvestment grade issuance is still fairly weak into this second quarter. Throughout the year, we're going to continue to follow all the same management disciplines we've talked about in the past, having to do with being having a very aggressive commercial strategy, managing our costs in a way that are very prudent, while meeting all of our goals and objectives related to investments in technology and more efficiency in our business, as well as meeting all of our risk and compliance standards.

And how do you offset or how do you think about the growth trajectory in the margins in that business for '16 going forward?"

So I mean, I don't know if we'd point to anything fundamentally having changed in that in the overall market environment for Market Intelligence. It is a competitive marketplace out there. But particularly now, as we now have the benefits of bringing together the scale benefits of SNL with our legacy S&P Cap IQ businesses, we think over time, we'll have a much more compelling product offering, particularly as we move forward. On the margin question, well, obviously, we're very, very pleased with the step-up to approximately 30% margins in the business. I think that's generally the new range for the business for 2016. But I would think over the long term, as we continue to realize synergies, which we obviously make progress on, but we continue to have a good number ahead of us, we think that there is some upside to the margin as we go into '17 and beyond."

So first of all, there have been -- we continue to see a very strong covered bond market in Europe and in Asia. There's also what I would call bank-originated securitization, which are traditional ABS products. It's credit cards, it's auto loans, things like that. Those continue to be very strong. Banks are all actively managing their balance sheets to have the optimal level of capital. So those types of issuances, bank specific, have been very, very busy, very, very important. The areas where we're seeing more, I guess, I'd use the word volatility in issuance, which means it's going up and down, is in traditional RMBS, which has been quite weak, as well as CMBS. We do see a robust pipeline of CMBS deals right now, but we didn't see that 3 weeks ago, 6 weeks ago and 12 weeks ago. So the CMBS market is a little bit more volatile. It's one of the swing factors. There has been some tightening of the spreads on CMBS deals in the United States over the last couple of weeks, and we do think that we're seeing -- because of that, we're getting a stronger pipeline. Anyway, so just to give you a view again, bank issuance, covered bonds, bank-oriented securitization should be stronger, more steady. And then things like RMBS, CMBS around the globe, we're seeing more volatility in that. But we expect towards -- our expectations on this forecast also take into account refinancing. And there are certain refinancing of securitizations as well that are coming in through the second half of the year that we think will also come to the market."

And obviously, we need to do something to reduce the dilution from the sale of those businesses. So we do anticipate some pickup at this point in time as we look to the back half of the year. And then in terms of the leverage question, I think you've seen over the last year that we are methodically putting a little bit more debt into the balance sheet. We had 2 very successful bond raises last year. You've seen that we have used our short-term borrowing capabilities to flex, to continue to buy back relatively heavy in the Q1 timeframe, which is a time that we're a little -- we tend to be a little bit short in U.S. cash.

And the legacy S&P Cap IQ business did improve their margins to sort of the mid-20 range and when you looked into the second and third. So the run rate of the legacy S&P Cap IQ business was getting better. Then you overlay the profits from the SNL acquisition. Those 2 -- those were just significant and, combined with both businesses, growing very nicely on the top line. Then you start to layer in the synergies, and the synergies, we had given guidance earlier that we thought about 1/3 of the $100 million of total synergies would be achieved in 2016.

On the first one, I'm going to answer the second part of your question first, to the ECB. We've seen that the ECB's approach to being able to purchase very large portions of new bond issuance, we expect that, that could have some positive impact on issuance. At the same time, there's -- the ECB also has some liquidity programs that's providing the banks that make it actually attractive for them to keep assets on their balance sheet. So there might be some increase in loan activity. We're not quite sure where all of these different initiatives are going to land, but we have seen corporate investment grade issuance in Europe. Even though it was weak, it seems to be picking up a little bit. So we expect there could be some pick up there. When it comes to Rating Evaluation Services, Rating Evaluation Services is more linked to activity of IPOs, companies that are going to be going to the market for the first time and want to have a benchmark or some sort of an ability to know how they rate. We also see Rating Evaluation Services that are done from M&A transactions. So what drives Rating Evaluation Services is not necessarily issuance, it's much more related to IPOs, to M&A activity. Those are the links that are more important on that. And as you know, during the quarter, both IPOs and M&A, there were some big M&A headline deals, but there was not as much smaller M&A deals. And in addition to that, the IPO activity was very, very weak. So some of those correlation factors were weak. So we watch RES. It's a business for us that we actually use sometimes as a leading indicator for M&A activity itself."

This morning, Jack and I will review our second quarter results. And we're very pleased with the progress the company is making, creating growth in a macroeconomic environment that has challenged many of our customers. 
Let me begin with the highlights of the second quarter. Every segment delivered revenue growth. This is a testament to the quality of our products and the creativity and execution of the employees to develop and deliver them. In addition to creating growth, driving performance is a key theme in managing the company, and margin improvement is an important yardstick by which our progress is measured. This quarter, the company delivered a 210 basis point expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. 
A top priority for 2016 is the integration of SNL. We continue to make progress on SNL integration and synergy targets, and I'll share a few examples with you in a few moments. 
Financial performance was excellent with an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 17% over the most difficult quarter of comparison in 2015. As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. 
Last week, we received final regulatory approval for the sale of J.D. Power. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $513 million, and we increased the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, reflecting strong second quarter results. 
Before I get to the results in more detail, I want to take a moment to discuss the British exit from the European Union. First and foremost, Brexit has no immediate implications for our European operations. It's business as usual for S&P Global. While the media has reported that a number of companies plan on moving operations out of London, we have no such plans. We expect that because of the uncertainty it creates, however, Brexit could hamper issuance, particularly in Europe. So far, the impact has been muted, but markets never like uncertainty and will take time to resolve all for the various regulatory changes that companies and markets will face. For our company, we'll seek to work with the relevant U.K. and EU legal and regulatory authorities to navigate the path forward, a process that will likely take years. 
S&P Global Ratings has written extensively on the impact that Brexit will have on the markets, and our views can be found on the S&P Global Ratings website at the URL listed on this slide. 
Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter results. While reported revenue grew 10%, organic revenue on a constant-currency basis increased 5%. In most recent quarters, the company's revenue has been hit by ForEx with little impact to operating profit. Primarily due to the weak British pound, however, this quarter was different. In the second quarter, ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue, yet contributed approximately 3 percentage points to adjusted operating profit and approximately 100 basis points to the adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in S&P Global Ratings. So overall, the company delivered 210 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as a result of ForEx, S&P Global Ratings margin improvement and the progress made on SNL integration synergy target. Together, revenue growth margin improvement and share repurchases combined led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. 
In the second quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in adjusted operating profit. The 2 standout performers was S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence, with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 400 and 370 basis points, respectively. 
Now let me turn to the business, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. During the quarter, revenue increased 4% with a negligible impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 12%, and the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 54.1%. Improved market conditions after a weak 2016 start resulted in a modest year-over-year issuance increase. For the first time in 6 quarters, international revenue outperformed domestic. ForEx had a favorable impact of 3 percentage points on adjusted operating profit and approximately 150 basis points on the adjusted operating profit margin, due primarily to the weakness in the British pound. Excluding ForEx, adjusted expenses decreased 3 percentage points mainly due to reduced outside services. 
Another highlight of the quarter was the purchase of a 49% stake in TRIS Rating. This increased commitment to TRIS and an exciting step forward in our long-standing relationship. By working together more closely, we'll be in a better position to serve our customers and investors in Thailand and other ASEAN markets. 
Non-transaction revenue increased 3% from growth in surveillance, CRISIL, commercial paper activity and royalties from Risk Services. Transaction revenue increased 5% as a result of improved contract terms, increased bank loan rating and growth in debt issuance in Asia. 
If we look more closely at the largest market, second quarter issuance in the U.S. was down 11% with investment grade decreasing 6%, high-yield down 9%, public finance up 4% and structured finance declining 37% with drops in every class. In Europe, investment grade is unchanged, high yield is down 5%, while structured finance increased 4% with strength in RMBS and CLOs. In Asia, investment-grade issuance surged 60% and structured finance increased 20% due to ABS and RMBS. 
Let's take a further look at issuance. The 3% increase in global issuance breaks a 4-quarter streak of year-on-year declining global issuance that had pressured S&P Global Ratings revenue. During the quarter, only Asia reported an increase in issuance with a 55% gain. Excluding domestic Chinese issuance, which we don't rate, issuance in Asia still increased 35%. One factor driving this growth was offshore Chinese issuance. 
During the quarter, investment-grade issuers generally had unfettered access to debt capital markets while spec-grade issuers had very limited access with windows of opportunity that opened for short periods and then were disrupted by external events. Despite the year-over-year declines in the U.S. and Europe, there were periods of extreme strength during the quarter. In fact, May set a monthly record for U.S. investment-grade issuance. June started out with a very strong issuance, but then came to a standstill in the week leading up to the Brexit vote. 
Last week, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. We now expect global issuance to decline 3.8% in 2016. This compares to the April forecast, which anticipate a decline of approximately 2%. The biggest difference is in corporate and structured issuance, which have been lowered due to Brexit, and international public issuance, which has been increased as first half issuance already exceeds all of 2015. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the second quarter, revenue increased 29%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic growth was 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased 48% and adjusted operating margin advanced 370 basis points to 28.4%. The adjusted segment operating margin includes a benefit from ForEx of approximately 100 basis points. Excluding ForEx, this figure is comparable to the first quarter adjusted segment operating margin. ForEx had a favorable impact of 5 percentage points on adjusted operating profit, primarily due to weakness in the Indian rupee and British pound. 
In 2016, successful integration of SNL was a top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL, and we recognize that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver return on that investment. We are well on our way to achieving cross-sell synergy targets for 2016. 
Last quarter, we reviewed some of the organizational changes that took place. Today, in order to help you get a better sense of our efforts, I'm going to share several examples of integration synergies progress in the quarter. We reconfigured our risk services scorecard product for analyzing commercial banks to include SNL Bank data. We received great feedback and early sales success from the market. We integrated our equity ownership and earnings estimate data on to the SNL platform. We made tremendous progress on integrating SNL sector-specific fundamental data into our Xpressfeed delivery platform. Now in beta testing, SNL content will be available this fall, enabling more seamless cross-selling to our existing feed clients. We completed significant design work on our next-generation consolidated product platform that will encompass mobile, web and Excel delivery, reduced cost by replacing third-party data with internal solutions. We completed our office consolidations in Denver, New York and Singapore with other cities still in the works. We've been making great progress. 
Let me add a bit more color on second quarter revenue growth in S&P Global Market Intelligence, which delivered double-digit user growth in both S&P Capital IQ Desktop and SNL. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 8% with high single-digit growth in both products. In addition, SNL revenue reported a 9% increase compared to the second quarter 2015. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, however, excluding a purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, revenue grew 10%. With the progress that we continue to make integrating SNL into S&P Global Market Intelligence, it will become increasingly difficult to separate SNL results from the total. Therefore, this is likely the last quarter we'll provide separate revenue figures for SNL. 
Risk Services revenue increased 10% lead by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, research and advisory, revenue decreased 12% due to declines in equity research services. 
Now let's turn to S&P Global -- S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4% and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 66%. Market volatility has created large swings in AUM from month to month as well as volatility in the number of exchange for derivative contract traded each month. During the second quarter, revenue increased primarily due to steady data license growth, strength in exchange-traded derivative activity due to market volatility and ETF-related revenue was up slightly. 
If we turn to the 3 types of revenue, transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives increased primarily due to a 24% increase in average daily volume of products based on S&P DJI Indices. In particular, in many S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index, VIX, and CME Equity Complex Track contracts all increased more than 20%. Asset-linked fees revenue, mostly from exchange-traded funds, was up slightly. The exchange-traded products industry recorded inflows of $46 billion in the second quarter with fixed income products receiving the largest inflows. Average AUM associated with our indices increased 3% year-over-year with inflows of 7%, offset by asset value declines of 4%. The quarter ended on a high note with quarter ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reaching a new record of $855 billion as U.S. equity markets rebounded. This creates a great starting point for the third quarter. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices, increased due to continued steady growth in data subscription revenue. During the quarter, the company launched 90 [ph] new indices, and our partners launched 18 new ETF space indices. We added 2 in the environmental, social governance space that I'd like to highlight. JPX/S&P CAPEX and Human Capital Indices, designed to measure performance of Japanese companies that are proactively and effectively making investments in physical and human capital based on various metrics, including the human capital scores. The S&P/ESG Index series, designed to measure the performance of companies with a weighting scheme based on an ESG factor score derived from annual corporate sustainability assessment. This launch brings together for the first time Smart Beta and sustainability into a global index family that treats environmental, social and governance, or ESG, on a stand-alone performance factor. With the addition of these 2 indices, we now have 130 ESG indices. 
This quarter, we celebrated the 120th anniversary of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, launched in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones. On its first day, May 16, 1896, the Dow closed at 40.94. Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the iconic symbol of the U.S. stock market. 
Now on to S&P Global Platts, which currently includes J.D. Power. Organic revenue increased 4% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide, Petromedia and RigData acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 38.4%. Platts delivered 7% revenue growth driven by strength in subscriptions in Global Trading Services. J.D. Power had a declining organic revenue due to lower consulting revenue in China. With all of the regulatory requirements completed, we continue to expect closing the sale of J.D. Power this quarter. 
Turning to Platts. Global Trading Services led the growth during the quarter with double-digit revenue gains primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE exchanges. The core subscription business delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector, with particular strength in Asia. Metals, agriculture and petrochemicals revenue grew with high single digits, primarily due to the strength in Singapore Exchange-listed TSI iron ore contracts and metal market data subscriptions. While rig counts are up since the beginning of May, many of our customers remain under pressure from low oil prices. Therefore, we continue to expect growth to moderate slightly in the remainder of 2016 as these customers continue to face difficulties. 
Finally, the CME Group introduced a new Aluminum A380 Alloy futures contracts that settles against our price assessment. There has been growing need for North American aluminum alloy risk management tool. This contract will provide market participants with an effective solution for hedging aluminum alloy price risk. 
On the business development front, we have several new items. In June, we acquired RigData, a leading provider of daily information on rig activity for the natural gas and oil markets across North America. We discussed our desire to add our own supply-demand data offerings, and this extends our energy analytic capabilities in North America in natural gas with oil offering. Founded in 1986, RigData provides over 5,500 customers with daily electronic reports on drilling permits, activity and rig locations in the United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. 
We launched 5 domestic oil product assessments in Japan. Platts now assesses prices for important refined oil products for domestic waterborne deliveries in Japan from locations in Tokyo Bay [indiscernible] The Japan waterborne assessments reflects prices for gasoline, gas oil, kerosene, low-sulfur fuel oil and high-sulfur fuel oil. This assessments will follow Platts' market-on-close principle. 
And finally, we launched the LNG U.S. Gulf Coast marker. The natural gas infrastructure that connects the United States, Mexico and Canada is the world's largest and most integrated natural gas market. By 2020, the Americas are expected to be the world's third-largest producer of LNG behind Australia and Qatar. This new price reflects the daily export value of LNG traded free on board from the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
In summary, all segments delivered revenue growth. Bond issuance recovered from a weak start to the year. Margin improvement continues to be a key focus. Integration of SNL remains a top priority for the company, meaningful progress to date. We expect Brexit to have no immediate implications for the company. And we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $5.05 to $5.20. Our guidance has been updated to now include dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power. 
With that, I'll want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. But before I turn the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, I wanted to say a few words about him. As you know, Jack has accepted new position at Yale. Not only is he an active Yale alumni, he grew up in New Haven, Connecticut. So Jack is going home. We're thankful for the time he spent with us. After joining the company in November of 2010, he was instrumental in engineering the transformation to S&P Global, a faster-growing, more focused and profitable company. He's also assembled an outstanding organization. And we're grateful for all he has done for the company and shareholders. Early next month, Jack will begin his role as Senior Vice President of Operations at Yale. We wish Jack and his family all the best. Rob McKay, our current Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO as we continue the search process for Jack's replacement. Thank you, Jack. And now I'll turn the call over to you."

This morning, I'll recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impacts from adjustments to earnings then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And wrapping up, I'll provide some color on our updated guidance. 
Let's start with the consolidated second quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 10% with organic growth of 5%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points. Approximately 100 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding profit growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Both businesses have delivered impressive margin improvements year-to-date. 
Interest expense was up over $26 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year, partially in support of the SNL acquisition. This stepped-up level of interest expense will continue to create a difficult year-over-year comparison until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in more than a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustained top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the most profitable quarter in 2015. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $22 million in the quarter. The first item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. The second item includes net disposition cost, primarily related to the pending sale of J.D. Power to the XIO Group and our pricing businesses to ICE. The last item is a restructuring charge in S&P Global Ratings as the business continues to focus on sustained productivity. And as we discussed last quarter, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization of $23 million. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 95% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $309 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a drawdown on our credit facility. Since the end of the first quarter, we have reduced short-term debt by $163 million. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will likely fluctuate a bit as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. 
Our first half free cash flow was $478 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first half free cash flow was $513 million and is on track to reach our 2016 guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company bought approximately 1.4 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, total to approximately $242 million of cash returned to shareholders just in this quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $538 million to shareholders. The volume weighted average price for the shares repurchased so far this year is approximately $98. The share repurchase program remains an important component of the company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate stepping up share repurchases to help mitigate some of the dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2016 guidance. There are 3 items that have been updated. Our previous guidance included the results of J.D. Power for the full year. We now assume that the sale of J.D. Power will be completed during the third quarter and ed remove J.D. Power results for the balance of the year. This will have an impact on revenue and our guidance moves from mid to high single digits to new guidance of mid-single-digit growth. Year-to-date margins have benefited by approximately 100 basis points from ForEx. Therefore, we have increased our adjusted operating profit margin improvement from approximately 50 basis points to a new guidance of approximately 150 basis points. Despite the inherent dilution from removing several months of J.D. Power results, we are increasing our 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 due to the strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The new range is $5.05 to $5.20. We are keeping a wide range as there remains considerable macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact the markets and our customers. 
So in summary, the second quarter was a strong quarter for the company. Each of our segments is performing well, and we are well positioned to continue to provide the essential benchmarks, data and analytics that our customers require. 
As Doug mentioned earlier, today is my last earnings conference call. It has been a pleasure and an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer of, initially, the McGraw-Hill Companies, the McGraw Hill Financial and now S&P Global. I want to thank our shareholders and the analyst community for your interest and support as we have transformed the company. 
And finally, I want to thank the over 20,000 S&P Global associates for your hard work and commitment in building a stronger organization for the future. I wish you all well, and I remain optimistic on the continued success of S&P Global going forward. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

First of all, Market Intelligence business is advancing quite well, as you heard from some of the statistics that I provided and some of the examples. Related specifically to your question about the selling environment, I'll just be clear that we continue to progress faster on cost synergies than we do on sell synergies. But we are finding some early wins -- we're finding more wins in Asia right now than we are necessarily in Europe. And this is where we are able to either sell SNL products into Asia customers who before didn't use them, using the former Cap IQ sales force. Or we're finding opportunities where we've integrated the services together between Capital IQ and SNL and also delivering them into Asia. The selling environment is mixed, as you know. There still are a lot of financial institution that is one large part of our customer base that are reducing headcount. They're reducing some of their, specifically, trading and front office people. On the other hand, in the back office and areas like compliance, control, risk management and also some more traditional consumer banking and commercial banking activities, there are continued to be increase in headcount. So the environment is mixed with some consolidation and shrinking happening. And on the other hand, increase in demand for risk management for other sorts of tools. So we're seeing a mixed market. But we are continuing to have a very, very strong sales effort. Our sales team has integrated excellent, and it's very well integrated. And they've got a new commercial approach. We're reaching out to clients in a much more consolidated organized way, and we're starting to see top line growth coming out of the synergies as well."

So we're looking across that as well as looking at our contract terms. One of the areas where we also had very strong growth in this quarter was in Asia. Just to give you a color on the issuance in Asia, it was up in across the board and every category. In fact, total issuance in Asia this quarter was greater than total issuance in the United States, if you include sovereign issuers. Sovereign issuers are not necessarily an area that there's a lot of profitability on. But even so, the total issuance in Asia, for the first time, outgrew the total issuance in the U.S. In the U.S., as you know, the issuance was down overall in corporates at 7%. Financial institutions was down as well in Asia. The corporates were up 32%. And financial institutions were up 84%. So the -- it was a combination of our sales approach, our relationship management approach, more penetration and looking at how we're working on contracts, and then very importantly, the volume in Asia."

That also brings with it a combination of better control, better process management and then also, in many cases, lower expenses. On that side, we're having a lot of focus in. On the top line, we're looking also at ways to simplify our pricing model to revisit our contracts we've had with customers for a very long time that provided relationship pricing that were -- that we want to recalibrate to markets where there's much larger issuance. So it's a combination of factors. But the top line growth, some of that has been driven by approach to how we look at our pricing.

There have been some residual expenses related to that. And then we had also been engaged in a full-blown implementation of the Dodd-Frank rules, which kicked in June 2015. And in order to implement that, we had engaged some outside help from some consulting firms and risk management experts, et cetera. So those are the legal fees related to. Those had tapered off in the second quarter. And then some of those external consulting fees and other advisory fees, those are gone. And so we think that we're approaching a more sustainable level of expenses going forward, although I would point out that with some of our programs, we do continue to invest in technology.

So that money has been spent. We do have that risk and compliance investment now in the run rate. That benefited some of the expenses quarter to quarter. On a go-forward basis, it's not like we expect minimal revenue. I mean we have to kind of -- we -- to Doug's point, we're trying to be more commercially oriented going forward, but we are going to be influenced by what's going on with issuance trends. I just would say that our forward outlook is not assuming a sort of robust activity that we saw clearly here in the second quarter."

Related to the overall issuance markets going forward, as you know, from what we just gave you, we do see that there's going to be a reduction in the overall issuance for 2016. But if you look forward further, and you look at the 2016 to 2000 -- looking out forward to 2020 or so, there's 2 factors we're looking at. One of them is total debt markets, including bank loans, which we don't necessarily rate. The market is large. we think it's going to grow by trillions of dollars. In fact, it could expand over the next 5 years to a $73 trillion market, including a large increase in China. We do think that there is an increase in the combination of refinancing as well as new financing going into that. We are targeting through all of our businesses, in Market Intelligence, couple of businesses there, and then also in ratings, more and more penetration of loan markets and through models and things like that. So we look at the size of the markets and how they're growing longer term than just the next quarter. Over the rest of the year ago, we do think that there is a large amount of debt maturing between now and 2021. The issuance -- the maturations over the rest of the year actually not that strong. That's why we see the full year down about 3.8%. We're concerned about the Brexit. What kind of impact that might have on issuance on U.S. interest rates and global interest rate outlooks are -- have been quite volatile in that they change all the time. On the short run, we usually expect positive volatility, as you've seen, as you track this business. Quarterly issuance can go up and down. But with a very long run, 5-year view, we see some very large numbers of $73 trillion overall corporate debt market, which includes bank loans and then through 2021, $10.3 trillion in debt maturing. That's actually publicly issued debt. So we do see that there's a lot of activity. We're trying to build our business around this and try to expand it beyond just being a single ratings approach in the market, looking at bank loan ratings, RES, different types of loan evaluation services, et cetera. So this is a big area for us to focus our strategy going forward."

It's -- that is probably -- I'm giving you an unscientific answer. But if I were going to look at what our -- what are one of the most important correlations to overall volume as well as activity, it has to do with the price of oil. As you know, as we dropped into a very low oil price early this year, even though it's recovered somewhat, there were a lot of -- people had exited the industry. You had a large increase in defaults and bankruptcies in the U.S., in particular in different types of oil businesses. So probably getting a higher price of oil is -- would be the largest factor that could bump up growth to the double-digit range, if that was still possible. We have still been growing quite steadily in the mid-single, mid to high single-digit range despite this because there's still such a demand for information or prices to be embedded in different kinds of contracts. But double-digit range would require more than just -- would require a lot of work for us, but in particular, for the price of oil to be a lot higher."

This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. 
The earnings release contains the exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Before we begin, I need to make certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 
In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
I would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. 
We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors. And we'd ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 438-1247 subsequent to this call.

This morning, Jack and I'll review our second quarter results. We're very pleased with the progress the company is making, creating growth in a macroeconomic environment that has challenged many of our customers. 
Let me begin with the highlights of the second quarter. 
Every segment delivered revenue growth. This is a testament to the quality of our products and the creativity and execution of the employees who develop and deliver them. In addition to creating growth, driving performance is a key theme in managing the company, and margin improvement is an important yardstick by which our progress is measured. This quarter, the company delivered a 210 basis point expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. 
A top priority for 2016 is the integration of SNL. We continue to make progress on SNL integration and synergy targets, and I'll share a few examples with you in a few moments. 
Financial performance was excellent with an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 17% over the most difficult quarter comparison in 2015. As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. 
Last week, we received final regulatory approvals for the sale of J.D. Power. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $513 million, and we increased the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, reflecting strong second quarter results. 
Before I get to the results in more detail, I want to take a moment to discuss the British exit from the European Union. First and foremost, Brexit has no immediate implications for European operations. It's business as usual for S&P Global. While the media has reported that a number of companies plan on moving operations out of London, we have no such plans. We expect that the -- because of the uncertainty it creates, however, Brexit could hamper issuance, particularly in Europe. So far, the impact has been muted, but markets never like uncertainty and it will take time to resolve all for the various regulatory changes that companies and markets will face. For our company, we'll seek to work with the relevant U.K. and EU legal and regulatory authorities to navigate the path forward, a process that will likely take years. S&P Global Ratings has written extensively on the impact that Brexit will have on the markets, and our views can be found on the S&P Global Ratings website at the URL listed on this slide. 
Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter results. Our reported revenue grew 10%, organic revenue on a constant-currency basis increased 5%. In most recent quarters, the company's revenue has been hit by ForEx with little impact to operating profit. Primarily due to the weak British pound, however, this quarter was different. In the second quarter, ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue, yet contributed approximately 3 percentage points to adjusted operating profit and approximately 100 basis points to the adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in S&P Global Ratings. So overall, the company delivered 210 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as a result of ForEx, S&P Global Ratings margin improvement and the progress made on SNL integration synergy target. Together, revenue growth margin improvement and share repurchases combined led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. 
In the second quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in adjusted operating profit. The two standout performers were S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence, with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 400 and 370 basis points, respectively. 
Now let me turn to the business, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. During the quarter, revenue increased 4% with a negligible impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 12%, and the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 54.1%. Improved market conditions after a weak 2016 start resulted in a modest year-over-year issuance increase. For the first time in 6 quarters, international revenue outperformed domestic. ForEx had a favorable impact of 3 percentage points on adjusted operating profit and approximately 150 basis points on the adjusted operating profit margin, due primarily to the weakness in the British pound. Excluding ForEx, adjusted expenses decreased 3 percentage points mainly due to reduced outside services. Another highlight of the quarter was the purchase of a 49% stake in TRIS Rating. This increased commitment to TRIS in an exciting step forward in our long-standing relationship. By working together more closely, we'll be in a better position to serve our customers and investors in Thailand and other ASEAN markets. 
Non-transaction revenue increased 3% from growth in surveillance, CRISIL, commercial paper activity and royalties from Risk Services. Transaction revenue increased 5% as a result of improved contract terms, increased bank loan rating and growth in debt issuance in Asia. 
If we look more closely at the largest market, second quarter issuance in the U.S. was down 11% with investment grade decreasing 6%, high-yield down 9%, public finance up 4% and structured finance declining 37% with drops in every class. In Europe, investment grade was unchanged, high yield was down 5%, while structured finance increased 4% with strength in RMBS and CLOs. And in Asia, investment grade issuance surged 60% and structured finance increased 20% due to ABS and RMBS. 
Let's take a further look at issuance. The 3% increase in global issuance breaks a 4-quarter streak of year-on-year declining global issuance that had pressured S&P Global Ratings revenue. During the quarter, only Asia reported an increase in issuance with a 55% gain. Excluding domestic Chinese issuance, which we don't rate, issuance in Asia still increased 35%. One factor driving this growth was offshore Chinese issuance. 
During the quarter, investment grade issuers generally had unfettered access to debt capital markets while spec-grade issuers had very limited access with windows of opportunity that opened for short periods and then were disrupted by external events. Despite the year-over-year declines in the U.S. and Europe, there were periods of extreme strength during the quarter. In fact, May set a monthly record for U.S. investment grade issuance. June started out with a very strong issuance, but then came to a standstill in the week leading up to the Brexit vote. 
Last week, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. We now expect global issuance to decline 3.8% in 2016. This compares to the April forecast, which anticipate a decline of approximately 2%. The biggest difference is in corporate and structured issuance, which have been lower due to Brexit, and international public issuance, which has been increased as first half issuance already exceeds all of 2015. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the second quarter, revenue increased 29%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic growth was 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased 48% and adjusted operating margin advanced 370 basis points to 28.4%. The adjusted segment operating margin includes a benefit from ForEx of approximately 100 basis points. Excluding ForEx, this figure is comparable to the first quarter adjusted segment operating margin. ForEx had a favorable impact of 5 percentage points on adjusted operating profit, primarily due to weakness in the Indian rupee and British pound. In 2016, successful integration of SNL was a top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL, and we recognize that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver return on that investment. We are well on our way to achieving cross-sell synergy targets for 2016. Last quarter, we reviewed some of the organizational changes that took place. Today, in order to help you get a better sense of our efforts, I'm going to share several examples of integration synergies progress during the quarter. We reconfigured our risk services scorecard product for analyzing commercial banks to include SNL Bank data and received great feedback and early sale success from the market. We integrated our equity ownership and earnings estimate data on to the SNL platform. We made tremendous progress on integrating SNL sector-specific fundamental data into our Xpressfeed delivery platform. Now in beta testing, SNL content will be available this fall, enabling more seamless cross-selling to our existing feed clients. We completed significant design work on our next-generation consolidated product platform that will encompass mobile, web and excel delivery, reduced cost by replacing third-party data with internal solutions. We completed our office consolidations in Denver, New York and Singapore with other cities still in the works. We've been making great progress. 
Let me add a bit more color on second quarter revenue growth in S&P Global Market Intelligence, which delivered double-digit user growth in both S&P Capital IQ Desktop and SNL. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 8% with high single-digit growth in both products. In addition, SNL revenue reported a 9% increase compared to the second quarter 2015. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, however, excluding a purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, revenue grew 10%. With the progress that we continue to make integrating SNL into S&P Global Market Intelligence, it will become increasingly difficult to separate SNL results from the total. Therefore, this is likely the last quarter we'll provide separate revenue figures for SNL.  
Risk services revenue increased 10% led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, research and advisory, revenue decreased 12% due to declines in equity research services. 
Now let's turn to S&P Global -- S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 66%. Market volatility has created large swings in AUM from month-to-month as well as volatility in the number of exchange-traded derivative contract traded each month. During the second quarter, revenue increased primarily due to steady data license growth, strength in exchange-traded derivative activity due to market volatility and ETF-related revenue was up slightly. If we turn this 3 types of revenue, transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives increased primarily due to a 24% increase in average daily volume of products based on S&P DJI's Indices. In particular, E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index, VIX, and CME equity complex track -- contracts all increased more than 20%. Asset-linked fees revenue, mostly from exchange-traded funds, was up slightly. The exchange-traded products industry recorded inflows of $46 billion in the second quarter with fixed income products receiving the largest inflows. Average AUM associated with our indices increased 3% year-over-year with inflows of 7%, offset by asset value declines of 4%. The quarter ended on a high note with quarter ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reaching a new record of $855 billion as U.S. equity markets rebounded. This creates a great starting point for the third quarter. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices, increased due to continued steady growth in data subscription revenue. During the quarter, the company launched 90 new indices, and our partners launched 18 new ETFs based on our indices. We added 2 in the environmental, social governance space that I'd like to highlight. JPX/S&P CAPEX and Human Capital Indices, designed to measure performance of Japanese companies that are proactively and effectively making investments in physical and human capital based on various metrics including the RobecoSAM human capital scores. In the S&P ESG Index series, designed to measure the performance of companies with a weighting scheme based on an ESG factor score derived from RobecoSAM's annual corporate sustainability assessment. This launch brings together for the first time Smart Beta and sustainability into a global index family that treats environmental, social and governance, or ESG, on a standalone performance factor. With the addition of these 2 indices, we now have 130 ESG indices. 
This quarter, we celebrated the 120th anniversary of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, launched in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones. On its first day, May 16, 1896, the Dow closed at 40.94. Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the iconic symbol of the U.S. stock market. 
Now on to S&P Global Platts, which currently includes J.D. Power. Organic revenue increased 4% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide, Petromedia and RigData acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 38.4%. Platts delivered 7% revenue growth driven by strength in subscriptions in Global Trading Services. J.D. Power had a declining organic revenue due to lower consulting revenue in China. With all of the regulatory requirements completed, we continue to expect closing the sale of J.D. Power this quarter. 
Turning to Platts. Global Trading Services led the growth during the quarter with double-digit revenue gains primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE exchanges. The core subscription business delivered mid-single digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector, with particular strength in Asia. Metals, agricultural and petrochemicals revenue grew at high single-digit, primarily due to the strength in Singapore Exchange-listed TSI Iron Ore contracts and metal market data subscriptions. While rig counts are up since the beginning of May, many of our customers remain under pressure from low oil prices. Therefore, we continue to expect growth to moderate slightly in the remainder of 2016 as these customers continue to face difficulties. Finally, the CME Group introduced a new Aluminum A380 alloy futures contracts that settles against our price assessment. There has been growing need for North American aluminum alloy risk management tool. This contract will provide market participants with an effective solution for hedging aluminum alloy price risk. 
On the business development front, we have several new items. In June, we acquired RigData, a leading provider of daily information on rig activity for the natural gas and oil markets across North America. We discussed our desire to add our own supply-demand data offerings, and this extends our energy analytic capabilities in North America natural gas with oil offering. Founded in 1986, RigData provides over 5,500 customers with daily electronic reports on drilling permits, activity and rig locations in the United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. 
We launched 5 domestic oil product assessments in Japan. Platts now assesses prices for important refined oil products for domestic waterborne deliveries in Japan from locations in Tokyo Bay, Chukyo and Hanshin. The Japan waterborne assessments reflect prices for gasoline, gas oil, kerosene, low-sulfur A fuel oil and high-sulfur fuel -- A fuel oil. These assessments will follow Platts' market-on-close principle. 
And finally, we launched the LNG U.S. Gulf Coast Marker. The natural gas infrastructure that connects United States, Mexico and Canada is the world's largest and most integrated natural gas market. By 2020, the Americas are expected to be the world's third-largest producer of LNG behind Australia and Qatar. This new price reflects the daily export value of LNG traded free on board from the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
In summary, all segments delivered revenue growth. Bond issuance recovered from a weak start to the year. Margin improvement continues to be a key focus. Integration of SNL remains a top priority for the company with meaningful progress to date. We expect Brexit to have no immediate implications for the company. And we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $5.05 to $5.20. Our guidance has been updated to now include dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power. 
With that, I'll want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. But before I turn the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, I wanted to say a few words about him. As you know, Jack has accepted new position at Yale. Not only is he an active Yale alumni, he grew up in New Haven, Connecticut. So Jack's going home. We're thankful for the time he spent with us. After joining the company in November of 2010, he was instrumental in engineering the transformation to S&P Global, a faster-growing, more focused and profitable company. He's also assembled an outstanding organization, and we're grateful for all he has done for the company and shareholders. Early next month, Jack will begin his role as Senior Vice President of Operations at Yale. We wish Jack and his family all the best. Rob McKay, our current Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO as we continue the search process for Jack's replacement. Thank you, Jack. And now I'll turn the call over to you."

This morning, I'll recap key financial results.

This morning, I'll recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impacts from adjustments to earnings then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And wrapping up, I'll provide some color on our updated guidance. 
Let's start with the consolidated second quarter income statement. There are just a couple items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 10% with organic growth of 5%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points. Approximately 100 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding profit growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Both businesses have delivered impressive margin improvements year-to-date. 
Interest expense was up over $26 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year, partially in support of the SNL acquisition. This stepped-up level of interest expense will continue to create a difficult year-over-year comparison until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in more than a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustained top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the most profitable quarter in 2015. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $22 million in the quarter. The first item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. The second item includes net disposition costs, primarily related to the pending sale of J.D. Power to the XIO Group and our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE. The last item is a restructuring charge in S&P Global Ratings as the business continues to focus on sustained productivity. And as we discussed last quarter, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization of $23 million. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 95% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $309 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a drawdown on our credit facility. Since the end of the first quarter, we have reduced short-term debt by $163 million. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will likely fluctuate a bit as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. 
Our first half free cash flow was $478 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first half free cash flow was $513 million and is on track to reach our 2016 guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company bought approximately 1.4 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, total to approximately $242 million of cash returned to shareholders just in this quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $538 million to shareholders. The volume weighted average price for the shares repurchased so far this year is approximately $98. The share repurchase program remains an important component of the company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate stepping up share repurchases to help mitigate some of the dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2016 guidance. There are 3 items that have been updated. Our previous guidance included the results of J.D. Power for the full year. We now assume that the sale of J.D. Power will be completed during the third quarter and have remove J.D. Power results for the balance of the year. This will have an impact on revenue and our guidance moves from mid- to high single-digit to new guidance of mid-single digit growth. Year-to-date margins have benefited by approximately 100 basis points from ForEx. Therefore, we have increased our adjusted operating profit margin improvement from approximately 50 basis points to a new guidance of approximately 150 basis points. Despite the inherent dilution from removing several months of J.D. Power results, we are increasing our 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 due to the strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The new range is $5.05 to $5.20. We are keeping a wide range as there remains considerable macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact the markets and our customers. 
So in summary, the second quarter was a strong quarter for the company. Each of our segments is performing well, and we are well positioned to continue to provide the essential benchmarks, data and analytics that our customers require. 
As Doug mentioned earlier, today is my last earnings conference call. It has been a pleasure and an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer of, initially, the McGraw-Hill Companies, the McGraw Hill Financial and now S&P Global. I want to thank our shareholders and the analyst community for your interest and support as we have transformed the company. 
And finally, I want to thank the over 20,000 S&P Global associates for your hard work and commitment in building a stronger organization for the future. I wish you all well, and I remain optimistic on the continued success of S&P Global going forward. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

So, first of all, the Market Intelligence business is advancing quite well, as you heard from some of the statistics that I provided and some of the examples. Related specifically to your question about the selling environment, I'll just be clear that we continue to progress faster on cost synergies than we do on sell synergies. But we are finding some early wins -- we're finding more wins in Asia right now than we are necessarily in Europe. And this is where we're able to either sell SNL products into Asia customers, who before didn't use them, using the former Cap IQ sales force, or we're finding opportunities where we've integrated the services together between Cap IQ and SNL and also delivering them into Asia. The selling environment is mixed, as you know. There still are a lot of financial institutions that is one large part of our customer base that are reducing headcount. They're reducing some of their, specifically, trading and front office people. On the other hand, on the back office in areas like compliance, control, risk management and also some more traditional consumer banking and commercial banking activities, there are continue to be increase in headcount. So the environment is mixed with some consolidation and shrinking happening and on the other hand, increase in demand for risk management for other sorts of tool. So we're seeing a mixed market. But we are continuing to have a very, very strong sales effort. Our sales team has integrated excellent and it's very well integrated, and they've got a new commercial approach. We're reaching out to clients in a much more consolidated organized way, and we're starting to see top line growth coming out of the synergies as well."

We've approached our clients in a way that gives us a broad relationship-oriented approach, where we're looking at ways to broaden our coverage, including products like loan, ratings, RES, et cetera. So we're looking across that as well as looking at our contract terms. One of the areas where we also had very strong growth in this quarter was in Asia. Just to give you a color on the issuance in Asia, it was up in across the board in every category. In fact, total issuance in Asia this quarter was greater than total issuance in the United States, if you include sovereign issuers. Sovereign issuers are not necessarily an area that there is a lot of profitability on. But even so, the total issuance in Asia, for the first time, outgrew the total issuance in the U.S. In the U.S., as you know, the issuance was down overall in corporates at 7%, financial institutions was down. While in Asia, the corporates were up 32% and financial institutions were up 84%. So the -- it was a combination of our sales approach, our relationship management approach, more penetration and looking at how we're working on contracts, and then very importantly, the volume in Asia."

There was just relatively more ForEx benefit in Q1 than there was in Q2. So there was about 2 points of benefit in Q1 and less than 1 in this quarter. So once you equivalize for that, you're pretty much in that same range, around 28%. And we're quite pleased with that step-up of versus a year ago. And we do think this is an opportunity we can continue to get some steady improvement over time."

We have many, many different pricing approaches across the globe. We're -- one of the biggest things you're going to hear from us, from our Ratings business over and over, is this term simplify. We have a project to simplify our workflow. We've been investing in technology to simplify our workflow. That also brings with it a combination of better control, better process management and then also, in many cases, lower expenses. So on that side, we're having a lot of focus in. On the top line, we're looking also at ways to simplify our pricing model to revisit our contracts that we've had with customers for a very long time that provided relationship pricing that were -- that we want to recalibrate to markets where there's much larger issuance. So it's a combination of factors. But the top line growth, some of that has been driven by approach to how we look at our pricing. And even though we are simplifying it, it has had some benefits and also going up."

Those continue to flow through. But one of the major areas, if you recall last year, in the first half of the year, we had the final resolution of some of the disputes and lawsuits we had with the U.S. government in 20 states as well as some private litigation. There had been some residual expenses related to that. And then we'd also been engaged in a full-blown implementation of the Dodd-Frank rules, which kicked in, in June 2015. And in order to implement that, we had engaged some outside help from some consulting firms and risk management experts, et cetera. So those are -- the legal fees related to those had tapered off in the second quarter and then some of those external consulting fees and other advisory fees, those are gone. And so we think that we're approaching a more sustainable level of expenses going forward. Although I would point out that with some of our programs, we do continue to invest in technology, that's critical for us. And as we simplify the business, we will be investing in technology.

Related to the overall issuance markets going forward, as you know, from what we just gave you, we do see that there is going to be a reduction in the overall issuance for 2016. But if you look forward further, and you look at the 2016 to 2000 -- looking out forward to 2020 or so, there's 2 factors we're looking at. One of them is total debt markets, including bank loans, which we don't necessarily rate. The market is large. We think it's going to grow by trillions of dollars. In fact, there could -- it could expand over the next 5 years to a $73 trillion market, including a large increase in China. We do think that there is a increase in the combination of refinancing as well as new financing going into that. We are targeting through all of our businesses, in Market Intelligence, couple of businesses there, and then also in ratings, more and more penetration of loan markets and through models and things like that. So we look at the size of the markets and how they're growing longer term in just the next quarter. Over the rest of the year though, we do think that there is a large amount of debt maturing between now and 2021. The issuance -- the maturations over the rest of the year actually not that strong. That's why we see the full year down about 3.8%. We're concerned about the Brexit. What kind of impact that might have on issuance. U.S. interest rates and global interest rate outlooks are -- have been quite volatile and that they're changing all the time. So in the short run, we usually expect possible volatility as you've seen, if you track this business. Quarterly issuance can go up and down. But with a very long run, 5-year view, we see some very large numbers of $73 trillion overall corporate debt market, which includes bank loans and then through 2021, $10.3 trillion in debt maturing, that's actually publicly issued debt. So we do see that there is a lot of activity. We're trying to build our business around this and trying to expand it beyond just being a single ratings approach to market looking at bank loan ratings, RES, different types of loan evaluation services, et cetera. So this is a big area for us to focus our strategy going forward."

It's -- that is probably -- I'm giving you an unscientific answer, but if I were going to look at what are -- what's the one of the most important correlations to overall volume as well as activity, it has to do with the price of oil. As you know, as we dropped into a very low oil price early this year, even though it's recovered somewhat, there were a lot of -- people had exited the industry. You had a large increase in defaults and bankruptcies in the U.S., in particular, in different types of oil businesses. So probably getting a higher price of oil is -- would be the largest factor that could bump up growth to the double-digit range, if that was still possible. We have still been growing quite steadily in the mid-single -- mid- to high single-digit range despite this because there's still such a demand for information and for our prices to be embedded in different kinds of contracts. But double-digit range would require more than just -- would require a lot of work from us, but in particular, for the price of oil to be a lot higher."

This morning, Jack and I'll review our second quarter results. We're very pleased with the progress the company is making, creating growth in a macroeconomic environment that has challenged many of our customers. 
Let me begin with the highlights of the second quarter. 
Every segment delivered revenue growth. This is a testament to the quality of our products and the creativity and execution of the employees who develop and deliver them. In addition to creating growth, driving performance is a key theme in managing the company, and margin improvement is an important yardstick by which our progress is measured. This quarter, the company delivered a 210 basis point expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. 
A top priority for 2016 is the integration of SNL. We continue to make progress on SNL integration and synergy targets, and I'll share a few examples with you in a few moments. 
Financial performance was excellent with an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 17% over the most difficult quarter comparison in 2015. As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. 
Last week, we received final regulatory approvals for the sale of J.D. Power. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $513 million, and we increased the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, reflecting strong second quarter results. 
Before I get to the results in more detail, I want to take a moment to discuss the British exit from the European Union. First and foremost, Brexit has no immediate implications for our European operations. It's business as usual for S&P Global. While the media has reported that a number of companies plan on moving operations out of London, we have no such plans. We expect that the -- because of the uncertainty it creates, however, Brexit could hamper issuance, particularly in Europe.
 So far, the impact has been muted, but markets never like uncertainty and it will take time to resolve all for the various regulatory changes that companies and markets will face. For our company, we'll seek to work with the relevant U.K. and EU legal and regulatory authorities to navigate the path forward, a process that will likely take years. S&P Global Ratings has written extensively on the impact that Brexit will have on the markets, and our views can be found on the S&P Global Ratings website at the URL listed on this slide. 
Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter results. While reported revenue grew 10%, organic revenue on a constant-currency basis increased 5%. In most recent quarters, the company's revenue has been hit by ForEx with little impact to operating profit. Primarily due to the weak British pound, however, this quarter was different. In the second quarter, ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue, yet contributed approximately 3 percentage points to adjusted operating profit and approximately 100 basis points to the adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in S&P Global Ratings. So overall, the company delivered 210 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as a result of ForEx, S&P Global Ratings margin improvement and the progress made on SNL integration synergy targets. Together, revenue growth margin improvement and share repurchases combined led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. 
In the second quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in adjusted operating profit. The 2 standout performers were S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence, with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 400 and 370 basis points, respectively. 
Now let me turn to the business, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. During the quarter, revenue increased 4% with a negligible impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 12%, and the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 54.1%. Improved market conditions after a weak 2016 start resulted in a modest year-over-year issuance increase. For the first time in 6 quarters, international revenue outperformed domestic. ForEx had a favorable impact of 3 percentage points on adjusted operating profit and approximately 150 basis points on the adjusted operating profit margin, due primarily to the weakness in the British pound. Excluding ForEx, adjusted expenses decreased 3 percentage points mainly due to reduced outside services. 
Another highlight of the quarter was the purchase of a 49% stake in TRIS Rating. This increased commitment to TRIS in an exciting step forward in our long-standing relationship. By working together more closely, we'll be in a better position to serve our customers and investors in Thailand and other ASEAN markets. 
Non-transaction revenue increased 3% from growth in surveillance, CRISIL, commercial paper activity and royalties from Risk Services. Transaction revenue increased 5% as a result of improved contract terms, increased bank loan rating and growth in debt issuance in Asia. 
If we look more closely at the largest market, second quarter issuance in the U.S. was down 11% with investment grade decreasing 6%, high-yield down 9%, public finance up 4% and structured finance declining 37% with drops in every class. In Europe, investment grade was unchanged, high yield was down 5%, while structured finance increased 4% with strength in RMBS and CLOs. And in Asia, investment grade issuance surged 60% and structured finance increased 20% due to ABS and RMBS. 
Let's take a further look at issuance. The 3% increase in global issuance breaks a 4-quarter streak of year-on-year declining global issuance that had pressured S&P Global Ratings revenue. During the quarter, only Asia reported an increase in issuance with a 55% gain. Excluding domestic Chinese issuance, which we don't rate, issuance in Asia still increased 35%. One factor driving this growth was offshore Chinese issuance. 
During the quarter, investment grade issuers generally had unfettered access to debt capital markets while spec-grade issuers had very limited access with windows of opportunity that opened for short periods and then were disrupted by external events. Despite the year-over-year declines in the U.S. and Europe, there were periods of extreme strength during the quarter. In fact, May set a monthly record for U.S. investment grade issuance. June started out with a very strong issuance, but then came to a standstill in the week leading up to the Brexit vote. 
Last week, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. We now expect global issuance to decline 3.8% in 2016. This compares to the April forecast, which anticipate a decline of approximately 2%. The biggest differences are in corporate and structured issuance, which have been lower due to Brexit, and international public issuance, which has been increased as first half issuance already exceeds all of 2015. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the second quarter, revenue increased 29%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic growth was 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased 48% and adjusted operating margin advanced 370 basis points to 28.4%. The adjusted segment operating margin includes a benefit from ForEx of approximately 100 basis points. Excluding ForEx, this figure is comparable to the first quarter adjusted segment operating margin. ForEx had a favorable impact of 5 percentage points on adjusted operating profit, primarily due to weakness in the Indian rupee and British pound. 
In 2016, successful integration of SNL was a top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL, and we recognize that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver return on that investment. We are well on our way to achieving cross-sell synergy targets for 2016. 
Last quarter, we reviewed some of the organizational changes that took place. Today, in order to help you get a better sense of our efforts, I'm going to share several examples of integration synergies progress during the quarter. We reconfigured our Risk Services Scorecard product for analyzing commercial banks to include SNL Bank data and received great feedback and early sale success from the market. 
We integrated our equity ownership and earnings estimate data on to the SNL platform. We made tremendous progress on integrating SNL sector-specific fundamental data into our Xpressfeed delivery platform. Now in beta testing, SNL content will be available this fall, enabling more seamless cross-selling to our existing feed clients. We completed significant design work on our next-generation consolidated product platform that will encompass mobile, web and excel delivery. Reduced cost by replacing third-party data with internal solutions, we completed our office consolidations in Denver, New York and Singapore with other cities still in the works. We've been making great progress. 
Let me add a bit more color on second quarter revenue growth in S&P Global Market Intelligence, which delivered double-digit user growth in both S&P Capital IQ Desktop and SNL. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 8% with high single-digit growth in both products. In addition, SNL revenue reported a 9% increase compared to the second quarter 2015. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, however, excluding a purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, revenue grew 10%. With the progress that we continue to make integrating SNL into S&P Global Market Intelligence, it will become increasingly difficult to separate SNL results from the total. Therefore, this is likely the last quarter we'll provide separate revenue figures for SNL. 
Risk services revenue increased 10% led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, Research & Advisory, revenue decreased 12% due to declines in equity research services. 
Now let's turn to S&P Global -- S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 66%. Market volatility has created large swings in AUM from month to month as well as volatility in the number of exchange-traded derivative contracts traded each month. During the second quarter, revenue increased primarily due to steady data license growth, strength in exchange-traded derivative activity due to market volatility and ETF-related revenue was up slightly. 
If we turn to 3 types of revenue, transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives increased primarily due to a 24% increase in average daily volume of products based on S&P DJI's Indices. In particular, E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index, VIX, and CME equity complex track -- contracts all increased more than 20%. Asset-linked fees revenue, mostly from exchange-traded funds, was up slightly. The exchange-traded products industry recorded inflows of $46 billion in the second quarter with fixed income products receiving the largest inflows. 
Average AUM associated with our indices increased 3% year-over-year with inflows of 7%, offset by asset value declines of 4%. The quarter ended on a high note with quarter ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reaching a new record of $855 billion as U.S. equity markets rebounded. This creates a great starting point for the third quarter. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices, increased due to continued steady growth in data subscription revenue. During the quarter, the company launched 90 new indices, and our partners launched 18 new ETFs based on our indices. We added 2 in the environmental, social and governance space that I'd like to highlight. JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Indices, designed to measure performance of Japanese companies that are proactively and effectively making investments in physical and human capital based on various metrics including the RobecoSAM human capital scores. And the S&P ESG Index series, designed to measure the performance of companies with a weighting scheme based on an ESG factor score derived from RobecoSAM's annual corporate sustainability assessment. This launch brings together for the first time Smart Beta and sustainability into a global index family that treats environmental, social and governance, or ESG, on a standalone performance factor. With the addition of these 2 indices, we now have 130 ESG indices. 
This quarter, we celebrated the 120th anniversary of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, launched in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones. On its first day, May 16, 1896, the Dow closed at 40.94. Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the iconic symbol of the U.S. stock market. 
Now on to S&P Global Platts, which currently includes J.D. Power. Organic revenue increased 4% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide, Petromedia and RigData acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 38.4%. Platts delivered 7% revenue growth driven by strength in subscriptions in Global Trading Services. J.D. Power had a declining organic revenue due to lower consulting revenue in China. With all of the regulatory requirements completed, we continue to expect closing the sale of J.D. Power this quarter. 
Turning to Platts. Global Trading Services led the growth during the quarter with double-digit revenue gains primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE exchanges. The core subscription business delivered mid-single digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector, with particular strength in Asia. Metals, agricultural and petrochemicals revenue grew at high single-digit, primarily due to the strength in Singapore Exchange-listed TSI Iron Ore contracts and metal market data subscriptions. 
While rig counts are up since the beginning of May, many of our customers remain under pressure from low oil prices. Therefore, we continue to expect growth to moderate slightly in the remainder of 2016 as these customers continue to face difficulties. Finally, the CME Group introduced a new Aluminum A380 alloy futures contracts that settles against our price assessment. There has been growing need for North American aluminum alloy risk management tool. This contract will provide market participants with an effective solution for hedging aluminum alloy price risk. 
On the business development front, we have several new items. In June, we acquired RigData, a leading provider of daily information on rig activity for the natural gas and oil markets across North America. We discussed our desire to add our own supply-demand data offerings, and this extends our energy analytic capabilities in North America natural gas with oil offering. Founded in 1986, RigData provides over 5,500 constant [ph] customers with daily electronic reports on drilling permits, activity and rig locations in the United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. 
We launched 5 domestic oil product assessments in Japan. Platts now assesses prices for important refined oil products for domestic waterborne deliveries in Japan from locations in Tokyo Bay, Chukyo and Hanshin. The Japan waterborne assessments reflect prices for gasoline, gas oil, kerosene, low-sulfur A fuel oil and high-sulfur fuel -- A fuel oil. These assessments will follow Platts' market-on-close principle. 
And finally, we launched the LNG U.S. Gulf Coast Marker. The natural gas infrastructure that connects United States, Mexico and Canada is the world's largest and most integrated natural gas market. By 2020, the Americas are expected to be the world's third-largest producer of LNG behind Australia and Qatar. This new price reflects the daily export value of LNG traded free on board from the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
In summary, all segments delivered revenue growth. Bond issuance recovered from a weak start to the year. Margin improvement continues to be a key focus. Integration of SNL remains a top priority for the company with meaningful progress to date. We expect Brexit to have no immediate implications for the company. And we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $5.05 to $5.20. Our guidance has been updated to now include dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power. 
With that, I'll want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. But before I turn the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, I wanted to say a few words about him. As you know, Jack has accepted new position at Yale. Not only is he an active Yale alumni, he grew up in New Haven, Connecticut. So Jack's going home. We're thankful for the time he spent with us. 
After joining the company in November of 2010, he was instrumental in engineering the transformation to S&P Global, a faster-growing, more focused and profitable company. He's also assembled an outstanding organization, and we're grateful for all he has done for the company and shareholders. Early next month, Jack will begin his role as Senior Vice President of Operations at Yale. We wish Jack and his family all the best. Rob McKay, our current Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO as we continue the search process for Jack's replacement. Thank you, Jack. And now I'll turn the call over to you."

This morning, I'll recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impacts from adjustments to earnings then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And wrapping up, I'll provide some color on our updated guidance. 
Let's start with the consolidated second quarter income statement. There are just a couple items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 10% with organic growth of 5%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points. Approximately 100 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding profit growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Both businesses have delivered impressive margin improvements year-to-date. 
Interest expense was up over $26 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year, partially in support of the SNL acquisition. This stepped-up level of interest expense will continue to create a difficult year-over-year comparison until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in more than a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustained top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the most profitable quarter in 2015. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $22 million in the quarter. The first item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. The second item includes net disposition costs, primarily related to the pending sale of J.D. Power to the XIO Group and our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE. The last item is a restructuring charge in S&P Global Ratings as the business continues to focus on sustained productivity. And as we discussed last quarter, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization of $23 million. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 95% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $309 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a drawdown on our credit facility. Since the end of the first quarter, we have reduced short-term debt by $163 million. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will likely fluctuate a bit as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. 
Our first half free cash flow was $478 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first half free cash flow was $513 million and is on track to reach our 2016 guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company bought approximately 1.4 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, total to approximately $242 million of cash returned to shareholders just in this quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $538 million to shareholders. The volume weighted average price for the shares repurchased so far this year is approximately $98. The share repurchase program remains an important component of the company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate stepping up share repurchases to help mitigate some of the dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2016 guidance. There are 3 items that have been updated. Our previous guidance included the results of J.D. Power for the full year. We now assume that the sale of J.D. Power will be completed during the third quarter and have remove J.D. Power results for the balance of the year. This will have an impact on revenue and our guidance moves from mid- to high single-digit to new guidance of mid-single digit growth. Year-to-date margins have benefited by approximately 100 basis points from ForEx. Therefore, we have increased our adjusted operating profit margin improvement from approximately 50 basis points to a new guidance of approximately 150 basis points. 
Despite the inherent dilution from removing several months of J.D. Power results, we are increasing our 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 due to the strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The new range is $5.05 to $5.20. We are keeping a wide range as there remains considerable macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact the markets and our customers. 
So in summary, the second quarter was a strong quarter for the company. Each of our segments is performing well, and we are well positioned to continue to provide the essential benchmarks, data and analytics that our customers require. 
As Doug mentioned earlier, today is my last earnings conference call. It has been a pleasure and an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer of, initially, the McGraw-Hill Companies, then McGraw Hill Financial and now S&P Global. I want to thank our shareholders and the analyst community for your interest and support as we have transformed the company. 
And finally, I want to thank the over 20,000 S&P Global associates for your hard work and commitment in building a stronger organization for the future. I wish you all well, and I remain optimistic on the continued success of S&P Global going forward. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

So, first of all, the Market Intelligence business is advancing quite well, as you heard from some of the statistics that I provided and some of the examples. Related specifically to your question about the selling environment, I'll just be clear that we continue to progress faster on cost synergies than we do on sales synergies. But we are finding some early wins -- we're finding more wins in Asia right now than we are necessarily in Europe. And this is where we're able to either sell SNL products into Asia customers, who before didn't use them, using the former Cap IQ sales force, or we're finding opportunities where we've integrated the services together between Cap IQ and SNL and also delivering them into Asia. The selling environment is mixed, as you know. There still are a lot of financial institutions, that is one large part of our customer base, that are reducing headcount. They're reducing some of their, specifically, trading and front office people. On the other hand, on the back office in areas like compliance, control, risk management and also some more traditional consumer banking and commercial banking activities, there are and continue to be increase in headcount. So the environment is mixed with some consolidation and shrinking happening and on the other hand, increase in demand for risk management for other sorts of tool. So we're seeing a mixed market. But we are continuing to have a very, very strong sales effort. Our sales team has integrated excellent and it's very well integrated, and they've got a new commercial approach. We're reaching out to clients in a much more consolidated organized way, and we're starting to see top line growth coming out of the synergies as well."

We've approached our clients in a way that gives us a broad relationship-oriented approach, where we're looking at ways to broaden our coverage, including products like loan, ratings, RES, et cetera. So we're looking across that as well as looking at our contract terms. One of the areas where we also had very strong growth in this quarter was in Asia. Just to give you a color on the issuance in Asia, it was up in across the board in every category. In fact, total issuance in Asia this quarter was greater than total issuance in the United States, if you include sovereign issuers. Sovereign issuers are not necessarily an area that there is a lot of profitability on. But even so, the total issuance in Asia, for the first time, outgrew the total issuance in the U.S. In the U.S., as you know, the issuance was down overall in corporates at 7%, financial institutions was down. While in Asia, the corporates were up 32% and financial institutions were up 84%. So the -- it was a combination of our sales approach, our relationship management approach, more penetration and looking at how we're working on contracts, and then very importantly, the volume in Asia."

That also brings with it a combination of better control, better process management and then also, in many cases, lower expenses.

So it's a combination of factors. But the top line growth, some of that has been driven by approach to how we look at our pricing.

We're not going to shut things out, but if we believe that there would be opportunities that might have incremental value to our company by adding capabilities or products or sales or operations or geographies that might enhance our ability to create value, we might look at those. But we're always going to look at those in combination with what the financial returns are and how that looks for the long run, and then also, do we have the capacity and management skills and capabilities to absorb and take over those business as well. So we have our eyes open. And you know our normal philosophy about our capital waterfall. And so we do look at things, but nothing to report on."

Those continue to flow through. But one of the major areas, if you recall last year, in the first half of the year, we had the final resolution of some of the disputes and lawsuits we had with the U.S. government in 20 states as well as some private litigation. There had been some residual expenses related to that. And then we'd also been engaged in a full-blown implementation of the Dodd-Frank rules, which kicked in, in June 2015. And in order to implement that, we had engaged some outside help from some consulting firms and risk management experts, et cetera. So those are -- the legal fees related to those had tapered off in the second quarter and then some of those external consulting fees and other advisory fees, those are gone. And so we think that we're approaching a more sustainable level of expenses going forward. Although I would point out that with some of our programs, we do continue to invest in technology, that's critical for us. And as we simplify the business, we will be investing in technology.

Related to the overall issuance markets going forward, as you know, from what we just gave you, we do see that there is going to be a reduction in the overall issuance for 2016. But if you look forward further, and you look at the 2016 to 2000 -- looking out forward to 2020 or so, there's 2 factors we're looking at. One of them is total debt markets, including bank loans, which we don't necessarily rate. The market is large. We think it's going to grow by trillions of dollars. In fact, there could -- it could expand over the next 5 years to a $73 trillion market, including a large increase in China. We do think that there is an increase in the combination of refinancing as well as new financing going into that. We are targeting through all of our businesses, in Market Intelligence, couple of businesses there, and then also in ratings, more and more penetration of loan markets and through models and things like that. So we look at the size of the markets and how they're growing longer term than just the next quarter. Over the rest of the year though, we do think that there is a large amount of debt maturing between now and 2021. The issuance -- the maturations over the rest of the year are actually not that strong. That's why we see the full year down about 3.8%. We're concerned about the Brexit. What kind of impact that might have on issuance. U.S. interest rates and global interest rate outlooks are -- have been quite volatile in that they're changing all the time. So in the short run, we usually expect possible volatility as you've seen. If you track this business quarterly, issuance can go up and down. But with a very long run, 5-year view, we see some very large numbers of $73 trillion overall corporate debt market, which includes bank loans and then through 2021, $10.3 trillion in debt maturing, that's actually publicly issued debt. So we do see that there is a lot of activity. We're trying to build our business around this and trying to expand it beyond just being a single ratings approach to market looking at bank loan ratings, RES, different types of loan evaluation services, et cetera. So this is a big area for us to focus our strategy going forward."

It's -- that is probably -- I'm giving you an unscientific answer, but if I were going to look at what are -- what's one of the most important correlations to overall volume as well as activity, it has to do with the price of oil. As you know, as we dropped into a very low oil price early this year, even though it's recovered somewhat, there were a lot of -- people had exited the industry. You had a large increase in defaults and bankruptcies in the U.S., in particular, in different types of oil businesses. So probably getting a higher price of oil is -- would be the largest factor that could bump up growth to the double-digit range, if that was still possible. We have still been growing quite steadily in the mid-single -- mid- to high single-digit range despite this because there's still such a demand for information and for our prices to be embedded in different kinds of contracts.

We think it's an area that it's -- it will continue to develop. We think there will be more and more ETF products and target date products, retirement products, et cetera, that are developed over the years. We would like to play in that. We're off to a good start with our dialogue with asset managers and with ultimate distributors about these types of products and services. We have a core set of indices around S&P 500 as well as some other fixed income indices. We have about $40 billion right now in AUMs in the fixed income index space. We are looking at all different ways to grow the business, whether it would be continuing to grow and penetrate with what we already have and what we're developing as well as looking at the different properties that pop up for sale and whether or not they could be valuable to be added to our portfolio if the price is attractive as well as if the capabilities they bring are attractive.

This morning, Jack and I'll review our second quarter results. We're very pleased with the progress the company is making, creating growth in a macroeconomic environment that has challenged many of our customers. 
Let me begin with the highlights of the second quarter. 
Every segment delivered revenue growth. This is a testament to the quality of our products and the creativity and execution of the employees who develop and deliver them. In addition to creating growth, driving performance is a key theme in managing the company, and margin improvement is an important yardstick by which our progress is measured. This quarter, the company delivered a 210 basis point expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. 
A top priority for 2016 is the integration of SNL. We continue to make progress on SNL integration and synergy targets, and I'll share a few examples with you in a few moments. 
Financial performance was excellent with an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 17% over the most difficult quarter comparison in 2015. As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. 
Last week, we received final regulatory approvals for the sale of J.D. Power. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $513 million, and we increased the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, reflecting strong second quarter results. 
Before I get to the results in more detail, I want to take a moment to discuss the British exit from the European Union. First and foremost, Brexit has no immediate implications for our European operations. It's business as usual for S&P Global. While the media has reported that a number of companies plan on moving operations out of London, we have no such plans. We expect that the -- because of the uncertainty it creates, however, Brexit could hamper issuance, particularly in Europe.
 So far, the impact has been muted, but markets never like uncertainty and it will take time to resolve all for the various regulatory changes that companies and markets will face. For our company, we'll seek to work with the relevant U.K. and EU legal and regulatory authorities to navigate the path forward, a process that will likely take years. S&P Global Ratings has written extensively on the impact that Brexit will have on the markets, and our views can be found on the S&P Global Ratings website at the URL listed on this slide. 
Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter results. While reported revenue grew 10%, organic revenue on a constant-currency basis increased 5%. In most recent quarters, the company's revenue has been hit by ForEx with little impact to operating profit. Primarily due to the weak British pound, however, this quarter was different. In the second quarter, ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue, yet contributed approximately 3 percentage points to adjusted operating profit and approximately 100 basis points to the adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in S&P Global Ratings. So overall, the company delivered 210 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as a result of ForEx, S&P Global Ratings margin improvement and the progress made on SNL integration synergy targets. Together, revenue growth margin improvement and share repurchases combined led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. 
In the second quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in adjusted operating profit. The 2 standout performers were S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence, with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 400 and 370 basis points, respectively. 
Now let me turn to the business, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. During the quarter, revenue increased 4% with a negligible impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 12%, and the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 54.1%. Improved market conditions after a weak 2016 start resulted in a modest year-over-year issuance increase. For the first time in 6 quarters, international revenue outperformed domestic. ForEx had a favorable impact of 3 percentage points on adjusted operating profit and approximately 150 basis points on the adjusted operating profit margin, due primarily to the weakness in the British pound. Excluding ForEx, adjusted expenses decreased 3 percentage points mainly due to reduced outside services. 
Another highlight of the quarter was the purchase of a 49% stake in TRIS Rating. This increased commitment to TRIS in an exciting step forward in our long-standing relationship. By working together more closely, we'll be in a better position to serve our customers and investors in Thailand and other ASEAN markets. 
Non-transaction revenue increased 3% from growth in surveillance, CRISIL, commercial paper activity and royalties from Risk Services. Transaction revenue increased 5% as a result of improved contract terms, increased bank loan rating and growth in debt issuance in Asia. 
If we look more closely at the largest market, second quarter issuance in the U.S. was down 11% with investment grade decreasing 6%, high-yield down 9%, public finance up 4% and structured finance declining 37% with drops in every class. In Europe, investment grade was unchanged, high yield was down 5%, while structured finance increased 4% with strength in RMBS and CLOs. And in Asia, investment grade issuance surged 60% and structured finance increased 20% due to ABS and RMBS. 
Let's take a further look at issuance. The 3% increase in global issuance breaks a 4-quarter streak of year-on-year declining global issuance that had pressured S&P Global Ratings revenue. During the quarter, only Asia reported an increase in issuance with a 55% gain. Excluding domestic Chinese issuance, which we don't rate, issuance in Asia still increased 35%. One factor driving this growth was offshore Chinese issuance. 
During the quarter, investment grade issuers generally had unfettered access to debt capital markets while spec-grade issuers had very limited access with windows of opportunity that opened for short periods and then were disrupted by external events. Despite the year-over-year declines in the U.S. and Europe, there were periods of extreme strength during the quarter. In fact, May set a monthly record for U.S. investment grade issuance. June started out with a very strong issuance, but then came to a standstill in the week leading up to the Brexit vote. 
Last week, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. We now expect global issuance to decline 3.8% in 2016. This compares to the April forecast, which anticipate a decline of approximately 2%. The biggest differences are in corporate and structured issuance, which have been lower due to Brexit, and international public issuance, which has been increased as first half issuance already exceeds all of 2015. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the second quarter, revenue increased 29%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic growth was 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased 48% and adjusted operating margin advanced 370 basis points to 28.4%. The adjusted segment operating margin includes a benefit from ForEx of approximately 100 basis points. Excluding ForEx, this figure is comparable to the first quarter adjusted segment operating margin. ForEx had a favorable impact of 5 percentage points on adjusted operating profit, primarily due to weakness in the Indian rupee and British pound. 
In 2016, successful integration of SNL was a top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL, and we recognize that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver return on that investment. We are well on our way to achieving cross-sell synergy targets for 2016. 
Last quarter, we reviewed some of the organizational changes that took place. Today, in order to help you get a better sense of our efforts, I'm going to share several examples of integration synergies progress during the quarter. We reconfigured our Risk Services Scorecard product for analyzing commercial banks to include SNL Bank data and received great feedback and early sale success from the market. 
We integrated our equity ownership and earnings estimate data on to the SNL platform. We made tremendous progress on integrating SNL sector-specific fundamental data into our Xpressfeed delivery platform. Now in beta testing, SNL content will be available this fall, enabling more seamless cross-selling to our existing feed clients. We completed significant design work on our next-generation consolidated product platform that will encompass mobile, web and excel delivery. Reduced cost by replacing third-party data with internal solutions, we completed our office consolidations in Denver, New York and Singapore with other cities still in the works. We've been making great progress. 
Let me add a bit more color on second quarter revenue growth in S&P Global Market Intelligence, which delivered double-digit user growth in both S&P Capital IQ Desktop and SNL. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 8% with high single-digit growth in both products. In addition, SNL revenue reported a 9% increase compared to the second quarter 2015. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, however, excluding a purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, revenue grew 10%. With the progress that we continue to make integrating SNL into S&P Global Market Intelligence, it will become increasingly difficult to separate SNL results from the total. Therefore, this is likely the last quarter we'll provide separate revenue figures for SNL. 
Risk services revenue increased 10% led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, Research & Advisory, revenue decreased 12% due to declines in equity research services. 
Now let's turn to S&P Global -- S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 66%. Market volatility has created large swings in AUM from month to month as well as volatility in the number of exchange-traded derivative contracts traded each month. During the second quarter, revenue increased primarily due to steady data license growth, strength in exchange-traded derivative activity due to market volatility and ETF-related revenue was up slightly. 
If we turn to 3 types of revenue, transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives increased primarily due to a 24% increase in average daily volume of products based on S&P DJI's Indices. In particular, E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index, VIX, and CME equity complex track -- contracts all increased more than 20%. Asset-linked fees revenue, mostly from exchange-traded funds, was up slightly. The exchange-traded products industry recorded inflows of $46 billion in the second quarter with fixed income products receiving the largest inflows. 
Average AUM associated with our indices increased 3% year-over-year with inflows of 7%, offset by asset value declines of 4%. The quarter ended on a high note with quarter ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reaching a new record of $855 billion as U.S. equity markets rebounded. This creates a great starting point for the third quarter. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices, increased due to continued steady growth in data subscription revenue. During the quarter, the company launched 90 new indices, and our partners launched 18 new ETFs based on our indices. We added 2 in the environmental, social and governance space that I'd like to highlight. JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Indices, designed to measure performance of Japanese companies that are proactively and effectively making investments in physical and human capital based on various metrics including the RobecoSAM human capital scores. And the S&P ESG Index series, designed to measure the performance of companies with a weighting scheme based on an ESG factor score derived from RobecoSAM's annual corporate sustainability assessment. This launch brings together for the first time Smart Beta and sustainability into a global index family that treats environmental, social and governance, or ESG, on a standalone performance factor. With the addition of these 2 indices, we now have 130 ESG indices. 
This quarter, we celebrated the 120th anniversary of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, launched in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones. On its first day, May 16, 1896, the Dow closed at 40.94. Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the iconic symbol of the U.S. stock market. 
Now on to S&P Global Platts, which currently includes J.D. Power. Organic revenue increased 4% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide, Petromedia and RigData acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 38.4%. Platts delivered 7% revenue growth driven by strength in subscriptions in Global Trading Services. J.D. Power had a declining organic revenue due to lower consulting revenue in China. With all of the regulatory requirements completed, we continue to expect closing the sale of J.D. Power this quarter. 
Turning to Platts. Global Trading Services led the growth during the quarter with double-digit revenue gains primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE exchanges. The core subscription business delivered mid-single digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector, with particular strength in Asia. Metals, agricultural and petrochemicals revenue grew at high single-digit, primarily due to the strength in Singapore Exchange-listed TSI Iron Ore contracts and metal market data subscriptions. 
While rig counts are up since the beginning of May, many of our customers remain under pressure from low oil prices. Therefore, we continue to expect growth to moderate slightly in the remainder of 2016 as these customers continue to face difficulties. Finally, the CME Group introduced a new Aluminum A380 alloy futures contracts that settles against our price assessment. There has been growing need for North American aluminum alloy risk management tool. This contract will provide market participants with an effective solution for hedging aluminum alloy price risk. 
On the business development front, we have several new items. In June, we acquired RigData, a leading provider of daily information on rig activity for the natural gas and oil markets across North America. We discussed our desire to add our own supply-demand data offerings, and this extends our energy analytic capabilities in North America natural gas with oil offering. Founded in 1986, RigData provides over 5,500 constant [ph] customers with daily electronic reports on drilling permits, activity and rig locations in the United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. 
We launched 5 domestic oil product assessments in Japan. Platts now assesses prices for important refined oil products for domestic waterborne deliveries in Japan from locations in Tokyo Bay, Chukyo and Hanshin. The Japan waterborne assessments reflect prices for gasoline, gas oil, kerosene, low-sulfur A fuel oil and high-sulfur fuel -- A fuel oil. These assessments will follow Platts' market-on-close principle. 
And finally, we launched the LNG U.S. Gulf Coast Marker. The natural gas infrastructure that connects United States, Mexico and Canada is the world's largest and most integrated natural gas market. By 2020, the Americas are expected to be the world's third-largest producer of LNG behind Australia and Qatar. This new price reflects the daily export value of LNG traded free on board from the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
In summary, all segments delivered revenue growth. Bond issuance recovered from a weak start to the year. Margin improvement continues to be a key focus. Integration of SNL remains a top priority for the company with meaningful progress to date. We expect Brexit to have no immediate implications for the company. And we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $5.05 to $5.20. Our guidance has been updated to now include dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power. 
With that, I'll want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. But before I turn the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, I wanted to say a few words about him. As you know, Jack has accepted new position at Yale. Not only is he an active Yale alumni, he grew up in New Haven, Connecticut. So Jack's going home. We're thankful for the time he spent with us. 
After joining the company in November of 2010, he was instrumental in engineering the transformation to S&P Global, a faster-growing, more focused and profitable company. He's also assembled an outstanding organization, and we're grateful for all he has done for the company and shareholders. Early next month, Jack will begin his role as Senior Vice President of Operations at Yale. We wish Jack and his family all the best. Rob McKay, our current Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO as we continue the search process for Jack's replacement. Thank you, Jack. And now I'll turn the call over to you."

This morning, I'll recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impacts from adjustments to earnings then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash",985,"Thanks, Doug, and I appreciate those kind words, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impacts from adjustments to earnings then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And wrapping up, I'll provide some color on our updated guidance. 
Let's start with the consolidated second quarter income statement. There are just a couple items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 10% with organic growth of 5%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points. Approximately 100 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding profit growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Both businesses have delivered impressive margin improvements year-to-date. 
Interest expense was up over $26 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year, partially in support of the SNL acquisition. This stepped-up level of interest expense will continue to create a difficult year-over-year comparison until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in more than a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustained top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the most profitable quarter in 2015. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $22 million in the quarter. The first item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. The second item includes net disposition costs, primarily related to the pending sale of J.D. Power to the XIO Group and our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE. The last item is a restructuring charge in S&P Global Ratings as the business continues to focus on sustained productivity. And as we discussed last quarter, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization of $23 million. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 95% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $309 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a drawdown on our credit facility. Since the end of the first quarter, we have reduced short-term debt by $163 million. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will likely fluctuate a bit as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. 
Our first half free cash flow was $478 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first half free cash flow was $513 million and is on track to reach our 2016 guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company bought approximately 1.4 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, total to approximately $242 million of cash returned to shareholders just in this quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $538 million to shareholders. The volume weighted average price for the shares repurchased so far this year is approximately $98. The share repurchase program remains an important component of the company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate stepping up share repurchases to help mitigate some of the dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2016 guidance. There are 3 items that have been updated. Our previous guidance included the results of J.D. Power for the full year. We now assume that the sale of J.D. Power will be completed during the third quarter and have remove J.D. Power results for the balance of the year. This will have an impact on revenue and our guidance moves from mid- to high single-digit to new guidance of mid-single digit growth. Year-to-date margins have benefited by approximately 100 basis points from ForEx. Therefore, we have increased our adjusted operating profit margin improvement from approximately 50 basis points to a new guidance of approximately 150 basis points. 
Despite the inherent dilution from removing several months of J.D. Power results, we are increasing our 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 due to the strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The new range is $5.05 to $5.20. We are keeping a wide range as there remains considerable macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact the markets and our customers. 
So in summary, the second quarter was a strong quarter for the company. Each of our segments is performing well, and we are well positioned to continue to provide the essential benchmarks, data and analytics that our customers require. 
As Doug mentioned earlier, today is my last earnings conference call. It has been a pleasure and an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer of, initially, the McGraw-Hill Companies, then McGraw Hill Financial and now S&P Global. I want to thank our shareholders and the analyst community for your interest and support as we have transformed the company. 
And finally, I want to thank the over 20,000 S&P Global associates for your hard work and commitment in building a stronger organization for the future. I wish you all well, and I remain optimistic on the continued success of S&P Global going forward. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

Welcome to the call. I think this is your first time on our call. So, first of all, the Market Intelligence business is advancing quite well, as you heard from some of the statistics that I provided and some of the examples. Related specifically to your question about the selling environment, I'll just be clear that we continue to progress faster on cost synergies than we do on sales synergies. But we are finding some early wins -- we're finding more wins in Asia right now than we are necessarily in Europe. And this is where we're able to either sell SNL products into Asia customers, who before didn't use them, using the former Cap IQ sales force, or we're finding opportunities where we've integrated the services together between Cap IQ and SNL and also delivering them into Asia. The selling environment is mixed, as you know. There still are a lot of financial institutions, that is one large part of our customer base, that are reducing headcount. They're reducing some of their, specifically, trading and front office people. On the other hand, on the back office in areas like compliance, control, risk management and also some more traditional consumer banking and commercial banking activities, there are and continue to be increase in headcount. So the environment is mixed with some consolidation and shrinking happening and on the other hand, increase in demand for risk management for other sorts of tool. So we're seeing a mixed market. But we are continuing to have a very, very strong sales effort. Our sales team has integrated excellent and it's very well integrated, and they've got a new commercial approach. We're reaching out to clients in a much more consolidated organized way, and we're starting to see top line growth coming out of the synergies as well."

And to start off with, as you know, we've been in -- engaging in a commercial approach to running our business with hiring of Chris Heusler last year to lead our commercial activities. We've approached our clients in a way that gives us a broad relationship-oriented approach, where we're looking at ways to broaden our coverage, including products like loan, ratings, RES, et cetera. So we're looking across that as well as looking at our contract terms. One of the areas where we also had very strong growth in this quarter was in Asia. Just to give you a color on the issuance in Asia, it was up in across the board in every category. In fact, total issuance in Asia this quarter was greater than total issuance in the United States, if you include sovereign issuers. Sovereign issuers are not necessarily an area that there is a lot of profitability on. But even so, the total issuance in Asia, for the first time, outgrew the total issuance in the U.S. In the U.S., as you know, the issuance was down overall in corporates at 7%, financial institutions was down. While in Asia, the corporates were up 32% and financial institutions were up 84%. So the -- it was a combination of our sales approach, our relationship management approach, more penetration and looking at how we're working on contracts, and then very importantly, the volume in Asia."

That also brings with it a combination of better control, better process management and then also, in many cases, lower expenses. So on that side, we're having a lot of focus and on the top line, we're looking also at ways to simplify our pricing model to revisit our contracts that we've had with customers for a very long time that provided relationship pricing that were -- that we want to recalibrate to markets where there's much larger issuance. So it's a combination of factors. But the top line growth, some of that has been driven by approach to how we look at our pricing.

One of them is, if you recall, about 1.5 years ago, we had undertaken a couple of programs to rebalance our sales force as well as rebalance our analytical force globally. We also had some programs where we slowed down some hiring. So some of that's just coming through -- from straight headcount and straight changes to the way that we are managing the business. Those continue to flow through. But one of the major areas, if you recall last year, in the first half of the year, we had the final resolution of some of the disputes and lawsuits we had with the U.S. government in 20 states as well as some private litigation. There had been some residual expenses related to that. And then we'd also been engaged in a full-blown implementation of the Dodd-Frank rules, which kicked in, in June 2015. And in order to implement that, we had engaged some outside help from some consulting firms and risk management experts, et cetera. So those are -- the legal fees related to those had tapered off in the second quarter and then some of those external consulting fees and other advisory fees, those are gone. And so we think that we're approaching a more sustainable level of expenses going forward. Although I would point out that with some of our programs, we do continue to invest in technology, that's critical for us. And as we simplify the business, we will be investing in technology. And here and there, we are going to invest in talent and people. So -- but we do think that some of those extraordinary expenses have been cleaned now -- cleared through."

So it's -- it is a combination of how well we do on growing the top line. That is going to have an impact on it and if we can have some of that incremental sales drop to the bottom line, taking advantage of our scale. But I guess, a long answer to your question, but we continue to be committed to driving growth in our margin through continuous improvement both from top line activities as well as finding ways to continue to be more efficient on our cost base as well."

Related to the overall issuance markets going forward, as you know, from what we just gave you, we do see that there is going to be a reduction in the overall issuance for 2016. But if you look forward further, and you look at the 2016 to 2000 -- looking out forward to 2020 or so, there's 2 factors we're looking at. One of them is total debt markets, including bank loans, which we don't necessarily rate. The market is large. We think it's going to grow by trillions of dollars. In fact, there could -- it could expand over the next 5 years to a $73 trillion market, including a large increase in China. We do think that there is an increase in the combination of refinancing as well as new financing going into that. We are targeting through all of our businesses, in Market Intelligence, couple of businesses there, and then also in ratings, more and more penetration of loan markets and through models and things like that. So we look at the size of the markets and how they're growing longer term than just the next quarter. Over the rest of the year though, we do think that there is a large amount of debt maturing between now and 2021. The issuance -- the maturations over the rest of the year are actually not that strong. That's why we see the full year down about 3.8%. We're concerned about the Brexit. What kind of impact that might have on issuance. U.S. interest rates and global interest rate outlooks are -- have been quite volatile in that they're changing all the time. So in the short run, we usually expect possible volatility as you've seen. If you track this business quarterly, issuance can go up and down. But with a very long run, 5-year view, we see some very large numbers of $73 trillion overall corporate debt market, which includes bank loans and then through 2021, $10.3 trillion in debt maturing, that's actually publicly issued debt. So we do see that there is a lot of activity. We're trying to build our business around this and trying to expand it beyond just being a single ratings approach to market looking at bank loan ratings, RES, different types of loan evaluation services, et cetera. So this is a big area for us to focus our strategy going forward."

It's -- that is probably -- I'm giving you an unscientific answer, but if I were going to look at what are -- what's one of the most important correlations to overall volume as well as activity, it has to do with the price of oil. As you know, as we dropped into a very low oil price early this year, even though it's recovered somewhat, there were a lot of -- people had exited the industry. You had a large increase in defaults and bankruptcies in the U.S., in particular, in different types of oil businesses. So probably getting a higher price of oil is -- would be the largest factor that could bump up growth to the double-digit range, if that was still possible. We have still been growing quite steadily in the mid-single -- mid- to high single-digit range despite this because there's still such a demand for information and for our prices to be embedded in different kinds of contracts.

I'm just wondering how the resourcing of that business is handled with so many different variables kind of out there?"

We have a resource model that takes everything that you just mentioned into account in terms of our forecasting. We are able to manage the staffing level through attrition, if we needed to, and we're also able to manage it through our bonus pool, our bonus accruals, if that was something we needed to look at to ensure that we're accruing according to the kind of level of staffing we have as well as level of activity. Those are 2 of the most important levers. But we've built a way that we've got some flexibility as well by having analysts that are spread around the globe. They are not all concentrated in London and New York. Despite the Brexit being a concern for us, we do have significant staffing in other European cities, including Frankfurt and Paris and Madrid. We also get support from our partner CRISIL in India to its -- they're part of the overall flow as well as some of the aspects to workflow processes of crunching numbers, et cetera. So we have various variables we use to manage that. And that's part of what John Berisford is doing a great job at."

That's an area that we've been spending a lot of time on structurally as well as strategically. The industry itself is going through a massive amount of change with Barclays having changed hands, with ICE having bought IDC, with what's happening in Europe with the exchange transaction going on there and interest of fixed income investments around the world as well as all of the main asset managers, large global asset managers, looking at so much change in volatility in the shape of the fixed income markets, especially with pricing and liquidity concerns creeping in. We think it's an area that it's -- it will continue to develop. We think there will be more and more ETF products and target date products, retirement products, et cetera, that are developed over the years. We would like to play in that. We're off to a good start with our dialogue with asset managers and with ultimate distributors about these types of products and services. We have a core set of indices around S&P 500 as well as some other fixed income indices. We have about $40 billion right now in AUMs in the fixed income index space. We are looking at all different ways to grow the business, whether it would be continuing to grow and penetrate with what we already have and what we're developing as well as looking at the different properties that pop up for sale and whether or not they could be valuable to be added to our portfolio if the price is attractive as well as if the capabilities they bring are attractive. So continues to be an important potential growth area for us. And we do have dedicated resources to seeing how we can grow in this area.
Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. With that, let me conclude the call. I -- I'm pleased that we had another strong quarter. The financial performance is excellent, ending up with an EPS growth of 17% and year-to-date cash flow $513 million, et cetera, is all something that we're very pleased that we've been able to achieve. But let me end the call again by thanking Jack Callahan. He's been a great partner, and he's heading off to Yale University, and they're going to get the benefit of his experience and expertise.

Welcome, everyone, to the call. This morning, Rob MacKay, our interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results, and you're -- you'll hear from him shortly. But let me begin with the hi",2314,"Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome, everyone, to the call. This morning, Rob MacKay, our interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results, and you're -- you'll hear from him shortly. 
But let me begin with the highlights. We completed several business divestitures with the sale of J.D. Power, our 2 pricing businesses, [indiscernible] and CMA, and the equity research business. This leaves us with a more focused, interrelated portfolio of market-leading businesses. 2 tuck-in acquisitions were added during the quarter, PIRA Energy Group within Platts and Trucost within S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Several key management additions were announced. We completed the 3-year $140 million cost-reduction initiative that was announced during our Investor Day in 2014. We demonstrated continued revenue growth and productivity progress, which led to an adjusted profit margin improvement of 320 basis points, with every segment delivering organic revenue growth. 
As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. Our bottom line result was excellent with a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS over the third quarter last year. 
We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, and we increased our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25, which Rob will cover shortly. 
Before we turn to the results, I want to note 3 new appointees to our management team. Steve Kemps joined us from our Quanta Services as EVP of General Counsel. Martin Fraenkel has been promoted to President, S&P Global Platts. Martin previously led the global editorial team at Platts. And Ewout Steenbergen will join us from Voya Financial as EVP and Chief Financial Officer effective November 14. I'm pleased we avoided any disruptions to our businesses as we put in place an excellent leadership team. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter results. Reported revenue grew 9% and organic revenue, on a constant-currency basis increased 8%. In the third quarter, ForEx reduced revenue by $5 million, yet contributed approximately $8 million to adjusted operating profit and approximately 60 basis points to adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in that Platts segment, which benefited from a weaker British pound. The company delivered a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. Together, revenue growth, margin improvement and share repurchases led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 per share. 
In the third quarter, every division recorded organic top line growth. Profit growth, however, was most pronounced at Ratings and Market Intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 330 and 480 basis points, respectively. 
Let me turn to the businesses, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. Despite initial uncertainty from the Brexit vote, third quarter issuance was strong, particularly nonfinancial global corporates and U.S. public finance market. This resulted in a 9% increase in revenue with a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 17% due to strong revenue growth and cost containment, particularly with reduced legal and outside services spending. The adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points to 51.3%. ForEx had a negligible impact on adjusted operating profit. 
Non-transaction revenue was unchanged with growth in surveillance fees offset by lower Rating Evaluation Services fees. Transaction revenue increased 23% as a result of improved contract terms, growth in debt issuance and a 21% increase in bank loan ratings revenue. 
I also want to note that as we work to reenter the U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS market, there were 13 transactions in the quarter, and we rated 2 of them. 
If we look more closely at the largest markets, third quarter issuance in the U.S. was up 7% with investment grade decreasing 3%, high yields soaring 49%, public finance up 16% and structured finance increasing 11% due to a 44% increase in ABS transactions, driven especially by credit card ABS. 
In Europe, issuance increased 14% with investment grade climbing 42%, driven by large M&A transactions, high yield rising 37% and structured finance decreasing 46%, primarily due to a 59% decline in covered bonds. 
In Asia, issuance more than doubled. However, excluding domestic China issuance, which we do not rate, Asia issuance increased 64%. Investment grade surged to 166%. However, excluding domestic China, it increased 67%. Japan was the country with the largest increase due to the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy. Finally, structured finance increased 2%. 
2 weeks ago, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. In the 3 months since the Brexit vote, debt markets have reacted very positively with unexpected levels of new issuance, especially in the nonfinancial corporate financial sectors and international public finance sectors. We now expect global issuance to increase 24% in 2016. This compares to the July forecast issued on the heels of the Brexit vote, which anticipated a decline of approximately 4%. If we remove sovereign issuance from the forecast, however, we anticipate issuance 2016 to increase approximately 10%.  Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall issuance increase -- we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 5%, driven by the ECB extending its quantitative easing policies longer than currently anticipated and further growth out of China. Excluding sovereign issuance, we anticipate issuance 2017 to increase 3% to 6%. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the third quarter, revenue increased 21%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic revenue growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 43%, and the adjusted operating margin advanced 480 basis points to 31.4%. This improvement was due to progress on SNL integration synergies, operating leverage from strong organic revenue growth and continued efficiency gain. ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue and adjusted operating profit in the quarter. As we have stated before, in 2016, successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies is a top priority for the company. We've made tremendous progress as evident in the margin improvement, and remain committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and deliver on our expected return on investment in SNL. 
Let me add a bit more color on third quarter revenue growth in Market Intelligence. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 6% with high single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ Desktop. In addition, on a comparable basis, which includes revenue prior to our acquisition, SNL revenue increased 12% over the third quarter 2015. SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth in the low teens and high single digit, respectively. 
Risk services revenue increased 10%, led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, Research and Advisory, revenue decreased 8% due to declines in equity research. With the sale of Equity Research, the only remaining asset in this category is Investment Advisory. Therefore, in the future, we'll report Investment Advisory as part of Financial Data and Analytics. 
Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 6%,  adjusted operating profit increased 1% and adjusted operating margin declined 320 basis points to 66.2%. This is a sizable decline as the third quarter of 2015 benefited from a sharp increase in exchange-traded derivative volume that did not repeat this quarter. I also want to point out that the adjusted margin this quarter is comparable to the 66% figure we reported last quarter. 
During the third quarter, revenue increased primarily due to mutual funds and ETF license fees and steady data license growth. Operating cost increased to support revenue growth in business initiatives as well as increased cost for purchased data. One notable example is connectivity expenses as we recently started up a third data center to provide additional backup capabilities. 
Often on our earnings calls, I cite new products that we have launched. Last quarter, I highlighted the launch of the JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index in Japan. The new ETF that was launched based on this index has turned out to be one of the fastest-growing new ETFs this year. It already has over $700 million in AUM. 
Asset linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter. The exchange-traded products industry recorded massive inflows of $126 billion in the third quarter, almost triple the inflows in the second quarter. Of the $126 billion of industry inflows, $58 billion went into the U.S. equity products, with S&P Dow Jones Indices capturing about 60% of those inflows. Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 15% year-over-year with inflows of 10% and the remainder from market appreciation. The quarter-ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $914 billion. 
Transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives decreased, primarily due to a 14% decrease in average daily volume of products based on our indices. The E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index Options and Futures, VIX, and CME Equity Complex Contrast -- Contracts all decreased 10% to 25% compared to the volatile third quarter of 2015. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices, increased due to growth in data subscription revenue and the timing of subscription revenue. 
During the quarter, the company launched 161 new indices, and our partners launched 11 new ETFs based on our indices. 
Now onto the S&P Global Platts segment, which included J.D. Power results for July and August. Because this quarter has one less month of J.D. Power revenue than the third quarter of 2015, segment revenue declined 8%. Segment organic revenue, though, increased 4%. Adjusted operating profit increased 4%, reflecting one less month of J.D. Power. And adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 40.9%. Organic revenue increased 4% due to growth in subscriptions, partially offset by decline in Global Trading Services. 
The core subscription business delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector. The Global Trading Services' double-digit revenue decrease is primarily due to the timing of license fees. Gas and power revenue is flat with modest gains in subscriptions, offset by lower GTS service revenue. Metals, Agriculture and Petrochemicals revenue declined low single digit, primarily due to lower revenue from SGX-listed TSI iron ore contracts. We continue to expect modest growth for the remainder of 2016 as many customers continue to face pressure from low oil prices. 
On the business development front, we're building a world-class capability in energy supply and demand information, the acquisition of PIRA Energy Group and the added capabilities of Commodity Flow and RigData, which we acquired earlier this year. 
PIRA is a leader in the worldwide energy market analysis and a great complement to our existing benchmarks. PIRA offers research and analysis in oil, gas, power, natural gas liquids, biofuels, coal, environmental and agricultural markets. They also provide data tools to help customers analyze prices, supply, demand, trade flows, product balances and refining activity. And I'm pleased that Executive Chairman and Founder of PIRA, Dr. Gary Ross, has joined our team and is already generating new product ideas. 
In addition, Platts worked with CME to launch a new futures contract. Alumina FOB Australia Futures will be a 100-metric ton contract and [ph] when we financially settled each month against the daily price index published for Alumina FOB Australia by S&P Global Platts. Alumina is aluminum oxide, a white granular material, a little finer than table salt that's transformed into alumina metal in the smelting process. This new futures contract is in addition to the 3 existing CME aluminum futures contracts based on Platts benchmark. 
And finally, Brazil [indiscernible]. Latin America's largest depository of private fixed income securities and Brazil's largest private asset clearinghouse, is going to make Platts benchmark prices estimates available as settlement mechanisms for the development of domestic derivative contracts. Historically, Brazil's only hedging tools tend to be similar, but not necessarily matching commodity indices, or they were international rather than domestic contracts. 
Investors are increasingly seeking new insights into environmental, social and government -- governance factors. And both our index and ratings businesses are taking action to address these needs. 
First, our S&P Dow Jones Indices acquired Trucost. Trucost has become a leading brand in ESG information sector. They provide the gold standard carbon and natural capital investment metrics that financial institutions need to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and capitalize on the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. The complementary nature of our 2 businesses allow us to combine Trucost's industry-leading environmental impact data with our world-class benchmarking capabilities to develop new ESG solutions. 
Second, Ratings is developing a green bond evaluation tool to provide an analysis and estimate of the environmental impact of projects financed by a bond proceeds. Our proposed approach would address mitigation, such as reducing negative environmental impact and adaptation to look at resiliency to the impact of climate change. The output of the green bond evaluation would include scores from the categories listed here amalgamated into an overall financial green -- final green bond evaluation. I'm encouraged by the innovative thinking underway in the company to help tackle increased ESG needs of investors. 
Before I conclude, I need to point out a reporting change. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we'll report our results under 3 segments: Ratings, Indices and Market and Commodities Intelligence. We are doing this to be consistent with how we manage our businesses. 
In summary, we completed sales of J.D. Power, 2 pricing businesses and Equity Research. We had consistent results with all segments delivering organic revenue growth. Bond issuance is robust in the third quarter despite the Brexit vote. Our focus on revenue growth and productivity performance led to continued margin improvement. Integration of SNL is progressing well and remains a top priority in 2016. And our adjusted diluted EPS guidance has increased to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 and includes dilution from the sale of J.D. Power, the pricing businesses and Equity Research. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Rob."

This morning, I will recap key financial results, discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings, then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. Next, I'll discuss the completion of our $140 million productivity program, the financial impact of our recent divestitures and update our 2016 guidance. Before wrapping up, I will explain the new segment reporting that will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter and the data we will provide. 
Let's start with the consolidated third quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line organic growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 9% with organic growth on a constant currency basis of 8%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $5 million and had a favorable impact of $8 million on operating profit. Our adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points. Approximately 60 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding top line growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 31.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over the third quarter of 2015 due to onetime benefits recorded in the prior period. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. 
Taken together, top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction combined to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $732 million in the quarter. The largest item is a gain on the sale of J.D. Power. The next item is a net gain from insurance proceed recoveries. And the last item includes net acquisition and disposition-related costs, primarily related to the sale of our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE, and J.D. Power to the XIO Group. And as we discussed earlier this year, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization, which totaled $23 million during the quarter. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $1.6 billion was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.6 billion of long-term debt and $400 million of short-term debt. The short-term debt is the value of the 2017 notes that were redeemed in October. One other item that I want to point out is that the cash proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power were recorded in the quarter. However, the tax on the gain will not be paid until later in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow during the first 9 months was approximately $1 billion. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow from the first 9 months was approximately $1.1 billion. 
Now I'll review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan. This resulted in the repurchase of 5.3 million shares during the quarter. However, the final share count reduction will not be determined until the ASR is completed. In addition, the company paid a dividend of $95 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In March of 2014, we initiated a productivity target of greater than $100 million in cost-reduction initiatives during 2014 to 2016. We subsequently increased the target to $140 million. Today, we are pleased to announce the successful completion of this program. We delivered slightly more than the $140 million in savings. If you look at the chart on the right, you can see that our adjusted operating margin has increased by 900 basis points since 2013. The successful achievement of this $140 million productivity target was a key contributor to this improvement. 
While we are pleased with our recent divestitures, we want to make sure all of you understand the loss of revenue and profitability associated with these transactions. J.D. Power, the SPSE and CMA pricing businesses and Equity Research combines to generate $310 million of revenue, $108 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA and approximately $0.25 of pro forma adjusted diluted EPS to our 2016 results before they were sold. This equates to approximately $100 million of revenue and $0.08 of adjusted diluted EPS that will be foregone each quarter. The recently announced ASR should help offset some of this dilution. We estimate that the ASR will increase diluted adjusted earnings per share by about $0.10 over the next year. We hope these figures will help you with your modeling of our future results. 
Based upon our strong results year-to-date and the expectation of debt issuance remain strong for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25. We've also made changes to other components of guidance as follows: adjusted unallocated expense is reduced to $135 million due primarily to reduced professional fees. The adjusted operating margin increase over 2015 is now expected to be approximately 200 basis points. This is largely due to the excellent performance in Ratings and Market Intelligence. The adjusted tax rate is increased to approximately 31.5%, primarily due to the timing and size of past years' tax settlements. Free cash flow, excluding the after-tax legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries, is increased to $1.4 billion due to strong financial results. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2016 will be another strong year for the company. 
The final item I want to discuss is the upcoming change to our reporting segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts will be included in a new segment called Market and Commodities Intelligence. Both fourth quarter results and full year 2016 results of both businesses will be reported in this new segment. To facilitate analysis in the next few weeks, we'll provide a pro forma schedule with results of this new segment for all quarters of 2015 and 2016 as if it had existed this way. This should help investors model 2017 appropriately. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

We are obviously going through our year-end review and our 2017 to 2019 strategic planning process, where we're evaluating ways that we can invest in the business. So investing in organic growth, which could be expansion of regional areas, of new products, of technology investments, et cetera, is very important for us. Following that, obviously, would be ways that we can accelerate growth or expand into new regions or new capabilities through M&A. Then obviously, finally, come our approach to dividends and share repurchase. But when it comes to your question around M&A, we would be looking at many ideas and many options coming in. Tuck-ins could be attractive for us, but it's something that we would do business by business, opportunity by opportunity, look at them separately as they arise. We have seen, as you know, tuck-in acquisitions have been a way for us to grow our portfolio of products in Platts. It's given us opportunities with different areas and services in Market Intelligence. Last quarter, we had purchased a very small rating agency in Thailand in our S&P Global Ratings area. So we would continue to look selectively at areas, but they need to -- we need to ensure that they also meet our parameters for growth and returns."

One of the areas that is a very fragmented business and there's high growth that relates to data and analytics on the energy market. And SNL has a small energy business and Platts, obviously, has a very large energy business. And we wanted to accelerate the integration of those 2 businesses, but more importantly take advantage of the expertise that we have in the Market Intelligence data machine and how they can work together with Platts on building out that data analytics business. So this was not something that I really felt we should wait. I felt it wasn't something we should wait for a couple of years for, that we needed to move now. The opportunities are going to start cropping up and we wanted to be positioned to take advantage of them as quickly as possible."

So there's obviously a few components to the revenue, one of them we just mentioned. It has been very strong in the last few quarters here now, which is the volatility aspect of our revenue, which relates to the exchange-traded derivative trading volume that goes through. So there's that aspect to it. There's another aspect, which is the core businesses that relate to AUM growth. And AUM growth, which could be a combination of the fees that we get for the actual underlying components of a fund or an ETF or the actual growth in AUMs over time. So that's a very important factor for us. And then we have our data feeds and data business. Generally, we are seeing growth in all of those. And I think that the drop of the exchange-traded derivative income is what impacted this quarter. It also had very positively impacted the third quarter last year. So that's a little bit about that -- about the -- about what you see there in the different between last year and this year. But let me just give you a couple of data points about the growth in the AUMs. So if I go way back, I go back almost 5, 6 years ago, if you go back into the end of 2013, there was a -- the overall AUMs was only $585 billion. It's now $914 billion, and it's in the end of this quarter. And through that time, there's been a combination of factors that have driven that growth. One is the increase in market value. So as the market itself and the indices themselves go up, that is a positive for our revenue. And the other is flows into the funds. And you saw that, last week, in the Wall Street Journal, there was a series the entire week about the shifting needs of investors and the changes in the investment management industry, which have been benefiting -- have been benefiting firms like ours that are in the past have been index fields. So we're not giving you any specific projections today. We'll provide guidance for 2017 at our next earnings call, but we do continue to see the trend for this industry to be very positive."

And I think that is really my question. If you look at the new combined segment now, how much of the business in terms of revenue or EBITDA do you think is really businesses that are Platts-like and maybe have gotten lost before, like things that are must haves, very sticky, good pricing power, things like the set database, ratings, reselling, like versus maybe some of the things that are more discretionary, easier to cut, like the desktop businesses?"

So within this segment, obviously, you're going to have the must-have products of SNL. You've got the must-have products of things like CUSIP, our risk services, areas which we have products which have become very important for risk management tools that you see as people are doing CCAR modeling and liquidity planning and living wills. So there's an advantage to having all of those types of products together. In addition then, you've got the Platts part of the business. So you've got a combination -- I don't know the numbers off of the top of my head. That would be better if we talked about that after we put together the new segment information and we send it out, but there is a lot of must-have data in there. And then remember that the traditional Cap IQ and SNL desktops have been growing very well. They're growing in somewhere in the high single-digit level for the Cap IQ desktop and over double digits for the SNL. So even though they might have some sort of discretionary component to them, they're still growing at a very good clip, and in many cases, substituting for other products which might be similar but are much more expensive."

As you've heard us say before, our goal was to remove all of the first areas of things like legal expense, of ensuring that we had the right approach to managing our business when it came to compliance and control, embedding new technology tools to have more automation. We have a project going on right now called Project simplify, which has the benefit of better control, a better workflow. And eventually, we'll also bring lower cost with it as well as you have more streamlined operations. So think about our approach towards margin as continuous improvement. We will keep striving to improve our margin. I'm not going to give you a target necessarily today, but we do have a commitment to strive to keep improving our margin. And now it come with a combination of better penetration into the markets, to our sales force, through looking at how we can manage our contracts and our mix and pricing as well as discounting policies. And then on the cost side, through projects like Simplify, and other ways to manage the business more efficiently more effectively. So you can see, over the last few years, we have had a continuous improvement in our margins, and that's a commitment that we still have."

But we're looking at -- if you want to think of it in 2 ways, the diversification of our expertise into some other product areas and also -- we hope and believe it could be a source of additional growth."

Welcome, everyone, to the call. This morning, Rob MacKay, our interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results, and you're -- you'll hear from him shortly. But let me begin with the hi",2313,"Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome, everyone, to the call. This morning, Rob MacKay, our interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results, and you're -- you'll hear from him shortly. 
But let me begin with the highlights. We completed several business divestitures with the sale of J.D. Power, our 2 pricing businesses, SPSE and CMA, and the equity research business. This leaves us with a more focused, interrelated portfolio of market-leading businesses. 2 tuck-in acquisitions were added during the quarter, PIRA Energy Group within Platts and Trucost within S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Several key management additions were announced. We completed the 3-year $140 million cost-reduction initiative that was announced during our Investor Day in 2014. We demonstrated continued revenue growth and productivity progress, which led to an adjusted profit margin improvement of 320 basis points, with every segment delivering organic revenue growth. 
As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. Our bottom line result was excellent with a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS over the third quarter last year. 
We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, and we increased our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25, which Rob will cover shortly. 
Before we turn to the results, I want to note 3 new appointees to our management team. Steve Kemps joined us from our Quanta Services as EVP of General Counsel. Martin Fraenkel has been promoted to President, S&P Global Platts. Martin previously led the global editorial team at Platts. And Ewout Steenbergen will join us from Voya Financial as EVP and Chief Financial Officer effective November 14. I'm pleased we avoided any disruptions to our businesses as we put in place an excellent leadership team. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter results. Reported revenue grew 9% and organic revenue, on a constant-currency basis increased 8%. In the third quarter, ForEx reduced revenue by $5 million, yet contributed approximately $8 million to adjusted operating profit and approximately 60 basis points to adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in that Platts segment, which benefited from a weaker British pound. The company delivered a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. Together, revenue growth, margin improvement and share repurchases led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 per share. 
In the third quarter, every division recorded organic top line growth. Profit growth, however, was most pronounced at Ratings and Market Intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 330 and 480 basis points, respectively. 
Let me turn to the businesses, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. Despite initial uncertainty from the Brexit vote, third quarter issuance was strong, particularly nonfinancial global corporates and U.S. public finance market. This resulted in a 9% increase in revenue with a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 17% due to strong revenue growth and cost containment, particularly with reduced legal and outside services spending. The adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points to 51.3%. ForEx had a negligible impact on adjusted operating profit. 
Non-transaction revenue was unchanged with growth in surveillance fees offset by lower Rating Evaluation Services fees. Transaction revenue increased 23% as a result of improved contract terms, growth in debt issuance and a 21% increase in bank loan ratings revenue. 
I also want to note that as we work to reenter the U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS market, there were 13 transactions in the quarter, and we rated 2 of them. 
If we look more closely at the largest markets, third quarter issuance in the U.S. was up 7% with investment grade decreasing 3%, high yields soaring 49%, public finance up 16% and structured finance increasing 11% due to a 44% increase in ABS transactions, driven especially by credit card ABS. 
In Europe, issuance increased 14% with investment grade climbing 42%, driven by large M&A transactions, high yield rising 37% and structured finance decreasing 46%, primarily due to a 59% decline in covered bonds. 
In Asia, issuance more than doubled. However, excluding domestic China issuance, which we do not rate, Asia issuance increased 64%. Investment grade surged to 166%. However, excluding domestic China, it increased 67%. Japan was the country with the largest increase due to the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy. Finally, structured finance increased 2%. 
2 weeks ago, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. In the 3 months since the Brexit vote, debt markets have reacted very positively with unexpected levels of new issuance, especially in the nonfinancial corporate financial sectors and international public finance sectors. We now expect global issuance to increase 24% in 2016. This compares to the July forecast issued on the heels of the Brexit vote, which anticipated a decline of approximately 4%. If we remove sovereign issuance from the forecast, however, we anticipate issuance 2016 to increase approximately 10%.  Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall issuance increase -- we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 5%, driven by the ECB extending its quantitative easing policies longer than currently anticipated and further growth out of China. Excluding sovereign issuance, we anticipate issuance 2017 to increase 3% to 6%. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the third quarter, revenue increased 21%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic revenue growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 43%, and the adjusted operating margin advanced 480 basis points to 31.4%. This improvement was due to progress on SNL integration synergies, operating leverage from strong organic revenue growth and continued efficiency gain. ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue and adjusted operating profit in the quarter. As we have stated before, in 2016, successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies is a top priority for the company. We've made tremendous progress as evident in the margin improvement, and remain committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and deliver on our expected return on investment in SNL. 
Let me add a bit more color on third quarter revenue growth in Market Intelligence. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 6% with high single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ Desktop. In addition, on a comparable basis, which includes revenue prior to our acquisition, SNL revenue increased 12% over the third quarter 2015. SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth in the low teens and high single digit, respectively. 
Risk services revenue increased 10%, led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, Research and Advisory, revenue decreased 8% due to declines in equity research. With the sale of Equity Research, the only remaining asset in this category is Investment Advisory. Therefore, in the future, we'll report Investment Advisory as part of Financial Data and Analytics. 
Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 6%, adjusted operating profit increased 1% and adjusted operating margin declined 320 basis points to 66.2%. This is a sizable decline as the third quarter of 2015 benefited from a sharp increase in exchange-traded derivative volume that did not repeat this quarter. I also want to point out that the adjusted margin this quarter is comparable to the 66% figure we reported last quarter. 
During the third quarter, revenue increased primarily due to mutual funds and ETF license fees and steady data license growth. Operating cost increased to support revenue growth in business initiatives as well as increased cost for purchased data. One notable example is connectivity expenses as we recently started up a third data center to provide additional backup capabilities. 
Often on our earnings calls, I cite new products that we have launched. Last quarter, I highlighted the launch of the JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index in Japan. The new ETF that was launched based on this index has turned out to be one of the fastest-growing new ETFs this year. It already has over $700 million in AUM. 
Asset linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter. The exchange-traded products industry recorded massive inflows of $126 billion in the third quarter, almost triple the inflows in the second quarter. Of the $126 billion of industry inflows, $58 billion went into the U.S. equity products, with S&P Dow Jones Indices capturing about 60% of those inflows. Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 15% year-over-year with inflows of 10% and the remainder from market appreciation. The quarter-ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $914 billion. 
Transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives decreased, primarily due to a 14% decrease in average daily volume of products based on our indices. The E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index Options and Futures, VIX, and CME Equity Complex Contrast -- Contracts all decreased 10% to 25% compared to the volatile third quarter of 2015. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices, increased due to growth in data subscription revenue and the timing of subscription revenue. 
During the quarter, the company launched 161 new indices, and our partners launched 11 new ETFs based on our indices. 
Now onto the S&P Global Platts segment, which included J.D. Power results for July and August. Because this quarter has one less month of J.D. Power revenue than the third quarter of 2015, segment revenue declined 8%. Segment organic revenue, though, increased 4%. Adjusted operating profit increased 4%, reflecting one less month of J.D. Power. And adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 40.9%. Organic revenue increased 4% due to growth in subscriptions, partially offset by decline in Global Trading Services. 
The core subscription business delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector. The Global Trading Services' double-digit revenue decrease is primarily due to the timing of license fees. Gas and power revenue is flat with modest gains in subscriptions, offset by lower GTS service revenue. Metals, Agriculture and Petrochemicals revenue declined low single digit, primarily due to lower revenue from SGX-listed TSI iron ore contracts. We continue to expect modest growth for the remainder of 2016 as many customers continue to face pressure from low oil prices. 
On the business development front, we're building a world-class capability in energy supply and demand information, the acquisition of PIRA Energy Group and the added capabilities of Commodity Flow and RigData, which we acquired earlier this year. 
PIRA is a leader in the worldwide energy market analysis and a great complement to our existing benchmarks. PIRA offers research and analysis in oil, gas, power, natural gas liquids, biofuels, coal, environmental and agricultural markets. They also provide data tools to help customers analyze prices, supply, demand, trade flows, product balances and refining activity. And I'm pleased that Executive Chairman and Founder of PIRA, Dr. Gary Ross, has joined our team and is already generating new product ideas. 
In addition, Platts worked with CME to launch a new futures contract. Alumina FOB Australia Futures will be a 100-metric ton contract and will be financially settled each month against the daily price index published for Alumina FOB Australia by S&P Global Platts. Alumina is aluminum oxide, a white granular material, a little finer than table salt that's transformed into alumina metal in the smelting process. This new futures contract is in addition to the 3 existing CME aluminum futures contracts based on Platts benchmark. 
And finally, Brazil [indiscernible]. Latin America's largest depository of private fixed income securities and Brazil's largest private asset clearinghouse, is going to make Platts benchmark prices estimates available as settlement mechanisms for the development of domestic derivative contracts. Historically, Brazil's only hedging tools tend to be similar, but not necessarily matching commodity indices, or they were international rather than domestic contracts. 
Investors are increasingly seeking new insights into environmental, social and government -- governance factors. And both our index and ratings businesses are taking action to address these needs. 
First, our S&P Dow Jones Indices acquired Trucost. Trucost has become a leading brand in ESG information sector. They provide the gold standard carbon and natural capital investment metrics that financial institutions need to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and capitalize on the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. The complementary nature of our 2 businesses allow us to combine Trucost's industry-leading environmental impact data with our world-class benchmarking capabilities to develop new ESG solutions. 
Second, Ratings is developing a green bond evaluation tool to provide an analysis and estimate of the environmental impact of projects financed by a bond proceeds. Our proposed approach would address mitigation, such as reducing negative environmental impact and adaptation to look at resiliency to the impact of climate change. The output of the green bond evaluation would include scores from the categories listed here amalgamated into an overall financial green -- final green bond evaluation. I'm encouraged by the innovative thinking underway in the company to help tackle increased ESG needs of investors. 
Before I conclude, I need to point out a reporting change. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we'll report our results under 3 segments: Ratings, Indices and Market and Commodities Intelligence. We are doing this to be consistent with how we manage our businesses. 
In summary, we completed sales of J.D. Power, 2 pricing businesses and Equity Research. We had consistent results with all segments delivering organic revenue growth. Bond issuance is robust in the third quarter despite the Brexit vote. Our focus on revenue growth and productivity performance led to continued margin improvement. Integration of SNL is progressing well and remains a top priority in 2016. And our adjusted diluted EPS guidance has increased to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 and includes dilution from the sale of J.D. Power, the pricing businesses and Equity Research. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Rob."

Next, I'll disc",1123,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will recap key financial results, discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings, then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. Next, I'll discuss the completion of our $140 million productivity program, the financial impact of our recent divestitures and update our 2016 guidance. Before wrapping up, I will explain the new segment reporting that will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter and the data we will provide. 
Let's start with the consolidated third quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line organic growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 9% with organic growth on a constant currency basis of 8%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $5 million and had a favorable impact of $8 million on operating profit. Our adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points. Approximately 60 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding top line growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 31.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over the third quarter of 2015 due to onetime benefits recorded in the prior period. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. 
Taken together, top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction combined to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $732 million in the quarter. The largest item is a gain on the sale of J.D. Power. The next item is a net gain from insurance proceed recoveries. And the last item includes net acquisition and disposition-related costs, primarily related to the sale of our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE, and J.D. Power to the XIO Group. And as we discussed earlier this year, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization, which totaled $23 million during the quarter. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $1.6 billion was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.6 billion of long-term debt and $400 million of short-term debt. The short-term debt is the value of the 2017 notes that were redeemed in October. One other item that I want to point out is that the cash proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power were recorded in the quarter. However, the tax on the gain will not be paid until later in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow during the first 9 months was approximately $1 billion. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow from the first 9 months was approximately $1.1 billion. 
Now I'll review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan. This resulted in the repurchase of 5.3 million shares during the quarter. However, the final share count reduction will not be determined until the ASR is completed. In addition, the company paid a dividend of $95 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In March of 2014, we initiated a productivity target of greater than $100 million in cost-reduction initiatives during 2014 to 2016. We subsequently increased the target to $140 million. Today, we are pleased to announce the successful completion of this program. We delivered slightly more than the $140 million in savings. If you look at the chart on the right, you can see that our adjusted operating margin has increased by 900 basis points since 2013. The successful achievement of this $140 million productivity target was a key contributor to this improvement. 
While we are pleased with our recent divestitures, we want to make sure all of you understand the loss of revenue and profitability associated with these transactions. J.D. Power, the SPSE and CMA pricing businesses and Equity Research combines to generate $310 million of revenue, $108 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA and approximately $0.25 of pro forma adjusted diluted EPS to our 2016 results before they were sold. This equates to approximately $100 million of revenue and $0.08 of adjusted diluted EPS that will be foregone each quarter. The recently announced ASR should help offset some of this dilution. We estimate that the ASR will increase diluted adjusted earnings per share by about $0.10 over the next year. We hope these figures will help you with your modeling of our future results. 
Based upon our strong results year-to-date and the expectation of debt issuance remain strong for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25. We've also made changes to other components of guidance as follows: adjusted unallocated expense is reduced to $135 million due primarily to reduced professional fees. The adjusted operating margin increase over 2015 is now expected to be approximately 200 basis points. This is largely due to the excellent performance in Ratings and Market Intelligence. The adjusted tax rate is increased to approximately 31.5%, primarily due to the timing and size of past years' tax settlements. Free cash flow, excluding the after-tax legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries, is increased to $1.4 billion due to strong financial results. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2016 will be another strong year for the company. 
The final item I want to discuss is the upcoming change to our reporting segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts will be included in a new segment called Market and Commodities Intelligence. Both fourth quarter results and full year 2016 results of both businesses will be reported in this new segment. To facilitate analysis in the next few weeks, we'll provide a pro forma schedule with results of this new segment for all quarters of 2015 and 2016 as if it had existed this way. This should help investors model 2017 appropriately. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

We are obviously going through our year-end review and our 2017 to 2019 strategic planning process, where we're evaluating ways that we can invest in the business. So investing in organic growth, which could be expansion of regional areas, of new products, of technology investments, et cetera, is very important for us. Following that, obviously, would be ways that we can accelerate growth or expand into new regions or new capabilities through M&A. Then obviously, finally, come our approach to dividends and share repurchase. But when it comes to your question around M&A, we would be looking at many ideas and many options coming in. Tuck-ins could be attractive for us, but it's something that we would do business by business, opportunity by opportunity, look at them separately as they arise. We have seen, as you know, tuck-in acquisitions have been a way for us to grow our portfolio of products in Platts. It's given us opportunities with different areas and services in Market Intelligence. Last quarter, we had purchased a very small rating agency in Thailand in our S&P Global Ratings area. So we would continue to look selectively at areas, but they need to -- we need to ensure that they also meet our parameters for growth and returns."

One of the areas that is a very fragmented business and there's high growth that relates to data and analytics on the energy market. And SNL has a small energy business and Platts, obviously, has a very large energy business. And we wanted to accelerate the integration of those 2 businesses, but more importantly take advantage of the expertise that we have in the Market Intelligence data machine and how they can work together with Platts on building out that data analytics business. So this was not something that I really felt we should wait. I felt it wasn't something we should wait for a couple of years for, that we needed to move now.

So there's obviously a few components to the revenue. One of them, we just mentioned, has been very strong in the last few quarters here now, which is the volatility aspect of our revenue, which relates to the exchange-traded derivative trading volume that goes through. So there's that aspect to it. There's another aspect is -- which is the core businesses that relate to AUM growth. And AUM growth, which could be a combination of the fees that we get for the actual underlying components of a fund or an ETF or the actual growth in AUMs over time. So that's a very important factor for us. And then we have our data feeds and data business. Generally, we're seeing growth in all of those. I think that the drop of the exchange-traded derivative income is what impacted this quarter and also had very positively impacted the third quarter last year. So that's a little bit about that -- about the -- that what you see there in the different between last year and this year. But let me just give you a couple of data points about the growth in the AUMs. So if I go way back, I go back almost 5, 6 years ago, if you go back into the end of 2013, there was a -- the overall AUMs is only $585 billion. It's now $914 billion at the end of this quarter. And through that time, there's been a combination of factors that have driven that growth. One is the increase in market value. So as the market itself and the indices themselves go up, that is a positive for our revenue. And the other is flows into the funds. And you saw that last week, in The Wall Street Journal, there was a series the entire week about the shifting needs of investors and the changes in the investment management industry, which have been benefiting firms like ours that are in the passive and index field.

But when I look at the midpoint here at $112 million for the fourth quarter, it doesn't really fit with a lot of the things that you've said. For example, you expect the debt issuance environment to remain good. I know you also gave some of the impact from the businesses that you are divesting. But I think it's like, $0.04, $0.05 maybe. So you're still arriving at an EPS for the fourth quarter that's basically below or around the first quarter, which, I think, we all would agree, it was a pretty tough environment. So can you flesh this out a little bit more? What am I missing here? Or are you just being very conservative? And sorry to -- one more thing. I -- you have raised your guidance like $0.05 each quarter. Is there any sort of technicalities in how you approach guidance? Or what's going on there? Sorry for the long question."

From the point of view of the factors, you actually gave most of the factors, which were included in our calculation, our understanding of our guidance, which have to do with a -- what could be a very difficult environment. On the one hand, we've seen a very strong third quarter in issuance. It was almost unprecedented, the strength that we saw after the Brexit. And we do project based off of the M&A pipeline and what we see for being some pull-forward of issuance and what we see looking in the investment banking calendar and the debt capital markets of desks of the big banks. We do see a strong issuance in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, as you saw with the Brexit that happened last quarter, this could turn on a dime. You could see there's still a lot of volatility. There's still a lot of factors, which we're very cautious about. You've got the interest rate discussion in the United States. You still have Brexit. You have the elections in the United States, which have been quite volatile. So there's still a lot of factors out there that are impacting our external view, and that external view has been driving our approach to where we ended up with guidance.

And I guess that is really my question. If you look at the new combined segment now, how much of the business in terms of revenue or EBITDA do you think is really businesses that are Platts-like and maybe have gotten lost before, like things that are must have, very sticky, good pricing power, things like these, things like the CUSIP database and ratings, reselling, like versus maybe some of the things that are more discretionary, easier to cut like the desktop businesses?"

So within this segment, obviously, you're going to have the must-have products of SNL. You've got the must-have products of things like CUSIP, our risk services area. We have products, which have become very important for risk management tools that you see as people are doing CCAR modeling and liquidity planning and living wills. So there's an advantage to having all of those types of products together. In addition then, you've got the Platts part of the business. So you've got a combination -- I don't know the numbers off of the top of my head. That would be better if we talked about that after we put together the new segment information and we send it out. But there is a lot of must-have data in there. And then remember that the traditional Cap IQ and SNL desktops have been growing very well. They're growing in -- somewhere in the high single-digit level for the Cap IQ desktop and over double digits for the SNL. So even though they might have some sort of discretionary component to them, they're still growing at a very good clip and, in many cases, substituting for other products, which might be similar that are much more expensive."

We have a project going on right now called Project Simplify, which has the benefit of better control, a better workflow and eventually, it will also bring lower cost with it as well, as you have more streamlined operations. So think about our approach towards margin as continuous improvement. We will keep striving to improve our margin. I'm not going to give you a target necessarily today. But we do have a commitment to strive to keep improving our margin. And now it would come with a combination of better penetration into the markets, to our sales force, through looking at how we can manage our contracts and our mix on pricing as well as discounting policies, and then on the cost side, through projects like Simplify and other ways to manage the business more efficiently and more effectively.

The -- it's a complicated topic because most of the pressure -- well, a lot of pressure is coming at the higher-end, full-service active management front. That seems to be where a lot of pressure is starting. And some of this is going into the lower-cost mutual funds and ETF providers. One of the things that you saw in the last quarter was that BlackRock cut some of its ETF pricing. And that one directly could have a small impact on our business because of the way that our pricing is embedded into those -- that fee structure of BlackRock. The flip side is if this leads to higher AUM fees -- higher AUM, we could actually benefit from this if the AUMs go up and we see much higher volume. But this is something that we're watching very carefully. It is something for the industry to see what will be the evolution of the structure. We believe that our cost generally are very low part of the total cost of managing an ETF or managing a fund. But we're aware that this is an important issue for our customers, and we're listening to them and hoping that we can be a part of the solution as they look at how they're going to manage their fee structures."

This morning, Rob MacKay, our interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results, and you're -- you'll hear from him shortly. 
But let me begin with the highlights. We completed several business divestitures with the sale of J.D. Power, our 2 pricing businesses, SPSE and CMA, and the equity research business. This leaves us with a more focused, interrelated portfolio of market-leading businesses. 2 tuck-in acquisitions were added during the quarter, PIRA Energy Group within Platts and Trucost within S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Several key management additions were announced. We completed the 3-year $140 million cost-reduction initiative that was announced during our Investor Day in 2014. We demonstrated continued revenue growth and productivity progress, which led to an adjusted profit margin improvement of 320 basis points, with every segment delivering organic revenue growth. 
As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. Our bottom line result was excellent with a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS over the third quarter last year. 
We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, and we increased our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25, which Rob will cover shortly. 
Before we turn to the results, I want to note 3 new appointees to our management team. Steve Kemps joined us from our Quanta Services as EVP of General Counsel. Martin Fraenkel has been promoted to President, S&P Global Platts. Martin previously led the global editorial team at Platts. And Ewout Steenbergen will join us from Voya Financial as EVP and Chief Financial Officer effective November 14. I'm pleased we avoided any disruptions to our businesses as we put in place an excellent leadership team. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter results. Reported revenue grew 9% and organic revenue, on a constant-currency basis increased 8%. In the third quarter, ForEx reduced revenue by $5 million, yet contributed approximately $8 million to adjusted operating profit and approximately 60 basis points to adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in the Platts segment, which benefited from a weaker British pound. The company delivered a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. Together, revenue growth, margin improvement and share repurchases led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 per share. 
In the third quarter, every division recorded organic top line growth. Profit growth, however, was most pronounced at Ratings and Market Intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 330 and 480 basis points, respectively. 
Let me turn to the businesses, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. Despite initial uncertainty from the Brexit vote, third quarter issuance was strong, particularly nonfinancial global corporates and U.S. public finance market. This resulted in a 9% increase in revenue with a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 17% due to strong revenue growth and cost containment, particularly with reduced legal and outside services spending. The adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points to 51.3%. ForEx had a negligible impact on adjusted operating profit. 
Non-transaction revenue was unchanged with growth in surveillance fees offset by lower Rating Evaluation Services fees. Transaction revenue increased 23% as a result of improved contract terms, growth in debt issuance and a 21% increase in bank loan ratings revenue. 
I also want to note that as we work to reenter the U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS market, there were 13 transactions in the quarter, and we rated 2 of them. 
If we look more closely at the largest markets, third quarter issuance in the U.S. was up 7% with investment grade decreasing 3%, high yields soaring 49%, public finance up 16% and structured finance increasing 11% due to a 44% increase in ABS transactions, driven especially by credit card ABS. 
In Europe, issuance increased 14% with investment grade climbing 42%, driven by large M&A transactions, high yield rising 37% and structured finance decreasing 46%, primarily due to a 59% decline in covered bonds. 
In Asia, issuance more than doubled. However, excluding domestic China issuance, which we do not rate, Asia issuance increased 64%. Investment grade surged 166%. However, excluding domestic China, it increased 67%. Japan was the country with the largest increase due to the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy. Finally, structured finance increased 2%. 
2 weeks ago, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. In the 3 months since the Brexit vote, debt markets have reacted very positively with unexpected levels of new issuance, especially in the nonfinancial corporate financial sectors and international public finance sectors. We now expect global issuance to increase 24% in 2016. This compares to the July forecast issued on the heels of the Brexit vote, which anticipated a decline of approximately 4%. If we remove sovereign issuance from the forecast, however, we anticipate issuance 2016 to increase approximately 10%.  Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall issuance increase -- we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 5%, driven by the ECB extending its quantitative easing policies longer than currently anticipated and further growth out of China. Excluding sovereign issuance, we anticipate issuance 2017 to increase 3% to 6%. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the third quarter, revenue increased 21%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic revenue growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 43%, and the adjusted operating margin advanced 480 basis points to 31.4%. This improvement was due to progress on SNL integration synergies, operating leverage from strong organic revenue growth and continued efficiency gains. ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue and adjusted operating profit in the quarter. As we have stated before, in 2016, successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies is a top priority for the company. We've made tremendous progress as evident in the margin improvement, and remain committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and deliver on our expected return on investment in SNL. 
Let me add a bit more color on third quarter revenue growth in Market Intelligence. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 6% with high single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ Desktop. In addition, on a comparable basis, which includes revenue prior to our acquisition, SNL revenue increased 12% over the third quarter 2015. SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth in the low teens and high single digit, respectively. 
Risk services revenue increased 10%, led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, Research and Advisory, revenue decreased 8% due to declines in equity research. With the sale of Equity Research, the only remaining asset in this category is Investment Advisory. Therefore, in the future, we'll report Investment Advisory as part of Financial Data and Analytics. 
Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 6%, adjusted operating profit increased 1% and adjusted operating margin declined 320 basis points to 66.2%. This is a sizable decline as the third quarter of 2015 benefited from a sharp increase in exchange-traded derivative volume that did not repeat this quarter. I also want to point out that the adjusted margin this quarter is comparable to the 66% figure we reported last quarter. 
During the third quarter, revenue increased primarily due to mutual funds and ETF license fees and steady data license growth. Operating cost increased to support revenue growth in business initiatives as well as increased cost for purchased data. One notable example is connectivity expenses as we recently started up a third data center to provide additional backup capabilities. 
Often on our earnings calls, I cite new products that we have launched. Last quarter, I highlighted the launch of the JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index in Japan. The new ETF that was launched based on this index has turned out to be one of the fastest-growing new ETFs this year. It already has over $700 million in AUM. 
Asset linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter. The exchange-traded products industry recorded massive inflows of $126 billion in the third quarter, almost triple the inflows in the second quarter. Of the $126 billion of industry inflows, $58 billion went into U.S. equity products, with S&P Dow Jones Indices capturing about 60% of those inflows. Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 15% year-over-year with inflows of 10% and the remainder from market appreciation. The quarter-ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $914 billion. 
Transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives decreased, primarily due to a 14% decrease in average daily volume of products based on our indices. The E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index Options and Futures, VIX, and CME Equity Complex Contrast -- Contracts all decreased 10% to 25% compared to the volatile third quarter of 2015. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions in custom indices, increased due to growth in data subscription revenue and the timing of subscription revenue. 
During the quarter, the company launched 161 new indices, and our partners launched 11 new ETFs based on our indices. 
Now onto the S&P Global Platts segment, which included J.D. Power results for July and August. Because this quarter has one less month of J.D. Power revenue than the third quarter of 2015, segment revenue declined 8%. Segment organic revenue, though, increased 4%. Adjusted operating profit increased 4%, reflecting one less month of J.D. Power. And adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 40.9%. Organic revenue increased 4% due to growth in subscriptions, partially offset by decline in Global Trading Services. 
The core subscription business delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector. The Global Trading Services' double-digit revenue decrease is primarily due to the timing of license fees. Gas and power revenue is flat with modest gains in subscriptions, offset by lower GTS service revenue. Metals, Agriculture and Petrochemicals revenue declined low single digit, primarily due to lower revenue from SGX-listed TSI iron ore contracts. We continue to expect modest growth for the remainder of 2016 as many customers continue to face pressure from low oil prices. 
On the business development front, we're building a world-class capability in energy supply and demand information, the acquisition of PIRA Energy Group and the added capabilities of Commodity Flow and RigData, which we acquired earlier this year. 
PIRA is a leader in the worldwide energy market analysis and a great complement to our existing benchmarks. PIRA offers research and analysis in oil, gas, power, natural gas liquids, biofuels, coal, environmental and agricultural markets. They also provide data tools to help customers analyze prices, supply, demand, trade flows, product balances and refining activity. And I'm pleased that Executive Chairman and Founder of PIRA, Dr. Gary Ross, has joined our team and is already generating new product ideas. 
In addition, Platts worked with CME to launch a new futures contract. Alumina FOB Australia Futures will be a 100-metric ton contract and will be financially settled each month against the daily price index published for Alumina FOB Australia by S&P Global Platts. Alumina is aluminum oxide, a white granular material, a little finer than table salt that's transformed into aluminum metal in the smelting process. This new futures contract is in addition to the 3 existing CME aluminum futures contracts based on Platts' benchmark. 
And finally, Brazil's CETIP. Latin America's largest depository of private fixed income securities and Brazil's largest private asset clearinghouse, is going to make Platts' benchmark prices estimates available as settlement mechanisms for the development of domestic derivative contracts. Historically, Brazil's only hedging tools tend to be similar, but not necessarily matching commodity indices, or they were international rather than domestic contracts. 
Investors are increasingly seeking new insights into environmental, social and governance factors. And both our index and ratings businesses are taking action to address these needs. 
First, our S&P Dow Jones Indices acquired Trucost. Trucost has become a leading brand in ESG information sector. They provide the gold standard carbon and natural capital investment metrics that financial institutions need to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and capitalize on the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. The complementary nature of our 2 businesses allow us to combine Trucost's industry-leading environmental impact data with our world-class benchmarking capabilities to develop new ESG solutions. 
Second, Ratings is developing a green bond evaluation tool to provide an analysis and estimate of the environmental impact of projects financed by a bond's proceeds. Our proposed approach would address mitigation, such as reducing negative environmental impact and adaptation to look at resiliency to the impact of climate change. The output of the green bond evaluation would include scores from the categories listed here amalgamated into an overall financial green -- final green bond evaluation. I'm encouraged by the innovative thinking underway in the company to help tackle increased ESG needs of investors. 
Before I conclude, I need to point out a reporting change. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we'll report our results under 3 segments: Ratings, Indices, and Market and Commodities Intelligence. We are doing this to be consistent with how we manage our businesses. 
In summary, we completed sales of J.D. Power, 2 pricing businesses and Equity Research. We had consistent results with all segments delivering organic revenue growth. Bond issuance is robust in the third quarter despite the Brexit vote. Our focus on revenue growth and productivity performance led to continued margin improvement. Integration of SNL is progressing well and remains a top priority in 2016. And our adjusted diluted EPS guidance has increased to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 and includes dilution from the sale of J.D. Power, the pricing businesses and Equity Research. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Rob."
21719,404682268,1072365,"S&P Global, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everybody on the call.

Next, I'll disc",1123,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will recap key financial results, discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings, then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. Next, I'll discuss the completion of our $140 million productivity program, the financial impact of our recent divestitures and update our 2016 guidance. Before wrapping up, I will explain the new segment reporting that will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter and the data we will provide. 
Let's start with the consolidated third quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line organic growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 9% with organic growth on a constant currency basis of 8%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $5 million and had a favorable impact of $8 million on operating profit. Our adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points. Approximately 60 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding top line growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 31.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over the third quarter of 2015 due to onetime benefits recorded in the prior period. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. 
Taken together, top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction combined to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $732 million in the quarter. The largest item is a gain on the sale of J.D. Power. The next item is a net gain from insurance proceed recoveries. And the last item includes net acquisition and disposition-related costs, primarily related to the sale of our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE, and J.D. Power to the XIO Group. And as we discussed earlier this year, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization, which totaled $23 million during the quarter. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $1.6 billion was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.6 billion of long-term debt and $400 million of short-term debt. The short-term debt is the value of the 2017 notes that were redeemed in October. One other item that I want to point out is that the cash proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power were recorded in the quarter. However, the tax on the gain will not be paid until later in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow during the first 9 months was approximately $1 billion. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow from the first 9 months was approximately $1.1 billion. 
Now I'll review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan. This resulted in the repurchase of 5.3 million shares during the quarter. However, the final share count reduction will not be determined until the ASR is completed. In addition, the company paid a dividend of $95 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In March of 2014, we initiated a productivity target of greater than $100 million in cost-reduction initiatives during 2014 to 2016. We subsequently increased the target to $140 million. Today, we are pleased to announce the successful completion of this program. We delivered slightly more than the $140 million in savings. If you look at the chart on the right, you can see that our adjusted operating margin has increased by 900 basis points since 2013. The successful achievement of this $140 million productivity target was a key contributor to this improvement. 
While we are pleased with our recent divestitures, we want to make sure all of you understand the loss of revenue and profitability associated with these transactions. J.D. Power, the SPSE and CMA pricing businesses and Equity Research combines to generate $310 million of revenue, $108 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA and approximately $0.25 of pro forma adjusted diluted EPS to our 2016 results before they were sold. This equates to approximately $100 million of revenue and $0.08 of adjusted diluted EPS that will be foregone each quarter. The recently announced ASR should help offset some of this dilution. We estimate that the ASR will increase diluted adjusted earnings per share by about $0.10 over the next year. We hope these figures will help you with your modeling of our future results. 
Based upon our strong results year-to-date and the expectation that debt issuance remains strong for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25. We've also made changes to other components of guidance as follows: adjusted unallocated expense is reduced to $135 million due primarily to reduced professional fees. The adjusted operating margin increase over 2015 is now expected to be approximately 200 basis points. This is largely due to the excellent performance in Ratings and Market Intelligence. The adjusted tax rate is increased to approximately 31.5%, primarily due to the timing and size of past years' tax settlements. Free cash flow, excluding the after-tax legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries, is increased to $1.4 billion due to strong financial results. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2016 will be another strong year for the company. 
The final item I want to discuss is the upcoming change to our reporting segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts will be included in a new segment called Market and Commodities Intelligence. Both fourth quarter results and full year 2016 results of both businesses will be reported in this new segment. To facilitate analysis in the next few weeks, we'll provide a pro forma schedule with results of this new segment for all quarters of 2015 and 2016 as if it had existed this way. This should help investors model 2017 appropriately. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

We are obviously going through our year-end review and our 2017 to 2019 strategic planning process, where we're evaluating ways that we can invest in the business. So investing in organic growth, which could be expansion of regional areas, of new products, of technology investments, et cetera, is very important for us. Following that, obviously, would be ways that we can accelerate growth or expand into new regions or new capabilities through M&A. Then obviously, finally, come our approach to dividends and share repurchase. But when it comes to your question around M&A, we would be looking at many ideas and many options coming in. Tuck-ins could be attractive for us, but it's something that we would do business by business, opportunity by opportunity, look at them separately as they arise. We have seen, as you know, tuck-in acquisitions have been a way for us to grow our portfolio of products in Platts. It's given us opportunities with different areas and services in Market Intelligence. Last quarter, we had purchased a very small rating agency in Thailand in our S&P Global Ratings area. So we would continue to look selectively at areas, but they need to -- we need to ensure that they also meet our parameters for growth and returns."

But we do continue to value highly this non-transaction side, but the main factor was related to lower Rating Evaluation Services fees."

So there's obviously a few components to the revenue. One of them, we just mentioned, has been very strong in the last few quarters here now, which is the volatility aspect of our revenue, which relates to the exchange-traded derivative trading volume that goes through. So there's that aspect to it. There's another aspect is -- which is the core businesses that relate to AUM growth. And AUM growth, which could be a combination of the fees that we get for the actual underlying components of a fund or an ETF or the actual growth in AUMs over time. So that's a very important factor for us. And then we have our data feeds and data business. Generally, we're seeing growth in all of those. I think that the drop of the exchange-traded derivative income is what impacted this quarter and also had very positively impacted the third quarter last year. So that's a little bit about that -- about the -- that what you see there in the different between last year and this year. But let me just give you a couple of data points about the growth in the AUMs. So if I go way back, I go back almost 5, 6 years ago, if you go back into the end of 2013, there was a -- the overall AUMs was only $585 billion. It's now $914 billion at the end of this quarter. And through that time, there's been a combination of factors that have driven that growth. One is the increase in market value. So as the market itself and the indices themselves go up, that is a positive for our revenue. And the other is flows into the funds. And you saw that last week, in The Wall Street Journal, there was a series the entire week about the shifting needs of investors and the changes in the investment management industry, which have been benefiting firms like ours that are in the passive and index fields. So we're not giving you any specific projections today. We'll provide guidance for 2017 at our next earnings call. But we do continue to see the trends for this industry to be very positive."

On the one hand, we've seen a very strong third quarter in issuance. It was almost unprecedented, the strength that we saw after the Brexit. And we do project based off of the M&A pipeline and what we see for being some pull-forward of issuance and what we see looking at the investment banking calendar and the debt capital markets of -- desks of the big banks. We do see a strong issuance in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, as you saw with the Brexit that happened last quarter, this could turn on a dime. You could see there's still a lot of volatility. There's still a lot of factors, which we're very cautious about. You've got the interest rate discussion in the United States. You still have Brexit. You have the elections in the United States, which have been quite volatile.

And I guess that is really my question. If you look at the new combined segment now, how much of the business in terms of revenue or EBITDA do you think is really businesses that are Platts-like and maybe have gotten lost before, like things that are must have, very sticky, good pricing power, things like these, things like the CUSIP database and ratings, reselling, like versus maybe some of the things that are more discretionary, easier to cut like the desktop businesses?"

So within this segment, obviously, you're going to have the must-have products of SNL. You've got the must-have products of things like CUSIP; our risk services area, we have products, which have become very important for risk management tools that you see as people are doing CCAR modeling and liquidity planning and living wills. So there's an advantage to having all of those types of products together. In addition then, you've got the Platts part of the business. So you've got a combination -- I don't know the numbers off of the top of my head. That would be better if we talked about that after we put together the new segment information and we send it out. But there is a lot of must-have data in there. And then remember that the traditional Cap IQ and SNL desktops have been growing very well. They're growing in -- somewhere in the high single-digit level for the Cap IQ desktop and over double digits for the SNL. So even though they might have some sort of discretionary component to them, they're still growing at a very good clip and, in many cases, substituting for other products, which might be similar that are much more expensive."

The -- it's a complicated topic because most of the pressure -- well, a lot of pressure is coming at the higher-end, full-service active management funds. That seems to be where a lot of pressure is starting. And some of this is going into the lower-cost mutual funds and ETF providers. One of the things that you saw in the last quarter was that BlackRock cut some of its ETF pricing. And that one directly could have a small impact on our business because of the way that our pricing is embedded into those -- that fee structure at BlackRock. The flip side is if this leads to higher AUM fees -- higher AUM, we could actually benefit from this if the AUMs go up and we see much higher volume. But this is something that we're watching very carefully. It is something for the industry to see what will be the evolution of the structure.

But let me begin with the hi",2309,"Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome, everyone, to the call. This morning, Rob MacKay, our interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results, and you're -- you'll hear from him shortly. 
But let me begin with the highlights. We completed several business divestitures with the sale of J.D. Power, our 2 pricing businesses, SPSE and CMA, and the equity research business. This leaves us with a more focused, interrelated portfolio of market-leading businesses. 2 tuck-in acquisitions were added during the quarter, PIRA Energy Group within Platts and Trucost within S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Several key management additions were announced. We completed the 3-year $140 million cost-reduction initiative that was announced during our Investor Day in 2014. We demonstrated continued revenue growth and productivity progress, which led to an adjusted profit margin improvement of 320 basis points, with every segment delivering organic revenue growth. 
As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. Our bottom line result was excellent with a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS over the third quarter last year. 
We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, and we increased our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25, which Rob will cover shortly. 
Before we turn to the results, I want to note 3 new appointees to our management team. Steve Kemps joined us from our Quanta Services as EVP of General Counsel. Martin Fraenkel has been promoted to President, S&P Global Platts. Martin previously led the global editorial team at Platts. And Ewout Steenbergen will join us from Voya Financial as EVP and Chief Financial Officer effective November 14. I'm pleased we avoided any disruptions to our businesses as we put in place an excellent leadership team. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter results. Reported revenue grew 9% and organic revenue, on a constant-currency basis increased 8%. In the third quarter, ForEx reduced revenue by $5 million, yet contributed approximately $8 million to adjusted operating profit and approximately 60 basis points to adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in the Platts segment, which benefited from a weaker British pound. The company delivered a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. Together, revenue growth, margin improvement and share repurchases led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 per share. 
In the third quarter, every division recorded organic top line growth. Profit growth, however, was most pronounced at Ratings and Market Intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 330 and 480 basis points, respectively. 
Let me turn to the businesses, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. Despite initial uncertainty from the Brexit vote, third quarter issuance was strong, particularly nonfinancial global corporates and U.S. public finance market. This resulted in a 9% increase in revenue with a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 17% due to strong revenue growth and cost containment, particularly with reduced legal and outside services spending. The adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points to 51.3%. ForEx had a negligible impact on adjusted operating profit. 
Non-transaction revenue was unchanged with growth in surveillance fees offset by lower Rating Evaluation Services fees. Transaction revenue increased 23% as a result of improved contract terms, growth in debt issuance and a 21% increase in bank loan ratings revenue. 
I also want to note that as we work to reenter the U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS market, there were 13 transactions in the quarter, and we rated 2 of them. 
If we look more closely at the largest markets, third quarter issuance in the U.S. was up 7% with investment grade decreasing 3%, high yields soaring 49%, public finance up 16% and structured finance increasing 11% due to a 44% increase in ABS transactions, driven especially by credit card ABS. 
In Europe, issuance increased 14% with investment grade climbing 42%, driven by large M&A transactions, high yield rising 37% and structured finance decreasing 46%, primarily due to a 59% decline in covered bonds. 
In Asia, issuance more than doubled. However, excluding domestic China issuance, which we do not rate, Asia issuance increased 64%. Investment grade surged 166%. However, excluding domestic China, it increased 67%. Japan was the country with the largest increase due to the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy. Finally, structured finance increased 2%. 
2 weeks ago, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. In the 3 months since the Brexit vote, debt markets have reacted very positively with unexpected levels of new issuance, especially in the nonfinancial corporate financial sectors and international public finance sectors. We now expect global issuance to increase 24% in 2016. This compares to the July forecast issued on the heels of the Brexit vote, which anticipated a decline of approximately 4%. If we remove sovereign issuance from the forecast, however, we anticipate issuance 2016 to increase approximately 10%.  Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall issuance increase -- we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 5%, driven by the ECB extending its quantitative easing policies longer than currently anticipated and further growth out of China. Excluding sovereign issuance, we anticipate issuance 2017 to increase 3% to 6%. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the third quarter, revenue increased 21%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic revenue growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 43%, and the adjusted operating margin advanced 480 basis points to 31.4%. This improvement was due to progress on SNL integration synergies, operating leverage from strong organic revenue growth and continued efficiency gains. ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue and adjusted operating profit in the quarter. As we have stated before, in 2016, successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies is a top priority for the company. We've made tremendous progress as evident in the margin improvement, and remain committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and deliver on our expected return on investment in SNL. 
Let me add a bit more color on third quarter revenue growth in Market Intelligence. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 6% with high single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ Desktop. In addition, on a comparable basis, which includes revenue prior to our acquisition, SNL revenue increased 12% over the third quarter 2015. SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth in the low teens and high single digit, respectively. 
Risk services revenue increased 10%, led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, Research and Advisory, revenue decreased 8% due to declines in equity research. With the sale of Equity Research, the only remaining asset in this category is Investment Advisory. Therefore, in the future, we'll report Investment Advisory as part of Financial Data and Analytics. 
Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 6%, adjusted operating profit increased 1% and adjusted operating margin declined 320 basis points to 66.2%. This is a sizable decline as the third quarter of 2015 benefited from a sharp increase in exchange-traded derivative volume that did not repeat this quarter. I also want to point out that the adjusted margin this quarter is comparable to the 66% figure we reported last quarter. 
During the third quarter, revenue increased primarily due to mutual funds and ETF license fees and steady data license growth. Operating cost increased to support revenue growth in business initiatives as well as increased cost for purchased data. One notable example is connectivity expenses as we recently started up a third data center to provide additional backup capabilities. 
Often on our earnings calls, I cite new products that we have launched. Last quarter, I highlighted the launch of the JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index in Japan. The new ETF that was launched based on this index has turned out to be one of the fastest-growing new ETFs this year. It already has over $700 million in AUM. 
Asset linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter. The exchange-traded products industry recorded massive inflows of $126 billion in the third quarter, almost triple the inflows in the second quarter. Of the $126 billion of industry inflows, $58 billion went into U.S. equity products, with S&P Dow Jones Indices capturing about 60% of those inflows. Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 15% year-over-year with inflows of 10% and the remainder from market appreciation. The quarter-ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $914 billion. 
Transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives decreased, primarily due to a 14% decrease in average daily volume of products based on our indices. The E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index Options and Futures, VIX, and CME Equity Complex Contrast -- Contracts all decreased 10% to 25% compared to the volatile third quarter of 2015. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions in custom indices, increased due to growth in data subscription revenue and the timing of subscription revenue. 
During the quarter, the company launched 161 new indices, and our partners launched 11 new ETFs based on our indices. 
Now onto the S&P Global Platts segment, which included J.D. Power results for July and August. Because this quarter has one less month of J.D. Power revenue than the third quarter of 2015, segment revenue declined 8%. Segment organic revenue, though, increased 4%. Adjusted operating profit increased 4%, reflecting one less month of J.D. Power. And adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 40.9%. Organic revenue increased 4% due to growth in subscriptions, partially offset by decline in Global Trading Services. 
The core subscription business delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector. The Global Trading Services' double-digit revenue decrease is primarily due to the timing of license fees. Gas and power revenue is flat with modest gains in subscriptions, offset by lower GTS service revenue. Metals, Agriculture and Petrochemicals revenue declined low single digit, primarily due to lower revenue from SGX-listed TSI iron ore contracts. We continue to expect modest growth for the remainder of 2016 as many customers continue to face pressure from low oil prices. 
On the business development front, we're building a world-class capability in energy supply and demand information, the acquisition of PIRA Energy Group and the added capabilities of Commodity Flow and RigData, which we acquired earlier this year. 
PIRA is a leader in the worldwide energy market analysis and a great complement to our existing benchmarks. PIRA offers research and analysis in oil, gas, power, natural gas liquids, biofuels, coal, environmental and agricultural markets. They also provide data tools to help customers analyze prices, supply, demand, trade flows, product balances and refining activity. And I'm pleased that Executive Chairman and Founder of PIRA, Dr. Gary Ross, has joined our team and is already generating new product ideas. 
In addition, Platts worked with CME to launch a new futures contract. Alumina FOB Australia Futures will be a 100-metric ton contract and will be financially settled each month against the daily price index published for Alumina FOB Australia by S&P Global Platts. Alumina is aluminum oxide, a white granular material, a little finer than table salt that's transformed into aluminum metal in the smelting process. This new futures contract is in addition to the 3 existing CME aluminum futures contracts based on Platts' benchmark. 
And finally, Brazil's CETIP. Latin America's largest depository of private fixed income securities and Brazil's largest private asset clearinghouse, is going to make Platts' benchmark prices estimates available as settlement mechanisms for the development of domestic derivative contracts. Historically, Brazil's only hedging tools tend to be similar, but not necessarily matching commodity indices, or they were international rather than domestic contracts. 
Investors are increasingly seeking new insights into environmental, social and governance factors. And both our index and ratings businesses are taking action to address these needs. 
First, our S&P Dow Jones Indices acquired Trucost. Trucost has become a leading brand in ESG information sector. They provide the gold standard carbon and natural capital investment metrics that financial institutions need to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and capitalize on the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. The complementary nature of our 2 businesses allow us to combine Trucost's industry-leading environmental impact data with our world-class benchmarking capabilities to develop new ESG solutions. 
Second, Ratings is developing a green bond evaluation tool to provide an analysis and estimate of the environmental impact of projects financed by a bond's proceeds. Our proposed approach would address mitigation, such as reducing negative environmental impact and adaptation to look at resiliency to the impact of climate change. The output of the green bond evaluation would include scores from the categories listed here amalgamated into an overall financial green -- final green bond evaluation. I'm encouraged by the innovative thinking underway in the company to help tackle increased ESG needs of investors. 
Before I conclude, I need to point out a reporting change. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we'll report our results under 3 segments: Ratings, Indices, and Market and Commodities Intelligence. We are doing this to be consistent with how we manage our businesses. 
In summary, we completed sales of J.D. Power, 2 pricing businesses and Equity Research. We had consistent results with all segments delivering organic revenue growth. Bond issuance is robust in the third quarter despite the Brexit vote. Our focus on revenue growth and productivity performance led to continued margin improvement. Integration of SNL is progressing well and remains a top priority in 2016. And our adjusted diluted EPS guidance has increased to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 and includes dilution from the sale of J.D. Power, the pricing businesses and Equity Research. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Rob."

Next, I'll disc",1123,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will recap key financial results, discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings, then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. Next, I'll discuss the completion of our $140 million productivity program, the financial impact of our recent divestitures and update our 2016 guidance. Before wrapping up, I will explain the new segment reporting that will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter and the data we will provide. 
Let's start with the consolidated third quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line organic growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 9% with organic growth on a constant currency basis of 8%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $5 million and had a favorable impact of $8 million on operating profit. Our adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points. Approximately 60 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding top line growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 31.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over the third quarter of 2015 due to onetime benefits recorded in the prior period. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. 
Taken together, top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction combined to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $732 million in the quarter. The largest item is a gain on the sale of J.D. Power. The next item is a net gain from insurance proceed recoveries. And the last item includes net acquisition and disposition-related costs, primarily related to the sale of our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE, and J.D. Power to the XIO Group. And as we discussed earlier this year, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization, which totaled $23 million during the quarter. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $1.6 billion was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.6 billion of long-term debt and $400 million of short-term debt. The short-term debt is the value of the 2017 notes that were redeemed in October. One other item that I want to point out is that the cash proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power were recorded in the quarter. However, the tax on the gain will not be paid until later in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow during the first 9 months was approximately $1 billion. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow from the first 9 months was approximately $1.1 billion. 
Now I'll review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan. This resulted in the repurchase of 5.3 million shares during the quarter. However, the final share count reduction will not be determined until the ASR is completed. In addition, the company paid a dividend of $95 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In March of 2014, we initiated a productivity target of greater than $100 million in cost-reduction initiatives during 2014 to 2016. We subsequently increased the target to $140 million. Today, we are pleased to announce the successful completion of this program. We delivered slightly more than the $140 million in savings. If you look at the chart on the right, you can see that our adjusted operating margin has increased by 900 basis points since 2013. The successful achievement of this $140 million productivity target was a key contributor to this improvement. 
While we are pleased with our recent divestitures, we want to make sure all of you understand the loss of revenue and profitability associated with these transactions. J.D. Power, the SPSE and CMA pricing businesses and Equity Research combines to generate $310 million of revenue, $108 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA and approximately $0.25 of pro forma adjusted diluted EPS to our 2016 results before they were sold. This equates to approximately $100 million of revenue and $0.08 of adjusted diluted EPS that will be foregone each quarter. The recently announced ASR should help offset some of this dilution. We estimate that the ASR will increase diluted adjusted earnings per share by about $0.10 over the next year. We hope these figures will help you with your modeling of our future results. 
Based upon our strong results year-to-date and the expectation that debt issuance remains strong for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25. We've also made changes to other components of guidance as follows: adjusted unallocated expense is reduced to $135 million due primarily to reduced professional fees. The adjusted operating margin increase over 2015 is now expected to be approximately 200 basis points. This is largely due to the excellent performance in Ratings and Market Intelligence. The adjusted tax rate is increased to approximately 31.5%, primarily due to the timing and size of past years' tax settlements. Free cash flow, excluding the after-tax legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries, is increased to $1.4 billion due to strong financial results. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2016 will be another strong year for the company. 
The final item I want to discuss is the upcoming change to our reporting segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts will be included in a new segment called Market and Commodities Intelligence. Both fourth quarter results and full year 2016 results of both businesses will be reported in this new segment. To facilitate analysis in the next few weeks, we'll provide a pro forma schedule with results of this new segment for all quarters of 2015 and 2016 as if it had existed this way. This should help investors model 2017 appropriately. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

We are obviously going through our year-end review and our 2017 to 2019 strategic planning process, where we're evaluating ways that we can invest in the business. So investing in organic growth, which could be expansion of regional areas, of new products, of technology investments, et cetera, is very important for us. Following that, obviously, would be ways that we can accelerate growth or expand into new regions or new capabilities through M&A. Then obviously, finally, come our approach to dividends and share repurchase. But when it comes to your question around M&A, we would be looking at many ideas and many options coming in. Tuck-ins could be attractive for us, but it's something that we would do business by business, opportunity by opportunity, look at them separately as they arise. We have seen, as you know, tuck-in acquisitions have been a way for us to grow our portfolio of products in Platts. It's given us opportunities with different areas and services in Market Intelligence. Last quarter, we had purchased a very small rating agency in Thailand in our S&P Global Ratings area. So we would continue to look selectively at areas, but they need to -- we need to ensure that they also meet our parameters for growth and returns."

One of the areas that is a very fragmented business and there's high growth that relates to data and analytics on the energy markets -- and SNL has a small energy business and Platts, obviously, has a very large energy business -- and we wanted to accelerate the integration of those 2 businesses, but more importantly take advantage of the expertise that we have in the Market Intelligence data machine and how they can work together with Platts on building out that data analytics business.

But as you can see, it was offset by a transaction revenue growth of $55 million from $244 million to $299 million. So there was a very robust growth on the transaction side.

So there's obviously a few components to the revenue. One of them, we just mentioned, has been very strong in the last few quarters here now, which is the volatility aspect of our revenue, which relates to the exchange-traded derivative trading volume that goes through. So there's that aspect to it. There's another aspect is -- which is the core businesses that relate to AUM growth. And AUM growth, which could be a combination of the fees that we get for the actual underlying components of a fund or an ETF or the actual growth in AUMs over time. So that's a very important factor for us. And then we have our data feeds and data business. Generally, we're seeing growth in all of those. I think that the drop of the exchange-traded derivative income is what impacted this quarter and also had very positively impacted the third quarter last year. So that's a little bit about that -- about the -- that what you see there in the different between last year and this year. But let me just give you a couple of data points about the growth in the AUMs. So if I go way back, I go back almost 5, 6 years ago, if you go back into the end of 2013, there was a -- the overall AUMs was only $585 billion. It's now $914 billion at the end of this quarter. And through that time, there's been a combination of factors that have driven that growth. One is the increase in market value. So as the market itself and the indices themselves go up, that is a positive for our revenue. And the other is flows into the funds. And you saw that last week, in The Wall Street Journal, there was a series the entire week about the shifting needs of investors and the changes in the investment management industry, which have been benefiting firms like ours that are in the passive and index fields. So we're not giving you any specific projections today. We'll provide guidance for 2017 at our next earnings call. But we do continue to see the trends for this industry to be very positive."

And we do project based off of the M&A pipeline and what we see for being some pull-forward of issuance and what we see looking at the investment banking calendar and the debt capital markets of -- desks of the big banks. We do see a strong issuance in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, as you saw with the Brexit that happened last quarter, this could turn on a dime. You could see there's still a lot of volatility. There's still a lot of factors, which we're very cautious about. You've got the interest rate discussion in the United States. You still have Brexit.

So within this segment, obviously, you're going to have the must-have products of SNL. You've got the must-have products of things like CUSIP; our risk services area, we have products, which have become very important for risk management tools that you see as people are doing CCAR modeling and liquidity planning and living wills. So there's an advantage to having all of those types of products together. In addition then, you've got the Platts part of the business. So you've got a combination -- I don't know the numbers off of the top of my head. That would be better if we talked about that after we put together the new segment information and we send it out. But there is a lot of must-have data in there. And then remember that the traditional Cap IQ and SNL desktops have been growing very well. They're growing in -- somewhere in the high single-digit level for the Cap IQ desktop and over double digits for the SNL. So even though they might have some sort of discretionary component to them, they're still growing at a very good clip and, in many cases, substituting for other products, which might be similar that are much more expensive."

We wouldn't be surprised, though -- given a combination of the Department of Labor fiduciary ruling that came out and some other industry factors, low interest rates and the low growth environment is another impact, the shifting funds that are going into retirement and pensions, et cetera, we wouldn't be surprised if there is an active dialogue that goes on around the industry about fee structures and things like that, and we would like to be an active part of that."

But many times, we're delivering to customers that don't even need or even have a Bloomberg or a FactSet. So there's a different sorts of customers that we deliver to. And what our approach is to show the value of being able to harness the power of so much data and so much analytics in one desktop, especially for people that don't need the trading capabilities. It's people that are analysts, risk managers, bankers, investment bankers, regulators, academics, et cetera, that need the power of the data, don't necessarily need the instantaneous, low-latency information that might come with some of the other platforms. But that's the way we sell it.
So first of all, let me make a couple of closing remarks. I want to thank Rob MacKay for having been an absolutely fabulous partner as the interim CFO. He is our controller, so he doesn't get off the hook. He still has to hang around and sign off on the books. And we're looking forward to -- as our -- to welcoming Ewout Steenbergen to our company in about 1.5 weeks. And we're pleased that we're able to speak with all of you today. If you have further questions, please follow up with Chip and we will provide more of some of the answers, which you asked -- we will be able to answer when we issue our information about the new segment. And then we look forward to speaking with you again on our next earnings call. Thank you very much."

But let me begin with the hi",2309,"Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome, everyone, to the call. This morning, Rob MacKay, our interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results, and you're -- you'll hear from him shortly. 
But let me begin with the highlights. We completed several business divestitures with the sale of J.D. Power, our 2 pricing businesses, SPSE and CMA, and the equity research business. This leaves us with a more focused, interrelated portfolio of market-leading businesses. 2 tuck-in acquisitions were added during the quarter, PIRA Energy Group within Platts and Trucost within S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Several key management additions were announced. We completed the 3-year $140 million cost-reduction initiative that was announced during our Investor Day in 2014. We demonstrated continued revenue growth and productivity progress, which led to an adjusted profit margin improvement of 320 basis points, with every segment delivering organic revenue growth. 
As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. Our bottom line result was excellent with a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS over the third quarter last year. 
We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, and we increased our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25, which Rob will cover shortly. 
Before we turn to the results, I want to note 3 new appointees to our management team. Steve Kemps joined us from our Quanta Services as EVP of General Counsel. Martin Fraenkel has been promoted to President, S&P Global Platts. Martin previously led the global editorial team at Platts. And Ewout Steenbergen will join us from Voya Financial as EVP and Chief Financial Officer effective November 14. I'm pleased we avoided any disruptions to our businesses as we put in place an excellent leadership team. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter results. Reported revenue grew 9% and organic revenue, on a constant-currency basis increased 8%. In the third quarter, ForEx reduced revenue by $5 million, yet contributed approximately $8 million to adjusted operating profit and approximately 60 basis points to adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in the Platts segment, which benefited from a weaker British pound. The company delivered a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. Together, revenue growth, margin improvement and share repurchases led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 per share. 
In the third quarter, every division recorded organic top line growth. Profit growth, however, was most pronounced at Ratings and Market Intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 330 and 480 basis points, respectively. 
Let me turn to the businesses, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. Despite initial uncertainty from the Brexit vote, third quarter issuance was strong, particularly nonfinancial global corporates and U.S. public finance market. This resulted in a 9% increase in revenue with a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 17% due to strong revenue growth and cost containment, particularly with reduced legal and outside services spending. The adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points to 51.3%. ForEx had a negligible impact on adjusted operating profit. 
Non-transaction revenue was unchanged with growth in surveillance fees offset by lower Rating Evaluation Services fees. Transaction revenue increased 23% as a result of improved contract terms, growth in debt issuance and a 21% increase in bank loan ratings revenue. 
I also want to note that as we work to reenter the U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS market, there were 13 transactions in the quarter, and we rated 2 of them. 
If we look more closely at the largest markets, third quarter issuance in the U.S. was up 7% with investment grade decreasing 3%, high yields soaring 49%, public finance up 16% and structured finance increasing 11% due to a 44% increase in ABS transactions, driven especially by credit card ABS. 
In Europe, issuance increased 14% with investment grade climbing 42%, driven by large M&A transactions, high yield rising 37% and structured finance decreasing 46%, primarily due to a 59% decline in covered bonds. 
In Asia, issuance more than doubled. However, excluding domestic China issuance, which we do not rate, Asia issuance increased 64%. Investment grade surged 166%. However, excluding domestic China, it increased 67%. Japan was the country with the largest increase due to the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy. Finally, structured finance increased 2%. 
2 weeks ago, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. In the 3 months since the Brexit vote, debt markets have reacted very positively with unexpected levels of new issuance, especially in the nonfinancial corporate financial sectors and international public finance sectors. We now expect global issuance to increase 24% in 2016. This compares to the July forecast issued on the heels of the Brexit vote, which anticipated a decline of approximately 4%. If we remove sovereign issuance from the forecast, however, we anticipate issuance 2016 to increase approximately 10%.  Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall issuance increase -- we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 5%, driven by the ECB extending its quantitative easing policies longer than currently anticipated and further growth out of China. Excluding sovereign issuance, we anticipate issuance 2017 to increase 3% to 6%. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the third quarter, revenue increased 21%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic revenue growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 43%, and the adjusted operating margin advanced 480 basis points to 31.4%. This improvement was due to progress on SNL integration synergies, operating leverage from strong organic revenue growth and continued efficiency gains. ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue and adjusted operating profit in the quarter. As we have stated before, in 2016, successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies is a top priority for the company. We've made tremendous progress as evident in the margin improvement, and remain committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and deliver on our expected return on investment in SNL. 
Let me add a bit more color on third quarter revenue growth in Market Intelligence. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 6% with high single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ Desktop. In addition, on a comparable basis, which includes revenue prior to our acquisition, SNL revenue increased 12% over the third quarter 2015. SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth in the low teens and high single digit, respectively. 
Risk services revenue increased 10%, led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, Research and Advisory, revenue decreased 8% due to declines in equity research. With the sale of Equity Research, the only remaining asset in this category is Investment Advisory. Therefore, in the future, we'll report Investment Advisory as part of Financial Data and Analytics. 
Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 6%, adjusted operating profit increased 1% and adjusted operating margin declined 320 basis points to 66.2%. This is a sizable decline as the third quarter of 2015 benefited from a sharp increase in exchange-traded derivative volume that did not repeat this quarter. I also want to point out that the adjusted margin this quarter is comparable to the 66% figure we reported last quarter. 
During the third quarter, revenue increased primarily due to mutual funds and ETF license fees and steady data license growth. Operating cost increased to support revenue growth in business initiatives as well as increased cost for purchased data. One notable example is connectivity expenses as we recently started up a third data center to provide additional backup capabilities. 
Often on our earnings calls, I cite new products that we have launched. Last quarter, I highlighted the launch of the JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index in Japan. The new ETF that was launched based on this index has turned out to be one of the fastest-growing new ETFs this year. It already has over $700 million in AUM. 
Asset linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter. The exchange-traded products industry recorded massive inflows of $126 billion in the third quarter, almost triple the inflows in the second quarter. Of the $126 billion of industry inflows, $58 billion went into U.S. equity products, with S&P Dow Jones Indices capturing about 60% of those inflows. Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 15% year-over-year with inflows of 10% and the remainder from market appreciation. The quarter-ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $914 billion. 
Transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives decreased, primarily due to a 14% decrease in average daily volume of products based on our indices. The E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index Options and Futures, VIX, and CME Equity Complex Contrast -- Contracts all decreased 10% to 25% compared to the volatile third quarter of 2015. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions in custom indices, increased due to growth in data subscription revenue and the timing of subscription revenue. 
During the quarter, the company launched 161 new indices, and our partners launched 11 new ETFs based on our indices. 
Now onto the S&P Global Platts segment, which included J.D. Power results for July and August. Because this quarter has one less month of J.D. Power revenue than the third quarter of 2015, segment revenue declined 8%. Segment organic revenue, though, increased 4%. Adjusted operating profit increased 4%, reflecting one less month of J.D. Power. And adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 40.9%. Organic revenue increased 4% due to growth in subscriptions, partially offset by decline in Global Trading Services. 
The core subscription business delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector. The Global Trading Services' double-digit revenue decrease is primarily due to the timing of license fees. Gas and power revenue is flat with modest gains in subscriptions, offset by lower GTS service revenue. Metals, Agriculture and Petrochemicals revenue declined low single digit, primarily due to lower revenue from SGX-listed TSI iron ore contracts. We continue to expect modest growth for the remainder of 2016 as many customers continue to face pressure from low oil prices. 
On the business development front, we're building a world-class capability in energy supply and demand information, the acquisition of PIRA Energy Group and the added capabilities of Commodity Flow and RigData, which we acquired earlier this year. 
PIRA is a leader in the worldwide energy market analysis and a great complement to our existing benchmarks. PIRA offers research and analysis in oil, gas, power, natural gas liquids, biofuels, coal, environmental and agricultural markets. They also provide data tools to help customers analyze prices, supply, demand, trade flows, product balances and refining activity. And I'm pleased that Executive Chairman and Founder of PIRA, Dr. Gary Ross, has joined our team and is already generating new product ideas. 
In addition, Platts worked with CME to launch a new futures contract. Alumina FOB Australia Futures will be a 100-metric ton contract and will be financially settled each month against the daily price index published for Alumina FOB Australia by S&P Global Platts. Alumina is aluminum oxide, a white granular material, a little finer than table salt that's transformed into aluminum metal in the smelting process. This new futures contract is in addition to the 3 existing CME aluminum futures contracts based on Platts' benchmark. 
And finally, Brazil's CETIP. Latin America's largest depository of private fixed income securities and Brazil's largest private asset clearinghouse, is going to make Platts' benchmark prices estimates available as settlement mechanisms for the development of domestic derivative contracts. Historically, Brazil's only hedging tools tend to be similar, but not necessarily matching commodity indices, or they were international rather than domestic contracts. 
Investors are increasingly seeking new insights into environmental, social and governance factors. And both our index and ratings businesses are taking action to address these needs. 
First, our S&P Dow Jones Indices acquired Trucost. Trucost has become a leading brand in ESG information sector. They provide the gold standard carbon and natural capital investment metrics that financial institutions need to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and capitalize on the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. The complementary nature of our 2 businesses allow us to combine Trucost's industry-leading environmental impact data with our world-class benchmarking capabilities to develop new ESG solutions. 
Second, Ratings is developing a green bond evaluation tool to provide an analysis and estimate of the environmental impact of projects financed by a bond's proceeds. Our proposed approach would address mitigation, such as reducing negative environmental impact and adaptation to look at resiliency to the impact of climate change. The output of the green bond evaluation would include scores from the categories listed here amalgamated into an overall financial green -- final green bond evaluation. I'm encouraged by the innovative thinking underway in the company to help tackle increased ESG needs of investors. 
Before I conclude, I need to point out a reporting change. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we'll report our results under 3 segments: Ratings, Indices, and Market and Commodities Intelligence. We are doing this to be consistent with how we manage our businesses. 
In summary, we completed sales of J.D. Power, 2 pricing businesses and Equity Research. We had consistent results with all segments delivering organic revenue growth. Bond issuance is robust in the third quarter despite the Brexit vote. Our focus on revenue growth and productivity performance led to continued margin improvement. Integration of SNL is progressing well and remains a top priority in 2016. And our adjusted diluted EPS guidance has increased to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 and includes dilution from the sale of J.D. Power, the pricing businesses and Equity Research. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Rob."

This morning, I will recap key financial results, discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings, then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. Next, I'll discuss the completion of our $140 million productivity program, the financial impact of our recent divestitures and update our 2016 guidance. Before wrapping up, I will explain the new segment reporting that will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter and the data we will provide. 
Let's start with the consolidated third quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line organic growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 9% with organic growth on a constant currency basis of 8%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $5 million and had a favorable impact of $8 million on operating profit. Our adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points. Approximately 60 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding top line growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 31.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over the third quarter of 2015 due to onetime benefits recorded in the prior period. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. 
Taken together, top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction combined to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $732 million in the quarter. The largest item is a gain on the sale of J.D. Power. The next item is a net gain from insurance proceed recoveries. And the last item includes net acquisition and disposition-related costs, primarily related to the sale of our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE, and J.D. Power to the XIO Group. And as we discussed earlier this year, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization, which totaled $23 million during the quarter. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $1.6 billion was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.6 billion of long-term debt and $400 million of short-term debt. The short-term debt is the value of the 2017 notes that were redeemed in October. One other item that I want to point out is that the cash proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power were recorded in the quarter. However, the tax on the gain will not be paid until later in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow during the first 9 months was approximately $1 billion. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow from the first 9 months was approximately $1.1 billion. 
Now I'll review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan. This resulted in the repurchase of 5.3 million shares during the quarter. However, the final share count reduction will not be determined until the ASR is completed. In addition, the company paid a dividend of $95 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In March of 2014, we initiated a productivity target of greater than $100 million in cost-reduction initiatives during 2014 to 2016. We subsequently increased the target to $140 million. Today, we are pleased to announce the successful completion of this program. We delivered slightly more than the $140 million in savings. If you look at the chart on the right, you can see that our adjusted operating margin has increased by 900 basis points since 2013. The successful achievement of this $140 million productivity target was a key contributor to this improvement. 
While we are pleased with our recent divestitures, we want to make sure all of you understand the loss of revenue and profitability associated with these transactions. J.D. Power, the SPSE and CMA pricing businesses and Equity Research combines to generate $310 million of revenue, $108 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA and approximately $0.25 of pro forma adjusted diluted EPS to our 2016 results before they were sold. This equates to approximately $100 million of revenue and $0.08 of adjusted diluted EPS that will be foregone each quarter. The recently announced ASR should help offset some of this dilution. We estimate that the ASR will increase diluted adjusted earnings per share by about $0.10 over the next year. We hope these figures will help you with your modeling of our future results. 
Based upon our strong results year-to-date and the expectation that debt issuance remains strong for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25. We've also made changes to other components of guidance as follows: adjusted unallocated expense is reduced to $135 million due primarily to reduced professional fees. The adjusted operating margin increase over 2015 is now expected to be approximately 200 basis points. This is largely due to the excellent performance in Ratings and Market Intelligence. The adjusted tax rate is increased to approximately 31.5%, primarily due to the timing and size of past years' tax settlements. Free cash flow, excluding the after-tax legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries, is increased to $1.4 billion due to strong financial results. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2016 will be another strong year for the company. 
The final item I want to discuss is the upcoming change to our reporting segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts will be included in a new segment called Market and Commodities Intelligence. Both fourth quarter results and full year 2016 results of both businesses will be reported in this new segment. To facilitate analysis in the next few weeks, we'll provide a pro forma schedule with results of this new segment for all quarters of 2015 and 2016 as if it had existed this way. This should help investors model 2017 appropriately. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

We are obviously going through our year-end review and our 2017 to 2019 strategic planning process, where we're evaluating ways that we can invest in the business. So investing in organic growth, which could be expansion of regional areas, of new products, of technology investments, et cetera, is very important for us. Following that, obviously, would be ways that we can accelerate growth or expand into new regions or new capabilities through M&A. Then obviously, finally, come our approach to dividends and share repurchase. But when it comes to your question around M&A, we would be looking at many ideas and many options coming in. Tuck-ins could be attractive for us, but it's something that we would do business by business, opportunity by opportunity, look at them separately as they arise. We have seen, as you know, tuck-in acquisitions have been a way for us to grow our portfolio of products in Platts. It's given us opportunities with different areas and services in Market Intelligence. Last quarter, we had purchased a very small rating agency in Thailand in our S&P Global Ratings area. So we would continue to look selectively at areas, but they need to -- we need to ensure that they also meet our parameters for growth and returns."

So there's obviously a few components to the revenue. One of them, we just mentioned, has been very strong in the last few quarters here now, which is the volatility aspect of our revenue, which relates to the exchange-traded derivative trading volume that goes through. So there's that aspect to it. There's another aspect is -- which is the core businesses that relate to AUM growth. And AUM growth, which could be a combination of the fees that we get for the actual underlying components of a fund or an ETF or the actual growth in AUMs over time. So that's a very important factor for us. And then we have our data feeds and data business. Generally, we're seeing growth in all of those. I think that the drop of the exchange-traded derivative income is what impacted this quarter and also had very positively impacted the third quarter last year. So that's a little bit about that -- about the -- that what you see there in the different between last year and this year. But let me just give you a couple of data points about the growth in the AUMs. So if I go way back, I go back almost 5, 6 years ago, if you go back into the end of 2013, there was a -- the overall AUMs was only $585 billion. It's now $914 billion at the end of this quarter. And through that time, there's been a combination of factors that have driven that growth. One is the increase in market value. So as the market itself and the indices themselves go up, that is a positive for our revenue. And the other is flows into the funds. And you saw that last week, in The Wall Street Journal, there was a series the entire week about the shifting needs of investors and the changes in the investment management industry, which have been benefiting firms like ours that are in the passive and index fields. So we're not giving you any specific projections today. We'll provide guidance for 2017 at our next earnings call. But we do continue to see the trends for this industry to be very positive."

So within this segment, obviously, you're going to have the must-have products of SNL. You've got the must-have products of things like CUSIP; our risk services area, we have products, which have become very important for risk management tools that you see as people are doing CCAR modeling and liquidity planning and living wills. So there's an advantage to having all of those types of products together. In addition then, you've got the Platts part of the business. So you've got a combination -- I don't know the numbers off of the top of my head. That would be better if we talked about that after we put together the new segment information and we send it out. But there is a lot of must-have data in there. And then remember that the traditional Cap IQ and SNL desktops have been growing very well. They're growing in -- somewhere in the high single-digit level for the Cap IQ desktop and over double digits for the SNL. So even though they might have some sort of discretionary component to them, they're still growing at a very good clip and, in many cases, substituting for other products, which might be similar that are much more expensive."

As you've heard us say before, our goal was to remove all of the first areas of things like legal expense, of ensuring that we had the right approach to managing our business when it came to compliance and control, embedding new technology tools to have more automation. We have a project going on right now called Project Simplify, which has the benefits of better control, a better workflow and eventually, it will also bring lower cost with it as well, as you have more streamlined operations. So think about our approach towards margin as continuous improvement. We will keep striving to improve our margin. I'm not going to give you a target necessarily today. But we do have a commitment to strive to keep improving our margin. And that would come with a combination of better penetration into the markets, to our sales force, through looking at how we can manage our contracts and our mix on pricing as well as discounting policies, and then on the cost side, through projects like Simplify and other ways to manage the business more efficiently and more effectively. So you can see, over the last few years, we have had a continuous improvement in our margins, and that's a commitment that we still have."

We're a business that has the data and the information around market activities. And we provide the benchmarks, the pricing, the data tools, et cetera.

So today, we're excited to have everyone here in the panelist and, of course, to talk -- and we're going to focus on the new drivers of change in credit markets. That's going to be -- that's the basis for today, of course. And as we think about what's going on and what's going on in credit these days and sort of erosion in credit standards, chasing yields, Fed, they're trying to decide if they're going to raise rates or not, Brexit, different things going on. We're really excited to hear what the panels are going to talk about today and what the impact is going to be.

So what will be the topics today? So the things we're going to cover. So transformative trends and credit risks analysis and modeling, the new financial technology landscape and what is the potential impact on big data and artificial intelligence.
So about 3 years ago, S&P Global started working with Ed to help us try to -- to help us inform our products, our clients and provide a bigger impact across the board. So it's been this really great partnership with us, and we're really appreciative of Ed to help us go through that process. So -- and in a bag, Ed -- so Ed's going to kick off in just a second. But there's -- we're talking about the beginning of this quantitative -- or modern history of quantitative modeling and Ed really -- there's no real distinctive date that occurred. But of course, Ed's 1968 Altman Z-score is probably the genesis of a lot of it. So we're -- it's a big tribute to Ed.
So finally, let me talk to you just a little bit about it. So Ed's going to come up and talk about where we are in the credit cycle. And is there a bubble building in the corporate and sovereign credits? I think Ed's resume speaks for itself. And looking through his bio is like a Tolstoy novel today. But -- and just a few things about him. So Ed is the -- and some of this stuff is on the board, too. So Ed is the Max Heine professor of Finance Emeritus at Stern in New York City -- New York University. He is the Director of Research and Credit and Debt Markets at NYU-Salomon Center in Study of Financial Institutions. Prior to serving in his present position, Ed was the Chair at the Stern School's MBA Program for 12 years. He is an international -- he has an international reputation. He's an expert for corporate bankruptcy, high yield bonds, distressed debt, credit risk and analysis. In 2005, Ed was named the 100 Most Influential People in Finance by Treasury & Risk Magazine.

Thanks for coming out. I'm still not sure why you come out early in the morning. I'm probably up at this hour and -- but the fact that you came from probably far away and -- is really very nice and we appreciate it very much. As Scott mentioned, I've been working with what used to be called Capital IQ. And I think it's probably still known as that to most of you. They have a new name, Global Market Intelligence. And I'm delighted to work, particularly with their risk solutions group -- risk group. I loved risks for a long time. And I'm not too happy these days. I haven't seen enough risk out there and -- so I'll see if you're going to be commenting on that. But seriously, it's been a turbulent period for me to talk about this subject.
Usually, when I come to the West Coast about this time, the Giants are in the World Series, and so that's not on this year. And since I grew up in New York City a long time ago and the Giants were back East, along with the Yankees, and I used to live in that little area between the 2 baseball fields. I feel a great affinity to the West Coast. I did my doctorate here. I met my wife and we were married out here in California. And now we're back in New York, but coming out here is always very special. On this trip, actually, I've been on an election tour in Asia and I can talk a little bit, perhaps later on, about what's going on there and what's going on Asia, real impact on the markets and vice versa. And so it's very interesting to get a different perspective as you travel and learn about what the local folks are thinking about us and vice versa, including Tokyo and Seoul for a big conference there.
And this subject of -- well, it's not on the slide. This topic about where we are in the credit cycle, and is there a bubble building? I've been thinking about this and speaking about it and writing about it for about a year, a little over 1.5 year now. I remember giving a speech in late January or early February 2015 at the local New York Turnaround Management Association group, which I spent a lot of time with back in New York, about where we were in the credit cycle then, so take us back 1.5 years. And if you don't mind, I'll continue the baseball metaphor. I usually have to when I'm speaking, either in the U.S. And it was really wonderful when I'm speaking in Tokyo and Seoul because they're baseball crazy there as well. So you don't have to explain the fact that a baseball game lasts typically 9 innings. And back 1.5 year -- a little over 1.5 years ago, we were talking about the benign credit cycle and I'll define what I mean by benign cycle, even though the general name will probably be pretty obvious to most of you. The benign credit cycle was in the seventh inning. A typical ballgame would last 9 innings. In other words, it was mostly over. And that we were possibly going to be moving into a stress cycle, and I'll define what I mean by a stress cycle in a few minutes, probably in a year to 18 months. And so that was back 1.5 years ago. And then I updated that and wrote some papers on the subject of the credit cycle and how it compares this time with 2006 and 2007 prior to the great financial crisis, and that we were in the ninth inning last January, 1 year after that and about 8 months ago. And I thought I was so smart, really. I said, ""Wow, stuck in the dugout, ninth inning, the game is almost over."" And that was January, February of this year, so you may remember what happened then. I'll show you in gory detail what happened then. I thought I'm really so smart. But I know that in baseball, if the score is tied at the end of 9 innings, the game is not over and we go into extra innings. And I think that's where we are today. We are in extra, extra innings of the credit cycle. And the umpire in this game, and the one that's going to determine -- help determine how long we're going to be in those extra innings, is -- are the 4 major central banks of the world. Certainly, the Fed, and you'd been following the Fed's activities as most people have for a long time, we've never seen the Fed being so aggressive, interventionist and involved in capital market activity, even though they use the rubric [ph] jobs and that's well -- and that's part of the double deal. But it's not only them. It's European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and of course, the Bank of China. The 4 major banks of the world decided independently supposedly, but they certainly were looking what each other were doing in February of this year that they were not going to, at least on their watch, permit another stress cycle to start. They weren't thinking about credit markets as much as we were. They were talking, of course, about growth and inflation, and that was what they were thinking about. And they started pouring, again, enormous amounts of liquidity into the system, which has continued to this day.
Continuing the baseball metaphor for a few minutes further. I was in my dentist's chair, as I unfortunately am quite frequently. I get a lot of information from 2 sources, my dentist and taxi drivers. And I told my dentist, who's a great guy, Pankaj Singh is his name, about the baseball metaphor. And in fact we're extra innings and he said, ""Oh, that's great, yes, really."" I really dig that. Well, what happens in extra innings is you have your best relief pitchers first, right? They come in, in the eighth, ninth, 10th inning. And then you dig down a little deeper into the barrel to get another relief pitcher and the like and except when -- I mean, the New York Yankees, this is really a pitiful year, when you think of it. We have 3 of the best relief pitchers in the world. And now 2 of them are making their mark in the World Series now, thank goodness for the teams that they're with. And it's, of course, Chicago and Cleveland. And anyway, the relief pitchers come in and after a while, you use up your good relief pitchers, And so isn't it likely that the game's going to be over pretty soon because batters are finally going to score some runs. And every time we've seem to be ready to score some runs and the game is over, something happens to change things. And the benign cycle, and I'm going to show you that what I mean now, is still with us. And so I'd have about a lot of egg on my face thinking that the benign cycle is going to be over shortly after January, February this year. And here we are in September, October and it is still with us.
So let's talk about what we mean by the benign cycle. I look at the credit cycle using 4 metrics, and I'm sure others metrics are possible. Default rates, recovery rates given default and the 2 together, of course, are known as loss given default or LGD; yields and spreads and liquidity, so the 4 metrics. It's very clear if you have low default rates, higher recovery rates, if there are defaults, low interest rates and low spreads compared to what we used to call the risk-free rate. Now we call it the benchmark rate, the treasury rate. And if high liquidity, you're in a benign cycle. And so 1.5 years ago, we were clearly in a benign cycle. Default rates were low. Recovery rates were very high, and I'll explain what I mean by recovery rates. Spreads were average or slightly below average. And there was tons of liquidity, new issue markets. And by the way, I'm going to use as my benchmark in the credit cycle to a market that I've been following since 1982 called the high-yield junk bond market. And the reason why is that first of all, it's very selfish on my part, I've done a lot of data. And data is really important anytime we do research. And we got into this market really early when Morgan Stanley asked me to do a internal study on whether they should get involved in this market back in 1982. And the rest is history. And also high-yield markets now are incredibly important because most people think that's the only game in town to get some yield. And that, of course, has been driving the markets dramatically in 2016. It's with these very, very low interest rates that surround us. So default rates, recovery rates, yields and liquidity. Those are the 4 metrics that we're going to talk about. I'm also going to, if you permit me, try to relate what's going on today to what happened in 2007. Of course, that was just before the crisis. And I remember in 2007, I was giving a speech for a large French bank in Montréal, North American division of this international bank. And I was painting a really bleak picture about the credit cycle and where we were headed. And I predicted that we will go into a bad stress cycle. But my focus was on the corporate market. If you recall, as we all know what happened, the big problems were in the mortgage-backed securities, so prime markets. And then the corporate markets followed in a state of bankruptcies and defaults late '08 and '09 is now quite clear in history. So I was giving the speech and at the end of the speech, the President of the bank pulled me aside and said, ""You know Prof. Altman, that was a very convincing argument that you just made about the credit cycle ending in terms of the benign and that we're going into a more stress period. If I follow what you say, I should be reducing my exposure, hedging my risk and maybe even going short credit primarily through the CDS market."" I said, ""Well, that's very flattering if you think that what we were saying is likely to happen."" He said, ""Yes, yes, but I don't have the courage to do it."" I said, ""What I don't understand, if you think it's the right strategy, why do you need to be courageous?"" He said, ""Well, you don't understand my job."" I said, ""Yes, that's probably right. That's why you're a bank president and I'm a college professor."" And he said, ""No, no. I'm serious. You don't understand my job."" I said, ""Well, could you explain?"" He said, ""Listen, if you're right and the credit markets change, and we have taken the appropriate actions in anticipation of that by hedging or even going short, I'm going to be a hero and get a big bonus. But if you're wrong and I take your advice, and the train keeps speeding down the track, and liquidity stays really high and the credit markets stay booming, I'm going to lose my job."" I said, ""Oh I didn't know that, but I think you're probably right "" And I think there were a lot of people at those -- at that time in '07 who felt the same way, that the markets were getting really frothy. Anything that walked through the door get financed. High-yield returns were very high. Risky debt was booming. And so he didn't hedge, and he didn't cover his positions that much. And things changed very dramatically as we all know starting in '08, and I'll show you the curves at that point.
So how different is today than '07? That's I think one of the things we want to explore. And of course, there's that famous book and that famous argument, this time it's different. And it is. There's no question. It's different now than it was in '07. And the question is, how long will that difference permeate the markets? And it's primarily the activities of the central banks who really got wrong the last time. The regulators deserve as much discredit as the bankers and all the people who were being sued. Although you don't sue a regulator and you just, of course, hopefully change the people and maybe you change the strategy, which is what we're seeing now becoming much more aggressive earlier.
So let's talk about these 4 metrics. And then I want you to use some ancient models that I built, some of them not so ancient, but certainly going back 50 years now. 50 is a magic number for me, by the way, I've been 50 years in NYU. 50 years ago, I built the Z model. And 50 years ago, I got married. So it's very easy to remember how long I've been married. I just think about the model. But it's a bankrupt model. Anyway, 50 years ago, we built this model. I want to try to bring that into play as well in our discussion. 
So of course, we're talking about investment grade, noninvestment grade. And we're going to spend the most time on the high-yield junk bond market, which, by the way, today, is about USD 1.7 trillion, about 1/2 of the investment grade market in corporate debt, but most of the investment grade market and corporate debt is in financial institutions. If we take out financials, they are more industrial, high-yield and they are all industrial high-grade. And so we're going to focus on that market. And just to give you some numbers, about $4.3 trillion investment grade, $1.65 trillion high-yield, total about USD 6 trillion straight debt, not counting corporate, not counting mortgage backs and other types of debt that are involved. And you can see the breakdown of financials and industrials and utilities.
Here's the growth of the high-yield market. When I got involved back in the early '80s, the market was tiny, essential, all fallen angels. And now about 80% of the market are in original issue junk. And as cost is one area to look at as to liquidity. I mean, we all can know what liquidity is, but to actually define it and to measure it is very tricky and very difficult. And the academics have been struggling with the term liquidity for a long, long time. And nobody has it yet. We all know when it's highly liquid or illiquid. But we don't really know how -- the right metric to look at. I personally like to look at the ability of highly risky companies to refinance, to get liquidity in a period. If they have difficult times when illiquid and they have a lot of easy times as they have lately, it's highly liquid. So we're at $1.6 trillion.
And default rates, let's see where we are. Default rates, of course, are defined as the -- either bankrupt, missed interest payment or distressed exchanges relative to the size of the market. This graph, and you can see this one perhaps a little bit more clearly, shows you the default rate on high-yield bonds going back to the late '80s. And we've had 3 periods of stress cycle. And notice that in between the default rates being 10% or more, we've got 3 of them, 1991, '01 and '02. And again in 2009, with 3 times. And in between, we have the benign cycles. And actually, if you went back to the 1970s, the yellow bars here represent the recession periods in the United States. And here are the 3 peaks again on the default rates. And here are your benign cycles, 1, 2, 3, 4. And we're in the fifth. We were in the fifth for sure until the beginning of this year and that's why in the default rate, one of the metrics, was below the historic average of 3.4%. That's the historic average for high-yield bonds.  And so if you look at these cycles, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  the length of the benign cycles in the U.S. had been between 4 and 7 years, the longest being 7 in this period and the shortest being 4 in this period. And we are now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And at the beginning of this year, we were entering the seventh year of a benign cycle.
But the 4 metrics began to disperse -- oh, I hit that by mistake, sorry about that. What can we do? Press it one more time. So I do it again, I'm okay. It's kind of fun. Okay, good. All right. So here we are, and for the first time since 2009, the default rate on high-yield bonds is now higher than the historic average for the last 12 months. We are now at about 4.5% last 12 months' default rates. Year-to-date, we are at 3.64%, that's was as of the 23rd of September. My assistant just wrote to me yesterday, said we're about 3.75% as of yesterday. So 3.75% last -- is the year-to-date default rate on high-yield bonds. And about 70% of that is energy, mining and -- energy and mining. So a lot of people are saying this time it's different. If you get rid of energy and mining, the default rate is really pretty low, only 30% of 3.7% is other industries but I learned over the years, you can't throw out the bad industry, there's always in default rates whether it was telecoms back in the early 2000, whether it was autos, chemicals and the industry back in '08, '09 or LDL red defaults back in the late '80s. You always have them but a lot of people are saying this time it's different. And the irony is, that sometimes high default rates engender tremendous recoveries in the market at the same time that the default rates are peaking. And the reason is that the market expected even worse defaults.
So the years 1991, 2009 and this year turned out to be the best years ever to be in risky debt. And yet all those years have relatively high default rates. And the reason is that the markets and people like myself and Standard & Poor's and a few others, I won't even mention their names, forecasts the default rates that sometimes were not right, we're overshoot , so back in 2009 or earlier 2008, we forecasted 2009, we were -- many of the pundits were thinking the default rate would be 15% to 20% of the high-yield market, it turned out only to be 11%. The second-largest ever. And the markets recovered dramatically. Something like that is happening this year. We expected this year, and I can show you the forecast, somewhere between 4.4% Moody's and 6% Fitch and I was in the middle at about 5%, all pretty big increases in the default rate this year. Yes, it has increased. We're at 3.7% year-to-date. My forecast was 5% for this year. I'm probably going to come in a little high. Maybe it'll be 4%, 4.5% depending on a lot of things, including the price of oil for the next 3 months. But we were all forecasting more than the historic average. So the first metric of the 4, the default rate, we can check off as the longer in the benign cycle more than the historic default rate.
Recovery rates. Now many of you know that the CDS market and the high-yield market, and particularly Basel II and Basel III with respect to promotional banks, a lot has to do now only with how many firms default and the hits that the banks take on nonperforming loans, but also on how much the windup recovers. And there are many ways of calculating that recovery rate. I've always been taking the easy route, and that is to measure the price of the security at the time of default, just that. That's the price you could sell the bonds for or loans or the price you pay for if you were a distressed investor. And by the way, the distressed investing industry, which is pretty large, probably about $400 billion under management, has incredible amount of dry powder today. And they are earning because of the new issues to invest in outside of the energy industry are relatively small. And they geared up for a big cycle that we were partially responsible for. But the recovery rate on high-yield bonds is another metric. Historic average corporate bonds recover have a price of about $0.40 to $0.45 on the $1.00 at default. So you get the modeling distressed around $0.80 on the $1, highly distressed at $0.60 on the $1.00. And around $0.40 on the $1.00 is usually the average recovery, at 40% or 45%.
Let's take a look at what's happened lately. Sorry for switching around so much. This is European. Okay, regarding 2014, the default rate was relatively low, 2.11%. Look at the recovery rate, $0.63 on the $1.00. This is corporate bonds that was way above the historic average benign credit cycle, low defaults, high recoveries. And oil and gas was not even that interesting or important then. Then you get to 2015, default rate is creeping up, still below the historic average, recovery rate was $0.34 on the $1.00, much below. But all of it was due to oil and gas and mining. And the average for all it was about the historic average. You could say that things were about normal. But look what's happened in 2016. Through September 23, default rate now above the historic coverage, recovery rate much below the historic average at $0.26. And it doesn't matter if you talk about oil and gas and mining or all of it. It's below the historic coverage.
So the second metric. Recovery rates are moving toward the stress cycle, below the historic average, default rates above the historic coverage. So at the beginning of this year, when we were anticipating these metrics and we've got models to estimate the recovery rate that I can show you as well, given the default rate, we were thinking the benign cycle was in the ninth inning, just about over. And now let's take a look at we said, let's take a look at yields, spreads, risk premiums and liquidity, the other 2 metrics that we look at. By the way, this graph, you may have seen before, was based on a study we did in 2002, published in 2005 with a couple of Italian researchers that I work with from the Bocconi University. And basically, it shows a negative correlation between default rates and recovery rates. So when you got a lot of data on low default rates between 0% and 2% in this quadrant, all of them seemed to have higher recovery rates. 
o the higher the -- the lower the default rate, the higher the recovery. And the opposite out here when you have high default rates and low default rates between 20% and 30%, certainly, about 37% being the highest of any stress period. So if we expect now the default rate to move in this direction, we would expect the recovery rate to move down. So you get the double whammy, right? You get high defaults and low recoveries. So whenever we forecast default rates, as we did this year, we then plug that into the forecast of recovery rate, and basically, it's a supply-demand dimension that determines that. 
So the first 2 metrics -- by the way, here's a lot of data on -- if you're really into defaults and particularly in the oil and gas and mining industry, here's the energy mining Chapter 11 filings since beginning of 2015 when we became interested in the benign cycle again. 41% of all bankruptcies were in energy and mining. And if you look at defaults -- [indiscernible] defaults are different, then bankruptcies, you can default in a lot of ways that you don't go bankrupt. The data is even more impressive. And so far since December of -- sorry, January of '15, 72% in dollars of all defaults are in these energy and mining sector. And one of the reasons why the default rate has begun to reduce is the price of oil has now risen to around $50 a barrel, and it was much higher defaults when it was $0.30, $0.35, $0.40 -- $40 per barrel.
Okay, let's look at spreads, interest rates. Here's where we really have egg on our face because here we were in January and February of this year. Spreads were about 850 over treasuries. Historic average about 5.25. If we go back, this is only a period since I gave that speech in Montréal and the historic average is actually about 5.25. So keep that in mind, 5.25 is a typical spread between high yield and treasuries, all right, and it was 850. So this was another metric that looked like we were going into the stress cycle or in it already. And then the question is, would it go this way or this way? And once before it happened in -- since the great financial crisis, and that was 2011, and this was mainly Europe that was driving it, here at the beginning of this year, remember what was driving spreads?"

And somehow, China is under the radar and not on the top of the radar screen. But things are not better in China today than they were in January, February. Things are actually far worse. The trade deficit is worse. So they're under $3 trillion now in terms of reserves. The amount of debt in the system has been building dramatically, even though the authorities are trying to put a clamp on it. But look what's happened to the spreads. We're now at -- this says 519. That was as of the 26th. As of yesterday, the spread between high yield and treasuries, 479 basis points or about 4.8%. Now that's one of the metrics -- or one of the indexes [indiscernible]. If you look at Barclays, it's probably even lower than 4.8%. Historic average, 5.25. The market does not seem to be concerned with defaults going forward. And we thought and we still think they should be. So the fundamentals in terms of credit profile, I'm going to ask you some questions on that, seems to be different than what the market seems to be expecting. Market seems to be expecting lower-than-average default rates, and we seem to -- we're expecting higher than average, but not like it was in '08, '09, unless there's a super catalyst out there that we can point to. 
Just to give you a little historic perspective, back here, it was 2,100 basis points, has an opportunity to adjust its spread over treasuries. And back here when I -- in '07, it was as low as 2.6%, and here we are at 4.8%. So the question is now, how low can it go? Or is it going to start going up again? Most people think that high yield, by the way, is up over 16% this year. So if you've been across-the-board in high yield, you would earn around 16%, and that, of course, is one of the few areas that have done really well. But the stock market in this period is about -- up about 5%. But what we've observed, I don't know if you -- what do you think lately, say since the '08 recession? What do you think the correlation is between stock price behavior, returns and risky debt returns, high yield versus, say, the S&P 500, high, low?"

And there was an article in the Wall Street Journal, I don't know if that's good",797,"High. How high? What has been -- well, let's go back a second. What has it been for the last 40 years, 30 years? Not so high, by 0.4. Last 6 years, 7 years? 0.8, cost of 0.8. And there was an article in the Wall Street Journal, I don't know if that's good or bad, but there was an article in the journal recently, last week I think it was, or maybe it was only this week -- or no, it was in The Sunday Times, in the mutual fund ETF section, about the fact that for the first time, that when a stock -- the correlation between the stock market and the government bond rate has been positive. Usually, that's a -- this gray hedge [ph], you go back and forth, displays the high, that the two are moving together for the first time in a long, long time. So when the stock market goes down, the bond market goes down. And, of course, a lot of people now are concerned with the increase in interest rates going forward, and the long-term rates have come up a little bit. So there are some signs of stress in the system but not if you look at the yield spread on high-yield debt versus treasury. We're at a low rate. So the question is, are we going to go up or down? I don't know if I'm hitting that or not, but I will touch the usual button. Okay, let's move on. I'm going to skip all of this. This is the B- or lower. 
Default rate forecast, I'm going to only highlight something called mortality rates. No, I don't want to even highlight that until I get to another section. I'll come back to this. And I'm going to skip over this in the interest of time. Incidentally, if you look at forecasts, the beginning of this year, we were forecasting about a 5% based on 3 models that we have: mortality rate, yield spread and distressed ratio. If you put -- plug in two of the market measures, how much the market is requiring as a risk premium and something called a distressed ratio. In 1990, I got a commission from a West Coast firm. How many of you remember, if I recall, the Foothill Group ? Any of you? A few of you. Okay. Are they part of Wells Fargo now? Okay, so it was their original identity. And the Foothill Group asked me to do a white paper on distressed debt, which is available from someone now. I have it, certainly. I don't know if [indiscernible] to get it. And so we had to define what is distressed? What is a distressed security? So our metric, and now it's been picked up by just about every investment bank and rating agency, our bond is selling at more than 1,000-over treasuries. So if it's selling at more than 1,000 basis points or 10% above treasuries, so today, it would be about 11.7%, the definition is that, that bond is distressed. So we use that as a metric for forecasting default rates, and you can see that by looking at this regression. Here's your distressed ratio, and it varies between 1% and 2%. And it was as high as 82% back in 2008 when everything was distressed just about. And look at that nice correlation. This is the distressed ratio here and the default rate 1 year later. So the market is kind of predicting how many firms would default. And if you plug in to this very simple regression, the distressed ratio, which is now down to only 13%, 13% of high yield on distressed. At the beginning of 2015, when we first looked about it, it was 25%. You plug that in and you get a forecast of only 2.7%, where it was 4.4% at the beginning of the year. So we use that as one of the metrics.
Okay. Let me ask you a question now. You've heard enough about me, and now I will get some insights from you. What do you think is the credit profile of a typical U.S. corporate today? And I'm emphasizing high yield, but we can talk about investment grade as well. But let's talk -- let's restrict it to typical high-yield bond issuer. Is it today more or less risky, higher probability of default or lower probability of default or the same as it was in 2007? More risky, less risky or about the same as it was in '07? How many of you think today's typical corporate credit profile is less risky, less risky than it was in '07? No one? I've never had an audience. Might be all asleep. Okay, think about it."

It looks like about the same or more risky are pretty much equal. So I asked myself that question. And I didn't know the answer, for sure, but I read about a lot of cash on the balance sheet, relatively good profits until recently. And I started asking this question in 2014, and I'm still asking it. And as we speak today, my assistant is finishing the 2015 year-end data analysis and should have had it done by now. 
Comparative health of high-yield firms '07 versus 2012. And not surprising to you, we use the Z-score as a metric. We built this model 100 years ago, as you know, and you're supposed to laugh. It was a long time ago when we built it. That was 50 years ago, and, of course, things have changed. But this is the original model, if you remember, 5 variables. And if you take the CFA exam, you have to study this. I just gave a couple of talks in Asia to the CFA, and I wasn't very popular because all these folks had to learn the model. They were very polite and they let me finish. So we have 5 variables representing usual fundamentals. Now we're going to talk about in the panel discussion big data, new drivers. This is old data, old drivers, right? This is the fundamental model that simply looked at financial statements, balance sheet, income statement data. And for the first time, we threw in back in 1966, published in '68, the market value of equity relative to the book value of liabilities as a metric, credit metric. Since then, you, of course, have the structural models, the KMV model, et cetera, that center our market value on volatility. We were the first to emphasize market value of equity, but we weren't the first and we didn't think about volatility then, which, of course, is very important.
So if you then -- and we have a second-generation model called Z double prime, which is really better for non-manufacturers and emerging market credits. This one yield book values, so we can now emphasize a risk metric for private firms like leverage buyouts as well as others. So we have these 2 models and we looked at data. And one thing we can do is look at the bond rating equivalents of the Z-score. So here's a very interesting statistic, where all of you have historical-based interest in financial data. When we built the original Z model in 1968, any firm with an overall score of below 1.8, if you added up the -- all the variables and weightings, was in the distressed zone, and 100% of them went bankrupt in our little laboratory. And if the score was above 3, no one went bankrupt at least within 2 years.
Look at how things have changed since 1968. The average B-rated company, which is the dominant junk bond, there are more Bs out there than any other bond, and second only to BBBs in terms of all credit ratings. So Bs are really out there, and the question is, is a B, is a B, is a B? I think William Shakespeare said that back in the -- a long time ago. And the average Z-score, 1.66. In other words, if you look at the old model and the old cutoff scores, the average B-rated company is in the distressed zone and a high percentage default. Well, guess what is the default rate of a newly issued B-rated bond over the last 40 years within, say, 5 years? What percentage of Bs default within 5 years? Any guesses?"

It's not that bad, but it's about -- let me show you the results, had it before, damn it. I want to go back to what areas. The mortality rate, this is like an actuarial approach to looking at default rates, of a B for 5 years is around 28%. So only 28% default by the fifth year, 72% don't, for a B, and yet the average is in the old distressed zone. So don't use those zones anymore, for those of you who still look at Z-scores. And incidentally, I'm told by at least Bloomberg and I'm waiting now for firms like Capital IQ and BlackRock and others who have great data on Z-scores. Who uses Z-scores? Is it the debt guys, the equity ladies? Who's using them? And it turns out Bloomberg tells me that Z-scores get about 5,000 hits a day. And the majority are equity investors, not debt investors, which surprised me. I was expecting the opposite. But with respect to debt, we can get a bond rating equivalent from a score and then plug in some sort of mapping historical default rates but done from a actuarial standpoint rather than a static pool or whatever the Moody's call this. We all look at this cumulative default rates, 28% for Bs and 47% CCCs. Let's get back to that. 
And now let's answer the question, Z-scores versus '07 versus 2014, and here are the results. Here are the number of firms we looked at, and now we're doing it for 2015. And the numbers are increasing. So for Z, we're probably well over 600 companies, and the Z double prime is probably close to 1,000. If you look at the median Z-score in '07, it was 1.81, just about at the threshold of the old distressed zone, and it's 1.8 in 2013. So those of you who voted -- I was out of time. I am out of time. Voted for no change between the average risk profile of '07 versus today, or this is '14 anyway, you would have been correct.
So is that good news or bad news? We're just as risky as '07, at least in terms of Z-scores."

But there's also no role of the Fed in the score. So you got to say that things may not be as much.
Let me conclude by talking about the last metric, and that is liquidity. So let me skip all of these other metrics. These are new issue of data. The blue lines represent new issue high-yield bond data in the U.S. and Europe, and notice how much the new issues escalated in '11, '12, '13, '14 and '15? This is the first half of this year, $98 billion in the U.S. We only have through the -- I should have September when I get back. So if $98 billion was the first half of the year, double that for the year, just by extrapolating, it's about $200 billion new issues. That's a little less than what it was in '15, definitely less than here, still pretty frothy market. Maybe it's going to be higher. Is Sprint noninvestment grade? I think they came out with a big issue recently. So that would add to this quite a bit. Anyway, the new issue market died off for a while, has come back. There was an article about bank lending. For the first time, everyone's surprised at this, bank lending to risky companies, for the first time, dropped in the third quarter of this year. If that's an anomaly, I don't know, but it was a surprise to a lot of people because the bond markets are a little lower than they were. Liquidity seems to be coming a little less so, but maybe everybody who's topped the markets for the low interest rates has done so. I mean, it's very little remaining interest.
When I was a graduate student at UCLA back in the '60s, 1960s, there was this theory called a trade-off theory between debt and equity and bankruptcy costs versus tax benefits. And the idea was there's an optimal capital structure to companies, and companies do move to that outboom [ph], but they go above or below it at times to take advantage of market conditions. And so we observed Times, a lot more debt being issued in low interest rate periods. Well, we've been in a low interest rate period now for 5, 6 years, and we've had companies keep coming in to the market, raising debt, high liquidity. So the leverage ratios are way above historic averages. Imagine certainly in book value terms, market value terms is not as much but it's definitely above. The question is, can you go back? The old theory was, you can always go back where the correlations weren't that high between debt and equity, but now they're very high. And the question is, can you go back so easily when all of a sudden, the stock market goes into decline and so does the bond market? So my guess is capital structure theory needs to be rethought a little bit in terms of this debt versus equity. That's a sideline.
Liquidity. This shows CCC new issuance, which is one of my metrics. The highest year ever was '07, 37% of high-yield bonds were CCCs. You know how ugly CCCs are? They are really ugly. Almost half default by the fifth year, running every 2, and yet in the last 5 to 6 years, the market seems to have said, ""Okay, I'll get out before the CCCs hit the fan or the yield risk return tradeoff is favorable even at the CCC level."" I'm not convinced and we've got now 10% to 20% of the market as CCCs. A lot of them CCCs, a lot of them are going to fail. The question is, have we kicked the can down the road enough so that it won't happen in the next 12 months? Perhaps, that's the case.
Final metric I want to talk about is the private equity industry. I know we have some private equity folks here, and, of course, the industry is alive and well throughout the world, tremendous number of private equity, LBO deals, especially in this low interest rate market. Let's take a look at some metrics in that -- from that industry. I'm going to skip over this and go through the last one.
Purchase price multiples. This is the average price or median price paid per dollar of cash flow. The highest year in a long, long time was '07, right before the crisis. Public to private was about 10x. This data is coming from S&P Capital IQ. So -- which is where I get a lot of my data these days, and I think it's the best data out there but I'm biased. And they're paying for this breakfast, so -- it was a good breakfast. So 9.9x was high, and then it dropped, of course, in the crisis but not as much as you would have thought. And then 2015, the highest year ever, 11x for primary buyouts. And secondary buyouts, all others, was about 10.2. And 2016 is coming in at a little lower, 10.5x by mid-year for public to private. Both higher than 9.9. So definitely showing a frothy market. You could argue, however, that the debt-to-EBITDA ratio is not as high, 5.5x in the U.S. versus 6.6 in '07 but still quite frothy. And so anytime you get 5.5 to 6x, you're getting into the CCC range, you're getting into very risky range, LBOs.
Now we've done the studying, we haven't published it yet. So the good news about LBO private equity is, on average, default rates are lower than comparably rated plain vanilla issuance for private equity sponsored LBOs. The bad news is, they're all going to go up when you start paying 10, 11, 12x cash flow and use a lot of debt in doing it. We can discuss that as well.
So the last metric, liquidity seems to be still pretty frothy. Yield spreads are low. 2 of the 4 metrics are saying we are still in the benign cycle. 2 of them, default rates and recovery rates, saying we are beginning in a stress cycle. We're in extra innings. So when will it end? I don't know. What will be the catalyst? Perhaps, we can discuss that in the panel discussion. I'll be part of that. 
Sorry for going so long, and thank you for staying. And hopefully, you'll stay now for a terrific panel put together by Cristiano and the folks at Capital IQ, Global Market Intelligence. And so let's take a break. Panelists, come up here, but don't go far. And by the way, if you need the men's or ladies room, it's about 3 miles down. Thank you very mu"

This morning, Rob MacKay, our interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results, and you're -- you'll hear from him shortly. 
But let me begin with the highlights. We completed several business divestitures with the sale of J.D. Power, our 2 pricing businesses, SPSE and CMA, and the equity research business. This leaves us with a more focused, interrelated portfolio of market-leading businesses. 2 tuck-in acquisitions were added during the quarter, PIRA Energy Group within Platts and Trucost within S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Several key management additions were announced. We completed the 3-year $140 million cost-reduction initiative that was announced during our Investor Day in 2014. We demonstrated continued revenue growth and productivity progress, which led to an adjusted profit margin improvement of 320 basis points, with every segment delivering organic revenue growth. 
As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. Our bottom line result was excellent with a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS over the third quarter last year. 
We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, and we increased our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25, which Rob will cover shortly. 
Before we turn to the results, I want to note 3 new appointees to our management team. Steve Kemps joined us from our Quanta Services as EVP of General Counsel. Martin Fraenkel has been promoted to President, S&P Global Platts. Martin previously led the global editorial team at Platts. And Ewout Steenbergen will join us from Voya Financial as EVP and Chief Financial Officer effective November 14. I'm pleased we avoided any disruptions to our businesses as we put in place an excellent leadership team. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter results. Reported revenue grew 9% and organic revenue, on a constant-currency basis increased 8%. In the third quarter, ForEx reduced revenue by $5 million, yet contributed approximately $8 million to adjusted operating profit and approximately 60 basis points to adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in the Platts segment, which benefited from a weaker British pound. The company delivered a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. Together, revenue growth, margin improvement and share repurchases led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 per share. 
In the third quarter, every division recorded organic top line growth. Profit growth, however, was most pronounced at Ratings and Market Intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 330 and 480 basis points, respectively. 
Let me turn to the businesses, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. Despite initial uncertainty from the Brexit vote, third quarter issuance was strong, particularly nonfinancial global corporates and U.S. public finance market. This resulted in a 9% increase in revenue with a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 17% due to strong revenue growth and cost containment, particularly with reduced legal and outside services spending. The adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points to 51.3%. ForEx had a negligible impact on adjusted operating profit. 
Non-transaction revenue was unchanged with growth in surveillance fees offset by lower Rating Evaluation Services fees. Transaction revenue increased 23% as a result of improved contract terms, growth in debt issuance and a 21% increase in bank loan ratings revenue. 
I also want to note that as we work to reenter the U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS market, there were 13 transactions in the quarter, and we rated 2 of them. 
If we look more closely at the largest markets, third quarter issuance in the U.S. was up 7% with investment grade decreasing 3%, high yields soaring 49%, public finance up 16% and structured finance increasing 11% due to a 44% increase in ABS transactions, driven especially by credit card ABS. 
In Europe, issuance increased 14% with investment grade climbing 42%, driven by large M&A transactions, high yield rising 37% and structured finance decreasing 46%, primarily due to a 59% decline in covered bonds. 
In Asia, issuance more than doubled. However, excluding domestic China issuance, which we do not rate, Asia issuance increased 64%. Investment grade surged 166%. However, excluding domestic China, it increased 67%. Japan was the country with the largest increase due to the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy. Finally, structured finance increased 2%. 
2 weeks ago, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. In the 3 months since the Brexit vote, debt markets have reacted very positively with unexpected levels of new issuance, especially in the nonfinancial corporate financial sectors and international public finance sectors. We now expect global issuance to increase 24% in 2016. This compares to the July forecast issued on the heels of the Brexit vote, which anticipated a decline of approximately 4%. If we remove sovereign issuance from the forecast, however, we anticipate issuance 2016 to increase approximately 10%.  Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall issuance increase -- we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 5%, driven by the ECB extending its quantitative easing policies longer than currently anticipated and further growth out of China. Excluding sovereign issuance, we anticipate issuance 2017 to increase 3% to 6%. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the third quarter, revenue increased 21%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic revenue growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 43%, and the adjusted operating margin advanced 480 basis points to 31.4%. This improvement was due to progress on SNL integration synergies, operating leverage from strong organic revenue growth and continued efficiency gains. ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue and adjusted operating profit in the quarter. As we have stated before, in 2016, successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies is a top priority for the company. We've made tremendous progress as evident in the margin improvement, and remain committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and deliver on our expected return on investment in SNL. 
Let me add a bit more color on third quarter revenue growth in Market Intelligence. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 6% with high single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ Desktop. In addition, on a comparable basis, which includes revenue prior to our acquisition, SNL revenue increased 12% over the third quarter 2015. SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth in the low teens and high single digit, respectively. 
Risk services revenue increased 10%, led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, Research and Advisory, revenue decreased 8% due to declines in equity research. With the sale of Equity Research, the only remaining asset in this category is Investment Advisory. Therefore, in the future, we'll report Investment Advisory as part of Financial Data and Analytics. 
Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 6%, adjusted operating profit increased 1% and adjusted operating margin declined 320 basis points to 66.2%. This is a sizable decline as the third quarter of 2015 benefited from a sharp increase in exchange-traded derivative volume that did not repeat this quarter. I also want to point out that the adjusted margin this quarter is comparable to the 66% figure we reported last quarter. 
During the third quarter, revenue increased primarily due to mutual funds and ETF license fees and steady data license growth. Operating cost increased to support revenue growth in business initiatives as well as increased cost for purchased data. One notable example is connectivity expenses as we recently started up a third data center to provide additional backup capabilities. 
Often on our earnings calls, I cite new products that we have launched. Last quarter, I highlighted the launch of the JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index in Japan. The new ETF that was launched based on this index has turned out to be one of the fastest-growing new ETFs this year. It already has over $700 million in AUM. 
Asset linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter. The exchange-traded products industry recorded massive inflows of $126 billion in the third quarter, almost triple the inflows in the second quarter. Of the $126 billion of industry inflows, $58 billion went into U.S. equity products, with S&P Dow Jones Indices capturing about 60% of those inflows. Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 15% year-over-year with inflows of 10% and the remainder from market appreciation. The quarter-ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $914 billion. 
Transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives decreased, primarily due to a 14% decrease in average daily volume of products based on our indices. The E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index Options and Futures, VIX, and CME Equity Complex Contrast -- Contracts all decreased 10% to 25% compared to the volatile third quarter of 2015. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions in custom indices, increased due to growth in data subscription revenue and the timing of subscription revenue. 
During the quarter, the company launched 161 new indices, and our partners launched 11 new ETFs based on our indices. 
Now onto the S&P Global Platts segment, which included J.D. Power results for July and August. Because this quarter has one less month of J.D. Power revenue than the third quarter of 2015, segment revenue declined 8%. Segment organic revenue, though, increased 4%. Adjusted operating profit increased 4%, reflecting one less month of J.D. Power. And adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 40.9%. Organic revenue increased 4% due to growth in subscriptions, partially offset by decline in Global Trading Services. 
The core subscription business delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector. The Global Trading Services' double-digit revenue decrease is primarily due to the timing of license fees. Gas and power revenue is flat with modest gains in subscriptions, offset by lower GTS service revenue. Metals, Agriculture and Petrochemicals revenue declined low single digit, primarily due to lower revenue from SGX-listed TSI iron ore contracts. We continue to expect modest growth for the remainder of 2016 as many customers continue to face pressure from low oil prices. 
On the business development front, we're building a world-class capability in energy supply and demand information, the acquisition of PIRA Energy Group and the added capabilities of Commodity Flow and RigData, which we acquired earlier this year. 
PIRA is a leader in the worldwide energy market analysis and a great complement to our existing benchmarks. PIRA offers research and analysis in oil, gas, power, natural gas liquids, biofuels, coal, environmental and agricultural markets. They also provide data tools to help customers analyze prices, supply, demand, trade flows, product balances and refining activity. And I'm pleased that Executive Chairman and Founder of PIRA, Dr. Gary Ross, has joined our team and is already generating new product ideas. 
In addition, Platts worked with CME to launch a new futures contract. Alumina FOB Australia Futures will be a 100-metric ton contract and will be financially settled each month against the daily price index published for Alumina FOB Australia by S&P Global Platts. Alumina is aluminum oxide, a white granular material, a little finer than table salt that's transformed into aluminum metal in the smelting process. This new futures contract is in addition to the 3 existing CME aluminum futures contracts based on Platts' benchmark. 
And finally, Brazil's CETIP. Latin America's largest depository of private fixed income securities and Brazil's largest private asset clearinghouse, is going to make Platts' benchmark prices estimates available as settlement mechanisms for the development of domestic derivative contracts. Historically, Brazil's only hedging tools tend to be similar, but not necessarily matching commodity indices, or they were international rather than domestic contracts. 
Investors are increasingly seeking new insights into environmental, social and governance factors. And both our index and ratings businesses are taking action to address these needs. 
First, our S&P Dow Jones Indices acquired Trucost. Trucost has become a leading brand in ESG information sector. They provide the gold standard carbon and natural capital investment metrics that financial institutions need to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and capitalize on the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. The complementary nature of our 2 businesses allow us to combine Trucost's industry-leading environmental impact data with our world-class benchmarking capabilities to develop new ESG solutions. 
Second, Ratings is developing a green bond evaluation tool to provide an analysis and estimate of the environmental impact of projects financed by a bond's proceeds. Our proposed approach would address mitigation, such as reducing negative environmental impact and adaptation to look at resiliency to the impact of climate change. The output of the green bond evaluation would include scores from the categories listed here amalgamated into an overall financial green -- final green bond evaluation. I'm encouraged by the innovative thinking underway in the company to help tackle increased ESG needs of investors. 
Before I conclude, I need to point out a reporting change. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we'll report our results under 3 segments: Ratings, Indices, and Market and Commodities Intelligence. We are doing this to be consistent with how we manage our businesses. 
In summary, we completed sales of J.D. Power, 2 pricing businesses and Equity Research. We had consistent results with all segments delivering organic revenue growth. Bond issuance is robust in the third quarter despite the Brexit vote. Our focus on revenue growth and productivity performance led to continued margin improvement. Integration of SNL is progressing well and remains a top priority in 2016. And our adjusted diluted EPS guidance has increased to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 and includes dilution from the sale of J.D. Power, the pricing businesses and Equity Research. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Rob."

Next, I'll disc",1123,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will recap key financial results, discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings, then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. Next, I'll discuss the completion of our $140 million productivity program, the financial impact of our recent divestitures and update our 2016 guidance. Before wrapping up, I will explain the new segment reporting that will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter and the data we will provide. 
Let's start with the consolidated third quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line organic growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 9% with organic growth on a constant currency basis of 8%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $5 million and had a favorable impact of $8 million on operating profit. Our adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points. Approximately 60 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding top line growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 31.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over the third quarter of 2015 due to onetime benefits recorded in the prior period. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. 
Taken together, top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction combined to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $732 million in the quarter. The largest item is a gain on the sale of J.D. Power. The next item is a net gain from insurance proceed recoveries. And the last item includes net acquisition and disposition-related costs, primarily related to the sale of our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE, and J.D. Power to the XIO Group. And as we discussed earlier this year, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization, which totaled $23 million during the quarter. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $1.6 billion was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.6 billion of long-term debt and $400 million of short-term debt. The short-term debt is the value of the 2017 notes that were redeemed in October. One other item that I want to point out is that the cash proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power were recorded in the quarter. However, the tax on the gain will not be paid until later in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow during the first 9 months was approximately $1 billion. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow from the first 9 months was approximately $1.1 billion. 
Now I'll review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan. This resulted in the repurchase of 5.3 million shares during the quarter. However, the final share count reduction will not be determined until the ASR is completed. In addition, the company paid a dividend of $95 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In March of 2014, we initiated a productivity target of greater than $100 million in cost-reduction initiatives during 2014 to 2016. We subsequently increased the target to $140 million. Today, we are pleased to announce the successful completion of this program. We delivered slightly more than the $140 million in savings. If you look at the chart on the right, you can see that our adjusted operating margin has increased by 900 basis points since 2013. The successful achievement of this $140 million productivity target was a key contributor to this improvement. 
While we are pleased with our recent divestitures, we want to make sure all of you understand the loss of revenue and profitability associated with these transactions. J.D. Power, the SPSE and CMA pricing businesses and Equity Research combines to generate $310 million of revenue, $108 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA and approximately $0.25 of pro forma adjusted diluted EPS to our 2016 results before they were sold. This equates to approximately $100 million of revenue and $0.08 of adjusted diluted EPS that will be foregone each quarter. The recently announced ASR should help offset some of this dilution. We estimate that the ASR will increase diluted adjusted earnings per share by about $0.10 over the next year. We hope these figures will help you with your modeling of our future results. 
Based upon our strong results year-to-date and the expectation that debt issuance remains strong for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25. We've also made changes to other components of guidance as follows: adjusted unallocated expense is reduced to $135 million due primarily to reduced professional fees. The adjusted operating margin increase over 2015 is now expected to be approximately 200 basis points. This is largely due to the excellent performance in Ratings and Market Intelligence. The adjusted tax rate is increased to approximately 31.5%, primarily due to the timing and size of past years' tax settlements. Free cash flow, excluding the after-tax legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries, is increased to $1.4 billion due to strong financial results. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2016 will be another strong year for the company. 
The final item I want to discuss is the upcoming change to our reporting segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts will be included in a new segment called Market and Commodities Intelligence. Both fourth quarter results and full year 2016 results of both businesses will be reported in this new segment. To facilitate analysis in the next few weeks, we'll provide a pro forma schedule with results of this new segment for all quarters of 2015 and 2016 as if it had existed this way. This should help investors model 2017 appropriately. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

We are obviously going through our year-end review and our 2017 to 2019 strategic planning process, where we're evaluating ways that we can invest in the business. So investing in organic growth, which could be expansion of regional areas, of new products, of technology investments, et cetera, is very important for us. Following that, obviously, would be ways that we can accelerate growth or expand into new regions or new capabilities through M&A. Then obviously, finally, come our approach to dividends and share repurchase. But when it comes to your question around M&A, we would be looking at many ideas and many options coming in. Tuck-ins could be attractive for us, but it's something that we would do business by business, opportunity by opportunity, look at them separately as they arise. We have seen, as you know, tuck-in acquisitions have been a way for us to grow our portfolio of products in Platts. It's given us opportunities with different areas and services in Market Intelligence. Last quarter, we had purchased a very small rating agency in Thailand in our S&P Global Ratings area.

So there's obviously a few components to the revenue. One of them, we just mentioned, has been very strong in the last few quarters here now, which is the volatility aspect of our revenue, which relates to the exchange-traded derivative trading volume that goes through. So there's that aspect to it. There's another aspect is -- which is the core businesses that relate to AUM growth. And AUM growth, which could be a combination of the fees that we get for the actual underlying components of a fund or an ETF or the actual growth in AUMs over time. So that's a very important factor for us. And then we have our data feeds and data business. Generally, we're seeing growth in all of those. I think that the drop of the exchange-traded derivative income is what impacted this quarter and also had very positively impacted the third quarter last year. So that's a little bit about that -- about the -- that what you see there in the different between last year and this year. But let me just give you a couple of data points about the growth in the AUMs. So if I go way back, I go back almost 5, 6 years ago, if you go back into the end of 2013, there was a -- the overall AUMs was only $585 billion. It's now $914 billion at the end of this quarter. And through that time, there's been a combination of factors that have driven that growth. One is the increase in market value. So as the market itself and the indices themselves go up, that is a positive for our revenue. And the other is flows into the funds. And you saw that last week, in The Wall Street Journal, there was a series the entire week about the shifting needs of investors and the changes in the investment management industry, which have been benefiting firms like ours that are in the passive and index fields. So we're not giving you any specific projections today. We'll provide guidance for 2017 at our next earnings call. But we do continue to see the trends for this industry to be very positive."

So within this segment, obviously, you're going to have the must-have products of SNL. You've got the must-have products of things like CUSIP; our risk services area, we have products, which have become very important for risk management tools that you see as people are doing CCAR modeling and liquidity planning and living wills. So there's an advantage to having all of those types of products together. In addition then, you've got the Platts part of the business. So you've got a combination -- I don't know the numbers off of the top of my head. That would be better if we talked about that after we put together the new segment information and we send it out. But there is a lot of must-have data in there. And then remember that the traditional Cap IQ and SNL desktops have been growing very well. They're growing in -- somewhere in the high single-digit level for the Cap IQ desktop and over double digits for the SNL. So even though they might have some sort of discretionary component to them, they're still growing at a very good clip and, in many cases, substituting for other products, which might be similar that are much more expensive."

This morning, Jack and I'll review our second quarter results. We're very pleased with the progress the company is making, creating growth in a macroeconomic environment that has challenged many of our customers. 
Let me begin with the highlights of the second quarter. 
Every segment delivered revenue growth. This is a testament to the quality of our products and the creativity and execution of the employees who develop and deliver them. In addition to creating growth, driving performance is a key theme in managing the company, and margin improvement is an important yardstick by which our progress is measured. This quarter, the company delivered a 210 basis point expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. 
A top priority for 2016 is the integration of SNL. We continue to make progress on SNL integration and synergy targets, and I'll share a few examples with you in a few moments. 
Financial performance was excellent with an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 17% over the most difficult quarter comparison in 2015. As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year. 
Last week, we received final regulatory approvals for the sale of J.D. Power. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $513 million, and we increased the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, reflecting strong second quarter results. 
Before I get to the results in more detail, I want to take a moment to discuss the British exit from the European Union. First and foremost, Brexit has no immediate implications for our European operations. It's business as usual for S&P Global. While the media has reported that a number of companies plan on moving operations out of London, we have no such plans. We expect that the -- because of the uncertainty it creates, however, Brexit could hamper issuance, particularly in Europe.
 So far, the impact has been muted, but markets never like uncertainty and it will take time to resolve all for the various regulatory changes that companies and markets will face. For our company, we'll seek to work with the relevant U.K. and EU legal and regulatory authorities to navigate the path forward, a process that will likely take years. S&P Global Ratings has written extensively on the impact that Brexit will have on the markets, and our views can be found on the S&P Global Ratings website at the URL listed on this slide. 
Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter results. While reported revenue grew 10%, organic revenue on a constant-currency basis increased 5%. In most recent quarters, the company's revenue has been hit by ForEx with little impact to operating profit. Primarily due to the weak British pound, however, this quarter was different. In the second quarter, ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue, yet contributed approximately 3 percentage points to adjusted operating profit and approximately 100 basis points to the adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in S&P Global Ratings. So overall, the company delivered 210 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as a result of ForEx, S&P Global Ratings margin improvement and the progress made on SNL integration synergy targets. Together, revenue growth margin improvement and share repurchases combined led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. 
In the second quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in adjusted operating profit. The 2 standout performers were S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence, with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 400 and 370 basis points, respectively. 
Now let me turn to the business, and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. During the quarter, revenue increased 4% with a negligible impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 12%, and the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 54.1%. Improved market conditions after a weak 2016 start resulted in a modest year-over-year issuance increase. For the first time in 6 quarters, international revenue outperformed domestic. ForEx had a favorable impact of 3 percentage points on adjusted operating profit and approximately 150 basis points on the adjusted operating profit margin, due primarily to the weakness in the British pound. Excluding ForEx, adjusted expenses decreased 3 percentage points mainly due to reduced outside services. 
Another highlight of the quarter was the purchase of a 49% stake in TRIS Rating. This increased commitment to TRIS in an exciting step forward in our long-standing relationship. By working together more closely, we'll be in a better position to serve our customers and investors in Thailand and other ASEAN markets. 
Non-transaction revenue increased 3% from growth in surveillance, CRISIL, commercial paper activity and royalties from Risk Services. Transaction revenue increased 5% as a result of improved contract terms, increased bank loan rating and growth in debt issuance in Asia. 
If we look more closely at the largest market, second quarter issuance in the U.S. was down 11% with investment grade decreasing 6%, high-yield down 9%, public finance up 4% and structured finance declining 37% with drops in every class. In Europe, investment grade was unchanged, high yield was down 5%, while structured finance increased 4% with strength in RMBS and CLOs. And in Asia, investment grade issuance surged 60% and structured finance increased 20% due to ABS and RMBS. 
Let's take a further look at issuance. The 3% increase in global issuance breaks a 4-quarter streak of year-on-year declining global issuance that had pressured S&P Global Ratings revenue. During the quarter, only Asia reported an increase in issuance with a 55% gain. Excluding domestic Chinese issuance, which we don't rate, issuance in Asia still increased 35%. One factor driving this growth was offshore Chinese issuance. 
During the quarter, investment grade issuers generally had unfettered access to debt capital markets while spec-grade issuers had very limited access with windows of opportunity that opened for short periods and then were disrupted by external events. Despite the year-over-year declines in the U.S. and Europe, there were periods of extreme strength during the quarter. In fact, May set a monthly record for U.S. investment grade issuance. June started out with a very strong issuance, but then came to a standstill in the week leading up to the Brexit vote. 
Last week, S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. We now expect global issuance to decline 3.8% in 2016. This compares to the April forecast, which anticipate a decline of approximately 2%. The biggest differences are in corporate and structured issuance, which have been lower due to Brexit, and international public issuance, which has been increased as first half issuance already exceeds all of 2015. 
Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the second quarter, revenue increased 29%, primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL, organic growth was 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased 48% and adjusted operating margin advanced 370 basis points to 28.4%. The adjusted segment operating margin includes a benefit from ForEx of approximately 100 basis points. Excluding ForEx, this figure is comparable to the first quarter adjusted segment operating margin. ForEx had a favorable impact of 5 percentage points on adjusted operating profit, primarily due to weakness in the Indian rupee and British pound. 
In 2016, successful integration of SNL was a top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL, and we recognize that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver return on that investment. We are well on our way to achieving cross-sell synergy targets for 2016. 
Last quarter, we reviewed some of the organizational changes that took place. Today, in order to help you get a better sense of our efforts, I'm going to share several examples of integration synergies progress during the quarter. We reconfigured our Risk Services Scorecard product for analyzing commercial banks to include SNL Bank data and received great feedback and early sale success from the market. 
We integrated our equity ownership and earnings estimate data on to the SNL platform. We made tremendous progress on integrating SNL sector-specific fundamental data into our Xpressfeed delivery platform. Now in beta testing, SNL content will be available this fall, enabling more seamless cross-selling to our existing feed clients. We completed significant design work on our next-generation consolidated product platform that will encompass mobile, web and excel delivery. Reduced cost by replacing third-party data with internal solutions, we completed our office consolidations in Denver, New York and Singapore with other cities still in the works. We've been making great progress. 
Let me add a bit more color on second quarter revenue growth in S&P Global Market Intelligence, which delivered double-digit user growth in both S&P Capital IQ Desktop and SNL. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 8% with high single-digit growth in both products. In addition, SNL revenue reported a 9% increase compared to the second quarter 2015. Prior to our acquisition of SNL, however, excluding a purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, revenue grew 10%. With the progress that we continue to make integrating SNL into S&P Global Market Intelligence, it will become increasingly difficult to separate SNL results from the total. Therefore, this is likely the last quarter we'll provide separate revenue figures for SNL. 
Risk services revenue increased 10% led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth. In the smallest category, Research & Advisory, revenue decreased 12% due to declines in equity research services. 
Now let's turn to S&P Global -- S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 66%. Market volatility has created large swings in AUM from month to month as well as volatility in the number of exchange-traded derivative contracts traded each month. During the second quarter, revenue increased primarily due to steady data license growth, strength in exchange-traded derivative activity due to market volatility and ETF-related revenue was up slightly. 
If we turn to 3 types of revenue, transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives increased primarily due to a 24% increase in average daily volume of products based on S&P DJI's Indices. In particular, E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index, VIX, and CME equity complex track -- contracts all increased more than 20%. Asset-linked fees revenue, mostly from exchange-traded funds, was up slightly. The exchange-traded products industry recorded inflows of $46 billion in the second quarter with fixed income products receiving the largest inflows. 
Average AUM associated with our indices increased 3% year-over-year with inflows of 7%, offset by asset value declines of 4%. The quarter ended on a high note with quarter ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reaching a new record of $855 billion as U.S. equity markets rebounded. This creates a great starting point for the third quarter. 
Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices, increased due to continued steady growth in data subscription revenue. During the quarter, the company launched 90 new indices, and our partners launched 18 new ETFs based on our indices. We added 2 in the environmental, social and governance space that I'd like to highlight. JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Indices, designed to measure performance of Japanese companies that are proactively and effectively making investments in physical and human capital based on various metrics including the RobecoSAM human capital scores. And the S&P ESG Index series, designed to measure the performance of companies with a weighting scheme based on an ESG factor score derived from RobecoSAM's annual corporate sustainability assessment. This launch brings together for the first time Smart Beta and sustainability into a global index family that treats environmental, social and governance, or ESG, on a standalone performance factor. With the addition of these 2 indices, we now have 130 ESG indices. 
This quarter, we celebrated the 120th anniversary of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, launched in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones. On its first day, May 16, 1896, the Dow closed at 40.94. Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the iconic symbol of the U.S. stock market. 
Now on to S&P Global Platts, which currently includes J.D. Power. Organic revenue increased 4% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide, Petromedia and RigData acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 38.4%. Platts delivered 7% revenue growth driven by strength in subscriptions in Global Trading Services. J.D. Power had a declining organic revenue due to lower consulting revenue in China. With all of the regulatory requirements completed, we continue to expect closing the sale of J.D. Power this quarter. 
Turning to Platts. Global Trading Services led the growth during the quarter with double-digit revenue gains primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE exchanges. The core subscription business delivered mid-single digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum sector, with particular strength in Asia. Metals, agricultural and petrochemicals revenue grew at high single-digit, primarily due to the strength in Singapore Exchange-listed TSI Iron Ore contracts and metal market data subscriptions. 
While rig counts are up since the beginning of May, many of our customers remain under pressure from low oil prices. Therefore, we continue to expect growth to moderate slightly in the remainder of 2016 as these customers continue to face difficulties. Finally, the CME Group introduced a new Aluminum A380 alloy futures contracts that settles against our price assessment. There has been growing need for North American aluminum alloy risk management tool. This contract will provide market participants with an effective solution for hedging aluminum alloy price risk. 
On the business development front, we have several new items. In June, we acquired RigData, a leading provider of daily information on rig activity for the natural gas and oil markets across North America. We discussed our desire to add our own supply-demand data offerings, and this extends our energy analytic capabilities in North America natural gas with oil offering. Founded in 1986, RigData provides over 5,500 customers with daily electronic reports on drilling permits, activity and rig locations in the United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. 
We launched 5 domestic oil product assessments in Japan. Platts now assesses prices for important refined oil products for domestic waterborne deliveries in Japan from locations in Tokyo Bay, Chukyo and Hanshin. The Japan waterborne assessments reflect prices for gasoline, gas oil, kerosene, low-sulfur A fuel oil and high-sulfur fuel -- A fuel oil. These assessments will follow Platts' market-on-close principle. 
And finally, we launched the LNG U.S. Gulf Coast Marker. The natural gas infrastructure that connects United States, Mexico and Canada is the world's largest and most integrated natural gas market. By 2020, the Americas are expected to be the world's third-largest producer of LNG behind Australia and Qatar. This new price reflects the daily export value of LNG traded free on board from the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
In summary, all segments delivered revenue growth. Bond issuance recovered from a weak start to the year. Margin improvement continues to be a key focus. Integration of SNL remains a top priority for the company with meaningful progress to date. We expect Brexit to have no immediate implications for the company. And we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $5.05 to $5.20. Our guidance has been updated to now include dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power. 
With that, I'll want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. But before I turn the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, I wanted to say a few words about him. As you know, Jack has accepted new position at Yale. Not only is he an active Yale alumni, he grew up in New Haven, Connecticut. So Jack's going home. We're thankful for the time he spent with us. 
After joining the company in November of 2010, he was instrumental in engineering the transformation to S&P Global, a faster-growing, more focused and profitable company. He's also assembled an outstanding organization, and we're grateful for all he has done for the company and shareholders. Early next month, Jack will begin his role as Senior Vice President of Operations at Yale. We wish Jack and his family all the best. Rob McKay, our current Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO as we continue the search process for Jack's replacement. Thank you, Jack. And now I'll turn the call over to you."

This morning, I'll recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impacts from adjustments to earnings then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And wrapping up, I'll provide some color on our updated guidance. 
Let's start with the consolidated second quarter income statement. There are just a couple items I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 10% with organic growth of 5%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points. Approximately 100 basis points was due to ForEx. The balance was primarily due to outstanding profit growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Both businesses have delivered impressive margin improvements year-to-date. 
Interest expense was up over $26 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year, partially in support of the SNL acquisition. This stepped-up level of interest expense will continue to create a difficult year-over-year comparison until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in more than a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustained top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the most profitable quarter in 2015. 
Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $22 million in the quarter. The first item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. The second item includes net disposition costs, primarily related to the pending sale of J.D. Power to the XIO Group and our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE. The last item is a restructuring charge in S&P Global Ratings as the business continues to focus on sustained productivity. And as we discussed last quarter, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization of $23 million. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 95% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $309 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a drawdown on our credit facility. Since the end of the first quarter, we have reduced short-term debt by $163 million. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will likely fluctuate a bit as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs. 
Our first half free cash flow was $478 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first half free cash flow was $513 million and is on track to reach our 2016 guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. 
Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company bought approximately 1.4 million shares. These purchases, combined with our dividend, total to approximately $242 million of cash returned to shareholders just in this quarter. Year-to-date, the company has returned $538 million to shareholders. The volume weighted average price for the shares repurchased so far this year is approximately $98. The share repurchase program remains an important component of the company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate stepping up share repurchases to help mitigate some of the dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power, subject to market conditions. 
Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2016 guidance. There are 3 items that have been updated. Our previous guidance included the results of J.D. Power for the full year. We now assume that the sale of J.D. Power will be completed during the third quarter and have remove J.D. Power results for the balance of the year. This will have an impact on revenue and our guidance moves from mid- to high single-digit to new guidance of mid-single digit growth. Year-to-date margins have benefited by approximately 100 basis points from ForEx. Therefore, we have increased our adjusted operating profit margin improvement from approximately 50 basis points to a new guidance of approximately 150 basis points. 
Despite the inherent dilution from removing several months of J.D. Power results, we are increasing our 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 due to the strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The new range is $5.05 to $5.20. We are keeping a wide range as there remains considerable macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact the markets and our customers. 
So in summary, the second quarter was a strong quarter for the company. Each of our segments is performing well, and we are well positioned to continue to provide the essential benchmarks, data and analytics that our customers require. 
As Doug mentioned earlier, today is my last earnings conference call. It has been a pleasure and an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer of, initially, the McGraw-Hill Companies, then McGraw Hill Financial and now S&P Global. I want to thank our shareholders and the analyst community for your interest and support as we have transformed the company. 
And finally, I want to thank the over 20,000 S&P Global associates for your hard work and commitment in building a stronger organization for the future. I wish you all well, and I remain optimistic on the continued success of S&P Global going forward. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

Welcome to the call. I think this is your first time on our call. So, first of all, the Market Intelligence business is advancing quite well, as you heard from some of the statistics that I provided and some of the examples. Related specifically to your question about the selling environment, I'll just be clear that we continue to progress faster on cost synergies than we do on sales synergies. But we are finding some early wins -- we're finding more wins in Asia right now than we are necessarily in Europe. And this is where we're able to either sell SNL products into Asia customers, who before didn't use them, using the former Cap IQ sales force, or we're finding opportunities where we've integrated the services together between Cap IQ and SNL and also delivering them into Asia. The selling environment is mixed, as you know. There still are a lot of financial institutions, that is one large part of our customer base, that are reducing headcount. They're reducing some of their, specifically, trading and front office people. On the other hand, on the back office in areas like compliance, control, risk management and also some more traditional consumer banking and commercial banking activities, there are and continue to be increase in headcount. So the environment is mixed with some consolidation and shrinking happening and on the other hand, increase in demand for risk management for other sorts of tool. So we're seeing a mixed market. But we are continuing to have a very, very strong sales effort. Our sales team has integrated excellent and it's very well integrated, and they've got a new commercial approach. We're reaching out to clients in a much more consolidated organized way, and we're starting to see top line growth coming out of the synergies as well."

And to start off with, as you know, we've been in -- engaging in a commercial approach to running our business with hiring of Chris Heusler last year to lead our commercial activities. We've approached our clients in a way that gives us a broad relationship-oriented approach, where we're looking at ways to broaden our coverage, including products like loan, ratings, RES, et cetera. So we're looking across that as well as looking at our contract terms. One of the areas where we also had very strong growth in this quarter was in Asia. Just to give you a color on the issuance in Asia, it was up in across the board in every category. In fact, total issuance in Asia this quarter was greater than total issuance in the United States, if you include sovereign issuers. Sovereign issuers are not necessarily an area that there is a lot of profitability on. But even so, the total issuance in Asia, for the first time, outgrew the total issuance in the U.S. In the U.S., as you know, the issuance was down overall in corporates at 7%, financial institutions was down. While in Asia, the corporates were up 32% and financial institutions were up 84%. So the -- it was a combination of our sales approach, our relationship management approach, more penetration and looking at how we're working on contracts, and then very importantly, the volume in Asia."

We have a project to simplify our workflow. We've been investing in technology to simplify our workflow. That also brings with it a combination of better control, better process management and then also, in many cases, lower expenses. So on that side, we're having a lot of focus and on the top line, we're looking also at ways to simplify our pricing model to revisit our contracts that we've had with customers for a very long time that provided relationship pricing that were -- that we want to recalibrate to markets where there's much larger issuance. So it's a combination of factors. But the top line growth, some of that has been driven by approach to how we look at our pricing.

We also had some programs where we slowed down some hiring. So some of that's just coming through -- from straight headcount and straight changes to the way that we are managing the business. Those continue to flow through. But one of the major areas, if you recall last year, in the first half of the year, we had the final resolution of some of the disputes and lawsuits we had with the U.S. government in 20 states as well as some private litigation. There had been some residual expenses related to that. And then we'd also been engaged in a full-blown implementation of the Dodd-Frank rules, which kicked in, in June 2015. And in order to implement that, we had engaged some outside help from some consulting firms and risk management experts, et cetera. So those are -- the legal fees related to those had tapered off in the second quarter and then some of those external consulting fees and other advisory fees, those are gone. And so we think that we're approaching a more sustainable level of expenses going forward. Although I would point out that with some of our programs, we do continue to invest in technology, that's critical for us. And as we simplify the business, we will be investing in technology. And here and there, we are going to invest in talent and people. So -- but we do think that some of those extraordinary expenses have been cleaned now -- cleared through."

We have a commitment as well as an operating philosophy across the entire company that we're going to always look for continuous improvement and continuous upside. One of the biggest determinants of our margins are going to also be top line growth. That's one of the reasons that we also have a big focus across the entire company and also in Ratings on commercial activities, which are the things I've mentioned before on needs-based selling, relationship approach to selling, deeper penetration, a broadening customer -- product coverage, looking at contracts, pricing, et cetera. So it's -- it is a combination of how well we do on growing the top line. That is going to have an impact on it and if we can have some of that incremental sales drop to the bottom line, taking advantage of our scale. But I guess, a long answer to your question, but we continue to be committed to driving growth in our margin through continuous improvement both from top line activities as well as finding ways to continue to be more efficient on our cost base as well."

Related to the overall issuance markets going forward, as you know, from what we just gave you, we do see that there is going to be a reduction in the overall issuance for 2016. But if you look forward further, and you look at the 2016 to 2000 -- looking out forward to 2020 or so, there's 2 factors we're looking at. One of them is total debt markets, including bank loans, which we don't necessarily rate. The market is large. We think it's going to grow by trillions of dollars. In fact, there could -- it could expand over the next 5 years to a $73 trillion market, including a large increase in China. We do think that there is an increase in the combination of refinancing as well as new financing going into that. We are targeting through all of our businesses, in Market Intelligence, couple of businesses there, and then also in ratings, more and more penetration of loan markets and through models and things like that. So we look at the size of the markets and how they're growing longer term than just the next quarter. Over the rest of the year though, we do think that there is a large amount of debt maturing between now and 2021. The issuance -- the maturations over the rest of the year are actually not that strong. That's why we see the full year down about 3.8%. We're concerned about the Brexit. What kind of impact that might have on issuance. U.S. interest rates and global interest rate outlooks are -- have been quite volatile in that they're changing all the time. So in the short run, we usually expect possible volatility as you've seen. If you track this business quarterly, issuance can go up and down. But with a very long run, 5-year view, we see some very large numbers of $73 trillion overall corporate debt market, which includes bank loans and then through 2021, $10.3 trillion in debt maturing, that's actually publicly issued debt. So we do see that there is a lot of activity. We're trying to build our business around this and trying to expand it beyond just being a single ratings approach to market looking at bank loan ratings, RES, different types of loan evaluation services, et cetera. So this is a big area for us to focus our strategy going forward."

It's -- that is probably -- I'm giving you an unscientific answer, but if I were going to look at what are -- what's one of the most important correlations to overall volume as well as activity, it has to do with the price of oil. As you know, as we dropped into a very low oil price early this year, even though it's recovered somewhat, there were a lot of -- people had exited the industry. You had a large increase in defaults and bankruptcies in the U.S., in particular, in different types of oil businesses. So probably getting a higher price of oil is -- would be the largest factor that could bump up growth to the double-digit range, if that was still possible. We have still been growing quite steadily in the mid-single -- mid- to high single-digit range despite this because there's still such a demand for information and for our prices to be embedded in different kinds of contracts.

That's an area that we've been spending a lot of time on structurally as well as strategically. The industry itself is going through a massive amount of change with Barclays having changed hands, with ICE having bought IDC, with what's happening in Europe with the exchange transaction going on there and interest of fixed income investments around the world as well as all of the main asset managers, large global asset managers, looking at so much change in volatility in the shape of the fixed income markets, especially with pricing and liquidity concerns creeping in. We think it's an area that it's -- it will continue to develop. We think there will be more and more ETF products and target date products, retirement products, et cetera, that are developed over the years. We would like to play in that. We're off to a good start with our dialogue with asset managers and with ultimate distributors about these types of products and services. We have a core set of indices around S&P 500 as well as some other fixed income indices. We have about $40 billion right now in AUMs in the fixed income index space. We are looking at all different ways to grow the business, whether it would be continuing to grow and penetrate with what we already have and what we're developing as well as looking at the different properties that pop up for sale and whether or not they could be valuable to be added to our portfolio if the price is attractive as well as if the capabilities they bring are attractive. So continues to be an important potential growth area for us. And we do have dedicated resources to seeing how we can grow in this area.
Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. With that, let me conclude the call. I -- I'm pleased that we had another strong quarter. The financial performance is excellent, ending up with an EPS growth of 17% and year-to-date cash flow $513 million, et cetera, is all something that we're very pleased that we've been able to achieve. But let me end the call again by thanking Jack Callahan. He's been a great partner, and he's heading off to Yale University, and they're going to get the benefit of his experience and expertise. So thank you, Jack. We wish you all the best. Thanks everyone."
