Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Senior Director of Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2015 performance, followed by our outlook for 2016. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our sales and earnings results for the fourth quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite a highly promotional holiday selling environment. 
Additionally, we faced our most challenging sales comparisons from the prior year. Our results were driven by the competitive values we offered on a wide assortment of name-brand bargains and gifts throughout our store. 
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew 10% to $0.66 on net earnings that rose 6% to $264 million. 
Sales for the quarter increased 7% to $3,251,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of last year's 6% gain. 
For the 2015 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 14% to $2.51 on top of strong multi-year increases. Net earnings rose 10% to $1,021,000,000, with comparable sales up 4% for the year.
 dd's DISCOUNTS also posted better-than-expected gain in sales and operating profit for both the quarter and year. As customers continue to respond positively to their value offering. 
Sportswear was the best-performing merchandise category at Ross for the fourth quarter, while the Midwest was the strongest region. 
Our fourth quarter operating margin of 12.7% was down from last year as improved merchandise margins and strong expense control were more than offset by the timing of packaway-related costs. 
For the full year, however, we are pleased that operating margin increased 10 basis points to a record 13.6%. 
As we ended 2015, total consolidated inventories were up 3% over the prior year with packaway levels of 47% of total inventory compared to 45% last year. 
Average in-store inventories were down approximately 2% at year-end. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for a total price of $170 million. 
For the full year, we repurchased 13.7 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million. We expect to complete the $700 million remaining under our current 2-year, $1.4 billion program by the end of fiscal 2016. 
As noted in today's release, our board recently approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.135 per share, up 15% on top of an 18% increase last year. The continued growth of our shareholder payouts reflects our ongoing confidence in the company's ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. 
We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and return. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2015 results and details on our fiscal 2016 full year and first quarter guidance."

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. 
As Barbara mentioned, while full year operating margin was up 10 basis points compared to last year, fourth quarter operating margin declined 45 basis points to 12.7%. 
Cost of goods sold increased 75 basis points in the quarter, driven by 100 basis points of higher distribution expenses due to the timing of packaway-related costs that benefited earnings earlier in the year. Freight and buying expenses also rose 15 and 5 basis points, respectively. 
These increases were partially offset by merchandise margin improvement of 35 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points of lower occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 30 basis points, benefiting from strong cost control and leverage on the 4% comparable store sales increase. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was lower-than-expected due to the passage of federal tax credit legislation and also the favorable resolution of a state tax matter. 
Let's turn now to our guidance for the upcoming quarter and year. Earnings per share for fiscal 2016 are forecast to be in the range of $2.59 to $2.71, up 3% to 8% from $2.51 in fiscal 2015. 
The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2016 include the following: Total sales are forecast to grow 4% to 5% on a comparable store sales increase of 1% to 2%. We expect to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. 
If same-store sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, then we would project operating margin for 2016 to be 13.5% to 13.7%. This forecast calls for a slight increase in merchandise margin that would offset some deleveraging on operating costs. Net interest expense is estimated to be $17 million, our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $395 million. 
Capital expenditures in 2016 are projected to be approximately $425 million, and depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $385 million, up from $346 million in 2015. 
Lastly, our guidance includes our plans to raise the minimum wage for eligible hourly associates to $10 per hour in the second quarter of 2016, up from the current $9 minimum. 
These wage adjustments will help keep us competitive in our hiring practices and enhance our ability to retain talented associates to provide the shopping experience our customers have come to expect. 
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. We are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% and earnings per share to be flat to up 4% at $0.69 to $0.72. 
Following are the assumption that support this range. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%, we expect to open 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. 
First quarter operating margin is projected to be 15.0% to 15.2% compared to last year's 15.7%. The forecasted decline is mainly from the timing of packaway-related costs that benefited the first quarter last year and also the impact of a new distribution center that opened in the second quarter of 2015. 
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $4.5 million, our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38% to 39%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around 400 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

We are very pleased with our strong performance in 2015 as we were, once again, are able to convert our better-than-expected revenue gains into solid double-digit earnings per share growth. These results are due to the resilience of our off-price business model and our testament to the talented people we have throughout our organization. They have demonstrated, once again, their ability to deliver compelling bargains to our customers, which will always be the key to success in our business. 
As we move into 2016, we are well positioned to take advantage of the best opportunities in the marketplace. However, we continue to face our own challenging multi-year sales and earnings comparison. And with the increasing, uncertain and volatile macroeconomic climate, it doesn't appear that the retail landscape will get any less competitive or promotional in 2016. 
So while we hope to do better, we believe it's prudent to maintain a conservative posture when forecasting our business for this year. 
As we look ahead over the longer term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver average annual earnings per share gain in the low double-digit percentage range. This view is rooted in our belief that the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail, especially given consumers' ongoing focus on values. 
Equally important is our proven ability over time to maximize our favorable industry position by delivering the exceptional values our customers have come to expect. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

What we usually see on the comp curve is over the first 5 years, we comp faster than the chain, and we settle in to about the chain average in year 5. Overall, we'll put about $1.5 million of capital and working capital to a store and the payback is about 2 years."

And as we went through the budget for this year, we look to lots of different areas that we could go after to try and capture efficiencies and offset some of those increased expenses, increased wage expenses. There wasn't one big silver bullet, there were lots and lots of small saving initiatives that will add up to a lot, and it's all the things you should expect. Some of them, reengineering processes in the stores to better utilize labor hours. There's also things like looking for savings in terms of services and supplies that we purchase from the outside, looking for higher productivity in our DCs, looking for opportunities to trim non-merchant G&A. There are a whole bunch of, I would say, relatively small savings opportunities that add up to a lot and have allowed us to cover the freight rate increase that  Michael Hartshorn mentioned earlier."

So we're just going through the same process we normally go through. So when we went out and there were goods available, we went to see if we thought it met the criteria where we thought we are going. And in some places, you're assuming that the vendors have merchandise they're going to move on the price, right? So sometimes, vendors move on the price based on their variance, it's the end of the quarter, it's the end of a half. So there's a lot of variables that we can't control. The only thing I can say is that we bought what we thought was appropriate. We ended with 47% versus 45%. We feel comfortable with that number and ultimately, we're only going to buy what we think is the right price. Your packaway is very hard to nail down in a quarter, in the POM, there has to be -- there is some our to buying packaway. You have to feel comfortable that after you put that in there, when you go to bring that out, whether it's 4 months later, 8 months later, 6 months later, depending on the product that the value is right. So there's a lot of variables that we can't determine as we're out in the marketplace, but that's really what the buyers do everyday of the week. So that was really our assessment in the fourth quarter of how we sell about packaway. Now whether vendors will move off the price as we get further into the next season, maybe, maybe some people will hold inventory over. I can't answer those question for the vendors. I can only answer what we feel comfortable in doing, which is same thing we've done every season."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2015 performance, followed by our outlook for 2016. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our sales and earnings results for the fourth quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite the highly promotional holiday selling environment. Additionally, we faced our most challenging sales comparisons from the prior year. Our results were driven by the competitive values we offered on a wide assortment of name-brand bargains and gifts throughout our stores. 
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew 10% to $0.66 on net earnings that rose 6% to $264 million. Sales for the quarter increased 7% to $3,251,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of last year's 6% gain. For the 2015 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 14% to $2.51 on top of strong multiyear increases. Net earnings rose 10% to $1,021,000,000, with comparable sales up 4% for the year.
dd's DISCOUNTS also posted better-than-expected gains in sales and operating profit for both the quarter and year, as customers continued to respond positively to their value offering. missy sportswear was the best-performing merchandise category at Ross for the fourth quarter while the Midwest was the strongest region. 
Our fourth quarter operating margin of 12.7% was down from last year as improved merchandise margins and strong expense control were more than offset by the timing of packaway-related costs. For the full year, however, we are pleased that operating margin increased 10 basis points to a record 13.6%. As we ended 2015, total consolidated inventories were up 3% over the prior year, with packaway levels at 47% of total inventories compared to 45% last year. Average in-store inventories were down approximately 2% at year-end. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for a total price of $170 million. For the full year, we repurchased 13.7 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million. We expect to complete the $700 million remaining under our current 2-year $1.4 billion program by the end of fiscal 2016. As noted in today's release, our board recently approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.135 per share, up 15% on top of an 18% increase last year. 
The continued growth of our shareholder payouts reflects our ongoing confidence in the company's ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and return. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2015 results and details on our fiscal 2016 full year and first quarter guidance."

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, while full year operating margin was up 10 basis points compared to last year, fourth quarter operating margin declined 45 basis points to 12.7%. 
Cost of goods sold increased 75 basis points in the quarter, driven by 100 basis points of higher distribution expenses due to the timing of packaway-related costs that benefited earnings earlier in the year. Freight and buying expenses also rose 15 and 5 basis points, respectively. These increases were partially offset by merchandise margin improvement of 35 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points of lower occupancy costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 30 basis points, benefiting from strong cost control and leverage on the 4% comparable store sales increase. Our tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected due to the passage of federal tax credit legislation and also the favorable resolution of a state tax matter. 
Let's turn now to our guidance for the upcoming quarter and year. Earnings per share for fiscal 2016 are forecast to be in the range of $2.59 to $2.71, up 3% to 8% from $2.51 in fiscal 2015. The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2016 include the following. Total sales are forecast to grow 4% to 5% on a comparable store sales increase of 1% to 2%. We expect to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. 
If same-store sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, then we would project operating margin for 2016 to be 13.5% to 13.7%. This forecast calls for a slight increase in merchandise margins that would offset some deleveraging on operating costs. Net interest expense is estimated to be $17 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 395 million. Capital expenditures in 2016 are projected to be approximately $425 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $385 million, up from $346 million in 2015. 
Lastly, our guidance includes our plans to raise the minimum wage for eligible hourly associates to $10 per hour in the second quarter of 2016, up from the current $9 minimum.  These wage adjustments will help keep us competitive in our hiring practices and enhance our ability to retain talented associates to provide the shopping experience our customers have come to expect. 
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. We are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% and earnings per share to be flat to up 4% at $0.69 to $0.72. 
Following are the assumptions that support this range. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. 
First quarter operating margin is projected to be 15.0% to 15.2% compared to last year's 15.7%. The forecasted decline is mainly from the timing of packaway-related costs that benefited the first quarter last year and also the impact of a new distribution center that opened in the second quarter of 2015. 
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $4.5 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38% to 39%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around 400 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

We are very pleased with our strong performance in 2015 as we were once again able to convert our better-than-expected revenue gains into solid double-digit earnings per share growth. These results are due to the resilience of our off-price business model and are a testament to the talented people we have throughout our organization. They have demonstrated once again their ability to deliver compelling bargains to our customers, which will always be the key to success in our business. 
As we move into 2016, we are well positioned to take advantage of the best opportunities in the marketplace. However, we continue to face our own challenging multiyear sales and earnings comparison. And with the increasing uncertain and volatile macroeconomic climate, it doesn't appear that the retail landscape will get any less competitive or promotional in 2016. So while we hope to do better, we believe it's prudent to maintain a conservative posture when forecasting our business for this year. 
As we look ahead over the longer term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver average annual earnings per share gain in the low double-digit percentage range. This view is rooted in our belief that the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail, especially given consumers' ongoing focus on values. Equally important is our proven ability over time to maximize our favorable industry position by delivering the exceptional values our customers have come to expect.

There wasn't one big silver bullet. There were lots and lots of small savings initiatives that will add up to a lot, and it's all the things you'd expect. Some of them are reengineering processes in the stores to better utilize labor hours. But there's also things like looking for savings in terms of services and supplies that we purchase from the outside, looking for higher productivity in our DCs, looking for opportunities to trim non-merchant G&A.

And so as we enter into the spring season, one would expect that there would be a bubble of inventory that we would see in spring, which we could use to fuel the spring. And back to your point on packaway, that would help us drive through packaway. So it's relative to how department stores plan. It's relative to how the vendors plan with department stores and how much risk they're willing to take. So we do feel there are trends -- there will be opportunities in the marketplace.

So we're just going through the same process we normally go through. So when we went out, and there were goods available, we went to see if we thought it met the criteria where we thought we are going. And in some places, you're assuming that the vendors have merchandise they're going to move on in price, right? So sometimes, vendors move on the price based off of their needs. It's the end of a quarter, the end of a half. So there's a lot of variables that we can't control. The only thing I can say is that we bought what we thought was appropriate. We ended with 47% versus 45%. We feel comfortable with that number and ultimately, we're only going to buy what we think is the right price. And your packaway's very hard to nail down. In a quarter, in the OM, there has to be -- there is some art to buying packaway. You have to feel comfortable that after you put that in there, and when you go to bring that out, whether it's 4 months later, 8 months later, 6 months later, depending on the product, that the value is right. So there's a lot of variables that we can't determine as we're out in the marketplace, but that's really what the buyers do every day of the week. So that was really our assessment in the fourth quarter of how we felt about packaway. Now whether vendors will move off the price as we get further into the next season, maybe, maybe some people will hold inventory over. I can't answer those questions for the vendors. I can only answer what we feel comfortable in doing, which is same thing we've done every season."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2015 performance, followed by our outlook for 2016. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our sales and earnings results for the fourth quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite the highly promotional holiday selling environment. Additionally, we faced our most challenging sales comparisons from the prior year. Our results were driven by the competitive values we offered on a wide assortment of name-brand bargains and gifts throughout our stores. 
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew 10% to $0.66 on net earnings that rose 6% to $264 million. Sales for the quarter increased 7% to $3,251,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of last year's 6% gain. For the 2015 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 14% to $2.51 on top of strong multiyear increases. Net earnings rose 10% to $1,021,000,000, with comparable sales up 4% for the year.
dd's DISCOUNTS also posted better-than-expected gains in sales and operating profit for both the quarter and year, as customers continued to respond positively to their value offering. missy sportswear was the best-performing merchandise category at Ross for the fourth quarter while the Midwest was the strongest region. 
Our fourth quarter operating margin of 12.7% was down from last year as improved merchandise margins and strong expense control were more than offset by the timing of packaway-related costs. For the full year, however, we are pleased that operating margin increased 10 basis points to a record 13.6%. As we ended 2015, total consolidated inventories were up 3% over the prior year, with packaway levels at 47% of total inventories compared to 45% last year. Average in-store inventories were down approximately 2% at year-end. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for a total price of $170 million. For the full year, we repurchased 13.7 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million. We expect to complete the $700 million remaining under our current 2-year $1.4 billion program by the end of fiscal 2016. As noted in today's release, our board recently approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.135 per share, up 15% on top of an 18% increase last year. 
The continued growth of our shareholder payouts reflects our ongoing confidence in the company's ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and return. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2015 results and details on our fiscal 2016 full year and first quarter guidance."

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, while full year operating margin was up 10 basis points compared to last year, fourth quarter operating margin declined 45 basis points to 12.7%. 
Cost of goods sold increased 75 basis points in the quarter, driven by 100 basis points of higher distribution expenses due to the timing of packaway-related costs that benefited earnings earlier in the year. Freight and buying expenses also rose 15 and 5 basis points, respectively. These increases were partially offset by merchandise margin improvement of 35 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points of lower occupancy costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 30 basis points, benefiting from strong cost control and leverage on the 4% comparable store sales increase. Our tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected due to the passage of federal tax credit legislation and also the favorable resolution of a state tax matter. 
Let's turn now to our guidance for the upcoming quarter and year. Earnings per share for fiscal 2016 are forecast to be in the range of $2.59 to $2.71, up 3% to 8% from $2.51 in fiscal 2015. The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2016 include the following. Total sales are forecast to grow 4% to 5% on a comparable store sales increase of 1% to 2%. We expect to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. 
If same-store sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, then we would project operating margin for 2016 to be 13.5% to 13.7%. This forecast calls for a slight increase in merchandise margins that would offset some deleveraging on operating costs. Net interest expense is estimated to be $17 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 395 million. Capital expenditures in 2016 are projected to be approximately $425 million, and depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $385 million, up from $346 million in 2015. 
Lastly, our guidance includes our plans to raise the minimum wage for eligible hourly associates to $10 per hour in the second quarter of 2016, up from the current $9 minimum.  These wage adjustments will help keep us competitive in our hiring practices and enhance our ability to retain talented associates to provide the shopping experience our customers have come to expect. 
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. We are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% and earnings per share to be flat to up 4% at $0.69 to $0.72. 
Following are the assumptions that support this range. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. 
First quarter operating margin is projected to be 15.0% to 15.2% compared to last year's 15.7%. The forecasted decline is mainly from the timing of packaway-related costs that benefited the first quarter last year and also the impact of a new distribution center that opened in the second quarter of 2015. 
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $4.5 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38% to 39%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around 400 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

We are very pleased with our strong performance in 2015 as we were once again able to convert our better-than-expected revenue gains into solid double-digit earnings per share growth. These results are due to the resilience of our off-price business model and are a testament to the talented people we have throughout our organization. They have demonstrated once again their ability to deliver compelling bargains to our customers, which will always be the key to success in our business. 
As we move into 2016, we are well positioned to take advantage of the best opportunities in the marketplace. However, we continue to face our own challenging multiyear sales and earnings comparison. And with the increasing uncertain and volatile macroeconomic climate, it doesn't appear that the retail landscape will get any less competitive or promotional in 2016. So while we hope to do better, we believe it's prudent to maintain a conservative posture when forecasting our business for this year. 
As we look ahead over the longer term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver average annual earnings per share gain in the low double-digit percentage range. This view is rooted in our belief that the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail, especially given consumers' ongoing focus on values. Equally important is our proven ability over time to maximize our favorable industry position by delivering the exceptional values our customers have come to expect.

But it's not about how you plan it, it's really about the sales that materialize and the rate at which you spend your receipt money. So as you look at where the department stores ended in January, most of them ended with more inventory and, clearly, ended with more clearance. And so as we enter into the spring season, one would expect that there would be a bubble of inventory that we would see in spring, which we could use to fuel the spring. And back to your point on packaway, that would help us drive through packaway. So it's relative to how department stores plan. It's relative to how the vendors plan with department stores and how much risk they're willing to take. So we do feel there are trends -- there will be opportunities in the marketplace. As long as traditional retailers continue to perform the way they're performing, you would think that there'll be more opportunities there. So from that perspective on the supply side, we feel good, which is why we're keeping ourselves liquid and feel we're well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace."

We've kind of been in a pattern here with dd's, with better than expected gains in sales and profits over -- a few years now. So we opened just over 20 new dd's stores a year, which on a base of 170 stores, is quite a big growth rate. So I don't think you should expect that we're going to ramp that up significantly, maybe in a given year, it could go up to 25, but it's not going to increase dramatically. Our history, as you know, because you've been following us for a long time, is that we're relatively conservative as we grow our business, as we've grown Ross, and we'll apply the same thinking as we grow dd's.

So we're just going through the same process we normally go through. So when we went out, and there were goods available, we went to see if we thought it met the criteria where we thought we are going. And in some places, you're assuming that the vendors have merchandise they're going to move on in price, right? So sometimes, vendors move on the price based off of their needs. It's the end of a quarter, the end of a half. So there's a lot of variables that we can't control. The only thing I can say is that we bought what we thought was appropriate. We ended with 47% versus 45%. We feel comfortable with that number and ultimately, we're only going to buy what we think is the right price. And your packaway's very hard to nail down. In a quarter, in the OM, there has to be -- there is some art to buying packaway. You have to feel comfortable that after you put that in there, and when you go to bring that out, whether it's 4 months later, 8 months later, 6 months later, depending on the product, that the value is right. So there's a lot of variables that we can't determine as we're out in the marketplace, but that's really what the buyers do every day of the week. So that was really our assessment in the fourth quarter of how we felt about packaway. Now whether vendors will move off the price as we get further into the next season, maybe, maybe some people will hold inventory over. I can't answer those questions for the vendors.

We will begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. After which, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
Earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.73 or a 6% gain on top of a robust 19% increase in the prior year period. Net earnings for the quarter were $291 million, up from $282 million last year. Sales increased 5% to $3,089,000,000, with comparable store sales up 2% on top of a strong 5% gain in the first quarter of 2015. 
Despite facing our strongest prior year comparisons, along with merchandising execution issues in ladies' apparel, sales performed at the high end of guidance, while earnings per share were slightly above our targeted range. 
During the quarter, home and shoes were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross while ladies' apparel underperformed. 
Geographically, the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic were the strongest region. Although our first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down from last year, it was slightly above plans, mainly due to higher merchandise margins that partially offset the expected impact from the unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses. 
As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were flat versus the prior year with average in-store inventories down slightly. 
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% at this time last year. 
Both sales and operating profit at dd's DISCOUNTS were better-than-expected in the first quarter as customers continue to respond positively to the dd's value offering. 
Our store expansion program remains on track as we opened 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We continue to expect to add a total of 90 new locations in 2016 comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plan to close or relocate about 10 older stores during the year. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

As Barbara mentioned, first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down 30 basis points from last year, which was better than our guidance for a 50 to 70 basis point decline. 
Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the quarter, mainly due to a 55 basis point increase in distribution expenses from the expected impact of a new distribution center we opened in the second quarter of last year as well as the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs that benefited this period in 2015. 
These expense pressures were partially offset by merchandise margins that rose a better-than-expected 35 basis points and 10 basis points in lower-volume costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points due to a combination of deleverage from the 2% increase in comparable store sales and also higher wages. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $176 million. This keeps us on track to buy back as planned a total of $700 million in stock for the year, which will complete the 2-year, $1.4 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2015. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. We continue to forecast same-store sales for the 13 weeks ending July 30, 2016 to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in the second quarter of 2015, with earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.67 compared to $0.63 last year. 
Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions: Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 31 new stores during the period, including 24 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. 
Second quarter operating margin is projected to be relatively flat at 13.8% to 14.0% compared to last year's 13.9%. 
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38% to 39% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 397 million. 
Based on our first quarter results and the second quarter guidance, we now project fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.72 compared to $2.51 last year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

As mentioned earlier, even though we faced our toughest prior year comparison and comparable store sales came in at the high end of guidance, with earnings per share performing slightly above our targeted range, we feel we should have done better. 
In hindsight, we now know that we had some merchandise execution issues at ladies' apparel during the quarter that are now in the process of being addressed. 
Looking ahead, we have plenty of open-to-buy, which gives our merchants the ability to select the best values from the large volume across available in the marketplace today. 
Seeing this position will enable us to offer customers even more fresh and exciting new bargains as we move through the second quarter and the balance of 2016. 
As always, providing customers with most compelling name brand value as possible is the key driver of both our short and long-term success.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We will begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
Earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.73 or a 6% gain on top of a robust 19% increase in the prior year period. Net earnings for the quarter were $291 million, up from $282 million last year. Sales increased 5% to $3,089,000,000, with comparable store sales up 2% on top of a strong 5% gain in the first quarter of 2015.
Despite facing our strongest prior year comparisons, along with merchandising execution issues in ladies' apparel, sales performed at the high end of guidance, while earnings per share were slightly above our targeted range.
During the quarter, home and shoes were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross, while ladies' apparel underperformed.
Geographically, the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic were the strongest regions. Although our first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down from last year, it was slightly above plan, mainly due to higher merchandise margins that partially offset the expected impact from the unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.
As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were flat versus the prior year, with average in-store inventories down slightly.
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% at this time last year.
Both sales and operating profit at dd's DISCOUNTS were better-than-expected in the first quarter, as customers continue to respond positively to dd's value offering.
Our store expansion program remains on track as we opened 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We continue to expect to add a total of 90 new locations in 2016 comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores during the year.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 2% comparable store sales gain was driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down 30 basis points from last year, which was better than our guidance for a 50 to 70 basis point decline.
Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the quarter, mainly due to a 55 basis point increase in distribution expenses from the expected impact of a new distribution center we opened in the second quarter of last year as well as the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs that benefited this period in 2015.
These expense pressures were partially offset by merchandise margins that rose a better-than-expected 35 basis points and 10 basis points in lower-volume costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points due to a combination of deleverage from the 2% increase in comparable store sales and also higher wages.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $176 million. This keeps us on track to buy back as planned a total of $700 million in stock for the year, which will complete the 2-year, $1.4-billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2015.
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. We continue to forecast same-store sales for the 13 weeks ending July 30, 2016, to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in the second quarter of 2015, with earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.67 compared to $0.63 last year.
Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 31 new stores during the period, including 24 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations.
Second quarter operating margin is projected to be relatively flat at 13.8% to 14.0% compared to last year's 13.9%.
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38% to 39%,  and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 397 million.
Based on our first quarter results and the second quarter guidance, we now project fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.72 compared to $2.51 last year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Seeing this position will enable us to offer customers even more fresh and exciting new bargains as we move through the second quarter and the balance of 2016.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We will begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
Earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.73 or a 6% gain on top of a robust 19% increase in the prior year period. Net earnings for the quarter were $291 million, up from $282 million last year. Sales increased 5% to $3,089,000,000, with comparable store sales up 2% on top of a strong 5% gain in the first quarter of 2015.
Despite facing our strongest prior year comparisons, along with merchandising execution issues in ladies' apparel, sales performed at the high end of guidance, while earnings per share were slightly above our targeted range.
During the quarter, home and shoes were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross, while ladies' apparel underperformed.
Geographically, the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic were the strongest regions. Although our first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down from last year, it was slightly above plan, mainly due to higher merchandise margins that partially offset the expected impact from the unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.
As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were flat versus the prior year, with average in-store inventories down slightly.
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% at this time last year.
Both sales and operating profits at dd's DISCOUNTS were better-than-expected in the first quarter, as customers continued to respond positively to dd's value offering.
Our store expansion program remains on track as we opened 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We continue to expect to add a total of 90 new locations in 2016 comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores during the year.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 2% comparable store sales gain was driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down 30 basis points from last year, which was better than our guidance for a 50 to 70 basis point decline.
Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the quarter, mainly due to a 55 basis point increase in distribution expenses from the expected impact of a new distribution center we opened in the second quarter of last year as well as the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs that benefited this period in 2015.
These expense pressures were partially offset by merchandise margins that rose a better-than-expected 35 basis points and 10 basis points in lower-volume costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points due to a combination of deleverage from the 2% increase in comparable store sales and also higher wages.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $176 million. This keeps us on track to buy back as planned a total of $700 million in stock for the year, which will complete the 2-year, $1.4-billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2015.
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. We continue to forecast same-store sales for the 13 weeks ending July 30, 2016, to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in the second quarter of 2015, with earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.67 compared to $0.63 last year.
Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 31 new stores during the period, including 24 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations.
Second quarter operating margin is projected to be relatively flat at 13.8% to 14.0% compared to last year's 13.9%.
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38% to 39%,  and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $397 million.
Based on our first quarter results and the second quarter guidance, we now project fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.72 compared to $2.51 last year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

In hindsight, we now know that we had some merchandise execution issues in ladies' apparel during the quarter that are now in the process of being addressed.
Looking ahead, we have plenty of open-to-buy, which gives our merchants the ability to select the best values from the large volume of product  available in the marketplace today. 
Seeing this position will enable us to offer customers even more fresh and exciting new bargains as we move through the second quarter and the balance of 2016.
As always, providing customers with the most compelling name brand values possible is the key driver of both our short- and long-term success.

Maybe Michael Hartshorn will respond on the expectations we met for reductions throughout the rest of the year. But in terms of some of the issues you raised like gas prices, wages, et cetera, I mean our business is always affected by sort of external variables and when we came into the year, we did -- we raised some about concerns about the economic in the consumer outlook. It's difficult, as you say, parse out those different components and quantify their impact. What I would say though is that I think we've always acknowledged that our performance is more than anything driven by our own execution. So although many of those things that you mentioned were important in Q1, I think our own execution was most important thing. That's why Barbara called it out in her comments."

We will begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
Earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.73 or a 6% gain on top of a robust 19% increase in the prior year period. Net earnings for the quarter were $291 million, up from $282 million last year. Sales increased 5% to $3,089,000,000, with comparable store sales up 2% on top of a strong 5% gain in the first quarter of 2015.
Despite facing our strongest prior year comparisons, along with merchandising execution issues in ladies' apparel, sales performed at the high end of guidance, while earnings per share were slightly above our targeted range.
During the quarter, home and shoes were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross, while ladies' apparel underperformed.
Geographically, the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic were the strongest regions. Although our first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down from last year, it was slightly above plan, mainly due to higher merchandise margins that partially offset the expected impact from the unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.
As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were flat versus the prior year, with average in-store inventories down slightly.
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% at this time last year.
Both sales and operating profits at dd's DISCOUNTS were better-than-expected in the first quarter, as customers continued to respond positively to dd's value offering.
Our store expansion program remains on track as we opened 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We continue to expect to add a total of 90 new locations in 2016 comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores during the year.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 2% comparable store sales gain was driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down 30 basis points from last year, which was better than our guidance for a 50 to 70 basis point decline.
Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the quarter, mainly due to a 55 basis point increase in distribution expenses from the expected impact of a new distribution center we opened in the second quarter of last year as well as the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs that benefited this period in 2015.
These expense pressures were partially offset by merchandise margins that rose a better-than-expected 35 basis points and 10 basis points in lower-volume costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points due to a combination of deleverage from the 2% increase in comparable store sales and also higher wages.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $176 million. This keeps us on track to buy back as planned a total of $700 million in stock for the year, which will complete the 2-year, $1.4-billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2015.
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. We continue to forecast same-store sales for the 13 weeks ending July 30, 2016, to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in the second quarter of 2015, with earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.67 compared to $0.63 last year.
Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 31 new stores during the period, including 24 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations.
Second quarter operating margin is projected to be relatively flat at 13.8% to 14.0% compared to last year's 13.9%.
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38% to 39%,  and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 397 million.
Based on our first quarter results and the second quarter guidance, we now project fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.72 compared to $2.51 last year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Texas was above the chain average on top of a strong performance last year when it was also above the chain average. And then Florida, trailed the chain average.

And then maybe if I could just look a little bit longer term, I want to think about maybe 2017, if we just take a look at inventory in the past 9 months in the channel, the department stores have really missed their business plans by a significant amount. We can already see in your comps, in the fourth quarter, you benefited from that. I think you just had first quarter, sounds like inventory is fairly wonderful. But if we assume a more rational inventory ordering pattern from the department stores heading into this holiday and also fairly common theme from the brands like PVH and Ralph Lauren, lately that their big corporate strategies are to slow, inventory flows into the department stores going forward. Do you have maybe a good point history you could point to and say, ""Here's what year like 2017 might look like as we lap a period of very favorable inventory situation?"""

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, both sales and earnings results in the second quarter were ahead of our forecast. Earnings per share for the period were $0.71, up 13% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in the second half. Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $282 million compared to $259 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 7% to $3,181,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. Prior merchandise gross margin during the second quarter drove a 50 basis point increase in operating margin to 14.4%. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2016, earnings per share were $1.44, up 9% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $573 million, up from $541 million in last year's first half. Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $6,270,000,000, with a comparable store sales up 3% versus a 5% gain in the prior year period. dd's DISCOUNTS again posted better-than-expected gains in both sales and profits for the quarter as customers continue to respond positively through their merchandise offerings. During the quarter, California and the Midwest were the strongest regions, while shoes and home were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross. We also made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses where we struggled during spring season. As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down 1%. Packaway, as a percent of total inventories, was 47% compared to 46% at this time last year. Turning to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track as 24 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS opened in the second quarter. For the full year, we continued to plan for a total of 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS location. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plan to close or relocate a handful of stores. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin was better-than-expected,",477,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin was better-than-expected, increasing 50 basis points from last year to 14.4%. Cost of goods sold improved 60 basis points in the quarter, driven by 45 basis point increase in merchandise margin and distribution and buying cost that were lower by 10 and 5 basis points, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 10 basis points due mainly to higher wages. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.2 million shares for an aggregate price of $352 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year to complete the 2-year, $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 29, 2016, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 3% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.55 versus $0.53 in last year's third quarter. For the fourth quarter ending January 28, 2017, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.66 last year. The difference in earnings per share growth between the third and fourth quarters is mainly due to timing of packaway-related costs compared to the prior year. Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS targets. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We're planning to add 25 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. In addition to the previously mentioned timing of packaway-related costs, if same-store sales perform in line with our guidance for a 1% to 2% gain, there would be some deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses. Thus, operating margin is projected to be 11.6% to 11.8% versus 12.1% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4.5 million, our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 394 million. As noted in today's press release, based on our results for the first 6 months and the second half forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 7% to 10% to $2.69 to $2.75 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To sum up, our sales and earnings growth improved from earlier in the year with second quarter results that were above our projections. As we briefly mentioned, we have made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses where we struggled during the spring season. However, we know we still have more work to do in this very important area, so as we move into the second half and beyond, we will continue to place additional emphasis on further improving our merchandise offerings in this business. We are well positioned with plenty of open-to-buy in order to take advantage of the large availability of products in the marketplace today. Not only in ladies' apparel, but throughout the store. This flexibility will allow us to offer plenty of appealing fashions and compelling bargains to our customers. That said, we still face an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic political and retail environment. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to manage our business conservatively over the balance of the year.

The short-term impact is when a retailer goes out of business or when they close stores, that just adds to the promotional environment. And as Barbara mentioned in her earlier remarks, we're kind of assuming the back half of the year, we'll be selling promotional and those store closures will add to that. In the medium- to long-term though, once those stores have closed, what we've found in the past is that when there's less competition, we have an opportunity to gain share. So longer term, that should be at a benefit now. On the third part of your question about, is there opportunity for space? It all depends on a particular store. I mean, as you know, we're a stripmall retailer, and it will depend upon the size of the store that's being closed, is there an opportunity to chop that up, et cetera. That's something that our real estate group is expert at looking at that. So hard to answer that in terms of specific opportunity."

There's a tremendous amount of availability in the market more than they're normally would be. So in terms of excess from now through fall, I don't think they'll still be any inventory issue. In terms of how promotional they get, I mean, I still believe that, that even with less inventory, there's so many uncertain factors out there, the macroeconomic environment, political environment, even though stores are position perhaps with less inventory than they have last year, that doesn't necessarily mean that sales will materialize. That's kind of remains to be seen. So what we're viewing is that the fourth quarter what Mike Sullivan said as the fourth quarter will be highly promotional and then, I guess, that will determine the additional excess supply that could be there beyond what we're seeing in the marketplace today."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance",456,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, both sales and earnings results in the second quarter were ahead of our forecast. Earnings per share for the period were $0.71, up 13% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in the second half. Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $282 million compared to $259 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 7% to $3,181,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. Higher merchandise gross margin during the second quarter drove a 50 basis point increase in operating margin to 14.4%. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2016, earnings per share were $1.44, up 9% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $573 million, up from $541 million in last year's first half. Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $6,270,000,000, with comparable store sales up 3% versus a 5% gain in the prior year period.. 
Dd's DISCOUNTS again posted better-than-expected gains in both sales and profits for the quarter as customers continue to respond positively to their merchandise offerings. During the quarter, California and the Midwest were the strongest regions, while shoes and home were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross. We also made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses, where we struggled during the spring season. As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down 1%. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 47% compared to 46% at this time last year. 
Turning to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track as 24 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS opened in the second quarter. For the full year, we continued to plan for a total of 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin was better-than-expected,",476,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin was better-than-expected, increasing 50 basis points from last year to 14.4%. Cost of goods sold improved 60 basis points in the quarter, driven by 45 basis point increase in merchandise margin and distribution and buying costs that were lower by 10 and 5 basis points, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 10 basis points due mainly to higher wages. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.2 million shares for an aggregate price of $352 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year to complete the 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. 
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 29, 2016, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 3% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.55 versus $0.53 in last year's third quarter. For the fourth quarter ending January 28, 2017, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.66 last year. The difference in earnings per share growth between the third and fourth quarters is mainly due to timing of packaway-related costs compared to the prior year. 
Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We're planning to add 25 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. In addition to the previously mentioned timing of packaway-related costs, if same-store sales perform in line with our guidance for 1% to 2% gain, there would be some deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses. Thus, operating margin is projected to be 11.6% to 11.8% versus 12.1% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4.5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 394 million. As noted in today's press release, based on our results for the first 6 months and the second half forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 7% to 10% to $2.69 to $2.75 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To sum up, our sales and earnings growth improved from earlier in the year, with second quarter results that were above our projections. As previously mentioned, we have made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses where we struggled during the spring season. However, we know we still have more work to do in this very important area. So as we move into the second half and beyond, we will continue to place additional emphasis on further improving our merchandise offerings in this business. We are well positioned with plenty of open-to-buy in order to take advantage of the large availability of products in the marketplace today, not only in ladies' apparel but throughout the store. This flexibility will allow us to offer plenty of appealing fashions and compelling bargains to our customers. That said, we still face an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic, political and retail environment. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to manage our business conservatively over the balance of the year. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

So longer term, that should be a benefit to that. On the third part of your question about, is there opportunity for space, it all depends on a particular store.

In terms of how promotional they get, I mean, I still believe that, that, even with less inventory, there's so many uncertain factors out there, the macroeconomic environment, political environment, even though stores are positioned perhaps with less inventory than they have last year, that doesn't necessarily mean that, that sales will materialize. So it's kind of remains to be seen. So what we're viewing is that the fourth quarter what Michael O'Sullivan said that the fourth quarter will be highly promotional and then, I guess, that will determine the additional excess supply that could be there beyond what we're seeing in the marketplace today."

And we also know that in some states, some very important states like California, there's already legislation that's passed or close to being passed that's going to set up multiple years of minimum wage increases. So those are things that we're looking at and as part of our budget and longer-term planning process, we'll look for ways to offset some of those minimum wage increases. It will get harder over time.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance",456,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, both sales and earnings results in the second quarter were ahead of our forecast. Earnings per share for the period were $0.71, up 13% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in the second half.
Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $282 million compared to $259 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 7% to $3,181,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. Higher merchandise gross margin during the second quarter drove a 50 basis point increase in operating margin to 14.4%. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2016, earnings per share were $1.44, up 9% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $573 million, up from $541 million in last year's first half. Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $6,270,000,000, with comparable store sales up 3% versus a 5% gain in the prior year period.
dd's DISCOUNTS again posted better-than-expected gains in both sales and profits for the quarter as customers continued to respond positively to their merchandise offerings. During the quarter, California and the Midwest were the strongest regions, while shoes and home were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross. We also made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses, where we struggled during the spring season. As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down 1%. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 47% compared to 46% at this time last year. 
Turning to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track as 24 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS opened in the second quarter. For the full year, we continued to plan for a total of 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin was better than expected,",478,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin was better than expected, increasing 50 basis points from last year to 14.4%. Cost of goods sold improved 60 basis points in the quarter, driven by 45 basis point increase in merchandise margin and distribution and buying costs that were lower by 10 and 5 basis points, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 10 basis points due mainly to higher wages. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.2 million shares for an aggregate price of $352 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year to complete the 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. 
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 29, 2016, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 3% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.55 versus $0.53 in last year's third quarter. For the fourth quarter ending January 28, 2017, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.66 last year. The difference in earnings per share growth between the third and fourth quarters is mainly due to timing of packaway-related costs compared to the prior year. 
Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We're planning to add 25 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. In addition to the previously mentioned timing of packaway-related costs, if same-store sales perform in line with our guidance for 1% to 2% gain, there would be some deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses. Thus, operating margin is projected to be 11.6% to 11.8% versus 12.1% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4.5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 394 million. As noted in today's press release, based on our results for the first 6 months and the second half forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 7% to 10% to $2.69 to $2.75 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To sum up, our sales and earnings growth improved from earlier in the year, with second quarter results that were above our projections. As previously mentioned, we have made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses where we struggled during the spring season. However, we know we still have more work to do in this very important area. So as we move into the second half and beyond, we will continue to place additional emphasis on further improving our merchandise offerings in this business. We are well positioned with plenty of open-to-buy in order to take advantage of the large availability of products in the marketplace today, not only in ladies' apparel but throughout the store. This flexibility will allow us to offer plenty of appealing fashions and compelling bargains to our customers. That said, we still face an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic, political and retail environment. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to manage our business conservatively over the balance of the year. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

And as Barbara mentioned in her earlier remarks, we're kind of assuming that the -- back half of the year will be fairly promotional and those store closures will add to that. In the medium- to long-term though, once those stores have closed, what we've found in the past is that when there's less competition, we have an opportunity to gain share. So longer term, there should be a benefit there. On the third part of your question about, is there opportunity for space, it all depends on a particular store. I mean, as you know, we're a strip mall retailer, and it will depend upon the size of the store that's being closed, is there an opportunity to chop that up, et cetera, and that's something that our real estate group is pretty expert at looking at.

There's a tremendous amount of availability in the market more than their normally would be. So in terms of excess from now through fall, I don't think there'll be any inventory issue. In terms of how promotional they get, I mean, I still believe that, that, even with less inventory, there's so many uncertain factors out there, the macroeconomic environment, political environment, even though stores are positioned perhaps with less inventory than they have last year, that doesn't necessarily mean that, that sales will materialize. So it's kind of remains to be seen.

But our expectation is that there's going doing to be wage pressure in the general economy over the next several years. And we also know that in some states, some very important states like California, there's already legislation that's passed or close to being passed that's going to set up multiple years of minimum wage increases. So those are things that we're looking at and as part of our budget and longer-term planning process, we'll look for ways to offset some of those minimum wage increases. It will get harder over time. I think we've done a good job so far, as Michael Hartshorn said, in absorbing those wage rate increases in the last couple of years. But that's probably a limit to how much we can absorb.

We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, both sales and earnings results in the second quarter were ahead of our forecast. Earnings per share for the period were $0.71, up 13% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in the second half.
Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $282 million compared to $259 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 7% to $3,181,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. Higher merchandise gross margin during the second quarter drove a 50 basis point increase in operating margin to 14.4%. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2016, earnings per share were $1.44, up 9% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $573 million, up from $541 million in last year's first half. Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $6,270,000,000, with comparable store sales up 3% versus a 5% gain in the prior year period.
dd's DISCOUNTS again posted better-than-expected gains in both sales and profits for the quarter as customers continued to respond positively to their merchandise offerings. During the quarter, California and the Midwest were the strongest regions, while shoes and home were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross. We also made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses, where we struggled during the spring season. As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down 1%. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 47% compared to 46% at this time last year. 
Turning to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track as 24 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS opened in the second quarter. For the full year, we continued to plan for a total of 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin was better than expected,",478,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin was better than expected, increasing 50 basis points from last year to 14.4%. Cost of goods sold improved 60 basis points in the quarter, driven by 45 basis point increase in merchandise margin and distribution and buying costs that were lower by 10 and 5 basis points, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 10 basis points due mainly to higher wages. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.2 million shares for an aggregate price of $352 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year to complete the 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. 
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 29, 2016, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 3% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.55 versus $0.53 in last year's third quarter. For the fourth quarter ending January 28, 2017, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.66 last year. The difference in earnings per share growth between the third and fourth quarters is mainly due to timing of packaway-related costs compared to the prior year. 
Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We're planning to add 25 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. In addition to the previously mentioned timing of packaway-related costs, if same-store sales perform in line with our guidance for 1% to 2% gain, there would be some deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses. Thus, operating margin is projected to be 11.6% to 11.8% versus 12.1% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4.5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 394 million. As noted in today's press release, based on our results for the first 6 months and the second half forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 7% to 10% to $2.69 to $2.75 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To sum up, our sales and earnings growth improved from earlier in the year, with second quarter results that were above our projections. As previously mentioned, we have made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses where we struggled during the spring season. However, we know we still have more work to do in this very important area. So as we move into the second half and beyond, we will continue to place additional emphasis on further improving our merchandise offerings in this business. We are well positioned with plenty of open-to-buy in order to take advantage of the large availability of products in the marketplace today, not only in ladies' apparel but throughout the store. This flexibility will allow us to offer plenty of appealing fashions and compelling bargains to our customers. That said, we still face an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic, political and retail environment. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to manage our business conservatively over the balance of the year. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

In the medium- to long-term though, once those stores have closed, what we've found in the past is that when there's less competition, we have an opportunity to gain share. So longer term, there should be a benefit there. On the third part of your question about, is there opportunity for space, it all depends on a particular store. I mean, as you know, we're a strip mall retailer, and it will depend upon the size of the store that's being closed, is there an opportunity to chop that up, et cetera, and that's something that our real estate group is pretty expert at looking at.

There's a tremendous amount of availability in the market more than their normally would be. So in terms of excess from now through fall, I don't think there'll be any inventory issue. In terms of how promotional they get, I mean, I still believe that, that, even with less inventory, there's so many uncertain factors out there, the macroeconomic environment, political environment, even though stores are positioned perhaps with less inventory than they have last year, that doesn't necessarily mean that, that sales will materialize. So it's kind of remains to be seen.

Just trying to get a little bit of a framework for how long this could last and how you think about this, and how you make these decisions."

So Warren, just a little bit of recap in terms of what we've done. Last year, we moved minimum entry wage rate to $9. And as we've mentioned on our previous call this year, we took our minimum hourly rate up to $10 for eligible store associates. But our expectation is that there's going doing to be wage pressure in the general economy over the next several years. And we also know that in some states, some very important states like California, there's already legislation that's passed or close to being passed that's going to set up multiple years of minimum wage increases. So those are things that we're looking at and as part of our budget and longer-term planning process, we'll look for ways to offset some of those minimum wage increases. It will get harder over time. I think we've done a good job so far, as Michael Hartshorn said, in absorbing those wage rate increases in the last couple of years. But that's probably a limit to how much we can absorb. So that's our expectation over the next few years."

We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter, after which, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings growth in the third quarter as customers responded favorably to the compelling values we operate throughout our stores. 
Earnings per share for the period were $0.62, up 17% on top of a robust 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings grew to $245 million compared to $216 million last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.01 per share from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Sales for the third quarter rose 11% to $3.1 billion, with comparable stores sales up 7% versus a 3% gain last year. Operating margin was about plan, growing 55 basis points to 12.6%, driven mainly by higher merchandise margin. 
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, earnings per share were $2.06, up 11% on top of 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $817 million, up from $757 million last year. 
Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $9.4 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015.
 dd's DISCOUNTS continued the year-to-date trend, with strong performance in the third quarter. California was the strongest region during the period while shoes was the best-performing category at Ross. 
Our ladies' apparel business also continued to strengthen as shoppers responded to our improved merchandise assortment. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down slightly. 
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 45% compared to 48% at this time last year. 
As planned, we completed our 2016 store opening programs during the third quarter, with the addition of 25 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS. 
We expect to end fiscal 2016 with 1,338 Ross and 192 dd's DISCOUNTS, an increase of 84 locations for the year. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year."

Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned,",410,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. 
As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, increasing 55 basis points from last year to 12.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points, driven by 50 basis points in higher merchandise margin combined with a 20 basis point decline in occupancy costs. This was partially offset by an increase of 20 basis points in buying expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 5 basis points as leverage on the 7% increase in comparable store sales was partially offset by higher wages and certain other nonrecurring costs. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. 
Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 9.1 million shares for an aggregate price of $530 million. 
We remain on track to spend a total of $700 million for the year to complete the 2-year, $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. While we hope to do better, we are maintaining our same-store sales guidance for a 1% to 2% increase. This range is on top of strong 6% and 4% gains in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We expect earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter to be $0.72 to $0.75, which reflects the impact from the previously mentioned expense timing that benefited the third quarter. 
This updated range compares to earnings per share of $0.66 last year. 
The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%; operating margin is forecast to be 13.2% to 13.4% versus 12.7% in the prior year as we anniversary higher packaway costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 392 million. 
Based on our year-to-date results, along with this fourth quarter forecast, we're now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 11% to 12% to $2.78 to $2.81 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

There might be some incremental opportunity in both of those areas, but it will be relatively small. So the real upside opportunity on margin is going to come from the head of plan sales."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; And Connie Kao, Vice President of Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter, after which we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings growth in the third quarter as customers responded favorably to the compelling values we offer throughout our stores. 
Earnings per share for the period were $0.62, up 17% on top of a robust 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings grew to $245 million compared to $216 million last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.01 per share from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Sales for the third quarter rose 11% to $3.1 billion, with comparable stores sales up 7% versus a 3% gain last year. Operating margin was above plan, growing 55 basis points to 12.6%, driven mainly by higher merchandise margin. 
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, earnings per share were $2.06, up 11% on top of 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $817 million, up from $757 million last year. 
Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $9.4 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015.
dd's DISCOUNTS continued the year-to-date trend with strong performance in the third quarter. California was the strongest region during the period while shoes was the best-performing category at Ross. 
Our ladies' apparel business also continued to strengthen as shoppers responded to our improved merchandise assortment. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down slightly. 
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 45% compared to 48% at this time last year. 
As planned, we completed our 2016 store opening programs during the third quarter, with the addition of 25 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS. 
We expect to end fiscal 2016 with 1,338 Ross and 192 dd's DISCOUNTS, an increase of 84 locations for the year. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year."

Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned,",411,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. 
As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, increasing 55 basis points from last year to 12.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points, driven by 50 basis points in higher merchandise margin combined with a 20 basis point decline in occupancy costs. This was partially offset by an increase of 20 basis points in buying expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 5 basis points as leverage on the 7% increase in comparable store sales was partially offset by higher wages and certain other nonrecurring costs. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. 
Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 9.1 million shares for an aggregate price of $530 million. 
We remain on track to spend a total of $700 million for the year to complete the 2-year, $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. While we hope to do better, we are maintaining our same-store sales guidance for a 1% to 2% increase. This range is on top of strong 6% and 4% gains in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We expect earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter to be $0.72 to $0.75, which reflects the impact from the previously mentioned expense timing that benefited the third quarter. 
This updated range compares to earnings per share of $0.66 last year. 
The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following: total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%; operating margin is forecast to be 13.2% to 13.4% versus 12.7% in the prior year as we anniversary higher packaway costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 392 million. 
Based on our year-to-date results, along with this fourth quarter forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 11% to 12% to $2.78 to $2.81 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we are very happy with our third quarter sales and earnings that were well ahead of our expectations. As Michael just mentioned, we faced our most challenging multi-year comparisons this holiday season. There is an ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic, political and retail environments that could, once again, lead to a very promotional fourth quarter. 
Despite these potential headwinds, we believe we are competitively positioned for the fourth quarter as our merchants have done a terrific job of acquiring a wide array of exciting and sharply priced name-brand fashions and gifts to appeal to today's value-driven holiday shoppers. 
To sum up, we see consumers' increased focus on value continuing for the foreseeable future. This, along with a solid execution of our short and long-term strategies, makes us optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in sales and earnings.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; And Connie Kao, Vice President of Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter, after which we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings growth in the third quarter as customers responded favorably to the compelling values we offer throughout our stores. 
Earnings per share for the period were $0.62, up 17% on top of a robust 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings grew to $245 million compared to $216 million last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.01 per share from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Sales for the third quarter rose 11% to $3.1 billion, with comparable stores sales up 7% versus a 3% gain last year. Operating margin was above plan, growing 55 basis points to 12.6%, driven mainly by higher merchandise margins. 
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, earnings per share were $2.06, up 11% on top of 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $817 million, up from $757 million last year. 
Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $9.4 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015.
dd's DISCOUNTS continued the year-to-date trend with strong performance in the third quarter. California was the strongest region during the period while shoes was the best-performing category at Ross. 
Our ladies' apparel business also continued to strengthen as shoppers responded to our improved merchandise assortment. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down slightly. 
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 45% compared to 48% at this time last year. 
As planned, we completed our 2016 store opening programs during the third quarter, with the addition of 25 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS. 
We expect to end fiscal 2016 with 1,338 Ross and 192 dd's DISCOUNTS, an increase of 84 locations for the year. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year."

Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned,",411,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. 
As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, increasing 55 basis points from last year to 12.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points, driven by 50 basis points in higher merchandise margin combined with a 20 basis point decline in occupancy costs. This was partially offset by an increase of 20 basis points in buying expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 5 basis points as leverage on the 7% increase in comparable store sales was partially offset by higher wages and certain other nonrecurring costs. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. 
Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 9.1 million shares for an aggregate price of $530 million. 
We remain on track to spend a total of $700 million for the year to complete the 2-year, $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. While we hope to do better, we are maintaining our same-store sales guidance for a 1% to 2% increase. This range is on top of strong 6% and 4% gains in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We expect earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter to be $0.72 to $0.75, which reflects the impact from the previously mentioned expense timing that benefited the third quarter. 
This updated range compares to earnings per share of $0.66 last year. 
The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following: total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%; operating margin is forecast to be 13.2% to 13.4% versus 12.7% in the prior year as we anniversary higher packaway costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 392 million. 
Based on our year-to-date results, along with this fourth quarter forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 11% to 12% to $2.78 to $2.81 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To sum up, we see consumers' increased focus on value continuing for the foreseeable future. This, along with a solid execution of our short- and long-term strategies, makes us optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in sales and earnings.

We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter, after which we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings growth in the third quarter as customers responded favorably to the compelling values we offer throughout our stores. 
Earnings per share for the period were $0.62, up 17% on top of a robust 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings grew to $245 million compared to $216 million last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.01 per share from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Sales for the third quarter rose 11% to $3.1 billion, with comparable stores sales up 7% versus a 3% gain last year. Operating margin was above plan, growing 55 basis points to 12.6%, driven mainly by higher merchandise margins. 
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, earnings per share were $2.06, up 11% on top of 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $817 million, up from $757 million last year. 
Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $9.4 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015.
dd's DISCOUNTS continued the year-to-date trend with strong performance in the third quarter. California was the strongest region during the period while shoes was the best-performing category at Ross. 
Our ladies' apparel business also continued to strengthen as shoppers responded to our improved merchandise assortment. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down slightly. 
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 45% compared to 48% at this time last year. 
As planned, we completed our 2016 store opening programs during the third quarter, with the addition of 25 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS. 
We expect to end fiscal 2016 with 1,338 Ross and 192 dd's DISCOUNTS, an increase of 84 locations for the year. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year."

Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned,",411,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. 
As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, increasing 55 basis points from last year to 12.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points, driven by 50 basis points in higher merchandise margin combined with a 20 basis point decline in occupancy costs. This was partially offset by an increase of 20 basis points in buying expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 5 basis points as leverage on the 7% increase in comparable store sales was partially offset by higher wages and certain other nonrecurring costs. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. 
Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 9.1 million shares for an aggregate price of $530 million. 
We remain on track to spend a total of $700 million for the year to complete the 2-year, $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. While we hope to do better, we are maintaining our same-store sales guidance for a 1% to 2% increase. This range is on top of strong 6% and 4% gains in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We expect earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter to be $0.72 to $0.75, which reflects the impact from the previously mentioned expense timing that benefited the third quarter. 
This updated range compares to earnings per share of $0.66 last year. 
The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following: total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%; operating margin is forecast to be 13.2% to 13.4% versus 12.7% in the prior year as we anniversary higher packaway costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 392 million. 
Based on our year-to-date results, along with this fourth quarter forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 11% to 12% to $2.78 to $2.81 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015.

Again, we are very happy with our third quarter sales and earnings that were well ahead of our expectations. As Michael just mentioned, we faced our most challenging multi-year comparisons this holiday season. There is an ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic, political and retail environments that could, once again, lead to a very promotional fourth quarter. 
Despite these potential headwinds, we believe we are competitively positioned for the fourth quarter as our merchants have done a terrific job of acquiring a wide array of exciting and sharply priced name-brand fashions and gifts to appeal to today's value-driven holiday shoppers. 
To sum up, we see consumers' increased focus on value continuing for the foreseeable future. This, along with a solid execution of our short- and long-term strategies, makes us optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in sales and earnings. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."
