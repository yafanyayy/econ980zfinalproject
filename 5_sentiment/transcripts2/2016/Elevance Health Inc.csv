We're pleased to announced fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.68. For the full year 2015, adjusted earnings per share was $10.16, representing",2105,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announced fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.68. For the full year 2015, adjusted earnings per share was $10.16, representing year-over-year growth of 8.7%, and GAAP earnings per share of $9.38. It's important to note that our results include roughly $0.04 of assessments associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op, an expense that was not expected when we last stated our full year earnings outlook. 
I'm very pleased with our 2015 performance, and I believe the growing diversification of our company and the complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will position us well to capitalize on market growth opportunities over the next several years. We remain focused on improving health care affordability, quality and choice to our growing membership base. 
I'm going to start with some overview comments on our fourth quarter and 2015 result and then move to discuss our 2016 outlook in more detail. Fourth quarter results capped a successful 2015 with underlying fundamentals that tracked well versus our expectations. The fourth quarter represented the lowest quarterly adjusted earnings per share during 2015, which reflected our evolving business mix and the timing of medical utilization and operating expenses. As expected, this included lower margins in our Commercial and Government businesses due to a higher benefit expense ratio and an increase in investment spending. Both fully insured and self-funded membership tracked ahead of expectations, and we ended the year with 38.6 million members, a growth of 1.1 million lives or nearly 3% since 2014. Our fourth quarter performance creates a favorable starting point for 2016 enrollment. In particular, during the quarter, we saw better-than-expected membership growth in our large group and Medicaid markets. As expected, we ended the year with 791,000 individual public exchange lives, a decrease of 33,000 from the third quarter. During 2015, we added a total of 84,000 lives on public exchanges. Our small group enrollment declined by just north of 100,000 lives in the quarter to 1.2 million lives as we saw higher-than-expected lapses in plans that had previously early renewed with a December 1 benefit start date. 
During the quarter, medical cost trends continued to come in favorably versus our stated range. Our 2015 medical cost trend came in at the lower half of our previously guided range of 6.5% to 7.5%. For 2016, we anticipate Local Group medical cost trends will be slightly higher in the range of 7% to 7.5%. 
Operating revenue was $78.4 billion during 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion or 7.4% versus 2014, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business, additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends and increased fees associated with health care reform. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The full year 2015 benefit expense ratio was 83.3%, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflected the change in our business mix towards the Government Business division and a higher benefit expense ratio in the individual exchange business. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 16% for the full year 2015, a decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by the changing mix of our membership to the Government Business and a continued focus on administrative expense control, reflecting the need to ensure that we have the right cost structure for our public exchange membership outlook through 2016. 
Supporting the strong quality of our earnings during 2015, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $4.1 billion or 1.6x net income with cash flow in the fourth quarter of $949 million. While we're pleased with our run rate cash flow performance, our 2015 results included the benefit of approximately $500 million in timing items related to government and vendor payments. These items are simply timing and accelerated our 2015 cash flow, which we originally expected to be in 2016. Including the impact of these timing items, we expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. 
Commercial operating margins in 2015 were 7.6%, reflecting year-over-year improvements in all lines of business, with the exception of individual. As we have previously discussed, operating results on the public exchanges have lagged expectations during the year as membership was more than 30% behind our original expectations. As expected, Commercial fourth quarter margins represented the lowest of the year, reflecting the timing of benefits, expense and our evolving mix of business. 
Our Government Business continued its strong year into the fourth quarter with an ending operating margin of 4.8%, an improvement of 130 basis points versus 2014 along with better-than-expected membership results. In particular, our Medicare and Medicaid margins improved meaningfully versus 2014. We're very encouraged by the turnaround plan put into place by our Medicare team, now finishing the second year of a 3-year plan. Their recent performance is an encouraging next step towards driving meaningful long-term earnings growth. We expect margins will continue to improve in 2016 towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017. 
For Medicaid, our team has built a process that is focused on the basic blocking-and-tackling aspects of managing our members' total cost of care and quality. We're leveraging our assets to provide industry-leading solutions for our government partners to help control their population's health care cost without sacrificing the quality of care. While this year's margin performance is above our long-term expectations, we feel confident in our team's ability to continue to outperform on a wide variety of care management and performance metrics. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. We have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the full year 2015, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $800 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. While the favorable development was higher than what was recognized during 2014, it resulted in offsetting adjustments for the risk-stabilization programs from Health Care Reform. We continued to maintain our upper single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of December 31, 2015. 
For the 3Rs related to the 2015 benefit year, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to expect to be in a net payable position for risk adjusters and in a net neutral position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent, given the dynamic nature of available information. 
Our days in claims payable was 42.7 days as of December 31, an increase of 0.4 days from the 42.3 days as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to changes in the timing of claims payments between periods. As previously discussed, we do still expect days in claims payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.8% at December 31, 2015, down 40 basis points from 41.2% as of September 30, which reflects the impact of reducing our outstanding balance and commercial paper during the quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $368 million as of December 31. 
Turning to our 2016 outlook. We currently expect operating revenues to grow to a range of $80 billion to $81 billion, which is light of the long-term projections we laid out at our Investor Day in early 2014. The shortfall is primarily due to our individual exchange membership being meaningfully behind our projections, as we've discussed with you previously. In Commercial, we expect relatively steady enrollment during the year. We expect growth of over 300,000 lives for National Accounts in 2016 with strong momentum in securing new contract wins and exceeding our retention expectations. We also expect growth in large groups self-funded enrollment, reflecting new contract wins. While we expect strong growth in ASO, our commercial fully-insured enrollment will be pressured. We expect membership declines of approximately 300,000 in our individual business as we aren't experiencing the overall market growth on the public exchange that we projected when we laid out our 5-year plan and unsustainable pricing in some markets is hurting our historic market share. We're encouraged that early indicators of the open enrollment activity are slightly better than our muted expectations. Recent actions taken by CMS to begin addressing the special enrollment period challenges, as well as the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2017, are important first steps towards improving affordability for our customers. And you can be assured we are contributing to the dialogue to form a long-term, sustainable and affordable marketplace. We also expect Local Group fully insured membership losses of approximately 250,000, as members continue to transition into self-funded product offerings. It is important to note that while this trend is in line with recent history, we now do not expect a meaningful offset to this trend from growth on the private exchanges. Additionally, we expect continued pressure from the impact of higher levels of attrition due to the ending of insurance policies that were early renewed by our clients before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. For Government, we expect another strong enrollment growth year. We expect Medicaid to add more than 350,000 lives, reflecting the addition of new businesses in the State of Iowa as well as continued organic growth in core and expansion products. We continue to see states gravitate towards managed care to be the solution for more complex populations and services, and we expect to be front and center supporting these states' initiatives. 
Within our Medicare business, we continue to expect enrollment to be relatively steady as growth in our existing markets will be mostly offset by membership losses as we finalize the repositioning of our book in certain markets as part of our turnaround plan. 
Turning to financial metrics. We expect relatively stable margins in 2016. We currently expect an MLR midpoint of 83.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus 2015. This reflects the impact of a change in the mix of our business as we expect strong growth in Medicaid, a business with a higher MLR than the consolidated average. 
Related to cost trend expectations, again, we expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trend to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We expect our SG&A ratio in 2016 to be 15.4% at the midpoint. This reflects the impact of the changing mix of our business, strong growth in Medicaid and the impact of the administrative efficiency initiatives our management team is taking to work through the challenging public exchange environment. 
Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $650 million and interest expense of approximately $630 million. Note that our interest expense projection does not include the cost we expect to incur related to the bridge loan financing we have in place for the pending Cigna acquisition. We also currently expect our tax rate to be in the range of 43.5% to 45.5% for the year. We expect some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities next year. [ph] 
While we suspended share repurchases after the announcement of the Cigna acquisition in 2015, we plan to resume our capital deployment program in 2016, subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. As a result, we currently expect our share count for the year to be in the range of 266 to 270 million shares. We remain committed to at least maintaining our current dividend. We plan to review our capital deployment strategies at our next board meeting in February, and we expect to make an announcement on our first quarter 2016 dividend shortly thereafter. 
To conclude, our 2016 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $10.35. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. The difference between these 2 estimates is the exclusion of the amortization of deal-related intangibles. It's important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna, which we continue to expect will close in the second half of the year.

One thing I would like to highlight, though, for each of you on the call is that we try to maintain a conservative posture on the 3Rs as well while maintaining our reserve balance sheet strength with our high single-digit margin for adverse deviation at year-end. So when you look at our run rate individual business, we still made a very slight, I'd call it, closer to breakeven for the year, but keep in mind that's with us maintaining a very conservative position on the 3Rs as well. And going into '16, we are still assuming we will be profitable on our individual and exchange business, albeit below our targeted 3% to 5% margins as we continue to see those markets hopefully begin to harden around pricing."

And I think, at this point, when built our 5-year plan, we fully expected more of these lives to be picked up in the public exchanges as a fully insured.

Obviously, there has been some recent attrition. But just if your sort of at that number or still some ways to go or just where we stand relative to that?"

I'd say we've taken our medicine in that $400 million over the last couple of years. Now it becomes a question of will small group migrate to other lines of this overtime or just pure membership. But we have taken that sizable hit. As we saw in the fourth quarter, a very sizable chunk of that membership migrated away from fully insured, and the question is will recover that with the public exchanges in open enrollment or others. Again, our early open enrollment data would imply we are recovering it, but we want to see what actually converts to a pay by the end of the month. So but it's in terms of the margin compression, we've taken substantial portion of that $400 million."

A couple of thoughts or at least insights. One is, yes, we are assuming that some of the pricing that we continue to see in our markets, our 14 states, is still well below what we think appropriate rates are for the sustainable environment. I think the fact that we're closer to breakeven in '15 and a profit margin that's below the targeted 3% to 5% in '16 I think is a good indication that price point isn't wrong, as much as I see the strength of the price points. So we're going to assume that the strengthening is not occurring. In fact, in many states, it hasn't occurred, and that we will continue to trip members. That being said, we are starting to see individual start to recognize problems in their books. They are starting to strength in our pricing quite meaningfully. We are seeing co-op struggle in the moment with more than half of those insolvent. And so the question becomes now will the markets start to harden going to '17, which has really 2 effects for us, one is we no longer have the diminishing membership base, but more importantly, we should be hopefully a net recipient of that and hopefully start getting that revenue back that we talked about in our original 5-year outlook. And then relative to 2017, Matt, to your comment, it's the grand mothering, it's really hard to say at this point. I mean the behaviors of kind of the dynamics of what will be market look like in '17, not to see changes in how grandmother that's just what's a global economy and the U.S., what as well. But the theory of what you laid out would imply that you're going to get more of those lives and a healthier population and should help improve the overall profitability of the book as well. But as indicated in our largest markets, we did not allow grandfathering in many cases, and we migrated already. So it won't have as big as impact, but if the market has hardened, it should improve for us."

Thanks for the question. Yes, I think private exchanges have had a slow uptake probably for a few reasons, but I think it was considered a sort of an to the Cadillac tax exposure and other necessities that business is an industry considered in terms of moving their pose to a private exchange marketplace. It didn't materialize to the level of the speed that anybody anticipated in the early going. And our position at the moment is that we're kind of taking a more muted response to the private exchange formation and execution. Nonetheless, we're going to be ready if and when it does accelerate, and it may very well do so in the future. But at this stage, it really is a sort of a muted response to that strategy, and we believe what you're seeing nationally is sort of an in-market standard in terms of private exchanges, just simply not picking up the speed the folks have had originally anticipated. So we're basically waiting -- wait and see, and we're positioned. And in fact, we do have private exchange membership that is not as substantial part of our membership, but certainly, we are in the space. I guess bottom line is, affordability is still the key and remains critical to long-term positioning as part of the employers and, private exchange presents itself as a solution. We are ready, willing and able to engage any meaningful way. But again, I think our response at this stage is fairly muted given there's just been such a slow uptake."

We're pleased to announced fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.68. For the full year 2015, adjusted earnings per share was $10.16, representing year-over-year growth of 8.7% and GAAP earnings per share of $9.38. It's important to note that our results include roughly $0.04 of assessments associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op, an expense that was not expected when we last stated our full year earnings outlook. 
I'm very pleased with our 2015 performance, and I believe the growing diversification of our company and the complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will position us well to capitalize on market growth opportunities over the next several years. We remain focused on improving health care affordability, quality and choice to our growing membership base. 
I'm going to start with some overview comments on our fourth quarter and 2015 result,, and then move to discuss our 2016 outlook in more detail. Fourth quarter results capped a successful 2015 with underlying fundamentals that tracked well versus our expectations. The fourth quarter represented the lowest quarterly adjusted earnings per share during 2015, which reflected our evolving business mix and the timing of medical utilization and operating expenses. As expected, this included lower margins in our Commercial and Government Businesses due to a higher benefit expense ratio and an increase in investment spending. 
Both fully insured and self-funded membership tracked ahead of expectations, and we ended the year with 38.6 million members, a growth of 1.1 million lives or nearly 3% since 2014. Our fourth quarter performance creates a favorable starting point for 2016 enrollment. In particular, during the quarter, we saw better-than-expected membership growth in our large group and Medicaid markets. As expected, we ended the year with 791,000 individual public exchange lives, a decrease of 33,000 from the third quarter. During 2015, we added a total of 84,000 lives on public exchanges. Our small group enrollment declined by just north of 100,000 lives in the quarter to 1.2 million lives as we saw higher-than-expected lapses in plans that had previously early renewed with a December 1 benefit start date. 
During the quarter, medical cost trends continued to come in favorably versus our stated range. Our 2015 medical cost trend came in at the lower half of our previously guided range of 6.5% to 7.5%. For 2016, we anticipate Local Group medical cost trends will be slightly higher in the range of 7% to 7.5%. 
Operating revenue was $78.4 billion during 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion or 7.4% versus 2014, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business, additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends and increased fees associated with health care reform. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The full year 2015 benefit expense ratio was 83.3%, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflected the change in our business mix towards the Government Business division and a higher benefit expense ratio in the individual exchange business. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 16% for the full year 2015, a decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by the changing mix of our membership to the Government Business and a continued focus on administrative expense control, reflecting the need to ensure that we have the right cost structure for our public exchange membership outlook through 2016. 
Supporting the strong quality of our earnings during 2015, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $4.1 billion or 1.6x net income, with cash flow in the fourth quarter of $949 million. While we're pleased with our run rate cash flow performance, our 2015 results included the benefit of approximately $500 million in timing items related to government and vendor payments. These items are simply timing and accelerated our 2015 cash flow, which we originally expected to be in 2016. Including the impact of these timing items, we expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. 
Commercial operating margins in 2015 were 7.6%, reflecting year-over-year improvements in all lines of business, with the exception of individual. As we have previously discussed, operating results on the public exchanges have lagged expectations during the year as membership was more than 30% behind our original expectations. As expected, Commercial fourth quarter margins represented the lowest of the year, reflecting the timing of benefits, expense and our evolving mix of business. 
Our Government Business continued its strong year into the fourth quarter with an ending operating margin of 4.8%, an improvement of 130 basis points versus 2014, along with better-than-expected membership results. In particular, our Medicare and Medicaid margins improved meaningfully versus 2014. We're very encouraged by the turnaround plan put into place by our Medicare team, now finishing the second year of a 3-year plan. Their recent performance is an encouraging next step towards driving meaningful long-term earnings growth. We expect margins will continue to improve in 2016 towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017. 
For Medicaid, our team has built a process that is focused on the basic blocking and tackling aspects of managing our members' total cost of care and quality. We're leveraging our assets to provide industry-leading solutions for our government partners to help control their population's health care cost without sacrificing the quality of care. While this year's margin performance is above our long-term expectations, we feel confident in our team's ability to continue to outperform on a wide variety of care management and performance metrics. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. We have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the full year 2015, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $800 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. While the favorable development was higher than what was recognized during 2014, it resulted in offsetting adjustments for the risk stabilization programs from Health Care Reform. We continue to maintain our upper single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of December 31, 2015. 
For the 3Rs related to the 2015 benefit year, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to expect to be in a net payable position for risk adjusters and in a net neutral position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent, given the dynamic nature of available information. 
Our Days in Claims Payable was 42.7 days as of December 31, an increase of 0.4 days from the 42.3 days as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to changes in the timing of claims payments between periods. As previously discussed, we do still expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.8% at December 31, 2015, down 40 basis points from 41.2% as of September 30, which reflects the impact of reducing our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $368 million as of December 31. 
Turning to our 2016 outlook. We currently expect operating revenues to grow to a range of $80 billion to $81 billion, which is light of the long-term projections we laid out at our Investor Day in early 2014. The shortfall is primarily due to our individual exchange membership being meaningfully behind our projections, as we've discussed with you previously. In Commercial, we expect relatively steady enrollment during the year. We expect growth of over 300,000 lives for National Accounts in 2016 with strong momentum in securing new contract wins and exceeding our retention expectations. We also expect growth in large group self-funded enrollment, reflecting new contract wins. 
While we expect strong growth in ASO, our commercial fully-insured enrollment will be pressured. We expect membership declines of approximately 300,000 in our Individual business as we aren't experiencing the overall market growth on the public exchange that we projected when we laid out our 5-year plan, and unsustainable pricing in some markets is hurting our historic market share. We're encouraged that early indicators of the open enrollment activity are slightly better than our muted expectations. Recent actions taken by CMS to begin addressing the special enrollment period challenges as well as the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2017 are important first steps towards improving affordability for our customers. And you can be assured we are contributing to the dialogue to form a long-term, sustainable and affordable marketplace. 
We also expect Local Group fully insured membership losses of approximately 250,000 as members continue to transition into self-funded product offerings. It is important to note that while this trend is in line with recent history, we now do not expect a meaningful offset to this trend from growth on the private exchanges. Additionally, we expect continued pressure from the impact of higher levels of attrition due to the ending of insurance policies that were early renewed by our clients before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. 
For Government, we expect another strong enrollment growth year. We expect Medicaid to add more than 350,000 lives, reflecting the addition of new business in the State of Iowa as well as continued organic growth in core and expansion products. We continue to see states gravitate towards managed care to be the solution for more complex populations and services, and we expect to be front and center, supporting these states' initiatives. 
Within our Medicare business, we continue to expect enrollment to be relatively steady as growth in our existing markets will be mostly offset by membership losses as we finalize the repositioning of our book in certain markets as part of our turnaround plan. 
Turning to financial metrics. We expect relatively stable margins in 2016. We currently expect an MLR midpoint of 83.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus 2015. This reflects the impact of a change in the mix of our business as we expect strong growth in Medicaid, a business with a higher MLR than the consolidated average. 
Related to cost trend expectations. Again, we expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We expect our SG&A ratio in 2016 to be 15.4% at the midpoint. This reflects the impact of the changing mix of our business, strong growth in Medicaid and the impact of the administrative efficiency initiatives our management team is taking to work through the challenging public exchange environment. 
Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $650 million and interest expense of approximately $630 million. Note that our interest expense projection does not include the costs we expect to incur related to the bridge loan financing we have in place for the pending Cigna acquisition. We also currently expect our tax rate to be in the range of 43.5% to 45.5% for the year. We expect some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities next year. 
While we suspended share repurchases after the announcement of the Cigna acquisition in 2015, we plan to resume our capital deployment program in 2016, subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. As a result, we currently expect our share count for the year to be in the range of 266 million to 270 million shares. 
We remain committed to at least maintaining our current dividend. We plan to review our capital deployment strategies at our next board meeting in February, and we expect to make an announcement on our first quarter 2016 dividend shortly thereafter. 
To conclude, our 2016 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $10.35. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. The difference between these 2 estimates is the exclusion of the amortization of deal-related intangibles. It's important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna, which we continue to expect will close in the second half of the year.

So again, I don't want to create any alarms there. Trend finished at the low end -- or lower half of our range, as we said earlier, and the metrics remain strong. One thing I would like to highlight, though, for each of you on the call is that we try to maintain a conservative posture on the 3Rs as well while maintaining our reserve balance sheet strength with our high single-digit margin for adverse deviation at year-end. So when you look at our run rate Individual business, we still made a very slight, I call it, closer to breakeven for the year. But keep in mind, that's with us maintaining a very conservative position on the 3Rs as well. And going into '16, we are still assuming we will be profitable on our individual and exchange business, albeit below our targeted 3% to 5% margins as we continue to see those markets hopefully begin to harden around pricing."

And I think, at this point, when we built our 5-year plan, we fully expected more of these lives to be picked up in the public exchanges as a fully insured. And we're finding that some of those lives now are actually getting employed and more in ASO market and -- or we're picking them up on Medicaid, which, in some cases, are lower PMPM that we would have got on the public exchange.

We got an update from the team yesterday. Actually, Joe and the senior leadership team got a full deep dive on where things are progressing. And things are moving exactly as we would have expected at this point. We're very close to starting that implementation on 3/1. We don't have line of sight of what membership we may or may not get. As you know, there are a number of appeals that have been filed both by the -- one individual that was selected that has been told they were being removed as well as others that were not selected in the first round. So we have not included any of that, and we want to see how that pans out. That being said, if you were to look at Medicaid all-in, both margin compressions that we're receiving throughout the year that we expect, plus we're assuming even further margin pressure in the back half of '16 from states as well as expansion, there's about a few hundred million dollar headwind baked in. But I would tell you that Iowa is less than 25% of that. So it gives you kind of a gauge of how we're envisioning year 1 to evolve and then migrate more to year 2, and then from there, to the normal profitability we would have in these programs.

A couple of thoughts or at least, insights. One is, yes, we are assuming that some of the pricing that we continue to see in our markets, our 14 states, is still well below what we think appropriate rates are for a sustainable environment. I think the fact that we're closer to breakeven in '15 and a profit margin that's below the targeted 3% to 5% in '16 I think is a good indication of -- our price point isn't wrong as much as others need to strengthen their price points. So we are going to assume that the strengthening is not occurring. In fact, we know in many states it hadn't occurred and that we will continue to treat members. That being said, we are starting to see Individual start to recognize the problems in their books. They are starting to strengthen their pricing quite meaningfully. We are seeing co-op struggle in the moment with more than half of those now insolvent. And so the question becomes, will the markets start to harden going into '17, which has really 2 effects for us: one is we no longer have the diminishing membership base; but more importantly, we should be hopefully a net recipient of that and hopefully start getting some of that revenue back that we had talked about in our original 5-year outlook? And then relative to 2017, Matt, to your comment, it's -- with grandmothering, it's really hard to say at this point. I mean, the behaviors of kind of the dynamics of what will the market look like in '17, not just the exchanges and how grandmothering, but just what's the global economy and the U.S. economy doing, what implications does that have as well. But the theory of what you laid out would imply that you're going to get more of those lives in that are a healthier population and should help improve the overall profitability of the book as well. But as you indicated, in our largest markets, we did not allow grandfathering in many cases, and we migrated already. So it won't have as big of an impact, but if the market has hardened, it should improve for us."

Yes, I think private exchanges have had a slow uptake probably for a few reasons. But I think it was considered as sort of an offset to the Cadillac tax exposure and other necessities that businesses and industry considered in terms of moving their employees into a private exchange marketplace. It didn't materialize to the level of the speed that anybody anticipated in the early going, and our position at the moment is that we're kind of taking a more muted response to the private exchange formation and execution. Nonetheless, we're going to be ready if and when it does accelerate, and it may very well do so in the future. But at this stage, it really is a sort of a muted response to that strategy. And we believe what you're seeing nationally is sort of an in-market standard in terms of private exchanges just simply not picking up the speed that folks had originally anticipated. So we're basically waiting -- wait and see, and we're positioned. And in fact, we do have private exchange membership that is not a substantial part of our membership. But certainly, we are in the space. I guess bottom line is, affordability is still the key and remains critical to long-term positioning on the part of employers. And as private exchange presents itself as a solution, we're ready, willing and able to engage in a meaningful way. But again, I think our response at this stage is fairly muted, given there's just been such a slow uptake."

So I don't think you can look at it with or without the program because the pricing is built with that program.

Understand that we have margins that are exceeding what we believe are long-term, sustainable, optimal margins. But know that we are still assuming that we will blend closer to a 5% margin all-in going into next year. Now that's higher than what you've typically heard from Medicaid, which will be the 2% to 3% margin range. But it's important to recognize that we do get a gross up for the health insurer fee as well, so that bumps those margins further. But we think that the guidance we provided puts us at what hopefully will be a sustainable outperformance margin for us. We believe we should have a better margin because we believe we can execute on this better, and the team that we brought in from the Amerigroup almost 3 years now has done an exceptional job in that space.

We're pleased to announced fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.68.

We're pleased to announced fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.68. For the full year 2015, adjusted earnings per share was $10.16, representing year-over-year growth of 8.7% and GAAP earnings per share of $9.38. It's important to note that our results include roughly $0.04 of assessments associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op, an expense that was not expected when we last stated our full year earnings outlook. 
I'm very pleased with our 2015 performance, and I believe the growing diversification of our company and the complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will position us well to capitalize on market growth opportunities over the next several years. We remain focused on improving health care affordability, quality and choice to our growing membership base. 
I'm going to start with some overview comments on our fourth quarter and 2015 result and then move to discuss our 2016 outlook in more detail. Fourth quarter results capped a successful 2015 with underlying fundamentals that tracked well versus our expectations. The fourth quarter represented the lowest quarterly adjusted earnings per share during 2015, which reflected our evolving business mix and the timing of medical utilization and operating expenses. As expected, this included lower margins in our Commercial and Government Businesses due to a higher benefit expense ratio and an increase in investment spending. 
Both fully insured and self-funded membership tracked ahead of expectations, and we ended the year with 38.6 million members, a growth of 1.1 million lives or nearly 3% since 2014. Our fourth quarter performance creates a favorable starting point for 2016 enrollment. In particular, during the quarter, we saw better-than-expected membership growth in our large group and Medicaid markets. As expected, we ended the year with 791,000 individual public exchange lives, a decrease of 33,000 from the third quarter. During 2015, we added a total of 84,000 lives on the public exchanges. Our small group enrollment declined by just north of 100,000 lives in the quarter to 1.2 million lives as we saw higher-than-expected lapses in plans that had previously early renewed with a December 1 benefit start date. 
During the quarter, medical cost trends continued to come in favorably versus our stated range. Our 2015 medical cost trend came in at the lower half of our previously guided range of 6.5% to 7.5%. For 2016, we anticipate Local Group medical cost trends will be slightly higher in the range of 7% to 7.5%. 
Operating revenue was $78.4 billion during 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion or 7.4% versus 2014, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business, additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends and increased fees associated with health care reform. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The full year 2015 benefit expense ratio was 83.3%, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflected the change in our business mix towards the Government Business division and a higher benefit expense ratio in the individual exchange business. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 16% for the full year 2015, a decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by the changing mix of our membership to the Government Business and a continued focus on administrative expense control, reflecting the need to ensure that we have the right cost structure for our public exchange membership outlook through 2016. 
Supporting the strong quality of our earnings during 2015, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $4.1 billion or 1.6x net income, with cash flow in the fourth quarter of $949 million. While we're pleased with our run rate cash flow performance, our 2015 results included the benefit of approximately $500 million in timing items related to government and vendor payments. These items are simply timing and accelerated our 2015 cash flow, which we originally expected to be in 2016. Including the impact of these timing items, we expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. 
Commercial operating margins in 2015 were 7.6%, reflecting year-over-year improvements in all lines of business, with the exception of individual. As we have previously discussed, operating results on the public exchanges have lagged expectations during the year as membership was more than 30% behind our original expectations. As expected, Commercial fourth quarter margins represented the lowest of the year, reflecting the timing of benefits, expense and our evolving mix of business. 
Our Government Business continued its strong year into the fourth quarter with an ending operating margin of 4.8%, an improvement of 130 basis points versus 2014, along with better-than-expected membership results. In particular, our Medicare and Medicaid margins improved meaningfully versus 2014. We're very encouraged about [ph] the turnaround plan put into place by our Medicare team, now finishing the second year of a 3-year plan. Their recent performance is an encouraging next step towards driving meaningful long-term earnings growth. We expect margins will continue to improve in 2016 towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017. 
For Medicaid, our team has built a process that is focused on the basic blocking and tackling aspects of managing our members' total cost of care and quality. We're leveraging our assets to provide industry-leading solutions for our government partners to help control their population's health care cost without sacrificing the quality of care. While this year's margin performance is above our long-term expectations, we feel confident in our team's ability to continue to outperform on a wide variety of care management and performance metrics. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. We have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the full year 2015, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $800 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. While the favorable development was higher than what was recognized during 2014, it resulted in offsetting adjustments for the risk stabilization programs from Health Care Reform. We continue to maintain our upper single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of December 31, 2015. 
For the 3Rs related to the 2015 benefit year, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to expect to be in a net payable position for risk adjusters and in a net neutral position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent, given the dynamic nature of available information. 
Our Days in Claims Payable was 42.7 days as of December 31, an increase of 0.4 days from the 42.3 days as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to changes in the timing of claims payments between periods. As previously discussed, we do still expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.8% at December 31, 2015, down 40 basis points from 41.2% as of September 30, which reflects the impact of reducing our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $368 million as of December 31. 
Turning to our 2016 outlook. We currently expect operating revenues to grow to a range of $80 billion to $81 billion, which is light of the long-term projections we laid out at our Investor Day in early 2014. The shortfall is primarily due to our individual exchange membership being meaningfully behind our projections, as we've discussed with you previously. In Commercial, we expect relatively steady enrollment during the year. We expect growth of over 300,000 lives for National Accounts in 2016 with strong momentum in securing new contract wins and exceeding our retention expectations. We also expect growth in large group self-funded enrollment, reflecting new contract wins. 
While we expect strong growth in ASO, our commercial fully-insured enrollment will be pressured. We expect membership declines of approximately 300,000 in our Individual business as we aren't experiencing the overall market growth on the public exchange that we projected when we laid out our 5-year plan, and unsustainable pricing in some markets is hurting our historic market share. We're encouraged that early indicators of the open enrollment activity are slightly better than our muted expectations. Recent actions taken by CMS to begin addressing the special enrollment period challenges as well as the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2017 are important first steps towards improving affordability for our customers. And you can be assured we are contributing to the dialogue to form a long-term, sustainable and affordable marketplace. 
We also expect Local Group fully insured membership losses of approximately 250,000 as members continue to transition into self-funded product offerings. It is important to note that while this trend is in line with recent history, we now do not expect a meaningful offset to this trend from growth on the private exchanges. Additionally, we expect continued pressure from the impact of higher levels of attrition due to the ending of insurance policies that were early renewed by our clients before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. 
For Government, we expect another strong enrollment growth year. We expect Medicaid to add more than 350,000 lives, reflecting the addition of new business in the State of Iowa as well as continued organic growth in core and expansion products. We continue to see states gravitate towards managed care to be the solution for more complex populations and services, and we expect to be front and center, supporting these states' initiatives. 
Within our Medicare business, we continue to expect enrollment to be relatively steady as growth in our existing markets will be mostly offset by membership losses as we finalize the repositioning of our book in certain markets as part of our turnaround plan. 
Turning to financial metrics. We expect relatively stable margins in 2016. We currently expect an MLR midpoint of 83.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus 2015. This reflects the impact of a change in the mix of our business as we expect strong growth in Medicaid, a business with a higher MLR than the consolidated average. 
Related to cost trend expectations. Again, we expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We expect our SG&A ratio in 2016 to be 15.4% at the midpoint. This reflects the impact of the changing mix of our business, strong growth in Medicaid and the impact of the administrative efficiency initiatives our management team is taking to work through the challenging public exchange environment. 
Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $650 million and interest expense of approximately $630 million. Note that our interest expense projection does not include the costs we expect to incur related to the bridge loan financing we have in place for the pending Cigna acquisition. We also currently expect our tax rate to be in the range of 43.5% to 45.5% for the year. We expect some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities next year. 
While we suspended share repurchases after the announcement of the Cigna acquisition in 2015, we plan to resume our capital deployment program in 2016, subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. As a result, we currently expect our share count for the year to be in the range of 266 million to 270 million shares. 
We remain committed to at least maintaining our current dividend. We plan to review our capital deployment strategies at our next board meeting in February, and we expect to make an announcement on our first quarter 2016 dividend shortly thereafter. 
To conclude, our 2016 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $10.35. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. The difference between these 2 estimates is the exclusion of the amortization of deal-related intangibles. It's important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna, which we continue to expect will close in the second half of the year.

So again, I don't want to create any alarms there. Trend finished at the low end -- or lower half of our range, as we said earlier, and the metrics remain strong. One thing I would like to highlight, though, for each of you on the call is that we tried to maintain a conservative posture on the 3Rs as well while maintaining our reserve balance sheet strength with our high single-digit margin for adverse deviation at year-end. So when you look at our run rate Individual business, we still made a very slight, I'd call it closer to breakeven for the year. But keep in mind, that's with us maintaining a very conservative position on the 3Rs as well. And going into '16, we are still assuming we will be profitable on our individual and exchange business, albeit below our targeted 3% to 5% margins as we continue to see those markets hopefully begin to harden around pricing."

But nonetheless, it's still occurring. And so we are retaining a lot of that membership moving from fully insured to ASO.

And I think, at this point, when we built our 5-year plan, we fully expected more of these lives to be picked up in the public exchanges as a fully insured. And we're finding that some of those lives now are actually getting employed and more in an ASO market and -- or we're picking them up on Medicaid, which, in some cases, is a lower PMPM that we would have got on the public exchange.

We got an update from the team yesterday. Actually, Joe and the senior leadership team got a full deep dive on where things are progressing. And things are moving exactly as we would have expected at this point. We're very close to starting that implementation on 3/1. We don't have line of sight of what membership we may or may not get. As you know, there are a number of appeals that have been filed both by the -- one individual that was selected that has been told they were being removed as well as others that were not selected in the first round. So we have not included any of that, and we want to see how that pans out. That being said, if you were to look at Medicaid all-in, both margin compressions that we're receiving throughout the year that we expect, plus we're assuming even further margin pressure in the back half of '16 from states as well as expansion, there's about a few hundred million dollar headwind baked in. But I would tell you that Iowa is less than 25% of that. So it gives you kind of a gauge of how we're envisioning year 1 to evolve and then migrate more to year 2, and then from there, to the normal profitability we would have in these programs.

A couple of thoughts or at least, insights. One is, yes, we are assuming that some of the pricing that we continue to see in our markets, our 14 states, is still well below what we think appropriate rates are for a sustainable environment. I think the fact that we're closer to breakeven in '15 and a profit margin that's below the targeted 3% to 5% in '16 I think is a good indication of -- our price point isn't wrong as much as others need to strengthen their price points. So we are going to assume that the strengthening is not occurring. In fact, we know in many states it hadn't occurred and that we will continue to attrit members. That being said, we are starting to see individuals start to recognize the problems in their books. They are starting to strengthen their pricing quite meaningfully. We are seeing co-ops struggle in the moment with more than half of those now insolvent. And so the question becomes, will the markets start to harden going into '17, which has really 2 effects for us: one is we no longer have the diminishing membership base; but more importantly, we should be hopefully a net recipient of that and hopefully start getting some of that revenue back that we had talked about in our original 5-year outlook? And then relative to 2017, Matt, to your comment, it's -- with grandmothering, it's really hard to say at this point. I mean, the behaviors of kind of the dynamics of what will the market look like in '17, not just the exchanges and how grandmothering, but just what's the global economy and the U.S. economy doing, what implications does that have as well. But the theory of what you laid out would imply that you're going to get more of those lives in that are in a healthier population and should help improve the overall profitability of the book as well. But as you indicated, in our largest markets, we did not allow grandfathering in many cases, and we migrated already. So it won't have as big of an impact, but if the market has hardened, it should improve for us."

Yes, I think private exchanges have had a slow uptake probably for a few reasons. But I think it was considered as sort of an offset to the Cadillac tax exposure and other necessities that business and industry considered in terms of moving their employees into a private exchange marketplace. It didn't materialize to the level of the speed that anybody anticipated in the early going, and our position at the moment is that we're kind of taking a more muted response to the private exchange formation and execution. Nonetheless, we're going to be ready if and when it does accelerate, and it may very well do so in the future. But at this stage, it really is a sort of a muted response to that strategy. And we believe what you're seeing nationally is sort of an in-market standard in terms of private exchanges just simply not picking up the speed that folks had originally anticipated. So we're basically waiting -- wait and see, and we're positioned. And in fact, we do have private exchange membership that is not a substantial part of our membership. But certainly, we are in the space. I guess the bottom line is, affordability is still the key and remains critical to long-term positioning on the part of employers.

So I don't think you can look at it with or without the program because the pricing is built with that program. That being said, as you know, there's data points out there that would imply that people may recover as much as 55% to 60%. And again, we're much more in line with where the law is.

And because the underlying economics of each state vary dramatically, we would prefer not to blend them together in a broad discussion. That being said, though, Sarah, I think it's a fair question. Understand that we have margins that are exceeding what we believe are long-term, sustainable, optimal margins. But know that we are still assuming that we will blend closer to a 5% margin all-in going into next year. Now that's higher than what you've typically heard from Medicaid, which would be the 2% to 3% margin range. But it's important to recognize that we do get a gross up for the health insurer fee as well, so that bumps those margins further. But we think that the guidance we provided puts us at what hopefully will be a sustainable outperformance margin for us. We believe we should have a better margin because we believe we can execute on this better, and the team that we brought in from the Amerigroup almost 3 years now has done an exceptional job in that space. But our pricing assumes slowly landing the plane on those margins to get to more of that sustainable, long-term margin."

We're pleased to announce first quarter of 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.46, with membership tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.63. I'm pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to 2016 as the company continues to benefit from the growing diversification of our businesses. The complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will allow us to further advance affordability and quality for our members. 
I'm going to start with some overview comments on our first quarter 2016 results, and then we'll discuss a few of the key details of our updated 2016 outlook. First quarter results reflect business performance that tracked well versus our expectations. Specifically, membership is exceeding our expectations, and we reported strong quality of earnings metrics while maintaining appropriate conservativism on our balance sheets to reflect the dynamic nature of the marketplace that exists today. 
Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded membership are tracking ahead of expectations. And we ended the first quarter with 39.6 million members, reflecting growth of 1 million lives or 2.6% since year-end 2015. Specifically, we ended the quarter with 975,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, an increase of 184,000 from year-end 2015 and ahead of our initial expectations. Our self-funded business grew by 906,000 lives or 3.8% in the quarter to 24.6 million members, which was also ahead of our expectations as the company experienced higher-than-expected in-group change in current contracts and BlueCard enrollment. Our Local Group insured enrollment declined by just north of 200,000 lives in the quarter and serves approximately 4 million members as of March 31. In particular, we saw higher-than-expected lapses in plans residing in states that transitioned the 51 to 99 key group size into the small group marketplace. 
Operating revenue was $20.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the first quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The first quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 81.8%, which increased versus prior year, as expected. The 160 basis point increase reflected the impact of an extra calendar day during the quarter from the leap year, a higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid and individual businesses as well as a change in our business mix towards the Government Business division, which carries a higher-than-average benefit expense ratio. While we do not include a reserve rollforward table in our first quarter press release, it is important to note that year-end 2015 reserves have developed moderately better than our expectations so far in 2016. However, we do not believe our first quarter 2016 financial results benefited from that reserve development, and we have maintained an appropriate level of conservativism on our balance sheet as of March 31 for the higher-than-expected individual enrollment. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 15.8% in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by a continued focus on administrative expense control in light of better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business. 
Supporting those strong quality of our earnings in the first quarter, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion or 1.9x net income. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. It is important to note that operating cash flow exceeded our expectations in the quarter, which is encouraging. 
Turning to discuss the first quarter financial performance of our business units. Let me say that in our Commercial business, we reported strong membership trends that came in well above our conservative expectations, increasing by 880,000 during the quarter. In particular, we saw strong self-funded membership trends in both our National and Local Group businesses and better-than-expected individual enrollment on the public exchanges. This contributed to the better-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 1.5% versus the prior year to $9.5 billion. 
Operating margins were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter at 13.6%, which reflects the impact of a higher benefit expense ratio, offset by a lower SG&A expense ratio, as expected. 
We were diligent with respect to pricing our exchange product offerings for 2016, as this remains a dynamic marketplace. We believe we have taken a conservative posture in the first quarter regarding our expectations for the profitability of this book of business for 2016. We believe we are well positioned for continued growth in exchange lives as this market stabilizes to a more sustainable level over time. 
Relating to National Accounts, we're pleased that the team has been able to secure some wins recently that should grow membership in both 2016 and 2017. As we said earlier, Local Group membership was down slightly year-over-year, and we continue to see a funding mix shift away from fully insured. We recognize it is vital to offer affordable products with the right network and benefit design in our markets. And our team is focused on improving the historical trends of this book of business. 
Our Government Business segment had another solid quarter, adding 123,000 members and growing year-over-year revenue by 13.9% to $10.8 billion. It is important to note that our results do not yet include an impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, aside from start-up costs incurred in the quarter ahead of the contract launch, where the implementation was delayed from March 1 to April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 3%, a decline of approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we continue to expect Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the performance of this business appropriately.  Within Medicare, I'm pleased with the progress the team continues to make as our first quarter margins reflect continued improvement versus last year. We continue to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial. We expect $68 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2020, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations and specialized services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care costs and improving quality for their residents. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. Our Days in Claims Payable was 43.4 days as of March 31, an increase of 0.7 days from the 42.7 days as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the timing of claims payments driven by the new membership that came online during the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.2% at March 31, 2016, down 60 basis points from the 40.8% as of December 31, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction of our outstanding balance in the commercial paper during the quarter. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. And our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $639 million as of March 31. For the 3Rs related to the 2015 and 2016 benefit years, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net payable position for risk adjusters and a net neutral position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information. 
Turning to our financial outlook. We have increased our operating revenue expectation for 2016 by $1 billion to between $81 billion and $82 billion. This increase reflects higher projected membership due to the strong enrollment results seen through the first quarter, as we've discussed. Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 14.9 million members at the midpoint of our range at year-end, 250,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the individual and Medicaid businesses. Self-funded membership is now expected to be approximately 24.5 million members at the midpoint of our range at year-end, also 250,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project our total membership to be approximately 700,000 to 900,000 lives higher than we ended in 2015. We continue to expect our 2016 medical loss ratio to be 83.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and now expect our SG&A ratio to be 15.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points, on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of Cigna-related transaction cost incurred during the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We're encouraged with first quarter operating cash flow, and we continue to project operating cash flows to be greater than $3 billion in 2016. 
Regarding capital deployment. We raised our dividend during the first quarter by $0.025 per share and declared our second quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. This represents an annualized dividend of $2.60 per share and continues our track record of increasing our dividend every year since it was implemented in 2011. 
Our 2016 outlook does include some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year. While we did not repurchase any shares through the first quarter, we plan to resume our capital deployment program, subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. 
To conclude, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.65 on a GAAP basis and our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. Our outlook continues to take an appropriately conservative posture around the expected financial performance on the public exchanges and the expected year-over-year margin compression in the Medicaid business. Our outlook does not include the adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments, which we expect to implement in 2017. For context, we estimate the impact in the first quarter of 2016 would have been a benefit to GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.10. Our outlook does include an adverse impact of $0.03 for the additional assessment in 2016 associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op. It's also important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect this acquisition will close in the second half of this year. It also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with the SI. 
With that, operator, please open the queue for questions."

As I",567,"Great. A.J., thanks for the question. Good morning. It's Joe. First thing, let me just tell you that we're really pleased overall with how our team has been able to navigate a very challenging landscape that has evolved over the last couple of years. As I stated in my remarks, we're really glad to now be serving 975,000 members across all of our markets, which I think really highlights an incredibly meaningful value proposition to the customers that have chosen to align with us. Over time, we do believe we're well positioned for continued growth in the exchange marketplace if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level. I think that is a key consideration. Clearly, the performance of the exchange marketplaces lagged expectations throughout the industry, as some of our peers have been recognized. And in consideration of that, we are monitoring the market very closely to see that our offerings continue to be: number one, very rational, sustainable for the customers, but also it is built on a platform that is constructed appropriately with respect to costs that need to drive our presence in that market. Again, at a very sustainable and appropriate level. We -- I think it's really critical for me to underscore that we are actively engaged with our government partners to help build that long-term sustainable model that we believe will ultimately create an affordable marketplace. And in doing so, we believe we can continue to develop the kind of rate structure in the marketplace that's adequate for us and appropriate in terms of affordability for members. And for example, I think the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2014 sets the stage nicely as we move into that new year with respect to a rate picture. And I think our combination with Cigna is going to present a meaningful improvement in affordability for our membership. So I think, put all that together, we're very kind of pleased with how we've performed this year. We think we're engaged in a fairly sustainable platform that has potential for continued growth, again, to underscore, as long as the model that we are engaged in in the marketplace is a sustainable model. Let me close my remarks in that regard by saying that I think there's some really key drivers to building that sustainable, affordable marketplace that I mentioned. Some of the key elements include what has already been put in place for '17, which is the health insurer tax adjustment. And the second thing would be, I think, a careful consideration of updating the risk adjustment model, further consideration of special enrollment period adjustments, and that would narrow the variety and number of special enrollment considerations. And we'd like to be able to begin offering some very innovative product designs in the marketplace. And hopefully, our government partners will be receptive to some of those creative, innovative model. And finally, I'd like to underscore modification of grace period for nonpayment of premiums to prevent abuse. So when you put all that together in a mosaic, I think, maybe a sustainable model can be built, and we will continue to perform in marketplace in a way that continues to maybe try to achieve the membership that we have originally anticipated back when this effort first began in '14. Wayne, you may want to speak to the MLR question that A.J. put to us."

But ultimately, as this business comes on, we'll see how it really develops in Q2. As you know, a lot of the claims activity always has a little bit of a lag when individuals switches to a new carrier. And then ultimately, that reporting time line that occurs with the providers and ultimately to us. So I think in 2Q, we get a much better feel. What we want you to be aware of is, one, we're not seeing any early indicators across our broader book on trend or anything that would have change our overall trend assumptions. Two is, we've maintained a conservative posture going into 2Q around the risk adjuster data and not only for what we believe that '15 would true up to be, but what we think the impact would be in '16 in light of this mix. That's not just based on our assumptions but actually using the updated weekly [ph] data we receive as well as recent CMIS data. But as you know, ultimate settlements on those will be very dependent upon who owes the risk adjuster and how that will settle out. So we're going to wait and see how that pans out in 2Q. But I would say, at each of these 3Rs, we've been in a posture that should give us some contingency if the book doesn't develop as we would've expected. And if it does develop as we would expect, then it would give us some upside going in the second half of this year and into Q2. On the Medicaid front, again no real surprise. As a reminder, that we have a lot of new markets that we're rolling out. We continue to have that book evolve. As you know, Iowa now starts on April 1 as well. So we would expect to see MLR pressure there in 2Q as well. But consistent with our expectations in new markets that are rolling out and we continue to be bullish in the Medicaid top line as well as bottom line. And as we've mentioned previously, we're going to be slow landing those margins down to what we think a more sustainable. And then on the Medicaid regs, no real surprises.

And so again, it's another reason why we want to see how this ultimately pans out our pricing. It's obviously much higher than what the -- would've been available in the market. So the question would be does that adequately reflect the book that we're inheriting over from the co-ops on that end.

So clearly, there's a positive effect that happens in the out years as the leap year continues. That's one dynamic. I think another dynamic to keep in mind is that when you look at our mix shift and how that's evolving, we've actually didn't do the typical seasonality you would see for individuals. So we try to book a little more of an MLR factor in the first quarter. That typically would've been lower, and then you would have a high in the fourth quarter in this case in this case because the new membership we're doing a little more little, I wouldn't call it straight line, but we're trying to get much more of upfront view and a conservative posture. So as that develops again, I would basically put it that we're seeing out '15 play out.

I think it spikes at one of our various options and just kind to help us all recall where we started this journey. We talk a lot about optionality and recognize that we had some choices ahead of us, one, bring it in-house, as you've just described. And other would be to recast our agreement with DSI. Another would be to go to another vendor, et cetera. So we're considering a full range of options. I think, first, I need to preface my remarks by underscoring that we've got probably a couple of years at a minimum before we need to make that call. And quite frankly, these considerations are -- we're actively involved in some sort of the various pluses and minuses of each options. So it's really too early for us to comment on specificity. And I think that to your point, but bringing it in-house, recognizing it's a complex process to do so. It does have costs associated with it. We recognize that. But again, let me underscore, it's not a decision that is imminent. We have, call it, a journey that we have to administer with respect to our ongoing negotiations with ESI regarding our position that we stated to them clearly and now taken the form of a lawsuit. So I direct you do that with respect to the specificity around our engagement with them at this stage. But optionality, again I want to underscore, we are in the development mode on our choices. But none of those choices do we have to exercise in any way of an imminent nature, and so I'd prefer just kind of maybe delay a response to some future date when that is more of an imminent necessity for us to deal with."

Yes, a significant portion of what you signed in MLR is a function of what we've been talking around rate pressure and those rates coming down. I think our outlook for the year in the Medicaid team continues to be consistent with the outlook that we gave when we give guidance initially, and we expect to be at our MLR and trends playing within the levels that we fully expected within the book. So no real surprises there. Relative to Iowa, as you know, we did not book the PDR. We typically expect to have a higher MLR and to lose money early on when the programs rolled out. And then ultimately, the PR requires you to look over the life of the contract, and we expect to be profitability or the like the contract, which is why we don't have a book on it. But because the contract was delayed, obviously, the MLR will reflect that 9 months of activity instead of 10 months, which means that your MLR will be a little bit pressured in the current year, but only by an additional month. The fact that was delayed by month will have a little bit of pressure this year. But obviously, we expect that to come down next year. But we weren't necessarily pleased with membership been delayed in the revenue impact. We actually think that additional month probably played well for the industry in terms of getting into contracts, finalizing its networks, finalizing a matter of hopefully can make this a very strong, profitable book consistent with our historical margins. So we remain optimistic on the program."

I can't emphasize enough that we are very pleased with all the metrics in Q1. But with those metrics, we really thought it was best to maintain a lot of conservatism that we can otherwise potentially release in Q1 until we see how this evolves into Q2. I think it's fair to say that the industry last year, and ourselves included, got to see a lot more of how things developed as last year progressed. So it is taking a much more conservative posture till we see more development. The second thing I would highlight again as we did a highlight that we are covering another $0.03 of assessments from co-ops and maintaining the guidance as well. And then last thing I would say is, in terms of the metrics, we like our G&A where it's at. And we think with some additional membership, this is the SG&A leverage we should have gotten a year ago with exchanges. As you know, it was the deleverage impact to us a year ago. This year, it's going to  be a leverageble impact. And so we're holding the line on G&A. And we again -- if the membership plays out with the risk profile we would expect, then the G&A leverage helps improve the margins. If it doesn't, than the G&A leverage will offset surprises. So I'd love to give you a different answer. But I'm in the reality is we just chose to be conservative in Q1 until we can see how this book of business evolves."

We're pleased to announce first quarter of 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.46, with membership tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.63. I'm pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to 2016 as the company continues to benefit from the growing diversification of our businesses. The complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will allow us to further advance affordability and quality for our members. 
I'm going to start with some overview comments on our first quarter 2016 results, and then we'll discuss a few of the key details of our updated 2016 outlook. First quarter results reflect business performance that tracked well versus our expectations. Specifically, membership is exceeding our expectations, and we reported strong quality of earnings metrics while maintaining appropriate conservativism on our balance sheets to reflect the dynamic nature of the marketplace that exists today. 
Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded membership are tracking ahead of expectations. And we ended the first quarter with 39.6 million members, reflecting growth of 1 million lives or 2.6% since year-end 2015. Specifically, we ended the quarter with 975,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, an increase of 184,000 from year-end 2015 and ahead of our initial expectations. Our self-funded business grew by 906,000 lives or 3.8% in the quarter to 24.6 million members, which was also ahead of our expectations as the company experienced higher-than-expected in-group change in current contracts and BlueCard enrollment. Our Local Group insured enrollment declined by just north of 200,000 lives in the quarter and serves approximately 4 million members as of March 31. In particular, we saw higher-than-expected lapses in plans residing in states that transitioned the 51 to 99 key group size into the small group marketplace. 
Operating revenue was $20.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the first quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The first quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 81.8%, which increased versus prior year, as expected. The 160 basis point increase reflected the impact of an extra calendar day during the quarter from the leap year, a higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid and individual businesses as well as a change in our business mix towards the Government Business division, which carries a higher-than-average benefit expense ratio. While we do not include a reserve rollforward table in our first quarter press release, it is important to note that year-end 2015 reserves have developed moderately better than our expectations so far in 2016. However, we do not believe our first quarter 2016 financial results benefited from that reserve development, and we have maintained an appropriate level of conservativism on our balance sheet as of March 31 for the higher-than-expected individual enrollment. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 15.8% in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by a continued focus on administrative expense control in light of better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business. 
Supporting those strong quality of our earnings in the first quarter, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion or 1.9x net income. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. It is important to note that operating cash flow exceeded our expectations in the quarter, which is encouraging. 
Turning to discuss the first quarter financial performance of our business units. Let me say that in our Commercial business, we reported strong membership trends that came in well above our conservative expectations, increasing by 880,000 during the quarter. In particular, we saw strong self-funded membership trends in both our National and Local Group businesses and better-than-expected individual enrollment on the public exchanges. This contributed to the better-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 1.5% versus the prior year to $9.5 billion. 
Operating margins were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter at 13.6%, which reflects the impact of a higher benefit expense ratio, offset by a lower SG&A expense ratio, as expected. 
We were diligent with respect to pricing our exchange product offerings for 2016, as this remains a dynamic marketplace. We believe we have taken a conservative posture in the first quarter regarding our expectations for the profitability of this book of business for 2016. We believe we are well positioned for continued growth in exchange lives as this market stabilizes to a more sustainable level over time. 
Relating to National Accounts, we're pleased that the team has been able to secure some wins recently that should grow membership in both 2016 and 2017. As we said earlier, Local Group membership was down slightly year-over-year, and we continue to see a funding mix shift away from fully insured. We recognize it is vital to offer affordable products with the right network and benefit design in our markets. And our team is focused on improving the historical trends of this book of business. 
Our Government Business segment had another solid quarter, adding 123,000 members and growing year-over-year revenue by 13.9% to $10.8 billion. It is important to note that our results do not yet include an impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, aside from start-up costs incurred in the quarter ahead of the contract launch, where the implementation was delayed from March 1 to April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 3%, a decline of approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we continue to expect Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the performance of this business appropriately.  Within Medicare, I'm pleased with the progress the team continues to make as our first quarter margins reflect continued improvement versus last year. We continue to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial. We expect $68 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2020, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations and specialized services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care costs and improving quality for their residents. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. Our Days in Claims Payable was 43.4 days as of March 31, an increase of 0.7 days from the 42.7 days as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the timing of claims payments driven by the new membership that came online during the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.2% at March 31, 2016, down 60 basis points from the 40.8% as of December 31, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction of our outstanding balance in the commercial paper during the quarter. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. And our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $639 million as of March 31. For the 3Rs related to the 2015 and 2016 benefit years, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net payable position for risk adjusters and a net neutral position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information. 
Turning to our financial outlook. We have increased our operating revenue expectation for 2016 by $1 billion to between $81 billion and $82 billion. This increase reflects higher projected membership due to the strong enrollment results seen through the first quarter, as we've discussed. Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 14.9 million members at the midpoint of our range at year-end, 250,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the individual and Medicaid businesses. Self-funded membership is now expected to be approximately 24.5 million members at the midpoint of our range at year-end, also 250,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project our total membership to be approximately 700,000 to 900,000 lives higher than we ended in 2015. We continue to expect our 2016 medical loss ratio to be 83.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and now expect our SG&A ratio to be 15.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points, on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of Cigna-related transaction cost incurred during the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We're encouraged with first quarter operating cash flow, and we continue to project operating cash flows to be greater than $3 billion in 2016. 
Regarding capital deployment. We raised our dividend during the first quarter by $0.025 per share and declared our second quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. This represents an annualized dividend of $2.60 per share and continues our track record of increasing our dividend every year since it was implemented in 2011. 
Our 2016 outlook does include some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year. While we did not repurchase any shares through the first quarter, we plan to resume our capital deployment program, subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. 
To conclude, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.65 on a GAAP basis and our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. Our outlook continues to take an appropriately conservative posture around the expected financial performance on the public exchanges and the expected year-over-year margin compression in the Medicaid business. Our outlook does not include the adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments, which we expect to implement in 2017. For context, we estimate the impact in the first quarter of 2016 would have been a benefit to GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.10. Our outlook does include an adverse impact of $0.03 for the additional assessment in 2016 associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op. It's also important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect this acquisition will close in the second half of this year. It also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.

As",567,"Great. A.J., thanks for the question. Good morning. It's Joe. First of all, let me just tell you that we're really pleased overall with how our team has been able to navigate a very challenging landscape that has evolved over the last couple of years. As I stated in my remarks, we're really glad to now be serving 975,000 members across all of our markets, which I think really highlights an incredibly meaningful value proposition to the customers that have chosen to align with us. Over time, we do believe we're well positioned for continued growth in the exchange marketplace if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level, I think that is a key consideration. Clearly, the performance of the exchange marketplaces lagged expectations throughout the industry, as some of our peers have recognized. And in consideration of that, we are monitoring the market very closely to see that our offerings continue to be: number one, very rational, sustainable for the customers, but also it is built on a platform that is constructed appropriately with respect to costs that need to drive our presence in that market. Again, at a very sustainable and appropriate level. We -- I think it's really critical for me to underscore that we are actively engaged with our government partners to help build that long-term sustainable model that we believe will ultimately create an affordable marketplace. And in doing so, we believe we can continue to develop the kind of rate structure in the marketplace that's adequate for us and appropriate in terms of affordability for members. And for example, I think the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2014 sets the stage nicely as we move into that new year with respect to a rate picture. And I think our combination with Cigna is going to present a meaningful improvement in affordability for our membership. So I think, put all that together, we're very kind of pleased with how we've performed this year. We think we're engaged in a fairly sustainable platform that has potential for continued growth, again, underscore, as long as the model that we are engaged in in the marketplace is a sustainable model. Let me close my remarks in that regard by saying that, I think there's some really key drivers to building that sustainable, affordable marketplace that I mentioned. Some of the key elements include what has already been put in place for '17, which is the health insurer tax adjustment. And the second thing would be, I think, a careful consideration of updating the risk adjustment model, further consideration of special enrollment period adjustments, and that would narrow the variety and number of special enrollment considerations. And we'd like to be able to begin offering some very innovative product designs in the marketplace. And hopefully, our government partners will be receptive to some of those creative, innovative models. And finally, I'd like to underscore modification of grace period for nonpayment of premiums to prevent abuse. So when you put all that together in a mosaic, I think, maybe a sustainable model can be built, and we will continue to perform in the marketplace in a way that continues to maybe try to achieve the membership that we had originally anticipated back when this effort first began in '14. Wayne, you may want to speak to the MLR question that A.J. put to us."

The age distribution in subsidy-eligible mix is consistent with those expectations. But I would tell you that we've chosen to maintain a conservative posture in Q1 until we see ultimately how this develops. So we've maintained a conservative posture on risk adjusters despite weekly data that would imply that we should be booking more, and we are really now booking to the normal seasonality profitability. You would see in this book in Q1. Because again, I think, from our perspective, we like to see this membership at least get through 2Q to really understand how the book is performing. So from that perspective, we think it's the prudent thing to do. And then as 2Q evolves, we'll give more commentary on how it's actually developing."

But ultimately, as this business comes on, we'll see how it really develops in Q2. As you know, a lot of the claims activity always has a little bit of a lag when individuals switches to a new carrier. And then ultimately, that reporting time line that occurs with the providers, ultimately to us. So I think in 2Q, we'll get a much better feel. What we want you to be aware of is, one, we're not seeing any early indicators across our broader book on trend or anything that would have us change our overall trend assumptions. Two is, we've maintained a conservative posture going into 2Q around the risk adjuster data and not only for what we believe '15 would true up to be, but what we think the impact would be on '16 in light of this mix. That's not based on just our assumptions, but actually using the updated weekly data we receive as well as some recent CMS data. But as you know, ultimate settlement on those will be very dependent upon who owes the risk adjuster and how that will settle out. So we're going to wait and see how that pans out in 2Q. But I would say, in each of the 3Rs, we've maintained a posture that should give us some contingency if the book doesn't develop as we would've expected. And if it does develop as we would expect, then it would give us some upside going into the second half of this year and into Q2. On the Medicaid front, again no real surprise, it's just a reminder that we had a lot of new markets that we're rolling out. We continue to have that book evolve. As you know, Iowa now starts on April 1 as well. So we would expect to see MLR pressure there in 2Q as well. But consistent with our expectations in new markets that are rolling out and continue to be bullish on the Medicaid top line as well as bottom line. And as we've mentioned previously, we're going to be slow landing those margins down to what we think are more sustainable. And then on the Medicaid regs, no real surprises. We were fine with the new regs, if you will."

And in many cases, we were substantially higher than the next or several next lowest-cost carriers. So it appears to be a little bit of a flight to safety, if you will, and security. And so again, it's another reason why we want to see how this ultimately pans out our pricing. It's obviously much higher than what the -- would've been available in the market. And so the question will be does that adequately reflect the book that we're inheriting over from the co-ops on that end.

So clearly, there is a positive effect that happens in the out years as the leap year continues, that's one dynamic. I think another dynamic to keep in mind is that, when we look at our mix shift and how that's evolving, we've actually didn't do the typical seasonality that you would see for individuals. So we've tried to book a little more of an MLR factor in the first quarter, that typically would have been lower, and then you would have a higher in the fourth quarter in this case because of the new membership we're doing a little more, I wouldn't call it straight line, but we're trying to get much more of a upfront view and a conservative posture. So as that develops again, I would basically put it that we're seeing how '15 played out.

And quite frankly, these considerations are -- we're actively involved in some sort of the various pluses and minuses of each options. So it's really too early for us to comment on specificity. And I think that to your point about bringing it in-house, recognize it's a complex process to do so. It does have costs associated with it. We recognize that. But again, let me underscore, it's not a decision that is imminent. We have, call it, a journey that we have to administer with respect to our ongoing negotiations with ESI regarding our position that we stated to them clearly and now taken the form of a lawsuit. So I direct you to that with respect to the specificity around our engagement with them at this stage. But optionality, again I want to underscore, we are in the development mode on our choices. But none of those choices do we have to exercise in any way of an imminent nature, and so I'd prefer just to kind of maybe delay a response to some future date when that is more of an imminent necessity for us to deal with."

Yes, a significant portion of what you saw in the MLR is a function of what we've been talking around the rate pressure and those rates coming down. I think our outlook for the year on the Medicaid team continues to be consistent with the outlook that we gave when we give guidance initially, and we expect to be at our MLR and trends playing within the levels that we have fully expected within the book. So no real surprises there. Relative to Iowa, as you know, we did not book a PDR. We typically expect to have a higher MLR and to lose money early on when the programs rolled out. And then ultimately, the PR requires you to look over the life of the contract, and we clearly expect it to be a profitability over the life of the contract, which is why we don't have a PDR booked on it. But because the contract was delayed, obviously, the MLR will reflect that 9 months of activity instead of 10 months, which means that your MLR will be a little bit pressured in the current year, but only by an additional month. The fact that it was delayed by a month will create a little bit of pressure this year. But obviously, we expect that to come down next year. But while we weren't necessarily pleased with membership been delayed in the revenue impact, we actually think that additional month probably played well for the industry in terms of getting into contracts, finalizing its networks, finalize in a manner that hopefully can make this a very strong, profitable book consistent with our historical margins. So we remain optimistic on the program."

I can't emphasize enough that we are very pleased with all the metrics in Q1. But with those metrics, we really thought it was best to maintain a lot of conservatism that we could have otherwise potentially released in Q1 until we see how this book evolves into Q2. I think it's fair to say that the industry last year, and ourselves included, got to see a lot more of how things developed as last year progressed. So we're just taking a much more conservative posture till we see more development. The second thing I would highlight again is, we did highlight that we are covering another $0.03 of assessments from co-ops and maintaining that guidance as well. And then last thing I would say is that, in terms of the metrics, we like our G&A where it's at. And we think with this additional membership, this is the G&A leverage we should have gotten a year ago with exchanges. As you know, it was a deleverage impact to us a year ago. This year, it's going to  be a leverageble impact. And so we're holding a line on G&A. And we again -- if the membership plays out with the risk profile we would expect, then that G&A leverage helps improve the margins. If it doesn't, then the G&A leverage helps offset any surprises. So I'd love to give you a different answer. But I mean, the reality is, we just chose to be conservative in Q1 until we can see how this book of business evolves."

We did expect a fairly sizable uptick in trend in Q1 regarding really hep C. And we saw that, which is good and the good news is at least on a rolling 3-month average we looked at it, it seems to be playing right in line with our expectations, slightly better than our expectations, but I would tell you that we're not going to bank that yet because we think there maybe some warehousing because there is new geno-type drugs that are coming out that people may be holding off on until those are available. So I think ultimately, when I look at what could be the big surprise items like a hep C or a flu or other items, everything seems to be playing pretty well relative to our expectations.

We're pleased to announce first quarter of 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.46, with membership tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.63. I'm pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to 2016 as the company continues to benefit from the growing diversification of our businesses. The complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will allow us to further advance affordability and quality for our members. 
I'm going to start with some overview comments on our first quarter 2016 results, and then we'll discuss a few of the key details of our updated 2016 outlook. First quarter results reflect business performance that tracked well versus our expectations. Specifically, membership is exceeding our expectations, and we reported strong quality of earnings metrics while maintaining appropriate conservativism on our balance sheets to reflect the dynamic nature of the marketplace that exists today. 
Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded membership are tracking ahead of expectations. And we ended the first quarter with 39.6 million members, reflecting growth of 1 million lives or 2.6% since year-end 2015. Specifically, we ended the quarter with 975,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, an increase of 184,000 from year-end 2015 and ahead of our initial expectations. Our self-funded business grew by 906,000 lives or 3.8% in the quarter to 24.6 million members, which was also ahead of our expectations as the company experienced higher-than-expected in-group change in current contracts and BlueCard enrollment. Our Local Group insured enrollment declined by just north of 200,000 lives in the quarter and serves approximately 4 million members as of March 31. In particular, we saw higher-than-expected lapses in plans residing in states that transitioned the 51 to 99 key group size into the small group marketplace. 
Operating revenue was $20.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the first quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The first quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 81.8%, which increased versus prior year, as expected. The 160 basis point increase reflected the impact of an extra calendar day during the quarter from the leap year, a higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid and individual businesses as well as a change in our business mix towards the Government Business division, which carries a higher-than-average benefit expense ratio. While we do not include a reserve roll forward table in our first quarter press release, it is important to note that year-end 2015 reserves have developed moderately better than our expectations so far in 2016. However, we do not believe our first quarter 2016 financial results benefited from that reserve development, and we have maintained an appropriate level of conservativism on our balance sheet as of March 31 for the higher-than-expected individual enrollment. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 15.8% in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by a continued focus on administrative expense control in light of better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business. 
Supporting those strong quality of our earnings in the first quarter, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion or 1.9x net income. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. It is important to note that operating cash flow exceeded our expectations in the quarter, which is encouraging. 
Turning to discuss the first quarter financial performance of our business units. Let me say that in our Commercial business, we reported strong membership trends that came in well above our conservative expectations, increasing by 880,000 during the quarter. In particular, we saw strong self-funded membership trends in both our National and Local Group businesses and better-than-expected individual enrollment on the public exchanges. This contributed to the better-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 1.5% versus the prior year to $9.5 billion. 
Operating margins were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter at 13.6%, which reflects the impact of a higher benefit expense ratio, offset by a lower SG&A expense ratio, as expected. 
We were diligent with respect to pricing our exchange product offerings for 2016, as this remains a dynamic marketplace. We believe we have taken a conservative posture in the first quarter regarding our expectations for the profitability of this book of business for 2016. We believe we are well positioned for continued growth in exchange lives as this market stabilizes to a more sustainable level over time. 
Relating to National Accounts, we're pleased that the team has been able to secure some wins recently that should grow membership in both 2016 and 2017. As we said earlier, Local Group membership was down slightly year-over-year, and we continue to see a funding mix shift away from fully insured. We recognize it is vital to offer affordable products with the right network and benefit design in our markets. And our team is focused on improving the historical trends of this book of business. 
Our Government Business segment had another solid quarter, adding 123,000 members and growing year-over-year revenue by 13.9% to $10.8 billion. It is important to note that our results do not yet include an impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, aside from start-up costs incurred in the quarter ahead of the contract launch, where the implementation was delayed from March 1 to April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 3%, a decline of approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we continue to expect Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the performance of this business appropriately.  Within Medicare, I'm pleased with the progress the team continues to make as our first quarter margins reflect continued improvement versus last year. We continue to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial. We expect $68 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2020, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations and specialized services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care costs and improving quality for their residents. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. Our Days in Claims Payable was 43.4 days as of March 31, an increase of 0.7 days from the 42.7 days as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the timing of claims payments driven by the new membership that came online during the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.2% at March 31, 2016, down 60 basis points from the 40.8% as of December 31, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction of our outstanding balance in the commercial paper during the quarter. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. And our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $639 million as of March 31. For the 3Rs related to the 2015 and 2016 benefit years, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net payable position for risk adjusters and a net neutral position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information. 
Turning to our financial outlook. We have increased our operating revenue expectation for 2016 by $1 billion to between $81 billion and $82 billion. This increase reflects higher projected membership due to the strong enrollment results seen through the first quarter, as we've discussed. Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 14.9 million members at the midpoint of our range at year-end, 250,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the individual and Medicaid businesses. Self-funded membership is now expected to be approximately 24.5 million members at the midpoint of our range at year-end, also 250,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project our total membership to be approximately 700,000 to 900,000 lives higher than we ended in 2015. We continue to expect our 2016 medical loss ratio to be 83.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and now expect our SG&A ratio to be 15.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points, on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of Cigna-related transaction cost incurred during the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We're encouraged with first quarter operating cash flow, and we continue to project operating cash flows to be greater than $3 billion in 2016. 
Regarding capital deployment. We raised our dividend during the first quarter by $0.025 per share and declared our second quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. This represents an annualized dividend of $2.60 per share and continues our track record of increasing our dividend every year since it was implemented in 2011. 
Our 2016 outlook does include some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year. While we did not repurchase any shares through the first quarter, we plan to resume our capital deployment program, subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. 
To conclude, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.65 on a GAAP basis and our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. Our outlook continues to take an appropriately conservative posture around the expected financial performance on the public exchanges and the expected year-over-year margin compression in the Medicaid business. Our outlook does not include the adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments, which we expect to implement in 2017. For context, we estimate the impact in the first quarter of 2016 would have been a benefit to GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.10. Our outlook does include an adverse impact of $0.03 for the additional assessment in 2016 associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op. It's also important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect this acquisition will close in the second half of this year. It also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.

It's Joe. First of all, let me just tell you that we're really pleased overall with how our team has been able to navigate a very challenging landscape that has evolved over the last couple of years. As",567,"Great. A.J., thanks for the question. Good morning. It's Joe. First of all, let me just tell you that we're really pleased overall with how our team has been able to navigate a very challenging landscape that has evolved over the last couple of years. As I stated in my remarks, we're really glad to now be serving 975,000 members across all of our markets, which I think really highlights an incredibly meaningful value proposition to the customers that have chosen to align with us. Over time, we do believe we're well positioned for continued growth in the exchange marketplace if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level, I think that is a key consideration. Clearly, the performance of the exchange marketplaces lagged expectations throughout the industry, as some of our peers have recognized. And in consideration of that, we are monitoring the market very closely to see that our offerings continue to be: number one, very rational, sustainable for the customers, but also it is built on a platform that is constructed appropriately with respect to costs that need to drive our presence in that market. Again, at a very sustainable and appropriate level. We -- I think it's really critical for me to underscore that we are actively engaged with our government partners to help build that long-term sustainable model that we believe will ultimately create an affordable marketplace. And in doing so, we believe we can continue to develop the kind of rate structure in the marketplace that's adequate for us and appropriate in terms of affordability for members. And for example, I think the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2014 sets the stage nicely as we move into that new year with respect to a rate picture. And I think our combination with Cigna is going to present a meaningful improvement in affordability for our membership. So I think, put all that together, we're very kind of pleased with how we've performed this year. We think we're engaged in a fairly sustainable platform that has potential for continued growth, again, underscore, as long as the model that we are engaged in, in the marketplace is a sustainable model. Let me close my remarks in that regard by saying that, I think there's some really key drivers to building that sustainable, affordable marketplace that I mentioned. Some of the key elements include what has already been put in place for '17, which is the health insurer tax adjustment. And the second thing would be, I think, a careful consideration of updating the risk adjustment model, further consideration of special enrollment period adjustments, and that would narrow the variety and number of special enrollment considerations. And we'd like to be able to begin offering some very innovative product designs in the marketplace. And hopefully, our government partners will be receptive to some of those creative, innovative models. And finally, I'd like to underscore modification of grace period for nonpayment of premiums to prevent abuse. So when you put all that together in a mosaic, I think, maybe a sustainable model can be built, and we will continue to perform in the marketplace in a way that continues to maybe try to achieve the membership that we had originally anticipated back when this effort first began in '14. Wayne, you may want to speak to the MLR question that A.J. put to us."

The age distribution in subsidy-eligible mix is consistent with those expectations. But I would tell you that we've chosen to maintain a conservative posture in Q1 until we see ultimately how this develops. So we've maintained a conservative posture on risk adjusters despite Wakely data that would imply that we should be booking more, and we are really now booking to the normal seasonality profitability. You would see in this book in Q1. Because again, I think, from our perspective, we like to see this membership at least get through 2Q to really understand how the book is performing. So from that perspective, we think it's the prudent thing to do. And then as 2Q evolves, we'll give more commentary on how it's actually developing."

But ultimately, as this business comes on, we'll see how it really develops in Q2. As you know, a lot of the claims activity always has a little bit of a lag when individuals switches to a new carrier. And then ultimately, that reporting time line that occurs with the providers, ultimately to us. So I think in 2Q, we'll get a much better feel. What we want you to be aware of is, one, we're not seeing any early indicators across our broader book on trend or anything that would have us change our overall trend assumptions. Two is, we've maintained a conservative posture going into 2Q around the risk adjuster data and not only for what we believe '15 would true up to be, but what we think the impact would be on '16 in light of this mix. That's not based on just our assumptions, but actually using the updated Wakely data we receive as well as some recent CMS data. But as you know, ultimate settlement on those will be very dependent upon who owes the risk adjuster and how that will settle out. So we're going to wait and see how that pans out in 2Q. But I would say, in each of the 3Rs, we've maintained a posture that should give us some contingency if the book doesn't develop as we would've expected. And if it does develop as we would expect, then it would give us some upside going into the second half of this year and into Q2. On the Medicaid front, again no real surprise, it's just a reminder that we had a lot of new markets that we're rolling out. We continue to have that book evolve. As you know, Iowa now starts on April 1 as well. So we would expect to see MLR pressure there in 2Q as well. But consistent with our expectations in new markets that are rolling out and continue to be bullish on the Medicaid top line as well as bottom line. And as we've mentioned previously, we're going to be slow landing those margins down to what we think are more sustainable. And then on the Medicaid regs, no real surprises. We were fine with the new regs that came out."

And in many cases, we were substantially higher than the next or several next lowest-cost carriers. So it appears to be a little bit of a flight to safety, if you will, and security. And so again, it's another reason why we want to see how this ultimately pans out our pricing. It's obviously much higher than what the -- would've been available in the market. And so the question will be does that adequately reflect the book that we're inheriting over from the co-ops on that end.

So clearly, there is a positive effect that happens in the out years as the leap year continues, that's one dynamic. I think another dynamic to keep in mind is that, when we look at our mix shift and how that's evolving, we've actually didn't do the typical seasonality that you would see for individuals. So we've tried to book a little more of an MLR factor in the first quarter, that typically would have been lower, and then you would have a higher in the fourth quarter in this case because of the new membership we're doing a little more, I wouldn't call it straight line, but we're trying to get much more of a upfront view and a conservative posture. So as that develops again, I would basically put it that we're seeing how '15 played out.

And quite frankly, these considerations are -- we're actively involved in some sort of the various pluses and minuses of each options. So it's really too early for us to comment on specificity. And I think that to your point about bringing it in-house, recognize it's a complex process to do so. It does have costs associated with it. We recognize that. But again, let me underscore, it's not a decision that is imminent. We have, call it, a journey that we have to administer with respect to our ongoing negotiations with ESI regarding our position that we stated to them clearly and now taken the form of a lawsuit. So I direct you to that with respect to the specificity around our engagement with them at this stage. But optionality, again I want to underscore, we are in the development mode on our choices. But none of those choices do we have to exercise in any way of an imminent nature, and so I'd prefer just to kind of maybe delay a response to some future date when that is more of an imminent necessity for us to deal with."

Yes, a significant portion of what you saw in the MLR is a function of what we've been talking around the rate pressure and those rates coming down. I think our outlook for the year on the Medicaid team continues to be consistent with the outlook that we gave when we give guidance initially, and we expect to be at our MLR and trends playing within the levels that we have fully expected within the book. So no real surprises there. Relative to Iowa, as you know, we did not book a PDR. We typically expect to have a higher MLR and to lose money early on when the programs rolled out. And then ultimately, the PR requires you to look over the life of the contract, and we clearly expect it to be a profitability over the life of the contract, which is why we don't have a PDR booked on it. But because the contract was delayed, obviously, the MLR will reflect that 9 months of activity instead of 10 months, which means that your MLR will be a little bit pressured in the current year, but only by an additional month. The fact that it was delayed by a month will create a little bit of pressure this year. But obviously, we expect that to come down next year. But while we weren't necessarily pleased with membership been delayed in the revenue impact, we actually think that additional month probably played well for the industry in terms of getting into contracts, finalizing its networks, finalize in a manner that hopefully can make this a very strong, profitable book consistent with our historical margins. So we remain optimistic on the program."

I can't emphasize enough that we are very pleased with all the metrics in Q1. But with those metrics, we really thought it was best to maintain a lot of conservatism that we could have otherwise potentially released in Q1 until we see how this book evolves into Q2. I think it's fair to say that the industry last year, and ourselves included, got to see a lot more of how things developed as last year progressed. So we're just taking a much more conservative posture till we see more development. The second thing I would highlight again is, we did highlight that we are covering another $0.03 of assessments from co-ops and maintaining that guidance as well. And then last thing I would say is that, in terms of the metrics, we like our G&A where it's at. And we think with this additional membership, this is the G&A leverage we should have gotten a year ago with exchanges. As you know, it was a deleverage impact to us a year ago. This year, it's going to  be a leverageable impact. And so we're holding a line on G&A. And we again -- if the membership plays out with the risk profile we would expect, then that G&A leverage helps improve the margins. If it doesn't, then the G&A leverage helps offset any surprises. So I'd love to give you a different answer. But I mean, the reality is, we just chose to be conservative in Q1 until we can see how this book of business evolves."

We did expect a fairly sizable uptick in trend in Q1 regarding really hep C. And we saw that, which is good and the good news is at least on a rolling 3-month average we looked at it, it seems to be playing right in line with our expectations, slightly better than our expectations, but I would tell you that we're not going to bank that yet because we think there maybe some warehousing because there is new geno-type drugs that are coming out that people may be holding off on until those are available. So I think ultimately, when I look at what could be the big surprise items like a hep C or a flu or other items, everything seems to be playing pretty well relative to our expectations.

We're pleased to announce first quarter of 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.46, with membership tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.63. I'm pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to 2016 as the company continues to benefit from the growing diversification of our businesses. The complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will allow us to further advance affordability and quality for our members. 
I'm going to start with some overview comments on our first quarter 2016 results, and then we'll discuss a few of the key details of our updated 2016 outlook. First quarter results reflect business performance that tracked well versus our expectations. Specifically, membership is exceeding our expectations, and we reported strong quality of earnings metrics while maintaining appropriate conservativism on our balance sheets to reflect the dynamic nature of the marketplace that exists today. 
Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded membership are tracking ahead of expectations. And we ended the first quarter with 39.6 million members, reflecting growth of 1 million lives or 2.6% since year-end 2015. Specifically, we ended the quarter with 975,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, an increase of 184,000 from year-end 2015 and ahead of our initial expectations. Our self-funded business grew by 906,000 lives or 3.8% in the quarter to 24.6 million members, which was also ahead of our expectations as the company experienced higher-than-expected in-group change in current contracts and BlueCard enrollment. Our Local Group insured enrollment declined by just north of 200,000 lives in the quarter and serves approximately 4 million members as of March 31. In particular, we saw higher-than-expected lapses in plans residing in states that transitioned the 51 to 99 key group size into the small group marketplace. 
Operating revenue was $20.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the first quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The first quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 81.8%, which increased versus prior year, as expected. The 160 basis point increase reflected the impact of an extra calendar day during the quarter from the leap year, a higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid and individual businesses as well as a change in our business mix towards the Government Business division, which carries a higher-than-average benefit expense ratio. While we do not include a reserve roll forward table in our first quarter press release, it is important to note that year-end 2015 reserves have developed moderately better than our expectations so far in 2016. However, we do not believe our first quarter 2016 financial results benefited from that reserve development, and we have maintained an appropriate level of conservativism on our balance sheet as of March 31 for the higher-than-expected individual enrollment. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 15.8% in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by a continued focus on administrative expense control in light of better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business. 
Supporting those strong quality of our earnings in the first quarter, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion or 1.9x net income. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. It is important to note that operating cash flow exceeded our expectations in the quarter, which is encouraging. 
Turning to discuss the first quarter financial performance of our business units. Let me say that in our Commercial business, we reported strong membership trends that came in well above our conservative expectations, increasing by 880,000 during the quarter. In particular, we saw strong self-funded membership trends in both our National and Local Group businesses and better-than-expected individual enrollment on the public exchanges. This contributed to the better-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 1.5% versus the prior year to $9.5 billion. 
Operating margins were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter at 13.6%, which reflects the impact of a higher benefit expense ratio, offset by a lower SG&A expense ratio, as expected. 
We were diligent with respect to pricing our exchange product offerings for 2016, as this remains a dynamic marketplace. We believe we have taken a conservative posture in the first quarter regarding our expectations for the profitability of this book of business for 2016. We believe we are well positioned for continued growth in exchange lives as this market stabilizes to a more sustainable level over time. 
Relating to National Accounts, we're pleased that the team has been able to secure some wins recently that should grow membership in both 2016 and 2017. As we said earlier, Local Group membership was down slightly year-over-year, and we continue to see a funding mix shift away from fully insured. We recognize it is vital to offer affordable products with the right network and benefit design in our markets. And our team is focused on improving the historical trends of this book of business. 
Our Government Business segment had another solid quarter, adding 123,000 members and growing year-over-year revenue by 13.9% to $10.8 billion. It is important to note that our results do not yet include an impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, aside from start-up costs incurred in the quarter ahead of the contract launch, where the implementation was delayed from March 1 to April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 3%, a decline of approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we continue to expect Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the performance of this business appropriately. Within Medicare, I'm pleased with the progress the team continues to make as our first quarter margins reflect continued improvement versus last year. We continue to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial. We expect $68 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2020, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations and specialized services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care costs and improving quality for their residents. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. Our Days in Claims Payable was 43.4 days as of March 31, an increase of 0.7 days from the 42.7 days as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the timing of claims payments driven by the new membership that came online during the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.2% at March 31, 2016, down 60 basis points from the 40.8% as of December 31, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction of our outstanding balance in the commercial paper during the quarter. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. And our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $639 million as of March 31. For the 3Rs related to the 2015 and 2016 benefit years, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net payable position for risk adjusters and a net neutral position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information. 
Turning to our financial outlook. We have increased our operating revenue expectation for 2016 by $1 billion to between $81 billion and $82 billion. This increase reflects higher projected membership due to the strong enrollment results seen through the first quarter, as we've discussed. Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 14.9 million members at the midpoint of our range at year-end, 250,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the individual and Medicaid businesses. Self-funded membership is now expected to be approximately 24.5 million members at the midpoint of our range at year-end, also 250,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project our total membership to be approximately 700,000 to 900,000 lives higher than we ended in 2015. We continue to expect our 2016 medical loss ratio to be 83.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and now expect our SG&A ratio to be 15.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points, on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of Cigna-related transaction cost incurred during the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We're encouraged with first quarter operating cash flow, and we continue to project operating cash flows to be greater than $3 billion in 2016. 
Regarding capital deployment. We raised our dividend during the first quarter by $0.025 per share and declared our second quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. This represents an annualized dividend of $2.60 per share and continues our track record of increasing our dividend every year since it was implemented in 2011. 
Our 2016 outlook does include some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year. While we did not repurchase any shares through the first quarter, we plan to resume our capital deployment program, subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. 
To conclude, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.65 on a GAAP basis and our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. Our outlook continues to take an appropriately conservative posture around the expected financial performance on the public exchanges and the expected year-over-year margin compression in the Medicaid business. Our outlook does not include the adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments, which we expect to implement in 2017. For context, we estimate the impact in the first quarter of 2016 would have been a benefit to GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.10. Our outlook does include an adverse impact of $0.03 for the additional assessment in 2016 associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op. It's also important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect this acquisition will close in the second half of this year. It also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.

It's Joe. First of all, let me just tell you that we're really pleased overall with how our team has been able to navigate a very challenging landscape that has evolved over the last couple of years. As",567,"Great. A.J., thanks for the question. Good morning. It's Joe. First of all, let me just tell you that we're really pleased overall with how our team has been able to navigate a very challenging landscape that has evolved over the last couple of years. As I stated in my remarks, we're really glad to now be serving 975,000 members across all of our markets, which I think really highlights an incredibly meaningful value proposition to the customers that have chosen to align with us. Over time, we do believe we're well positioned for continued growth in the exchange marketplace if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level, I think that is a key consideration. Clearly, the performance of the exchange marketplaces lagged expectations throughout the industry, as some of our peers have recognized. And in consideration of that, we are monitoring the market very closely to see that our offerings continue to be: number one, very rational, sustainable for the customers, but also it is built on a platform that is constructed appropriately with respect to costs that need to drive our presence in that market. Again, at a very sustainable and appropriate level. We -- I think it's really critical for me to underscore that we are actively engaged with our government partners to help build that long-term sustainable model that we believe will ultimately create an affordable marketplace. And in doing so, we believe we can continue to develop the kind of rate structure in the marketplace that's adequate for us and appropriate in terms of affordability for members. And for example, I think the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2014 sets the stage nicely as we move into that new year with respect to a rate picture. And I think our combination with Cigna is going to present a meaningful improvement in affordability for our membership. So I think, put all that together, we're very kind of pleased with how we've performed this year. We think we're engaged in a fairly sustainable platform that has potential for continued growth, again, underscore, as long as the model that we are engaged in, in the marketplace is a sustainable model. Let me close my remarks in that regard by saying that, I think there's some really key drivers to building that sustainable, affordable marketplace that I mentioned. Some of the key elements include what has already been put in place for '17, which is the health insurer tax adjustment. And the second thing would be, I think, a careful consideration of updating the risk adjustment model, further consideration of special enrollment period adjustments, and that would narrow the variety and number of special enrollment considerations. And we'd like to be able to begin offering some very innovative product designs in the marketplace. And hopefully, our government partners will be receptive to some of those creative, innovative models. And finally, I'd like to underscore modification of grace period for nonpayment of premiums to prevent abuse. So when you put all that together in a mosaic, I think, maybe a sustainable model can be built, and we will continue to perform in the marketplace in a way that continues to maybe try to achieve the membership that we had originally anticipated back when this effort first began in '14. Wayne, you may want to speak to the MLR question that A.J. put to us."

The age distribution in subsidy-eligible mix is consistent with those expectations. But I would tell you that we've chosen to maintain a conservative posture in Q1 until we see ultimately how this develops. So we've maintained a conservative posture on risk adjusters despite Wakely data that would imply that we should be booking more, and we are really now booking to the normal seasonality profitability. You would see in this book in Q1. Because again, I think, from our perspective, we like to see this membership at least get through 2Q to really understand how the book is performing. So from that perspective, we think it's the prudent thing to do. And then as 2Q evolves, we'll give more commentary on how it's actually developing."

But ultimately, as this business comes on, we'll see how it really develops in Q2. As you know, a lot of the claims activity always has a little bit of a lag when individuals switches to a new carrier. And then ultimately, that reporting time line that occurs with the providers, ultimately to us. So I think in 2Q, we'll get a much better feel. What we want you to be aware of is, one, we're not seeing any early indicators across our broader book on trend or anything that would have us change our overall trend assumptions. Two is, we've maintained a conservative posture going into 2Q around the risk adjuster data and not only for what we believe '15 would true up to be, but what we think the impact would be on '16 in light of this mix. That's not based on just our assumptions, but actually using the updated Wakely data we receive as well as some recent CMS data. But as you know, ultimate settlement on those will be very dependent upon who owes the risk adjuster and how that will settle out. So we're going to wait and see how that pans out in 2Q. But I would say, in each of the 3Rs, we've maintained a posture that should give us some contingency if the book doesn't develop as we would've expected. And if it does develop as we would expect, then it would give us some upside going into the second half of this year and into Q2. On the Medicaid front, again no real surprise, it's just a reminder that we had a lot of new markets that we're rolling out. We continue to have that book evolve. As you know, Iowa now starts on April 1 as well. So we would expect to see MLR pressure there in 2Q as well. But consistent with our expectations in new markets that are rolling out and continue to be bullish on the Medicaid top line as well as bottom line. And as we've mentioned previously, we're going to be slow landing those margins down to what we think are more sustainable. And then on the Medicaid regs, no real surprises. We were fine with the new regs that came out."

And in many cases, we were substantially higher than the next or several next lowest-cost carriers. So it appears to be a little bit of a flight to safety, if you will, and security. And so again, it's another reason why we want to see how this ultimately pans out our pricing. It's obviously much higher than what the -- would've been available in the market. And so the question will be does that adequately reflect the book that we're inheriting over from the co-ops on that end.

So clearly, there is a positive effect that happens in the out years as the leap year continues, that's one dynamic. I think another dynamic to keep in mind is that, when we look at our mix shift and how that's evolving, we've actually didn't do the typical seasonality that you would see for individuals. So we've tried to book a little more of an MLR factor in the first quarter, that typically would have been lower, and then you would have a higher in the fourth quarter in this case because of the new membership we're doing a little more, I wouldn't call it straight line, but we're trying to get much more of a upfront view and a conservative posture. So as that develops again, I would basically put it that we're seeing how '15 played out.

And quite frankly, these considerations are -- we're actively involved in some sort of the various pluses and minuses of each options. So it's really too early for us to comment on specificity. And I think that to your point about bringing it in-house, recognize it's a complex process to do so. It does have costs associated with it. We recognize that. But again, let me underscore, it's not a decision that is imminent. We have, call it, a journey that we have to administer with respect to our ongoing negotiations with ESI regarding our position that we stated to them clearly and now taken the form of a lawsuit. So I direct you to that with respect to the specificity around our engagement with them at this stage. But optionality, again I want to underscore, we are in the development mode on our choices. But none of those choices do we have to exercise in any way of an imminent nature, and so I'd prefer just to kind of maybe delay a response to some future date when that is more of an imminent necessity for us to deal with."

Yes, a significant portion of what you saw in the MLR is a function of what we've been talking around the rate pressure and those rates coming down. I think our outlook for the year on the Medicaid team continues to be consistent with the outlook that we gave when we give guidance initially, and we expect to be at our MLR and trends playing within the levels that we have fully expected within the book. So no real surprises there. Relative to Iowa, as you know, we did not book a PDR. We typically expect to have a higher MLR and to lose money early on when the programs rolled out. And then ultimately, the PR requires you to look over the life of the contract, and we clearly expect it to be a profitability over the life of the contract, which is why we don't have a PDR booked on it. But because the contract was delayed, obviously, the MLR will reflect that 9 months of activity instead of 10 months, which means that your MLR will be a little bit pressured in the current year, but only by an additional month. The fact that it was delayed by a month will create a little bit of pressure this year. But obviously, we expect that to come down next year. But while we weren't necessarily pleased with membership been delayed in the revenue impact, we actually think that additional month probably played well for the industry in terms of getting into contracts, finalizing its networks, finalize in a manner that hopefully can make this a very strong, profitable book consistent with our historical margins. So we remain optimistic on the program."

I can't emphasize enough that we are very pleased with all the metrics in Q1. But with those metrics, we really thought it was best to maintain a lot of conservatism that we could have otherwise potentially released in Q1 until we see how this book evolves into Q2. I think it's fair to say that the industry last year, and ourselves included, got to see a lot more of how things developed as last year progressed. So we're just taking a much more conservative posture till we see more development. The second thing I would highlight again is, we did highlight that we are covering another $0.03 of assessments from co-ops and maintaining that guidance as well. And then last thing I would say is that, in terms of the metrics, we like our G&A where it's at. And we think with this additional membership, this is the G&A leverage we should have gotten a year ago with exchanges. As you know, it was a deleverage impact to us a year ago. This year, it's going to be a leverageable impact. And so we're holding a line on G&A. And we again -- if the membership plays out with the risk profile we would expect, then that G&A leverage helps improve the margins. If it doesn't, then the G&A leverage helps offset any surprises. So I'd love to give you a different answer. But I mean, the reality is, we just chose to be conservative in Q1 until we can see how this book of business evolves."

And at the same time, though, to the extent that we're limited on actions, to make sure people understand in the pricing that goes with it.

And we saw that, which is good and the good news is at least on a rolling 3-month average we looked at it, it seems to be playing right in line with our expectations, slightly better than our expectations, but I would tell you that we're not going to bank that yet because we think there may be some warehousing because there is new geno-type drugs that are coming out that people may be holding off on until those are available.

This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91. Befor",925,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91. 
Before John and I discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our updated 2016 outlook, I think it's appropriate to discuss our perspective on the latest Cigna developments. I'll start by saying we are disappointed by the U.S. Department of Justice's position to block Anthem's acquisition of Cigna, a combination specifically designed to tackle our health care systems challenges head on and deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high-quality affordable health care. To be clear, our board and executive leadership team at Anthem is fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court. 
As you may have read in Tuesday's published op-ed, the DOJ has disregarded the issue of access for 2 of the most unstable and at high risk health insurance markets, individuals and small businesses. These populations comprise a meaningful proportion of the still more than 33 million uninsured Americans who will benefit from the Cigna acquisition through expanded and improved access, affordability and quality. 
For example, despite the many and continuing challenges of the health insurance exchanges, Anthem entered into this new and high-risk market at its inception. Though several of our competitors have exited this business, we now serve 923,000 public exchange members across 14 states where we do business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan. As shared with the DOJ, our acquisition of Cigna will help stabilize pricing in this volatile market, enabling Anthem to continue its commitment to the public exchanges and provide the opportunity to expand our participation to 9 additional states where neither Anthem nor Cigna currently participate. Additionally, we estimate this acquisition will significantly lower cost for our self-funded consumers with over $2 billion in medical cost savings that we passed directly back to them. 
Finally, we also note this acquisition will benefit our shareholders and the pension, retirement and investment funds that they represent. Specifically, 99% of our shareholders voted in favor of this transaction. 
Now to discuss consolidated financials we reported this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.33 was slightly ahead of our expectations, albeit with mixed financial metrics to get us there. Within membership, both fully-insured and self-funded memberships are tracking ahead of expectations as we ended the second quarter with nearly 39.8 million members. This reflects growth of an additional 148,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.2 million lives or 3%. Specifically, our insured membership increased by 170,000 lives as our Medicaid business grew by a better-than-expected 280,000 lives in the quarter to over 6.3 million members. This reflected better-than-expected enrollment growth from the implementation of the Iowa State contract, which started on April 1, as well as better-than-expected core membership growth within multiple other state contracts. 
Within Commercial, our insured enrollment came in line with expectations. We ended the quarter with 923,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, a decrease of 52,000 from the 975,000 we reported in the first quarter. And Local Group insured business declined modestly and in line with our most recent expectations. 
Our self-funded business was relatively stable during the quarter, which was better than our previous expectations, as we experienced higher-than-expected growth in membership in existing accounts. Our membership results translated into better-than-expected operating revenue of $21.3 billion. Our second quarter 2016 results represent an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue, as a result of our strong self-funded memberships trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our commercial business. 
The second quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 84.2%, which increased by 210 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was partially driven by a higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid business as our medical cost experience exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments and the impact of growth in membership, which the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the individual business and the timing of higher medical cost experience in the Local Group business. The increase was partially offset by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates in our ACA-compliant individual and small group products. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at a better than previously expected 14% in the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of 140 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control, coupled with better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business, which carries a lower than a consolidated average SG&A ratio. 
We reported operating cash flows of approximately $2 billion or 1.3x net income during the first 6 months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $662 million or 0.8x net income. As a reminder, we did make our first and second quarter income tax payments during the second quarter, consistent with prior years. 
I'll now turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, John Gallina, to discuss our business segments quarterly results and our updated 2016 outlook in more detail. John?"

Turning to discuss the second quarter financial performance of our business units. We added 290,000 members in our Government Business during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 9.5% to $11.4 billion. These results now include the impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 4%, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we have been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level. We're monitoring rate environment for the remainder of the year. 
During the quarter, we also experienced higher-than-expected claims across Medicaid businesses with the most notable market being the newly implemented Iowa contract. It is important to note that it is not uncommon to have early challenges in a new market, and our team has a long track record of successfully identifying and implementing revenue and cost of care initiatives to help mitigate issues. We will continue to work collaboratively with our state partner to ensure program stability and high-quality care for Iowa's citizens. 
Within Medicare, we are pleased with the progress the team continues to make, and our year-to-date margins continue to reflect improvement versus last year. Our outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term sustainable levels, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid businesses remained substantial with an estimated $78 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. A little more than 3/4 of this opportunity is in new and specialized services, with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint position us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care costs and improving quality for their residents. 
Switching to our Commercial business. Our enrollment decreased by 142,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced second quarter declines of 86,000 and 51,000 lives in our individual and national businesses, respectively. The better-than-expected enrollment results contributed to a higher-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 5.7% versus the prior year quarter to $9.9 billion. 
Our second quarter operating margin of 10.9% was 120 basis points higher than the 9.7% we reported in the second quarter of 2015. The increase was driven by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates recorded during the quarter, a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative costs resulting from expense efficiency initiatives and growth in self-funded enrollment, which carries a higher-than-average operating margin. This increase was partially offset by higher medical cost experience in individual ACA-compliant products and the timing of medical cost experience in our Local Group business. 
Within our individual ACA-compliant population, we had previously taken a conservative stance on our balance sheet with respect to various different estimates. This conservatism was very prudent as our current period claims trends have been higher than expected. We have seen higher-than-expected cost from membership with chronic conditions such as renal disease, COPD, heart disease and diabetes, along with signs of pent-up demand among our new members. We have experienced higher-than-expected payments for dialysis treatments during the first half of the year, which we're in the process of reviewing the drivers of this increase. All in, our updated outlook now expects the individual ACA-compliant business to incur mid-single-digit operating margin losses for the 2016 benefit year. 
It is important to note that we have assumed the higher-than-expected claims rate experienced thus far in the year will continue for the remainder of 2016 in developing our 2017 pricing assumptions. To be clear, we believe our pricing for 2017 fully incorporates our current expectations for 2016 claims, and we are focused on returning to profitability in 2017. 
Relating to national accounts, we continue to be pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $726 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid to high single-digit margins for average deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of June 30, 2016. 
Our Days in Claims Payable is 40.6 days as of June 30, a decrease of 2.8 days from the 43.4 days as of March 31. The decrease is in line with our expectations and consistent with the level of decreased seen between the first and second quarter of 2015. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down and closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.1% at June 30, 2016, now 110 basis points from the 40.2% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction in our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $958 million as of June 30. 
For the 3Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate, and we continue to establish a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. 
For risk adjusters, the recent information from CMS shows us in a net receivable position, primarily in our small group market. We have recorded a valuation allowance against certain risk-adjusted receivables in some of our markets based on our assessment of the financial solvency of co-op organizations that are payers into the risk-adjusted program. There is a belief that these receivables may ultimately not be collected. 
As we have said in recent months and in the results we reported this morning, our operating metrics are expected to be different than we previously expected during the last earnings call. That said, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings guidance and expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be greater than $10.80, excluding greater than $1.46 of negative adjustment items. On a GAAP basis, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.34. We are raising our operating revenue outlook by $1.5 billion to a range of $82.5 billion to $83.5 billion, reflecting stronger-than-expected enrollment across our businesses, including the contributions from Medicaid as well as the impact of adjustments to both prior and current year risk adjustment estimates. Fully-insured membership is now expected to be approximately 15 million members at the midpoint of our range, 100,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Medicaid business. Self-funded membership is now expected to be 24.7 million members at the midpoint of our range, approximately 200,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project total membership to be approximately 1 million to 1.2 million higher than we ended 2015. 
We now expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points for the year, reflecting our view that higher-than-previously-expected claims rates in our individual ACA-compliant plans as well as our Medicaid businesses remain at elevated levels throughout the year. This includes the worse-than-expected results in the newly implemented Iowa market. Reflecting the expected higher paid claims, we now expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. To offset the expected increase in our medical loss ratio, we are continuing the effort started last year to ensure we have an efficient cost structure. We now expect our SG&A ratio for the full year 2016 to be in the range of 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. Our updated 2016 outlook does not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares for the first 6 months of 2016. 
Our outlook does include the adverse impact of the additional $0.02 in assessments associated with the dissolution of the Ohio co-op. This is in addition to the $0.03 of assessments we previously discussed in our first quarter call associated with the State of Colorado dissolution on their co-op. We have not included any additional assessments beyond those incurred in Colorado and Ohio in our outlook. 
It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first half of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue, we believe, we are entitled to, under our current contract with ESI. 
With that, operator, please open the queue for questions."

If my numbers are right, you're allowing for about a 300 to 400 basis point deterioration further from what we saw first half's MLR to back half MLR, and you're getting obviously, as you say, the SG&A leverage. Two parts today. Is that a normal seasonal pattern? Are you allowing for any other contingencies on the MLR assumption in the back half? And as -- would you characterize what you're doing on the SG&A side as something sustainable? Or are these sort of extraordinary measures in light of the MLR pressure you've experienced?"

Thank you for the question, and good morning. So a couple of questions there in terms of MLR and G&A. But first of all, on MLR, yes, your math is certainly appropriate from the first half to the last half. And really, what we've seen is that we've got an elevated amount of utilization specifically in the ACA Individual-compliant plans as well as in Medicaid and more significantly there in Iowa. And we're, at least, for purposes of our outlook, assuming that that elevated level is going to continue throughout the rest of the year. So while, certainly, if there's any mitigation factors or medical management initiatives end up being more successful than we are planning, then there could be upside. But it's really -- it has to do with taking the elevated levels of utilization we've seen and just essentially run rate again for the rest of the year. In terms of the G&A, I'd say the bulk of the G&A is sustainable. What we've really done is done an outstanding job of fixed cost leveraging. We're increasing membership this year between 1 million and 1.2 million members and maintaining our cost structure relatively constant. We are growing. Our headcount increased in the second quarter, but it increased at a far, far slower rate than our membership increased. Revenue is going up about $2.5 billion -- $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the change in guidance from the beginning of the year until today. Yet, the raw SG&A number is only going up very slightly. And so there's really -- it's really -- it has as much to do with an excellent job of fixed cost leveraging. Clearly, we are looking at some inefficiency and waste in terms of our processes and continue to look at those very closely on a regular basis and try to eliminate those things. And at the end of the day, the last piece of this, really is that we're a pay-for-performance company. And as a pay-for-performance company, in order to get our bonus payments, we have to hit our targets. And to the extent that we don't hit our targets, we'll reduce our benefit -- our bonus structure. So that's something that we're looking at very closely as well."

But the second half looks more like an increase of 140 basis points. So the way I'm looking at it, year-over-year, you're actually expecting some noticeable improvement in the second half. So my MLR question is, what's causing that improvement on a relative basis? And then, John, on the G&A side, I think you mentioned that growth is going up a lot less than the revenue growth. But the way I look at it, second quarter, you added $1.5 billion to revenues but took $600 million of G&A out. So it looks like there are noticeable savings. I guess I'm just curious.

They've made changes over the years of tightening the supplemental enrollment a bit in various other requirements. The penalty continues to increase.

The risk adjuster model, it's -- it does a lot of what it's intended to do. But quite honestly, there's a bit of an imbalance that the -- that it overcharges for healthy and over-reimburses for certain moderately unhealthy disease states. We think, as I said, the supplemental moment period, we really do need a better upfront medical verification process and that there should not be any restriction on our efforts to innovative product designs to meet consumer needs and then modifying the grace periods for nonpayment of premiums would be something else.

Just to reiterate, we've been a very active participant in exchanges from the beginning. And recognize the markets have taken longer than expected to stabilize. And we've stated that repeatedly. And I think we've been working very closely with the administration in conducting our own modeling to best judgment how we're going to continually engage year-over-year in as profitable a context as possible. It's interesting, reflect back to the end of the first quarter, we told you that, end of June 30, we'd probably have greater insight into the membership we've captured, recognizing that we had a substantial uptick in membership. Deteriorated a little bit at the end of Q2 to around 925,000 or so members. But what we've observed in terms of the intensity of illness is that, as John pointed out in his earlier remarks, we're dealing with some chronic illnesses like cardiac, diabetes, COPD. We've had what we think is a material uptick in dialysis cost that have hit us. So we're going through an appraisal of all that in terms how to better medically manage those members as well as begin pricing it into '17. That's the trick. I mean, John has stated, and I restate it. I mean, we believe we're well positioned for pricing in '17 given what we now know about the membership we captured. And so I guess, when you put all that together, what we're waiting for now is rate approvals by state. And I can assure you that we're going to be extremely prudent in our continued engagement. I think we're in something like 138 or so rating regions. And we're going through an appraisal of every one of those regions. And we'll make prudent business decisions in terms of flexing our engagement in appropriate ways going into '17. And so I just -- I want to assure that, notwithstanding we've been active participants, we're also very -- I'll use the word prudent, very thoughtful, in terms of executing a good business practice in terms of how we continue to stay engaged in the public marketplace."

So in terms of trend on the Local Group side, that's actually going very well. And we reaffirmed the 7% to 7.5% outlook for that and feel very comfortable with that, given the results for the first half of the year. In terms of the timing, that relates to just a couple, really, accounting and calendar quirks. The first quarter of 2016 had an extra workday in it, driven by a leap year. The second quarter of 2016 had an extra work day in it, driven by how the weekend spell. The fourth quarter of 2016 has 1 less work day in it. And so that's significant enough to change the timing pattern on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Then you take that in the fact that our overall product mix in the group side is slightly richer than the overall product mix in the group side a year ago. That changes the timing as well given how the deductibles work."

This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91. Befor",923,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91. 
Before John and I discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our updated 2016 outlook, I think it's appropriate to discuss our perspective on the latest Cigna developments. I'll start by saying we are disappointed by the U.S. Department of Justice's decision to block Anthem's acquisition of Cigna, a combination specifically designed to tackle our health care system's challenges head on and deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high-quality, affordable health care. To be clear, our board and executive leadership team at Anthem is fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court. 
As you may have read in Tuesday's published op-ed, the DOJ has disregarded the issue of access for 2 of the most unstable and at high risk health insurance markets: individuals and small businesses. These populations comprise a meaningful proportion of the still more than 33 million uninsured Americans who will benefit from the Cigna acquisition through expanded and improved access, affordability and quality. 
For example, despite the many and continuing challenges of the health insurance exchanges, Anthem entered into this new and high-risk market at its inception. Though several of our competitors have exited this business, we now serve 923,000 public exchange members across 14 states where we do business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan. As shared with the DOJ, our acquisition of Cigna will help stabilize pricing in this volatile market, enabling Anthem to continue its commitment to the public exchanges and provide the opportunity to expand our participation to 9 additional states where neither Anthem nor Cigna currently participate. Additionally, we estimate this acquisition will significantly lower cost for our self-funded consumers, with over $2 billion in medical cost savings that we passed directly back to them. Finally, we also note this acquisition will benefit our shareholders and the pension, retirement and investment funds that they represent. Specifically, 99% of our shareholders voted in favor of this transaction. 
Now to discuss consolidated financials we reported this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.33 was slightly ahead of our expectations, albeit with mixed financial metrics to get us there. Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded memberships are tracking ahead of expectations as we ended the second quarter with nearly 39.8 million members. This reflects growth of an additional 148,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.2 million lives or 3%. Specifically, our insured membership increased by 170,000 lives as our Medicaid business grew by a better-than-expected 280,000 lives in the quarter to over 6.3 million members. This reflected better-than-expected enrollment growth from the implementation of the Iowa state contract, which started on April 1, as well as better-than-expected core membership growth within multiple other state contracts. 
Within commercial, our insured enrollment came in line with expectations. We ended the quarter with 923,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, a decrease of 52,000 from the 975,000 we reported in the first quarter. And Local Group insured business declined modestly and in line with our most recent expectations. 
Our self-funded business was relatively stable during the quarter, which was better than our previous expectations, as we experienced higher-than-expected growth in membership in existing accounts. Our membership results translated into better-than-expected operating revenue of $21.3 billion. Our second quarter 2016 results represent an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded memberships trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our commercial business. 
The second quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 84.2%, which increased by 210 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was partially driven by higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid business as our medical cost experience exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments and the impact of growth in membership, which the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the Individual business and the timing of higher medical cost experience in the Local Group business. The increase was partially offset by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates in our ACA-compliant individual and small group products. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at a ""better than previously expected"" 14% in the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of 140 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control, coupled with better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business, which carries a lower-than-consolidated average SG&A ratio. 
We reported operating cash flows of approximately $2 billion or 1.3x net income during the first 6 months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $662 million or 0.8x net income. As a reminder, we did make our first and second quarter income tax payments during the second quarter, consistent with prior years. 
I'll now turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, John Gallina, to discuss our business segments' quarterly results and our updated 2016 outlook in more detail. John?"

Turning to discuss the second quarter financial performance of our business units. We added 290,000 members in our Government Business during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 9.5% to $11.4 billion. These result",1560,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning. Turning to discuss the second quarter financial performance of our business units. We added 290,000 members in our Government Business during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 9.5% to $11.4 billion. These results now include the impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 4%, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we have been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we're monitoring the rate environment for the remainder of the year. 
During the quarter, we also experienced higher-than-expected claims across Medicaid businesses with the most notable market being the newly implemented Iowa contract. It is important to note that it is not uncommon to have early challenges in a new market, and our team has a long track record of successfully identifying and implementing revenue and cost of care initiatives to help mitigate issues. We will continue to work collaboratively with our state partner to ensure program stability and high-quality care for Iowa's most vulnerable citizens. 
Within Medicare, we're pleased with the progress the team continues to make, and our year-to-date margins continue to reflect improvement versus last year. Our outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term, sustainable levels, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid businesses remain substantial with an estimated $78 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. A little more than 3/4 of this opportunity is in new and specialized services, with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care cost and improving quality to their residents. 
Switching to our commercial business. Our enrollment decreased by 142,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced second quarter declines of 86,000 and 51,000 lives in our Individual and national businesses, respectively. The better-than-expected enrollment results contributed to a higher-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 5.7% versus the prior year quarter to $9.9 billion. 
Our second quarter operating margin of 10.9% was 120 basis points higher than the 9.7% we reported in the second quarter of 2015. The increase was driven by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates recorded during the quarter, a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative costs resulting from expense efficiency initiatives and growth in self-funded enrollment, which carries a higher-than-average operating margin. This increase was partially offset by higher medical cost experience in the individual ACA-compliant products and the timing of medical cost experience in our Local Group business. 
Within our individual ACA-compliant population, we had previously taken a conservative stance on our balance sheet with respect to various different estimates. This conservatism was very prudent as our current period claims trends have been higher than expected. We have seen higher-than-expected cost from membership with chronic conditions, such as renal disease, COPD, heart disease and diabetes, along with signs of pent-up demand among our new members. We have experienced higher-than-expected payments for dialysis treatments during the first half of the year, which we're in the process of reviewing the drivers of this increase. All in, our updated outlook now expects the Individual ACA-compliant business to incur mid-single-digit operating margin losses for the 2016 benefit year. 
It is important to note that we have assumed the higher-than-expected claims rate experienced thus far in the year will continue for the remainder of 2016 in developing our 2017 pricing assumptions. To be clear, we believe our pricing for 2017 fully incorporates our current expectations for 2016 claims, and we are focused on returning to profitability in 2017. Relating to National Accounts, we continue to be pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $726 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid- to high single-digit margins for average deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of June 30, 2016. 
Our Days in Claims Payable is 40.6 days as of June 30, a decrease of 2.8 days from the 43.4 days as of March 31. The decrease is in line with our expectations and consistent with the level of decrease seen between the first and second quarter of 2015. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down and closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.1% at June 30, 2016, down 110 basis points from the 40.2% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction in our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $958 million as of June 30. 
For the 3Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate, and we continue to establish a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. For risk adjusters, the recent information from CMS shows us in a net receivable position, primarily in our small group markets. We have recorded a valuation allowance against certain risk-adjusted receivables in some of our markets based on our assessment of the financial solvency of co-op organizations that are payers into the risk-adjusted program due to the belief that those receivables may ultimately not be collected. 
As we have said in recent months and in the results we reported this morning, our operating metrics are expected to be different than we previously expected during the last earnings call. That said, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings guidance and expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be greater than $10.80, excluding greater than $1.46 of negative adjustment items. On a GAAP basis, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.34. We are raising our operating revenue outlook by $1.5 billion to a range of $82.5 billion to $83.5 billion, reflecting stronger-than-expected enrollment across our businesses, including the contributions from Medicaid as well as the impact of adjustments to both prior and current year risk adjustment estimates. Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 15 million members at the midpoint of our range, 100,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Medicaid business. Self-funded membership is now expected to be 24.7 million members at the midpoint of our range, approximately 200,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project total membership to be approximately 1 million to 1.2 million higher than we ended 2015. 
We now expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points for the year, reflecting our view that ""higher than previously expected"" claims rates in our individual ACA-compliant plans as well as our Medicaid businesses remain at elevated levels throughout the year. This includes the worse-than-expected results in the newly implemented Iowa market. Reflecting the expected higher paid claims, we now expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. To offset the expected increase in our medical loss ratio, we're continuing the effort started last year to ensure we have an efficient cost structure. We now expect our SG&A ratio for the full year 2016 to be in the range of 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. Our updated 2016 outlook does not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares for the first 6 months of 2016. 
Our outlook does include the adverse impact of the additional $0.02 in assessments associated with the dissolution of the Ohio co-op. This is in addition to the $0.03 of assessments we previously discussed in our first quarter call associated with the State of Colorado dissolution on their co-op. We have not included any additional assessments beyond those incurred in Colorado and Ohio in our outlook. 
It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first half of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue -- we believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. 
With that, operator, please open the queue for questions."

If my numbers are right, you're allowing for about a 300 to 400 basis point deterioration further from what we saw first half's MLR to back half MLR, and you're getting obviously, as you say, the SG&A leverage. Two parts to this: Is that a normal seasonal pattern? Are you allowing for any other contingencies on the MLR assumption in the back half? And as -- would you characterize what you're doing on the SG&A side as something sustainable? Or are these sort of extraordinary measures in light of the MLR pressure you've experienced?"

But first of all, on MLR, yes, your math is certainly appropriate from the first half to the last half. And really, what we've seen is that we've got an elevated amount of utilization specifically in the ACA individual-compliant plans as well as in Medicaid and most significantly there in Iowa. And we're, at least, for purposes of our outlook, assuming that, that elevated level is going to continue throughout the rest of the year. So while, certainly, if there's any mitigation factors or medical management initiatives ended up being more successful than we're planning, there could be upside. But it's really -- it has to do with taking the elevated levels of utilization we've seen and just essentially run rating them for the rest of the year. In terms of the G&A, I'd say the bulk of the G&A is sustainable. What we've really done is done an outstanding job of fixed-cost leveraging. We're increasing membership here this year between 1 million and 1.2 million members and maintaining our cost structure relatively constant. But we are growing. Our headcount increased in the second quarter, but it increased at a far, far slower rate than our membership increased. Revenue's going up about $2.5 billion -- $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the change in guidance from the beginning of the year into -- to today. Yet, the raw SG&A number is only going up very slightly. And so there's really -- it's really has as much to do with an excellent job of fixed-cost leveraging. Clearly, we are looking at some inefficiency and waste in terms of our processes and continue to look at those very closely on a regular basis and try to eliminate those things. And at the end of the day, the last piece of it really is that we're a pay-for-performance company. And as a pay-for-performance company, in order to get our bonus payments, we have to hit our targets. And to the extent that we don't hit our targets, we'll reduce our bonus structure. So that's something that we're looking at very closely as well."

We adjusted our bonus payable appropriately based on ensuring that we're going to hit our $10.80, and so that's certainly a part of the reconciliation."

The really good news to that is that we do believe that our plan -- when we look at what we've done here historically, what the team has done historically in terms of new markets and implementing the managed care-type processes and procedures and the fact that the first year markets have historically been dilutive, and that we've got target margins within a 18- to 24-month period of time.

They've made changes over the years of tightening the supplemental enrollment a bit and various other requirements. The penalty continues to increase. We think all those things obviously have to be done. Other things that would certainly help the acceleration of stabilization would be to eliminate the health insurer tax in beyond 2017. The risk adjuster model, it's -- it does a lot of what it's intended to do. But quite honestly, there's a bit of an imbalance that the -- that it overcharges for healthy and over-reimburses for certain moderately unhealthy disease states. We think, as I said, the supplemental enrollment period, we really do need a better upfront verification process and that there should not be any restriction on our efforts to innovate product designs to meet consumer needs. And then modifying the grace periods for nonpayment of premiums would be something else.

Let me just weigh in to add to what John just shared with you. Just reiterate, we've been a very active participant in the exchanges from the beginning and recognize the markets have taken longer than expected to stabilize. And we've stated that repeatedly. And I think we've been working very closely with the administration and conducting our own modeling to best judge how we're going to continually engage year-over-year in as profitable a context as possible. It's interesting, reflect back to the end of first quarter, we told you that, end of June 30, we'd probably have greater insight into the membership we've captured, recognizing that we had a substantial uptick in membership. Deteriorated a little bit at the end of Q2 to around 925,000 or so members. But what we've observed in terms of the intensity of illness is that, as John pointed out in his earlier remarks, we're dealing with some chronic illnesses like cardiac, diabetes, COPD. We've had a, what we think, is a material uptick in dialysis cost that have hit us. So we're going through an appraisal of all that in terms how to better medically manage those members as well as begin pricing it into '17. That's the trick. I think John has stated it, and I'll restate it. We believe we're well positioned for pricing in '17, given what we now know about the membership we captured. And so I guess, when you put all that together, what we're waiting for now is rate approvals by state. And I can assure you that we're going to be extremely prudent in our continuing engagement. I think we're in something like 138 or so rating regions. And we're going through an appraisal of every one of those regions. And we'll make prudent business decisions in terms of flexing our engagement in appropriate ways going into '17. And so I just -- I want to assure that, notwithstanding we've been active participants, we're also very -- I'll use the word prudent, very thoughtful, in terms of executing a good business practice, in terms of how we continue to stay engaged in the public marketplace."

The second quarter of 2016 had an extra workday in it, driven by how the weekends fell. The fourth quarter of 2016 has 1 less workday in it, and so that's significant enough to change the timing pattern on a quarter-over-quarter basis.

This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91. Befor",925,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91. 
Before John and I discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our updated 2016 outlook, I think it's appropriate to discuss our perspective on the latest Cigna developments. I'll start by saying we are disappointed by the U.S. Department of Justice's decision to block Anthem's acquisition of Cigna, a combination specifically designed to tackle our health care system's challenges head on and deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high-quality, affordable health care. To be clear, our board and executive leadership team at Anthem is fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court. 
As you may have read in Tuesday's published op-ed, the DOJ has disregarded the issue of access for 2 of the most unstable and at high risk health insurance markets: individuals and small businesses. These populations comprise a meaningful proportion of the still more than 33 million uninsured Americans who will benefit from the Cigna acquisition through expanded and improved access, affordability and quality. 
For example, despite the many and continuing challenges of the health insurance exchanges, Anthem entered into this new and high-risk market at its inception. Though several of our competitors have exited this business, we now serve 923,000 public exchange members across 14 states where we do business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan. As shared with the DOJ, our acquisition of Cigna will help stabilize pricing in this volatile market, enabling Anthem to continue its commitment to the public exchanges and provide the opportunity to expand our participation to 9 additional states where neither Anthem nor Cigna currently participate. Additionally, we estimate this acquisition will significantly lower cost for our self-funded consumers, with over $2 billion in medical cost savings that we pass directly back to them. Finally, we also note this acquisition will benefit our shareholders and the pension, retirement and investment funds they represent. Specifically, 99% of our shareholders voted in favor of this transaction. 
Now to discuss consolidated financials we reported this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.33 was slightly ahead of our expectations, albeit with mixed financial metrics to get us there. Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded memberships are tracking ahead of expectations as we ended the second quarter with nearly 39.8 million members. This reflects growth of an additional 148,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.2 million lives or 3%. Specifically, our insured membership increased by 170,000 lives as our Medicaid business grew by a better-than-expected 280,000 lives in the quarter to over 6.3 million members. This reflected better-than-expected enrollment growth from the implementation of the Iowa state contract, which started on April 1, as well as better-than-expected core membership growth within multiple other state contracts. 
Within commercial, our insured enrollment came in line with expectations. We ended the quarter with 923,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, a decrease of 52,000 from the 975,000 we reported in the first quarter. And Local Group insured business declined modestly and in line with our most recent expectations. 
Our self-funded business was relatively stable during the quarter, which was better than our previous expectations, as we experienced higher-than-expected growth in membership in existing accounts. Our membership results translated into better-than-expected operating revenue of $21.3 billion. Our second quarter 2016 results represent an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded memberships trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our commercial business. 
The second quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 84.2%, which increased by 210 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was partially driven by higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid business as our medical cost experience exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments and the impact of growth in membership, which the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the Individual business and the timing of higher medical cost experience in the Local Group business. The increase was partially offset by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates in our ACA-compliant individual and small group products. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at a better than previously expected 14% in the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of 140 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control, coupled with better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business, which carries a lower than in consolidated average SG&A ratio. 
We reported operating cash flows of approximately $2 billion or 1.3x net income during the first 6 months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $662 million or 0.8x net income. As a reminder, we did make our first and second quarter income tax payments during the second quarter, consistent with prior years. 
I'll now turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, John Gallina, to discuss our business segments' quarterly results and our updated 2016 outlook in more detail. John?"

Turning to discuss the second quarter financial performance of our business units. We added 290,000 members in our Government Business during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 9.5% to $11.4 billion. These results now include the impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 4%, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we have been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the rate environment for the remainder of the year. 
During the quarter, we also experienced higher-than-expected claims across Medicaid businesses with the most notable market being the newly implemented Iowa contract. It is important to note that it is not uncommon to have early challenges in a new market, and our team has a long track record of successfully identifying and implementing revenue and cost of care initiatives to help mitigate issues. We will continue to work collaboratively with our state partner to ensure program stability and high-quality care for Iowa's most vulnerable citizens. 
Within Medicare, we're pleased with the progress the team continues to make, and our year-to-date margins continue to reflect improvement versus last year. Our outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term, sustainable levels, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid businesses remains substantial with an estimated $78 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. A little more than 3/4 of this opportunity is in new and specialized services, with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care cost and improving quality to their residents. 
Switching to our commercial business. Our enrollment decreased by 142,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced second quarter declines of 86,000 and 51,000 lives in our Individual and national businesses, respectively. The better-than-expected enrollment results contributed to a higher-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 5.7% versus the prior year quarter to $9.9 billion. 
Our second quarter operating margin of 10.9% was 120 basis points higher than the 9.7% we reported in the second quarter of 2015. The increase was driven by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates recorded during the quarter, a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative costs resulting from expense efficiency initiatives and growth in self-funded enrollment, which carries a higher-than-average operating margin. This increase was partially offset by higher medical cost experience in the individual ACA-compliant products and the timing of medical cost experience in our Local Group business. 
Within our individual ACA-compliant population, we had previously taken a conservative stance on our balance sheet with respect to various different estimates. This conservatism was very prudent as our current period claims trends have been higher than expected. We have seen higher-than-expected cost from membership with chronic conditions, such as renal disease, COPD, heart disease and diabetes, along with signs of pent-up demand among our new members. We have experienced higher-than-expected payments for dialysis treatments during the first half of the year, which we're in the process of reviewing the drivers of this increase. All in, our updated outlook now expects the Individual ACA-compliant business to incur mid-single-digit operating margin losses for the 2016 benefit year. 
It is important to note that we have assumed the higher-than-expected claims rate experienced thus far in the year will continue for the remainder of 2016 in developing our 2017 pricing assumptions. To be clear, we believe our pricing for 2017 fully incorporates our current expectations for 2016 claims, and we are focused on returning to profitability in 2017. Relating to National Accounts, we continue to be pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $726 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid- to high single-digit margins for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of June 30, 2016. 
Our Days in Claims Payable is 40.6 days as of June 30, a decrease of 2.8 days from the 43.4 days as of March 31. The decrease is in line with our expectations and consistent with the level of decrease seen between the first and second quarter of 2015. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.1% at June 30, 2016, down 110 basis points from the 40.2% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction in our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $958 million as of June 30. 
For the 3Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate, and we continue to establish a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. For risk adjusters, the recent information from CMS shows us in a net receivable position, primarily in our small group markets. We have recorded a valuation allowance against certain risk-adjusted receivables in some of our markets based on our assessment of the financial solvency of co-op organizations that are payers into the risk-adjusted program due to the belief that those receivables may ultimately not be collected. 
As we have said in recent months and in the results we reported this morning, our operating metrics are expected to be different than we previously expected during the last earnings call. That said, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings guidance and expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be greater than $10.80, excluding greater than $1.46 of negative adjustment items. On a GAAP basis, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.34. We are raising our operating revenue outlook by $1.5 billion to a range of $82.5 billion to $83.5 billion, reflecting stronger-than-expected enrollment across our businesses, including the contributions from Medicaid as well as the impact of adjustments to both prior and current year risk adjustment estimates. Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 15 million members at the midpoint of our range, 100,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Medicaid business. Self-funded membership is now expected to be 24.7 million members at the midpoint of our range, approximately 200,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project total membership to be approximately 1 million to 1.2 million higher than we ended 2015. 
We now expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points for the year, reflecting our view that higher than previously expected claims rates in our individual ACA-compliant plans as well as our Medicaid businesses remain at elevated levels throughout the year. This includes the worse-than-expected results in the newly implemented Iowa market. Reflecting the expected higher paid claims, we now expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. To offset the expected increase in our medical loss ratio, we are continuing the effort started last year to ensure we have an efficient cost structure. We now expect our SG&A ratio for the full year 2016 to be in the range of 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. Our updated 2016 outlook does not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares for the first 6 months of 2016. 
Our outlook does include the adverse impact of the additional $0.02 in assessments associated with the dissolution of the Ohio co-op. This is in addition to the $0.03 of assessments we previously discussed in our first quarter call associated with the State of Colorado dissolution on their co-op. We have not included any additional assessments beyond those incurred in Colorado and Ohio in our outlook. 
It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first half of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue -- we believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.

If my numbers are right, you're allowing for about a 300 to 400 basis point deterioration further from what we saw first half's MLR to back half MLR, and you're getting obviously, as you say, the SG&A leverage. Two parts to this: Is that a normal seasonal pattern? Are you allowing for any other contingencies on the MLR assumption in the back half? And as -- would you characterize what you're doing on the SG&A side as something that's sustainable? Or are these sort of extraordinary measures in light of the MLR pressure you've experienced?"

But first of all, on MLR, yes, your math is certainly appropriate from the first half to the last half. And really, what we've seen is that we've got an elevated amount of utilization specifically in the ACA individual-compliant plans as well as in Medicaid and most significantly there in Iowa. And we're, at least, for purposes of our outlook, assuming that, that elevated level is going to continue throughout the rest of the year. So while, certainly, if there's any mitigation factors or medical management initiatives end up being more successful than we're planning, there could be upside. But it's really -- it has to do with taking the elevated levels of utilization we've seen and just essentially run rating them for the rest of the year. 
In terms of the G&A, I'd say the bulk of the G&A is sustainable. What we've really done is done an outstanding job of fixed-cost leveraging. We're increasing membership here this year between 1 million and 1.2 million members and maintaining our cost structure relatively constant. But we are growing. Our headcount increased in the second quarter, but it increased at a far, far slower rate than our membership increased. Revenue's going up about $2.5 billion -- $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the change in guidance from the beginning of the year until -- to today. Yet, the raw SG&A number is only going up very slightly. And so there's really -- it's really has as much to do with an excellent job of fixed-cost leveraging. Clearly, we are looking at some inefficiency and waste in terms of our processes and continue to look at those very closely on a regular basis and try to eliminate those things. And at the end of the day, the last piece of it really is that we're a pay-for-performance company. And as a pay-for-performance company, in order to get our bonus payments, we have to hit our targets. And to the extent that we don't hit our targets, we'll reduce our bonus structure. So that's something that we're looking at very closely as well."

So my MLR question is, what's causing that improvement on a relative basis? 
And then, John, on the G&A side, I think you mentioned that growth is going up a lot less than the revenue growth. But the way I look at it is, second quarter, you added $1.5 billion to revenues but took $600 million of G&A out. So it looks like there are noticeable savings and, I guess, I'm just curious.

No. Because there's no one single bullet that actually solves the entire problem. The administration is extremely focused on having a sustainable marketplace. And we think that we've been a very active participant in the exchanges and been a great partner with CMS in trying to help with the stability of the marketplace. They've made changes over the years of tightening the supplemental enrollment a bit and various other requirements. The penalty continues to increase. We think all those things obviously have to be done. Other things that would certainly help the acceleration of stabilization would be to eliminate the health insurer tax in beyond 2017. The risk adjuster model, it's -- it does a lot of what it's intended to do. But quite honestly, there's a bit of an imbalance that the -- that it overcharges for healthy and over-reimburses for certain moderately unhealthy disease states. We think, as I said, the supplemental enrollment period, we really do need a better upfront verification process and that there should not be any restriction on our efforts to innovate product designs to meet consumer needs. And then modifying the grace periods for nonpayment of premiums would be something else. So those are just -- in addition to the pricing, things that we've been working with the administration on and believe should occur. We do believe that with the medical management and various other issues, that we can help get this back to profitability here in 2017."

Let me just weigh in to add to what John just shared with you. Just reiterate, we've been a very active participant in the exchanges from the beginning and recognize the markets have taken longer than expected to stabilize. And we've stated that repeatedly. And I think we've been working very closely with the administration and conducting our own modeling to best judge how we're going to continually engage year-over-year in as profitable a context as possible. It's interesting, reflect back to the end of first quarter, we told you that, end of June 30, we'd probably have greater insight into the membership we've captured, recognizing that we had a substantial uptick in membership. Deteriorated a little bit at the end of Q2 to around 925,000 or so members. But what we've observed in terms of the intensity of illness is that, as John pointed out in his earlier remarks, we're dealing with some chronic illnesses like cardiac, diabetes, COPD. We've had a, what we think, is a material uptick in dialysis cost that have hit us. So we're going through an appraisal of all that in terms how to better medically manage those members as well as begin pricing it into '17. That's the trick. I think John has stated it, and I'll restate it. We believe we're well positioned for pricing in '17, given what we now know about the membership we captured. And so I guess, when you put all that together, what we're waiting for now is rate approvals by state. And I can assure you that we're going to be extremely prudent in our continuing engagement. I think we're in something like 138 or so rating regions. And we're going through an appraisal of every one of those regions. And we'll make prudent business decisions in terms of flexing our engagement in appropriate ways going into '17. And so I just -- I want to assure that, notwithstanding we've been active participants, we're also very -- I'll use the word prudent, very thoughtful, in terms of executing a good business practice, in terms of how we continue to stay engaged in the public marketplace."

The second quarter of 2016 had an extra workday in it, driven by how the weekends fell. The fourth quarter of 2016 has 1 less workday in it, and so that's significant enough to change the timing pattern on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Then you take that and the fact that our overall product mix in the group side is slightly richer than the overall product mix in the group side a year ago, that changes the timing as well given how the deductibles work."

So the other piece that gives us a little bit of comfort in terms of having caught everything is that our 2016 risk adjuster that we're assuming into '17 really is based on 2015 experience. So we think that, that gives us a natural cushion associated with how that's being approached. But at the end of the day, the question is, ""How do we know we've gotten everything?"" Well, we've got 6 months of information. Obviously, there's a lot of new members associated with this block of business, and we can't provide absolute certainty. But we think we have very, very good line of sight. What we saw at the end of the first quarter, we further predicted from a pricing standpoint, and what we saw at the end of the second quarter was exactly consistent with that pricing prediction. So we feel good that we've got a good line of sight on that."

This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91. Befor",925,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91. 
Before John and I discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our updated 2016 outlook, I think it's appropriate to discuss our perspective on the latest Cigna developments. I'll start by saying we are disappointed by the U.S. Department of Justice's decision to block Anthem's acquisition of Cigna, a combination specifically designed to tackle our health care system's challenges head on and deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high-quality, affordable health care. To be clear, our board and executive leadership team at Anthem is fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court. 
As you may have read in Tuesday's published op-ed, the DOJ has disregarded the issue of access for 2 of the most unstable and at high risk health insurance markets: individuals and small businesses. These populations comprise a meaningful proportion of the still more than 33 million uninsured Americans who will benefit from the Cigna acquisition through expanded and improved access, affordability and quality. 
For example, despite the many and continuing challenges of the health insurance exchanges, Anthem entered into this new and high-risk market at its inception. Though several of our competitors have exited this business, we now serve 923,000 public exchange members across 14 states where we do business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan. As shared with the DOJ, our acquisition of Cigna will help stabilize pricing in this volatile market, enabling Anthem to continue its commitment to the public exchanges and provide the opportunity to expand our participation to 9 additional states where neither Anthem nor Cigna currently participate. Additionally, we estimate this acquisition will significantly lower cost for our self-funded consumers, with over $2 billion in medical cost savings that we pass directly back to them. Finally, we also note this acquisition will benefit our shareholders and the pension, retirement and investment funds they represent. Specifically, 99% of our shareholders voted in favor of this transaction. 
Now to discuss consolidated financials we reported this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.33 was slightly ahead of our expectations, albeit with mixed financial metrics to get us there. Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded memberships are tracking ahead of expectations as we ended the second quarter with nearly 39.8 million members. This reflects growth of an additional 148,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.2 million lives or 3%. Specifically, our insured membership increased by 170,000 lives as our Medicaid business grew by a better-than-expected 280,000 lives in the quarter to over 6.3 million members. This reflected better-than-expected enrollment growth from the implementation of the Iowa state contract, which started on April 1 as well as better-than-expected core membership growth within multiple other state contracts. 
Within commercial, our insured enrollment came in line with expectations. We ended the quarter with 923,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, a decrease of 52,000 from the 975,000 we reported in the first quarter. And Local Group insured business declined modestly and in line with our most recent expectations. 
Our self-funded business was relatively stable during the quarter, which was better than our previous expectations, as we experienced higher-than-expected growth in membership in existing accounts. Our membership results translated into better-than-expected operating revenue of $21.3 billion. Our second quarter 2016 results represent an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded memberships trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our commercial business. 
The second quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 84.2%, which increased by 210 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was partially driven by higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid business as our medical cost experience exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments and the impact of growth in membership, which the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the Individual business and the timing of higher medical cost experience in the Local Group business. The increase was partially offset by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates in our ACA-compliant individual and small group products. 
Our SG&A expense ratio came in at a better than previously expected 14% in the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of 140 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control, coupled with better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business, which carries a lower than in consolidated average SG&A ratio. 
We reported operating cash flows of approximately $2 billion or 1.3x net income during the first 6 months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $662 million or 0.8x net income. As a reminder, we did make our first and second quarter income tax payments during the second quarter, consistent with prior years. 
I'll now turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, John Gallina, to discuss our business segments' quarterly results and our updated 2016 outlook in more detail. John?"

Turning to discuss the second quarter financial performance of our business units. We added 290,000 members in our Government Business during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 9.5% to $11.4 billion. These result",1561,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning. Turning to discuss the second quarter financial performance of our business units. We added 290,000 members in our Government Business during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 9.5% to $11.4 billion. These results now include the impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 4%, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we have been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the rate environment for the remainder of the year. 
During the quarter, we also experienced higher-than-expected claims across Medicaid businesses with the most notable market being the newly implemented Iowa contract. It is important to note that it is not uncommon to have early challenges in a new market, and our team has a long track record of successfully identifying and implementing revenue and cost of care initiatives to help mitigate issues. We will continue to work collaboratively with our state partner to ensure program stability and high-quality care for Iowa's most vulnerable citizens. 
Within Medicare, we're pleased with the progress the team continues to make, and our year-to-date margins continue to reflect improvement versus last year. Our outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term, sustainable levels, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid businesses remains substantial with an estimated $78 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. A little more than 3/4 of this opportunity is in new and specialized services, with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care cost and improving quality to their residents. 
Switching to our commercial business. Our enrollment decreased by 142,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced second quarter declines of 86,000 and 51,000 lives in our Individual and national businesses, respectively. The better-than-expected enrollment results contributed to a higher-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 5.7% versus the prior year quarter to $9.9 billion. 
Our second quarter operating margin of 10.9% was 120 basis points higher than the 9.7% we reported in the second quarter of 2015. The increase was driven by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates recorded during the quarter, a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative costs resulting from expense efficiency initiatives and growth in self-funded enrollment, which carries a higher-than-average operating margin. This increase was partially offset by higher medical cost experience in the individual ACA-compliant products and the timing of medical cost experience in our Local Group business. 
Within our individual ACA-compliant population, we had previously taken a conservative stance on our balance sheet with respect to various different estimates. This conservatism was very prudent as our current period claims trends have been higher than expected. We have seen higher-than-expected cost from membership with chronic conditions, such as renal disease, COPD, heart disease and diabetes, along with signs of pent-up demand among our new members. We have experienced higher-than-expected payments for dialysis treatments during the first half of the year, which we're in the process of reviewing the drivers of this increase. All in, our updated outlook now expects the Individual ACA-compliant business to incur mid-single-digit operating margin losses for the 2016 benefit year. 
It is important to note that we have assumed the higher-than-expected claims rate experienced thus far in the year will continue for the remainder of 2016 in developing our 2017 pricing assumptions. To be clear, we believe our pricing for 2017 fully incorporates our current expectations for 2016 claims, and we are focused on returning to profitability in 2017. Relating to National Accounts, we continue to be pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. 
Regarding our balance sheet metrics. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $726 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid- to high single-digit margins for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of June 30, 2016. 
Our Days in Claims Payable is 40.6 days as of June 30, a decrease of 2.8 days from the 43.4 days as of March 31. The decrease is in line with our expectations and consistent with the level of decrease seen between the first and second quarter of 2015. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. 
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.1% at June 30, 2016, down 110 basis points from the 40.2% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction in our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $958 million as of June 30. 
For the 3Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate, and we continue to establish a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. For risk adjusters, the recent information from CMS shows us in a net receivable position, primarily in our small group markets. We have recorded a valuation allowance against certain risk-adjusted receivables in some of our markets based on our assessment of the financial solvency of co-op organizations that are payers into the risk-adjusted program due to the belief that those receivables may ultimately not be collected. 
As we have said in recent months and in the results we reported this morning, our operating metrics are expected to be different than we previously expected during the last earnings call. That said, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings guidance and expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be greater than $10.80, excluding greater than $1.46 of negative adjustment items. On a GAAP basis, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.34. We are raising our operating revenue outlook by $1.5 billion to a range of $82.5 billion to $83.5 billion, reflecting stronger-than-expected enrollment across our businesses, including the contributions from Medicaid as well as the impact of adjustments to both prior and current year risk adjustment estimates. Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 15 million members at the midpoint of our range, 100,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Medicaid business. Self-funded membership is now expected to be 24.7 million members at the midpoint of our range, approximately 200,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project total membership to be approximately 1 million to 1.2 million higher than we ended 2015. 
We now expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points for the year, reflecting our view that higher than previously expected claims rates in our individual ACA-compliant plans as well as our Medicaid businesses remain at elevated levels throughout the year. This includes the worse-than-expected results in the newly implemented Iowa market. Reflecting the expected higher paid claims, we now expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. To offset the expected increase in our medical loss ratio, we are continuing the effort started last year to ensure we have an efficient cost structure. We now expect our SG&A ratio for the full year 2016 to be in the range of 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. Our updated 2016 outlook does not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares for the first 6 months of 2016. 
Our outlook does include the adverse impact of the additional $0.02 in assessments associated with the dissolution of the Ohio co-op. This is in addition to the $0.03 of assessments we previously discussed in our first quarter call associated with the State of Colorado dissolution on their co-op. We have not included any additional assessments beyond those incurred in Colorado and Ohio in our outlook. 
It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first half of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue -- we believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.

But first of all, on MLR, yes, your math is certainly appropriate from the first half to the last half. And really, what we've seen is that we've got an elevated amount of utilization specifically in the ACA individual-compliant plans as well as in Medicaid and most significantly there in Iowa. And we're, at least, for purposes of our outlook, assuming that, that elevated level is going to continue throughout the rest of the year. So while, certainly, if there's any mitigation factors or medical management initiatives end up being more successful than we're planning, there could be upside. But it's really -- it has to do with taking the elevated levels of utilization we've seen and just essentially run rating them for the rest of the year. In terms of the G&A, I'd say the bulk of the G&A is sustainable. What we've really done is done an outstanding job of fixed-cost leveraging. We're increasing membership here this year between 1 million and 1.2 million members and maintaining our cost structure relatively constant. But we are growing. Our headcount increased in the second quarter, but it increased at a far, far slower rate than our membership increased. Revenue's going up about $2.5 billion -- $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the change in guidance from the beginning of the year until -- to today. Yet, the raw SG&A number is only going up very slightly. And so there's really -- it's really has as much to do with an excellent job of fixed-cost leveraging. Clearly, we are looking at some inefficiency and waste in terms of our processes and continue to look at those very closely on a regular basis and try to eliminate those things. And at the end of the day, the last piece of it really is that we're a pay-for-performance company. And as a pay-for-performance company, in order to get our bonus payments, we have to hit our targets. And to the extent that we don't hit our targets, we'll reduce our bonus structure. So that's something that we're looking at very closely as well."

But the second half looks more like an increase of 140 basis points. So the way I'm looking at it, year-over-year, you're actually expecting some noticeable improvement in the second half. So my MLR question is, what's causing that improvement on a relative basis? And then, John, on the G&A side, I think you mentioned that growth is going up a lot less than the revenue growth. But the way I look at it is, second quarter, you added $1.5 billion to revenues but took $600 million of G&A out. So it looks like there are noticeable savings and, I guess, I'm just curious.

They've made changes over the years of tightening the supplemental enrollment a bit and various other requirements. The penalty continues to increase. We think all those things obviously have to be done. Other things that would certainly help the acceleration of stabilization would be to eliminate the health insurer tax in beyond 2017. The risk adjuster model, it's -- it does a lot of what it's intended to do. But quite honestly, there's a bit of an imbalance that the -- that it overcharges for healthy and over-reimburses for certain moderately unhealthy disease states. We think, as I said, the supplemental enrollment period, we really do need a better upfront verification process and that there should not be any restriction on our efforts to innovate product designs to meet consumer needs. And then modifying the grace periods for nonpayment of premiums would be something else.

Let me just weigh in to add to what John just shared with you. Just reiterate, we've been a very active participant in the exchanges from the beginning and recognize the markets have taken longer than expected to stabilize. And we've stated that repeatedly. And I think we've been working very closely with the administration and conducting our own modeling to best judge how we're going to continually engage year-over-year in as profitable a context as possible. It's interesting, reflect back to the end of first quarter, we told you that, end of June 30, we'd probably have greater insight into the membership we've captured, recognizing that we had a substantial uptick in membership. Deteriorated a little bit at the end of Q2 to around 925,000 or so members. But what we've observed in terms of the intensity of illness is that, as John pointed out in his earlier remarks, we're dealing with some chronic illnesses like cardiac, diabetes, COPD. We've had a, what we think, is a material uptick in dialysis cost that have hit us. So we're going through an appraisal of all that in terms how to better medically manage those members as well as begin pricing it into '17. That's the trick. I think John has stated it, and I'll restate it. We believe we're well positioned for pricing in '17, given what we now know about the membership we captured. And so I guess, when you put all that together, what we're waiting for now is rate approvals by state. And I can assure you that we're going to be extremely prudent in our continuing engagement. I think we're in something like 138 or so rating regions. And we're going through an appraisal of every one of those regions. And we'll make prudent business decisions in terms of flexing our engagement in appropriate ways going into '17. And so I just -- I want to assure that, notwithstanding we've been active participants, we're also very -- I'll use the word prudent, very thoughtful, in terms of executing a good business practice, in terms of how we continue to stay engaged in the public marketplace."

The second quarter of 2016 had an extra workday in it, driven by how the weekends fell. The fourth quarter of 2016 has 1 less workday in it, and so that's significant enough to change the timing pattern on a quarter-over-quarter basis.

Adjusted earnings per share was $2.45, consistent with our previous expectations. 
Within membership, we continued to post strong fully insured and self-funded enrollment results, as we ended the third quarter with over 39.9 million members. We grew an additional 160,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.3 million lives or 3.4%. Specifically, insured enrollment increased by 39,000 lives during the quarter, as our Medicaid business grew by 81,000 lives to over 6.4 million members. Since closing the Amerigroup transaction in 2012, we've grown Medicaid enrollment by nearly 1.9 million lives or 41%, including growth of approximately 800,000 lives from Medicaid expansion. 
Within Commercial, our insured enrollment came in slightly ahead of expectations, as Local Group fully insured membership tracked well, particularly in the large group marketplace. Our public exchange enrollment declined by a less-than-expected 34,000 during the quarter to 889,000 lives. Our self-funded business increased by 121,000 during the quarter, reflecting the impact of enrollment growth from existing accounts and recently awarded contracts. 
Our solid membership results during the year translated into better-than-expected operating revenue of $21.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of $1.4 billion or 6.8% versus third quarter of 2015. The increase reflects the strong enrollment growth in the government business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Additionally, administrative fee revenue grew by 6.4% versus the prior year quarter as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. These increases were partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The third quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was in line with our previous expectations at 85.5%, an increase of 190 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the Medicaid business, as higher-than-expected medical cost experience, notably in Iowa, has exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments made over the last 12 months. In addition, it reflects the impact of growth in membership, as the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the individual business. These increases were partially offset by the timing of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business. 
Our SG&A expense ratio was also in line with expectations at 14.8% in the third quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control coupled with better-than-expected enrollment trends, as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the government business, which carries a lower than the consolidated average SG&A ratio. 
Turning to discuss the third quarter financial performance of our business units. In the government business, we added 92,000 members during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 10.9% to nearly $11.5 billion. As a reminder, our third quarter results include the impact of the addition of the Iowa contract which was implemented on April 1. Operating margins for the government business were 4.2% during third quarter, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. 
As we communicated previously, we've been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels due to rate actions. In addition, we've been experiencing higher-than-expected claims across the Medicaid business in the current year, including materially higher-than-expected costs in the recently implemented Iowa contract. As expected, there was a rebalancing of funding based on risk pool during the quarter. In addition, we've been informed of a retroactive rate increase which extends through June 2017, when rates will again be adjusted. 
Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, given the claims experienced to date. We remain confident we can make a meaningful impact by improving the cost and quality of care in Iowa as we've done for our other state partners. However, we will remain disciplined and only participating in markets where we receive rates that are actuarially sound. 
Within Medicare, we're pleased with the progress the team continues to make, and our year-to-date margins reflect continued improvement. During the quarter, CMS announced we earned Medicare STAR quality ratings for 2017, consistent with our long-term strategy. In the most recent ratings released by CMS, 51% of Anthem's Medicare Advantage members will be enrolled in plans that achieve 4 stars or higher. This accomplishment represents significant growth from the 22% of MA members in 4-star plans last year. The improvement is the direct result of investments made in the Medicare program over the past 3 years. 
Our 2016 outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-range sustainable level. As we stated since our MA restructuring began, we have positioned our portfolio to grow MA in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial with an updated estimate of $81 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. Approximately 3/4 of this opportunity is in new and specialized services with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience, targeted investments in critical capabilities and geographic footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care cost and improving quality for their residents. 
Switching to our Commercial business. Our enrollment increased by 68,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced growth of 171,000 lives in our Local Group business, partially offset by declines of 48,000 and 54,000 lives in our national and individual businesses, respectively. These results translated into better than previously expected operating revenue of $9.7 billion, representing growth of 2.4%. 
Our third quarter operating margin of 6.6% was flat versus third quarter of 2015. Commercial operating margins during the quarter reflected a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative cost resulting from expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company, as well as fixed cost leverage on a growing membership base. In addition, our Commercial business experienced the favorable timing impact of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business. These increases were offset by higher medical cost experience in our individual ACA-compliant products. 
Within our individual ACA-compliant plans, costs during the third quarter were marginally better than recent expectations, which is reassuring. We continue to experience higher than initially expected costs for members with chronic conditions, as we have discussed with you previously. Overall, the financial performance in individual ACA-compliant products has been disappointing, as membership has been short of our original expectations since its inception and operating margins have been lower than expected beginning in 2015. 
We believe we've taken the appropriate actions across our served market to return to slight profitability in 2017. Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint. We will continue to closely monitor this business, and if we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path towards sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018. We believe both the pricing and regulatory environment need to be improved to drive toward a sustainable and affordable marketplace over the long term. 
Relating to National Accounts, which typically encompass the most sophisticated purchasers of coverage, we're pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. We have added 602,000 lives so far in 2016, building on the growth of over 900,000 lives during the previous 2 years. 
And now turning to our 2016 financial outlook. Our third quarter results were largely in line with the expectations we laid out during our last quarter call. We expect our full year 2016 GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $9.28, including approximately $1.52 of negative adjustment items. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share to be approximately $10.80. 
We now expect our 2016 operating revenue to be approximately $83.5 billion, which is at the high end of our previously guided range, reflecting the impact of slightly better enrollment trends during the quarter. 
Fully insured membership is expected to be in the range of 15 million to 15.1 million members or 50,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Commercial business. Self-funded membership is expected to be 24.7 million, members which is at the midpoint of our range, unchanged from our previous outlook. Taken together, we're now projecting total membership growth of just over 1.1 million lives at the midpoint of our range versus where we ended in 2015. 
Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points; the SG&A ratio to be 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points; and operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. 
Our 2016 outlook continues to not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares through the first 9 months of 2016. 
It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first 9 months of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. 
I will now turn the call over to John to discuss some key financial metrics and our initial thoughts on headwinds and tailwinds for 2017. John?"

As Joe stated, our third quarter results were very consistent with the expectations we laid out last quarter. In order to provide you a bit more clarity on our performance, I will highlight some of our key financial metrics. 
First, I'd like to discuss the balance sheet. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a rollforward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $773 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid to high single-digit margins for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balances remained consistent and strong as of September 30, 2016. Our Days in Claims Payable was 40.6 days as of September 30, unchanged from the 40.6 days we reported last quarter. As previously discussed and consistent with our expectations, this metric has trended down over the past year, and we expect Days in Claims Payable to be around 40 days over time. 
Our debt to cap ratio was 38.7% as of September 30, down 40 basis points from the 39.1% at the end of the second quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity, as we did not repurchase any stock during the quarter. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $983 million as of the end of the quarter. 
For the 3Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net receivable position for risk adjusters. We also continue our conservative posture of recording a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, the 2015 and the 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. 
Moving on to cash flow. We reported operating cash flow of approximately $2.9 billion or 1.4x net income during the first 9 months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $964 million, which was 1.6x net income. These results include the receipt of a CMS Medicare prepayment of approximately $650 million during the third quarter. Through the full year of 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flows to be approximately $3 billion. We used $171 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. And yesterday, the Audit Committee declared our fourth quarter 2016 dividend of $0.65 per share to shareholders. 
Now turning to 2017. We are currently working through our planning process and analyzing the impact of various expected headwinds and tailwinds. Our current view of the tailwinds include: Number one, enrollment gains across Medicaid, Medicare and National and Large Group self-funded businesses; two, margin improvement due to improving results in our individual ACA-compliant plans, the Iowa Medicaid contract and the impact of the 1-year health insurer fee moratorium in 2017; and three, we expect to resume capital deployment activity in 2017, however, the timing and magnitude is dependent on the timing of the pending Cigna acquisition. 
Potential headwinds include: The return of a 2017 onetime administrative expense cuts that we made in 2016; the impact of lower Local Group enrollment and gross margin pressures as a result of the migration towards ACA-compliant product offerings; and finally, we expect to experience continued pressure in the Medicaid business, primarily driven by rate actions within the Medicaid expansion population over the next year. 
Taken together, these items are expected to represent modest earnings growth from 2016. 
As part of our planning process, we will continue to be focused on identifying steps to maximize our opportunities to drive improved earnings growth over time. We expect to provide more details around our 2017 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joe to discuss our longer-term outlook."
160077,324533304,1069668,"Anthem, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Elevance Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. 3 years ago, we laid out our plan for growth, which reflected our strategy to capitalize on the substantial opportunities in the government business while recognizing the changing nature of the commercial marketplace as a result of the im",731,"Thank you, John. 3 years ago, we laid out our plan for growth, which reflected our strategy to capitalize on the substantial opportunities in the government business while recognizing the changing nature of the commercial marketplace as a result of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Our plan was to establish a leadership position in the Medicaid market, stabilize our Medicare Advantage platform and grow individual ACA-compliant and ASO enrollment to mitigate the expected pressure in the Local Group fully insured segment. 
Since that time we've been pleased with the growth in our Medicaid business, where enrollment has grown 47% since 2013. And we're well positioned to capitalize on the $81 billion pipeline of opportunity between now and 2021 that I mentioned earlier. In addition, we have reconfigured and upgraded our Medicare platform, as evidenced by the improvement in our margin profile and STAR rating performance. We expect to leverage our upgraded Medicare platform to grow MA enrollment in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, the government business segment has grown nicely and now represents 54% of our consolidated company revenue, up from 44% in 2013. And we remain very optimistic about continued growth potential in this business. 
Switching to individual. As we've discussed previously, the earnings contribution from the individual ACA-compliant business represents a meaningful headwind to our original targets. The volume shortfall from our previous expectation remains substantial. 
For your reference, we laid out a plan to grow individual ACA-compliant enrollment to 3 million members by 2018 using the assumption that the overall individual marketplace would be approximately 25 million members, in line with CBO estimates. In 2016, the overall marketplace is about half of the expected size and has only grown to roughly 10 million to 11 million members. And subsequently, we have grown our individual ACA-compliant enrollment to approximately 1.4 million members as of the third quarter of 2016. We're closely monitoring the progress of our actions to improve the margin profile of this business toward our low to mid-single-digit margin targets of 2018. 
In our self-funded business, we've added 4.4 million members since 2013, as our value proposition has resonated with large employers who are focused on quality and affordability. This ASO growth has helped mitigate some of the pressure from higher-than-expected declines in our Local Group insured enrollment. 
Across our Commercial segment overall, we are generally pleased with our aggregate enrollment growth, but the mix of enrollment has skewed more than expected to self-funded than fully insured, pressuring revenue and earnings growth. Looking ahead, we still have meaningful opportunity to improve the per-member EBITDA contribution from ASO by increasing the penetration of our specialty and other product offerings to help further offset the pressures in Local Group. 
I want to spend a few moments on the pending acquisition of Cigna. We're committed to this combination which will further Anthem's vision to be America's valued health partner. This is truly a compelling opportunity to positively impact the health and well-being of our members and advance our commitment to expand access to high-quality, affordable health care for consumers. It will also save consumers more than $2 billion of medical cost annually, directly benefiting the most vulnerable populations in the country. 
I also would like to briefly address the upcoming trial with the Department of Justice, which will begin on November 21. We continue to believe the DOJ's action to sue to block the acquisition is based on a flawed analysis and a misunderstanding of the dynamic competitive and heavily regulated health care landscape, and we're fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court. 
In terms of the court proceeding, the judge has decided to bifurcate the issues and will first hear evidence on the National Accounts issue. If the judge decides in our favor on the National Account issue, we will then move forward and try the other 2 remaining issues, with the decision on those issues being rendered before the end of January. 
To summarize, we are in the process of updating our long-term growth plan and expect target improved core earning growth rates beyond 2017. The individual ACA-compliant headwinds in our enrollment mix discussed previously represent a meaningful challenge to achieving our $14 earnings target in 2018. And we expect to provide additional clarity around our long-term growth prospects after the Cigna transaction process is complete.

And we still expect there's losses in the same general range of what we said, maybe just a little bit better than we had indicated. In terms of 2017, reinsurance is obviously a very important factor, but it's only one aspect of pricing and one aspect of the overall structure of the program. We've got rate increases that average in excess of 20% across the country. I think there's been studies that have been published that have stated that our rate increases are a little bit higher than the average rate increases. We've made adjustments to product offerings. We've changed networks. We've enhanced product designs. We've done many, many things to improve affordability of the specific product mix. So we feel very good about the previous guidance that we provided, that we're really targeting a small profit margin in 2017 and then returning to more -- closely related to target margins in 2018 and beyond."

Yes, first question regarding, I guess, the out possibilities. As you know, the contract went live earlier this year, and obviously, we're very concerned because it has experienced a deterioration that certainly exceeded our forecast expectations regarding the medical loss ratio.

I commented in our discussions just a moment ago that we have realized some positive effect from that discussion. And quite frankly, we're hoping for more. Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, and again, we're hoping for a better outcome with respect to more discussion. With respect to the legal construct of the contract, we are examining our position. We quite frankly, are awaiting the state to respond to the inquiries that we've submitted to them. And I think it's a little early for us to maybe put commentary out regarding our legal position, given the fact that there's still administrative considerations that are working their way through the system. And we're hopeful for a very positive outcome at the end of that review. We are concerned about the actuarial soundness of the rates. And that's been expressed by all the MCOs from the get go. We are engaged in an extensive process of meetings, as I mentioned. And we'll continue to be deeply concerned until we get a resolution to this.

To you point, what we're looking for are a variety of fixes, such as elimination of the health insurance tax or at least extending the 2017 moratorium. Another one that you probably heard quite a bit about is updating the risk adjustment model substantially to address existing imbalance that we believe deteriorates the overall risk pool. We are also looking at additional adjustments to special enrollment periods, which we believe the -- needs to be continually narrowed with respect to the variety and number of special enrollments.

In terms of the small group, yes, we're still working through it, and I really am hesitant to provide an answer until our planning process is done and some of the grandmothering associated with the early renewals that exist, and we actually have several of our many of our small group plans renewed early on December a couple of years ago in order to maintain the non-ACA-compliant plans. And it's probably premature to throw a number out until we've worked through that process. We will update you and provide more clarity on the fourth quarter call. Associated with the general administrative expenses, I think maybe I'll just repeat sort of a commentary from last time. It's down quite substantially in 2016. And a little more than half of it is a good sustainable run rate, a meaningful decrease in SG&A expense that has to do with more efficient processes, better performance in some of the administrative and core areas of the company, and we grew in our membership and we had a really good membership year from both a membership and premium prospective, raising guidance on that and we're able to do that by maintaining our administrative expense levels. Obviously, then the ratio went down. The other half or a little less than the other half were more of one-time items and those are nonsustainable. And the most significant part of those, other less than the other half is our incentive compensation plans. As I stated, we are a pay for performance company, and we have our promises to Wall Street and what we expected earnings to be and we ensure that we deliver those earnings. And unfortunately, we are below our incentive compensation expense as part of that process. So it's a little less than half come back in 2017."

So like, for instance, California still has 11 competitors, Virginia still has 8 competitors, just to rattle off a couple of our states. In terms of the risk pool, we believe that we understand the risk pool. We're very good at the individual marketplace. We're the #1 individual market carrier for years and years prior to the ACA.

Number one, on average, our price point for targeted bronze silver plans in the marketplace is higher than our competitors. We certainly recognize that and acknowledge it. And while the number of competitors in our markets has declined overall versus 2016, for the most part, those declines are in less populated areas versus the world market, where we have had historically high market share. On the flip side, there's really still substantial competition across all of our markets, those served markets, most notably in these highly dense urban markets. And finally, some of the largest markets do not see any significant reduction in competition. For example, California still has 11 competitors, down 1 from last year. Virginia still has 8. Georgia still has 5. So we know we're in highly competitive markets and we believe we will compete very effectively. But again, I think we very effectively managed price points with respect to the product that we offer in the marketplace. And so we have a fairly good outlook, as John commented earlier in his remarks, about our expected margins. And as I said then follow on to that, we'll be evaluating our situation in those markets, all of our markets, through the beginning of the year to see how well we perform and how well the regulatory adjustments play out leading up to midyear."

And so if we go backwards a year and then you look at the number of co-ops who are in our markets that fell, there was a significant impact on our membership. And then as those customers then went into the marketplace, they said it was a flight to safety, they went to Blue. I think the real key difference in the expectations in '16 and expectations in '17 is really the amount of exits within our markets of carriers and who the exits were and how much membership those that exited have. So long story short, the co-ops in certain markets had extremely high market share and they went insolvent and their market share was absorbed, where in 2017, while we certainly have some exits of carriers in our markets, they do not have the breadth or the magnitude of the market share that the ones who exited the year ago had. Associated with the premium deficiency reserves, we have none recorded. We have none recorded in 2015. We have none recorded in 2016.

Adjusted earnings per share was $2.45, consistent with our previous expectations. 
Within membership, we continued to post strong fully insured and self-funded enrollment results, as we ended the third quarter with over 39.9 million members. We grew an additional 160,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.3 million lives or 3.4%. Specifically, insured enrollment increased by 39,000 lives during the quarter, as our Medicaid business grew by 81,000 lives to over 6.4 million members. Since closing the Amerigroup transaction in 2012, we've grown Medicaid enrollment by nearly 1.9 million lives or 41%, including growth of approximately 800,000 lives from Medicaid expansion. 
Within Commercial, our insured enrollment came in slightly ahead of expectations, as Local Group fully insured membership tracked well, particularly in the large group marketplace. Our public exchange enrollment declined by a less-than-expected 34,000 during the quarter to 889,000 lives. Our self-funded business increased by 121,000 during the quarter, reflecting the impact of enrollment growth from existing accounts and recently awarded contracts. 
Our solid membership results during the year translated into better-than-expected operating revenue of $21.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of $1.4 billion or 6.8% versus third quarter of 2015. The increase reflects the strong enrollment growth in the government business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Additionally, administrative fee revenue grew by 6.4% versus the prior year quarter as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. These increases were partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The third quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was in line with our previous expectations at 85.5%, an increase of 190 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the Medicaid business, as higher-than-expected medical cost experience, notably in Iowa, has exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments made over the last 12 months. In addition, it reflects the impact of growth in membership, as the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the individual business. These increases were partially offset by the timing of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business. 
Our SG&A expense ratio was also in line with expectations at 14.8% in the third quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control coupled with better-than-expected enrollment trends, as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the government business, which carries a lower than the consolidated average SG&A ratio. 
Turning to discuss the third quarter financial performance of our business units. In the government business, we added 92,000 members during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 10.9% to nearly $11.5 billion. As a reminder, our third quarter results include the impact of the addition of the Iowa contract which was implemented on April 1. Operating margins for the government business were 4.2% during third quarter, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. 
As we communicated previously, we've been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels due to rate actions. In addition, we've been experiencing higher-than-expected claims across the Medicaid business in the current year, including materially higher-than-expected costs in the recently implemented Iowa contract. As expected, there was a rebalancing of funding based on risk pool during the quarter. In addition, we've been informed of a retroactive rate increase which extends through June 2017, when rates will again be adjusted. 
Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, given the claims experienced to date. We remain confident we can make a meaningful impact by improving the cost and quality of care in Iowa as we've done for our other state partners. However, we will remain disciplined and only participating in markets where we receive rates that are actuarially sound. 
Within Medicare, we're pleased with the progress the team continues to make, and our year-to-date margins reflect continued improvement. During the quarter, CMS announced we earned Medicare STAR quality ratings for 2017, consistent with our long-term strategy. In the most recent ratings released by CMS, 51% of Anthem's Medicare Advantage members will be enrolled in plans that achieve 4 stars or higher. This accomplishment represents significant growth from the 22% of MA members in 4-star plans last year. The improvement is the direct result of investments made in the Medicare program over the past 3 years. 
Our 2016 outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-range sustainable level. As we stated since our MA restructuring began, we have positioned our portfolio to grow MA in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial with an updated estimate of $81 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. Approximately 3/4 of this opportunity is in new and specialized services with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience, targeted investments in critical capabilities and geographic footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care cost and improving quality for their residents. 
Switching to our Commercial business. Our enrollment increased by 68,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced growth of 171,000 lives in our Local Group business, partially offset by declines of 48,000 and 54,000 lives in our national and individual businesses, respectively. These results translated into better than previously expected operating revenue of $9.7 billion, representing growth of 2.4%. 
Our third quarter operating margin of 6.6% was flat versus third quarter of 2015. Commercial operating margins during the quarter reflected a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative cost resulting from expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company, as well as fixed cost leverage on a growing membership base. In addition, our Commercial business experienced the favorable timing impact of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business. These increases were offset by higher medical cost experience in our individual ACA-compliant products. 
Within our individual ACA-compliant plans, costs during the third quarter were marginally better than recent expectations, which is reassuring. We continue to experience higher than initially expected costs for members with chronic conditions, as we have discussed with you previously. Overall, the financial performance in individual ACA-compliant products has been disappointing, as membership has been short of our original expectations since its inception and operating margins have been lower than expected beginning in 2015. 
We believe we've taken the appropriate actions across our served market to return to slight profitability in 2017. Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint. We will continue to closely monitor this business, and if we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path towards sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018. We believe both the pricing and regulatory environment need to be improved to drive toward a sustainable and affordable marketplace over the long term. 
Relating to National Accounts, which typically encompass the most sophisticated purchasers of coverage, we're pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. We have added 602,000 lives so far in 2016, building on the growth of over 900,000 lives during the previous 2 years. 
And now turning to our 2016 financial outlook. Our third quarter results were largely in line with the expectations we laid out during our last quarter call. We expect our full year 2016 GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $9.28, including approximately $1.52 of negative adjustment items. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share to be approximately $10.80. 
We now expect our 2016 operating revenue to be approximately $83.5 billion, which is at the high end of our previously guided range, reflecting the impact of slightly better enrollment trends during the quarter. 
Fully insured membership is expected to be in the range of 15 million to 15.1 million members or 50,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Commercial business. Self-funded membership is expected to be 24.7 million, members which is at the midpoint of our range, unchanged from our previous outlook. Taken together, we're now projecting total membership growth of just over 1.1 million lives at the midpoint of our range versus where we ended in 2015. 
Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points; the SG&A ratio to be 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points; and operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. 
Our 2016 outlook continues to not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares through the first 9 months of 2016. 
It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first 9 months of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. 
I will now turn the call over to John to discuss some key financial metrics and our initial thoughts on headwinds and tailwinds for 2017. John?"

As Joe stated, our third quarter results were very consistent with the expectations we laid out last quarter. In order to provide you a bit more clarity on our performance, I will highlight some of our key financial metrics. 
First, I'd like to discuss the balance sheet. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $773 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid to high single-digit margins for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balances remained consistent and strong as of September 30, 2016. Our Days in Claims Payable was 40.6 days as of September 30, unchanged from the 40.6 days we reported last quarter. As previously discussed and consistent with our expectations, this metric has trended down over the past year, and we expect Days in Claims Payable to be around 40 days over time. 
Our debt to cap ratio was 38.7% as of September 30, down 40 basis points from the 39.1% at the end of the second quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity, as we did not repurchase any stock during the quarter. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $983 million as of the end of the quarter. 
For the 3Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net receivable position for risk adjusters. We also continue our conservative posture of recording a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, the 2015 and the 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. 
Moving on to cash flow. We reported operating cash flow of approximately $2.9 billion or 1.4x net income during the first 9 months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $964 million, which was 1.6x net income. These results include the receipt of a CMS Medicare prepayment of approximately $650 million during the third quarter. Through the full year of 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flows to be approximately $3 billion. We used $171 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. And yesterday, the Audit Committee declared our fourth quarter 2016 dividend of $0.65 per share to shareholders. 
Now turning to 2017. We are currently working through our planning process and analyzing the impact of various expected headwinds and tailwinds. Our current view of the tailwinds include: Number one, enrollment gains across Medicaid, Medicare and National and Large Group self-funded businesses; two, margin improvement due to improving results in our individual ACA-compliant plans, the Iowa Medicaid contract and the impact of the 1-year health insurer fee moratorium in 2017; and three, we expect to resume capital deployment activity in 2017, however, the timing and magnitude is dependent on the timing of the pending Cigna acquisition. 
Potential headwinds include: The return of a 2017 onetime administrative expense cuts that we made in 2016; the impact of lower Local Group enrollment and gross margin pressures as a result of the migration towards ACA-compliant product offerings; and finally, we expect to experience continued pressure in the Medicaid business, primarily driven by rate actions within the Medicaid expansion population over the next year. 
Taken together, these items are expected to represent modest earnings growth from 2016. 
As part of our planning process, we will continue to be focused on identifying steps to maximize our opportunities to drive improved earnings growth over time. We expect to provide more details around our 2017 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joe to discuss our longer-term outlook."

Since that time we've been pleased with the growth in our Medicaid business, where enrollment has grown 47% since 2013. And we're well positioned to capitalize on the $81 billion pipeline of opportunity between now and 2021 that I mentioned earlier. In addition, we have reconfigured and upgraded our Medicare platform, as evidenced by the improvement in our margin profile and STAR rating performance. We expect to leverage our upgraded Medicare platform to grow MA enrollment in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, the government business segment has grown nicely and now represents 54% of our consolidated company revenue, up from 44% in 2013. And we remain very optimistic about continued growth potential in this business. 
Switching to individual. As we've discussed previously, the earnings contribution from the individual ACA-compliant business represents a meaningful headwind to our original targets. The volume shortfall from our previous expectation remains substantial. 
For your reference, we laid out a plan to grow individual ACA-compliant enrollment to 3 million members by 2018 using the assumption that the overall individual marketplace would be approximately 25 million members, in line with CBO estimates. In 2016, the overall marketplace is about half of the expected size and has only grown to roughly 10 million to 11 million members. And subsequently, we have grown our individual ACA-compliant enrollment to approximately 1.4 million members as of the third quarter of 2016. We're closely monitoring the progress of our actions to improve the margin profile of this business toward our low to mid-single-digit margin targets of 2018. 
In our self-funded business, we've added 4.4 million members since 2013, as our value proposition has resonated with large employers who are focused on quality and affordability. This ASO growth has helped mitigate some of the pressure from higher-than-expected declines in our Local Group insured enrollment. 
Across our Commercial segment overall, we are generally pleased with our aggregate enrollment growth, but the mix of enrollment has skewed more than expected to self-funded than fully insured, pressuring revenue and earnings growth. Looking ahead, we still have meaningful opportunity to improve the per-member EBITDA contribution from ASO by increasing the penetration of our specialty and other product offerings to help further offset the pressures in Local Group. 
I want to spend a few moments on the pending acquisition of Cigna. We're committed to this combination which will further Anthem's vision to be America's valued health partner. This is truly a compelling opportunity to positively impact the health and well-being of our members and advance our commitment to expand access to high-quality, affordable health care for consumers. It will also save consumers more than $2 billion of medical cost annually, directly benefiting the most vulnerable populations in the country. 
I also would like to briefly address the upcoming trial with the Department of Justice, which will begin on November 21. We continue to believe the DOJ's action to sue to block the acquisition is based on a flawed analysis and a misunderstanding of the dynamic competitive and heavily regulated health care landscape, and we're fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court. 
In terms of the court proceeding, the judge has decided to bifurcate the issues and will first hear evidence on the National Accounts issue. If the judge decides in our favor on the National Account issue, we will then move forward and try the other 2 remaining issues, with the decision on those issues being rendered before the end of January. 
To summarize, we are in the process of updating our long-term growth plan and expect target improved core earning growth rates beyond 2017. The individual ACA-compliant headwinds in our enrollment mix discussed previously represent a meaningful challenge to achieving our $14 earnings target in 2018. And we expect to provide additional clarity around our long-term growth prospects after the Cigna transaction process is complete. 
With that, operator, please open the queue for questions."

So thank you for the question. Associated with our individual exchange business, we certainly did, in the second quarter, indicate losses, and we expect that our operating margins are going to be on the mid-single-digit loss for the year. Now during the third quarter, the reserve development was okay. The trend has been moderated a bit. And we still expect there's losses in the same general range of what we said, maybe just a little bit better than we had indicated. In terms of 2017, reinsurance is obviously a very important factor, but it's only one aspect of pricing and one aspect of the overall structure of the program. We've got rate increases that average in excess of 20% across the country. I think there's been studies that have been published that have stated that our rate increases are a little bit higher than the average rate increases. We've made adjustments to product offerings. We've changed networks. We've enhanced product designs. We've done many, many things to improve affordability of the specific product mix. So we feel very good about the previous guidance that we provided, that we're really targeting a small profit margin in 2017 and then returning to more -- closely related to target margins in 2018 and beyond."

As you know, the contract went live earlier this year, and obviously, we're very concerned because it has experienced a deterioration that certainly exceeded our forecast expectations regarding the medical loss ratio.

I commented in our discussions just a moment ago that we have realized some positive effect from that discussion. And quite frankly, we're hoping for more. Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, and again, we're hoping for a better outcome with respect to more discussion. With respect to the legal construct of the contract, we are examining our position. We quite frankly, are awaiting the state to respond to the inquiries that we've submitted to them. And I think it's a little early for us to maybe put commentary out regarding our legal position, given the fact that there's still administrative considerations that are working their way through the system. And we're hopeful for a very positive outcome at the end of that review. We are concerned about the actuarial soundness of the rates. And that's been expressed by all the MCOs from the get go. We are engaged in an extensive process of meetings, as I mentioned. And we'll continue to be deeply concerned until we get a resolution to this.

To you point, what we're looking for are a variety of fixes, such as elimination of the health insurance tax or at least extending the 2017 moratorium. Another one that you probably heard quite a bit about is updating the risk adjustment model substantially to address existing imbalance that we believe deteriorates the overall risk pool. We are also looking at additional adjustments to special enrollment periods, which we believe the -- needs to be continually narrowed with respect to the variety and number of special enrollments. We also believe that we need to have the flexibility to develop innovative products that should go to market to meet our -- the needs of our customers.

And that is, this is a specific recipe for solutions, and we believe these recipe characteristics represent the form of long-term sustainable and affordable marketplace.

And could probably be premature to throw a number out until we've worked through that process. So we will update that and provide more clarity on our fourth quarter call. Associated with the general administrative expenses, I think maybe I'll just repeat sort of the commentary from last time. It's down quite substantially in 2016. And a little more than half of it is a good, sustainable run rate, meaningful decrease in SG&A expense. Has to do with more efficient processes, better performance in some of the administrative and core areas of the company. And we grew in our membership. We had a really good membership year from both a membership and premium prospective, raising guidance on that, and we're able to do that by maintaining our administrative expense levels. Obviously then, the ratio went down. The other half -- or a little less than the other half were more of onetime items, and those are nonsustainable. And the most significant part of those, other less than the other half is our incentive compensation plans. As we've stated, we're a pay-for-performance company, and we had our promises to Wall Street and what we expected earnings to be and we ensured that we delivered those earnings. And unfortunately, we had to lower our incentive compensation expense as part of that process. So a little less than half come back in 2017."

Do you think that provides you any buffer against adverse selection next year?"

Hopefully, I can address and all of them. But maybe the most simple is that we expect that, overall, individual ACA-compliant membership on a national basis will be slightly down next year and that our membership will reflect that. We still have many, many competitors in our markets. I just do want to point out that some of the exits that have been a very widely publicized, very few of them impact our market specifically. So like, for instance, California still has 11 competitors, Virginia still has 8 competitors, just to rattle off a couple of our states. In terms of the risk pool, we believe that we understand the risk pool. We're very good at the individual marketplace. We're been #1 individual market carrier for years and years prior to the ACA. Our products are designed in such a way to really get a good risk pool that allows us to maximize on risk adjusters and then be a risk adjuster collector. So we feel good about our assumptions at this point in time."

Number one, on average, our price point for targeted bronze, silver plans in the marketplace is higher than our competitors. We certainly recognize that and acknowledge it. And while the number of competitors in our markets has declined overall versus 2016, for the most part, those declines are in less populated areas, such as the rural market, where we have had historically high market share. There's -- On the flip side, there's really still substantial competition across all of our markets, those served markets, most notably in these highly dense urban markets. And finally, some of the largest markets do not see any significant reduction in competition. For example, California still has 11 competitors, down 1 from last year. Virginia still has 8. Georgia still has 5. So we know we're in highly competitive markets and we believe we will compete very effectively. But again, I think we very effectively managed the price points with respect to the product that we've offered in the marketplace. And so we have a fairly good outlook, as John commented earlier in his remarks, about our expected margins. And as I said then follow on to that, we'll be evaluating our situation in those markets, all of our markets, through the beginning of the year to see how well we performed and how well the regulatory adjustments play out leading up to midyear."

And 2016 was interesting because what we ended up seeing was a flight to safety, and that was one of the reasons that our 2016 individual exchange membership grew more than expectations. And so if we go backwards a year and then you look at the number of co-ops who are in our markets that failed, it was a significant impact on our membership. And then as those customers then went into the marketplace, they -- as I said, it was a flight to safety, they went for Blue. I think the real key difference in the expectations in '16 and the expectations in '17 is, really, the amount of exits within our markets of carriers and who the exits were and how much membership those that exited had. So long story short, the co-ops in certain markets were -- had extremely high market share and they went insolvent and their market share then was absorbed. Where in 2017, while we certainly have some exits of carriers in our markets, they do not have the breadth or the magnitude of the market share that the ones who exited a year ago had. Associated with the premium deficiency reserves, we have none recorded. We had none recorded in 2015. We have none recorded in 2016. It's a very easy question. Which means that our results are pure, our results are clean and that we don't have the puts and takes that maybe you have in some of the other companies that you're modeling."

And so I guess, if that's all very expected, what changed this year from a seasonality perspective? And then on the long term, from a strategic perspective, when you guys announced the Cigna deal, and I know we're going back 1.5 years now, you talked about Cigna bringing commercial expertise and exposure to Medicare, the strong specialty and then the international segment. And so I'm curious kind of where those priorities sit today. And in the case that the judge disagrees with you guys and the transaction does not move forward, how do you guys think about the reaction? Is there a need for scale?

Within membership, we continue to post strong fully insured and self-funded enrollment results, as we ended the third quarter with over 39.9 million members. We grew an additional 160,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.3 million lives or 3.4%. Specifically, insured enrollment increased by 39,000 lives during the quarter, as our Medicaid business grew by 81,000 lives to over 6.4 million members. Since closing the Amerigroup transaction in 2012, we've grown Medicaid enrollment by nearly 1.9 million lives, or 41%, including growth of approximately 800,000 lives from Medicaid expansion. 
Within Commercial, our insured enrollment came in slightly ahead of expectations, as Local Group fully insured membership tracked well, particularly in the large group marketplace. Our public exchange enrollment declined by a less-than-expected 34,000 during the quarter to 889,000 lives. Our self-funded business increased by 121,000 during the quarter, reflecting the impact of enrollment growth from existing accounts and recently awarded contracts. 
Our solid membership results during the year translated into better than expected operating revenue of $21.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of $1.4 billion or 6.8% versus third quarter of 2015. The increase reflects the strong enrollment growth in the government business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Additionally, administrative fee revenue grew by 6.4% versus the prior year quarter as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. These increases were partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The third quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was in line with our previous expectations at 85.5%, an increase of 190 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the Medicaid business, as higher-than-expected medical cost experience, notably in Iowa, has exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments made over the last 12 months. In addition, it reflects the impact of growth in membership, as the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the Individual business. These increases were partially offset by the timing of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business. 
Our SG&A expense ratio was also in line with expectations at 14.8% in the third quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control coupled with better than expected enrollment trends, as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the government business, which carries a lower than the consolidated average SG&A ratio. 
Turning to discuss the third quarter financial performance of our business units. In the government business, we added 92,000 members during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 10.9% to nearly $11.5 billion. As a reminder, our third quarter results include the impact of the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1. Operating margins for the government business were 4.2% during the third quarter, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. 
As we communicated previously, we've been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels due to rate actions. In addition, we've been experiencing higher-than-expected claims across the Medicaid business in the current year, including materially higher-than-expected costs in the recently implemented Iowa contract. As expected, there was a rebalancing of funding based on risk pool during the quarter. In addition, we've been informed of a retroactive rate increase which extends through June 2017, when rates will again be adjusted. 
Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, given the claims experience to date. We remain confident we can make a meaningful impact by improving the cost and quality of care in Iowa as we've done for our other state partners. However, we will remain disciplined and only participating in markets where we receive rates that are actuarially sound. 
Within Medicare, we're pleased with the progress the team continues to make, and our year-to-date margins reflect continued improvement. During the quarter, CMS announced we earned Medicare STAR quality ratings for 2017 consistent with our long-term strategy. In the most recent ratings released by CMS, 51% of Anthem's Medicare Advantage members will be enrolled in plans that achieve 4 stars or higher. This accomplishment represents significant growth from the 22% of MA members in 4-star plans last year. The improvement is the direct result of investments made in the Medicare program over the past 3 years. 
Our 2016 outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-range sustainable level. As we've stated since our MA restructuring began, we have positioned our portfolio to grow MA in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial, with an updated estimate of $81 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. Approximately 3/4 of this opportunity is in new and specialized services with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience, targeted investments and critical capabilities and geographic footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care costs and improving quality for their residents. 
Switching to our Commercial business. Our enrollment increased by 68,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced growth of 171,000 lives in our Local Group business, partially offset by declines of 48,000 and 54,000 lives in our national and Individual businesses, respectively. These results translated into better than previously expected operating revenue of $9.7 billion, representing growth of 2.4%. 
Our third quarter operating margin of 6.6% was flat versus the third quarter of 2015. Commercial operating margins during the quarter reflected a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative costs resulting from expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company, as well as fixed cost leverage on a growing membership base. In addition, our Commercial business experienced the favorable timing impact of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business. These increases were offset by higher medical cost experience in our Individual ACA-compliant products. 
Within our Individual ACA-compliant plans, costs during the third quarter were marginally better than recent expectations, which is reassuring. We continue to experience higher than initially expected costs for members with chronic conditions, as we have discussed with you previously. Overall, the financial performance in Individual ACA-compliant products has been disappointing, as membership has been short of our original expectations since its inception and operating margins have been lower than expected beginning in 2015. 
We believe we've taken the appropriate actions across our served markets to return to slight profitability in 2017. Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint. We will continue to closely monitor this business, and if we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path towards sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018. We believe both the pricing and regulatory environment need to be improved to drive toward a sustainable and affordable marketplace over the long term. 
Relating to National Accounts, which typically encompass the most sophisticated purchasers of coverage, we're pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. We have added 602,000 lives so far in 2016, building on the growth of over 900,000 lives during the previous 2 years. 
And now turning to our 2016 financial outlook. Our third quarter results were largely in line with the expectations we laid out during our last quarter call. We expect our full year 2016 GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $9.28, including approximately $1.52 of negative adjustment items. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share to be approximately $10.80. 
We now expect our 2016 operating revenue to be approximately $83.5 billion, which is at the high end of our previously guided range, reflecting the impact of slightly better enrollment trends during the quarter. 
Fully insured membership is expected to be in the range of 15 million to 15.1 million members, or 50,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Commercial business. Self-funded membership is expected to be 24.7 million members, which is at the midpoint of our range, unchanged from our previous outlook. Taken together, we're now projecting total membership growth of just over 1.1 million lives, at the midpoint of our range versus where we ended in 2015. 
Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points; the SG&A ratio to be 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points; and operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. 
Our 2016 outlook continues to not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares through the first 9 months of 2016. 
It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first 9 months of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. 
I will now turn the call over to John to discuss some key financial metrics and our initial thoughts on headwinds and tailwinds for 2017. John?"

As Joe stated, our third quarter results were very consistent with the expectations we laid out last quarter. In order to provide you a bit more clarity on our performance, I will highlight some of our key financial metrics. 
First, I'd like to discuss the balance sheet. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a favorable prior year reserve development of $773 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid to high single-digit margins for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balances remained consistent and strong as of September 30, 2016. Our Days in Claims Payable was 40.6 days as of September 30, unchanged from the 40.6 days we reported last quarter. As previously discussed and consistent with our expectations, this metric has trended down over the past year, and we expect Days in Claims Payable to be around 40 days over time. 
Our debt-to-cap ratio was 38.7% as of September 30, down 40 basis points from the 39.1% at the end of the second quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity, as we did not repurchase any stock during the quarter. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $983 million as of the end of the quarter. 
For the 3Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net receivable position for risk adjusters. We also continue our conservative posture of recording a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, the 2015 and the 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. 
Moving on to cash flow. We reported operating cash flow of approximately $2.9 billion, or 1.4x net income, during the first 9 months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $964 million, which was 1.6x net income. These results include the receipt of a CMS Medicare prepayment of approximately $650 million during the third quarter. For the full year of 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flows to be approximately $3 billion. We used $171 million during the quarter for our cash dividend, and yesterday, the Audit Committee declared our fourth quarter 2016 dividend of $0.65 per share to shareholders. 
Now turning to 2017. We are currently working through our planning process and analyzing the impact of various expected headwinds and tailwinds. Our current view of the tailwinds include: Number one, enrollment gains across Medicaid, Medicare and National and Large Group self-funded businesses; two, margin improvement due to improving results in our Individual ACA-compliant plans, the Iowa Medicaid contract and the impact of the 1-year health insurer fee moratorium in 2017; and three, we expect to resume capital deployment activity in 2017, however, the timing and magnitude is dependent on the timing of the pending Cigna acquisition. 
Potential headwinds include: The return of the 2017 onetime administrative expense cuts that we made in 2016; the impact of lower Local Group enrollment and gross margin pressures as a result of the migration towards ACA-compliant product offerings; and finally, we expect to experience continued budgeting pressure in the Medicaid business, primarily driven by rate actions within the Medicaid expansion population over the next year. 
Taken together, these items are expected to represent modest earnings growth from 2016. 
As part of our planning process, we will continue to be focused on identifying steps that maximize our opportunities to drive improved earnings growth over time. We expect to provide more details around our 2017 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joe to discuss our longer-term outlook."
160077,324533304,1070293,"Anthem, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Elevance Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John.

Three years ago, we laid out our plan for growth, which reflected our strategy to capitalize on the substantial opportunities in the government business while recognizing the changing nature of the commercial marketplace as a result of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Our plan was to establish a leadership position in the Medicaid market, stabilize our Medicare Advantage platform and grow Individual ACA-compliant and ASO enrollment to mitigate the expected pressure in the Local Group fully insured segment. 
Since that time, we've been pleased with the growth in our Medicaid business, where enrollment has grown 47% since 2013. And we are well positioned to capitalize on the $81 billion pipeline of opportunity between now and 2021 that I mentioned earlier. In addition, we have reconfigured and upgraded our Medicare platform, as evidenced by the improvement in our margin profile and STAR rating performance. We expect to leverage our upgraded Medicare platform to grow MA enrollment in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, the government business segment has grown nicely and now represents 54% of our consolidated company revenue, up from 44% in 2013. And we remain very optimistic about continued growth potential in this business. 
Switching to Individual. As we've discussed previously, the earnings contribution from the Individual ACA-compliant business represents a meaningful headwind to our original targets. The volume shortfall from our previous expectation remains substantial. 
For your reference, we laid out a plan to grow Individual ACA-compliant enrollment to 3 million members by 2018 using the assumption that the overall Individual marketplace would be approximately 25 million members, in line with CBO estimates. In 2016, the overall marketplace was about half of the expected size and has only grown to roughly 10 million to 11 million members. And subsequently, we have grown our Individual ACA-compliant enrollment to approximately 1.4 million members as of the third quarter of 2016. We are closely monitoring the progress of our actions to improve the margin profile of this business toward our low to mid-single-digit margin targets of 2018. 
In our self-funded business, we've added 4.4 million members since 2013 as our value proposition has resonated with large employers who are focused on quality and affordability. This ASO growth has helped mitigate some of the pressure from higher-than-expected declines in our Local Group insured enrollment. 
Across our Commercial segment overall, we are generally pleased with our aggregate enrollment growth, but the mix of enrollment has skewed more than expected to self-funded than fully insured, pressuring revenue and earnings growth. Looking ahead, we still have meaningful opportunity to improve the per-member EBITDA contribution from ASO by increasing the penetration of our Specialty and other product offerings to help further offset the pressures in Local Group. 
I want to spend a few moments on the pending acquisition of Cigna. We are committed to this combination which will further Anthem's vision to be America's valued health partner. This is truly a compelling opportunity to positively impact the health and well-being of our members and advance our commitment to expand access to high-quality, affordable health care for consumers. It will also save consumers more than $2 billion of medical costs annually, directly benefiting the most vulnerable populations in the country. 
I also would like to briefly address the upcoming trial with the Department of Justice, which will begin on November 21. We continue to believe the DOJ's action to sue to block the acquisition is based on a flawed analysis and a misunderstanding of the dynamic competitive and heavily regulated health care landscape, and we're fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court. 
In terms of the court proceeding, the judge has decided to bifurcate the issues and will first hear evidence on the National Accounts issue. If the judge decides in our favor on the National Account issue, we will then move forward and try the other 2 remaining issues, with a decision on those issues being rendered before the end of January. 
To summarize, we are in the process of updating our long-term growth plan and expect to target improved core earnings growth rates beyond 2017. The Individual ACA-compliant headwinds in our enrollment mix discussed previously represent a meaningful challenge to achieving our $14 earnings target in 2018. And we expect to provide additional clarity around our long-term growth prospects after the Cigna transaction process is complete.

So thank you for the question.

Now during the third quarter, the reserve development was okay. The trend has been moderated a bit. And we still expect those losses in the same general range of what we said, maybe just a little bit better than we had indicated. In terms of 2017, reinsurance is obviously a very important factor, but it's only one aspect of pricing and one aspect of the overall structure of the program. We've got rate increases that average in excess of 20% across the country. I think there's been studies that have been published that have stated that our rate increases are a little bit higher than the average rate increases. We've made adjustments to product offerings. We've changed networks. We've enhanced product designs. We've done many, many things to improve affordability of the specific product mix. So we feel very good about the previous guidance that we provided, that we're really targeting a small profit margin in 2017 and then returning to more closely related to target margins in 2018 and beyond."

Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, and again, we're hoping for a better outcome with respect to more discussion. With respect to the legal construct of the contract, we are examining our position. We, quite frankly, are awaiting the state to respond to the inquiries that we've submitted to them. And I think it's a little early for us to maybe put commentary out regarding our legal position, given the fact that there's still administrative considerations that are working their way through the system. And we're hopeful for a very positive outcome at the end of that review. We are concerned about the actuarial soundness of the rates. And that's been expressed by all of the MCOs from the get go.

We are also looking at additional adjustments to the special enrollment periods, which we believe the -- needs to be continually narrowed with respect to the variety and number of special enrollments.

However, that won't be until after the pending Cigna acquisition process is completed. And so the timing and the magnitude of that capital deployment is still somewhat of an unknown.

And that's our 2016 -- approximately $10.80 is our 2016 guidance number. And then, of course, you have the tailwinds that offset that. But in terms of the PBM, we don't have any of the upside baked in. I think, Joe, maybe some comments just about the PBM situation in general might be helpful."

However, associated with the remainder of the Medicaid block, we are seeing some slight margin pressure. We were phenomenally successful the past couple of years with our margins. And specifically, our expansion margins have been very, very, very good.

The -- in terms of the small group, we're still working through it, and I really am hesitant to provide an answer until our planning process is done. And some of the grandmothering associated with the early renewals that exist, we actually have several of our -- many of our small group plans renewed early on December a couple of years ago in order to maintain their non-ACA-compliant plans. And I think it'd probably be premature to throw a number out until we've worked through that process. So we will update that and provide more clarity on our fourth quarter call. Associated with the general and administrative expenses, I think maybe I'll just repeat sort of the commentary from last time. It's down quite substantially in 2016. And a little more than half of it is a good, sustainable run rate, meaningful decrease in SG&A expense. That has to do with more efficient processes, better performance in some of the administrative and core areas of the company. And we grew into our membership. We had a really good membership year from both a membership and premium prospective, raising guidance on that. And we're able to do that by maintaining our administrative expense levels. Obviously, then the ratio went down. The other half, or a little less than the other half, were more onetime items, and those are nonsustainable. And the most significant part of those other, less than the other half is our incentive compensation plans. As we've stated, we're a pay-for-performance company, and we had our promises to Wall Street in what we expected earnings to be, and we ensured that we delivered those earnings. And unfortunately, we had to lower our incentive compensation expense as part of that process. So a little less than half will come back in 2017."

So like, for instance, California still has 11 competitors, Virginia still has 8 competitors, just to rattle off a couple of our states. In terms of the risk pool, we believe that we understand the risk pool. We're very good at the Individual marketplace. We've been the #1 Individual market carrier for years and years prior to the ACA. Our products are designed in such a way to really get a good risk pool that allows us to maximize on risk adjusters and then be a risk adjuster collector.

Number one, on average, our price point for targeted bronze and silver plans in the marketplace is higher than our competitors. We certainly recognize that and acknowledge it. And while the number of competitors in our markets has declined overall versus 2016, for the most part, those declines are in less populated areas, such as the rural market, where we have had historically high market shares. There's -- on the flip side, there's really still substantial competition across all of our markets, those served markets, most notably in these highly dense urban markets. And finally, some of the largest markets did not see any significant reduction in competition. For example, California still has 11 competitors, down one from last year. Virginia still has 8. Georgia still has 5. So we know we're in highly competitive markets, and we believe we will compete very effectively. But again, I think we've very effectively managed the price points with respect to the products that we've offered in the marketplace. And so we have a fairly good outlook, as John commented earlier in his remarks, about our expected margins. And as I said then to follow on to that, we'll be evaluating our situation in those markets, all of our markets, through the beginning of the year to see how well we perform and how well the regulatory adjustments play out leading up to midyear."

And so if you go backwards a year and then you look at the number of co-ops who are in our markets that failed, it was a significant impact on our membership. And then as those customers then went into the marketplace, they -- as I said, it was a flight to safety, they went for Blue. I think the real key difference in the expectations in '16 and the expectations in '17 is, really, the amount of exits within our markets of carriers and who the exits were and how much membership those that exited had. So long story short, the co-ops in certain markets were -- had extremely high market share, and they went insolvent and their market share then was absorbed. Where in 2017, while we certainly have some exits of carriers in our markets, they do not have the breadth or the magnitude of the market share that the ones who exited a year ago had. Associated with the premium deficiency reserves, we have none recorded. We had none recorded in 2015. We have none recorded in 2016. It's a very easy question.

Adjusted earnings per share was $2.45, consistent with our previous expectations. 
Within membership, we continue to post strong fully insured and self-funded enrollment results, as we ended the third quarter with over 39.9 million members. We grew an additional 160,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.3 million lives or 3.4%. Specifically, insured enrollment increased by 39,000 lives during the quarter, as our Medicaid business grew by 81,000 lives to over 6.4 million members. Since closing the Amerigroup transaction in 2012, we've grown Medicaid enrollment by nearly 1.9 million lives, or 41%, including growth of approximately 800,000 lives from Medicaid expansion. 
Within Commercial, our insured enrollment came in slightly ahead of expectations, as Local Group fully insured membership tracked well, particularly in the large group marketplace. Our public exchange enrollment declined by a less-than-expected 34,000 during the quarter to 889,000 lives. Our self-funded business increased by 121,000 during the quarter, reflecting the impact of enrollment growth from existing accounts and recently awarded contracts. 
Our solid membership results during the year translated into better than expected operating revenue of $21.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of $1.4 billion or 6.8% versus third quarter of 2015. The increase reflects the strong enrollment growth in the government business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Additionally, administrative fee revenue grew by 6.4% versus the prior year quarter as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. These increases were partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. 
The third quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was in line with our previous expectations at 85.5%, an increase of 190 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the Medicaid business, as higher-than-expected medical cost experience, notably in Iowa, has exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments made over the last 12 months. In addition, it reflects the impact of growth in membership, as the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the Individual business. These increases were partially offset by the timing of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business. 
Our SG&A expense ratio was also in line with expectations at 14.8% in the third quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control coupled with better than expected enrollment trends, as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the government business, which carries a lower than the consolidated average SG&A ratio. 
Turning to discuss the third quarter financial performance of our business units. In the government business, we added 92,000 members during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 10.9% to nearly $11.5 billion. As a reminder, our third quarter results include the impact of the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1. Operating margins for the government business were 4.2% during the third quarter, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. 
As we communicated previously, we've been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels due to rate actions. In addition, we've been experiencing higher-than-expected claims across the Medicaid business in the current year, including materially higher-than-expected costs in the recently implemented Iowa contract. As expected, there was a rebalancing of funding based on risk pool during the quarter. In addition, we've been informed of a retroactive rate increase which extends through June 2017, when rates will again be adjusted. 
Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, given the claims experience to date. We remain confident we can make a meaningful impact by improving the cost and quality of care in Iowa as we've done for our other state partners. However, we will remain disciplined and only participating in markets where we receive rates that are actuarially sound. 
Within Medicare, we're pleased with the progress the team continues to make, and our year-to-date margins reflect continued improvement. During the quarter, CMS announced we earned Medicare STAR quality ratings for 2017 consistent with our long-term strategy. In the most recent ratings released by CMS, 51% of Anthem's Medicare Advantage members will be enrolled in plans that achieve 4 stars or higher. This accomplishment represents significant growth from the 22% of MA members in 4-star plans last year. The improvement is the direct result of investments made in the Medicare program over the past 3 years. 
Our 2016 outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-range sustainable level. As we've stated since our MA restructuring began, we have positioned our portfolio to grow MA in 2017. 
The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial, with an updated estimate of $81 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. Approximately 3/4 of this opportunity is in new and specialized services with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience, targeted investments and critical capabilities and geographic footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising health care costs and improving quality for their residents. 
Switching to our Commercial business. Our enrollment increased by 68,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced growth of 171,000 lives in our Local Group business, partially offset by declines of 48,000 and 54,000 lives in our national and Individual businesses, respectively. These results translated into better than previously expected operating revenue of $9.7 billion, representing growth of 2.4%. 
Our third quarter operating margin of 6.6% was flat versus the third quarter of 2015. Commercial operating margins during the quarter reflected a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative costs resulting from expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company, as well as fixed cost leverage on a growing membership base. In addition, our Commercial business experienced the favorable timing impact of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business. These increases were offset by higher medical cost experience in our Individual ACA-compliant products. 
Within our Individual ACA-compliant plans, costs during the third quarter were marginally better than recent expectations, which is reassuring. We continue to experience higher than initially expected costs for members with chronic conditions, as we have discussed with you previously. Overall, the financial performance in Individual ACA-compliant products has been disappointing, as membership has been short of our original expectations since its inception and operating margins have been lower than expected beginning in 2015. 
We believe we've taken the appropriate actions across our served markets to return to slight profitability in 2017. Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint. We will continue to closely monitor this business, and if we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path towards sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018. We believe both the pricing and regulatory environment need to be improved to drive toward a sustainable and affordable marketplace over the long term. 
Relating to National Accounts, which typically encompass the most sophisticated purchasers of coverage, we're pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. We have added 602,000 lives so far in 2016, building on the growth of over 900,000 lives during the previous 2 years. 
And now turning to our 2016 financial outlook. Our third quarter results were largely in line with the expectations we laid out during our last quarter call. We expect our full year 2016 GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $9.28, including approximately $1.52 of negative adjustment items. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share to be approximately $10.80. 
We now expect our 2016 operating revenue to be approximately $83.5 billion, which is at the high end of our previously guided range, reflecting the impact of slightly better enrollment trends during the quarter. 
Fully insured membership is expected to be in the range of 15 million to 15.1 million members, or 50,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Commercial business. Self-funded membership is expected to be 24.7 million members, which is at the midpoint of our range, unchanged from our previous outlook. Taken together, we're now projecting total membership growth of just over 1.1 million lives, at the midpoint of our range versus where we ended in 2015. 
Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points; the SG&A ratio to be 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points; and operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. 
Our 2016 outlook continues to not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares through the first 9 months of 2016. 
It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first 9 months of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. 
I will now turn the call over to John to discuss some key financial metrics and our initial thoughts on headwinds and tailwinds for 2017. John?"

As Joe stated, our third quarter results were very consistent with the expectations we laid out last quarter. In order to provide you a bit more clarity on our performance, I will highlight some of our key financial metrics. 
First, I'd like to discuss the balance sheet. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a favorable prior year reserve development of $773 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid to high single-digit margins for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balances remained consistent and strong as of September 30, 2016. Our Days in Claims Payable was 40.6 days as of September 30, unchanged from the 40.6 days we reported last quarter. As previously discussed and consistent with our expectations, this metric has trended down over the past year, and we expect Days in Claims Payable to be around 40 days over time. 
Our debt-to-cap ratio was 38.7% as of September 30, down 40 basis points from the 39.1% at the end of the second quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity, as we did not repurchase any stock during the quarter. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $983 million as of the end of the quarter. 
For the 3Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net receivable position for risk adjusters. We also continue our conservative posture of recording a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, the 2015 and the 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. 
Moving on to cash flow. We reported operating cash flow of approximately $2.9 billion, or 1.4x net income, during the first 9 months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $964 million, which was 1.6x net income. These results include the receipt of a CMS Medicare prepayment of approximately $650 million during the third quarter. For the full year of 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flows to be approximately $3 billion. We used $171 million during the quarter for our cash dividend, and yesterday, the Audit Committee declared our fourth quarter 2016 dividend of $0.65 per share to shareholders. 
Now turning to 2017. We are currently working through our planning process and analyzing the impact of various expected headwinds and tailwinds. Our current view of the tailwinds include: Number one, enrollment gains across Medicaid, Medicare and National and Large Group self-funded businesses; two, margin improvement due to improving results in our Individual ACA-compliant plans, the Iowa Medicaid contract and the impact of the 1-year health insurer fee moratorium in 2017; and three, we expect to resume capital deployment activity in 2017, however, the timing and magnitude is dependent on the timing of the pending Cigna acquisition. 
Potential headwinds include: The return of the 2017 onetime administrative expense cuts that we made in 2016; the impact of lower Local Group enrollment and gross margin pressures as a result of the migration towards ACA-compliant product offerings; and finally, we expect to experience continued budgeting pressure in the Medicaid business, primarily driven by rate actions within the Medicaid expansion population over the next year. 
Taken together, these items are expected to represent modest earnings growth from 2016. 
As part of our planning process, we will continue to be focused on identifying steps that maximize our opportunities to drive improved earnings growth over time. We expect to provide more details around our 2017 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joe to discuss our longer-term outlook."
160077,324533304,1071347,"Anthem, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Elevance Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. 3 years ago, we laid out our plan for growth, which reflected our strategy to capitalize on the substantial opportunities in the government business while recognizing the changing nature of the commercial marketplace as a result of the im",735,"Thank you, John. 3 years ago, we laid out our plan for growth, which reflected our strategy to capitalize on the substantial opportunities in the government business while recognizing the changing nature of the commercial marketplace as a result of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Our plan was to establish a leadership position in the Medicaid market, stabilize our Medicare Advantage platform and grow Individual ACA-compliant and ASO enrollment to mitigate the expected pressure in the Local Group fully insured segment. 
Since that time, we've been pleased with the growth in our Medicaid business, where enrollment has grown 47% since 2013. And we are well positioned to capitalize on the $81 billion pipeline of opportunity between now and 2021 that I mentioned earlier. In addition, we have reconfigured and upgraded our Medicare platform, as evidenced by the improvement in our margin profile and STAR rating performance. We expect to leverage our upgraded Medicare platform to grow MA enrollment in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, the government business segment has grown nicely and now represents 54% of our consolidated company revenue, up from 44% in 2013. And we remain very optimistic about continued growth potential in this business. 
Switching to Individual. As we've discussed previously, the earnings contribution from the Individual ACA-compliant business represents a meaningful headwind to our original targets. The volume shortfall from our previous expectation remains substantial. 
For your reference, we laid out a plan to grow Individual ACA-compliant enrollment to 3 million members by 2018 using the assumption that the overall Individual marketplace would be approximately 25 million members, in line with CBO estimates. In 2016, the overall marketplace was about half of the expected size and has only grown to roughly 10 million to 11 million members. And subsequently, we have grown our Individual ACA-compliant enrollment to approximately 1.4 million members as of the third quarter of 2016. We are closely monitoring the progress of our actions to improve the margin profile of this business toward our low to mid-single-digit margin targets of 2018. 
In our self-funded business, we've added 4.4 million members since 2013 as our value proposition has resonated with large employers who are focused on quality and affordability. This ASO growth has helped mitigate some of the pressure from higher-than-expected declines in our Local Group insured enrollment. 
Across our Commercial segment overall, we are generally pleased with our aggregate enrollment growth, but the mix of enrollment has skewed more than expected to self-funded than fully insured, pressuring revenue and earnings growth. Looking ahead, we still have meaningful opportunity to improve the per-member EBITDA contribution from ASO by increasing the penetration of our Specialty and other product offerings to help further offset the pressures in Local Group. 
I want to spend a few moments on the pending acquisition of Cigna. We are committed to this combination which will further Anthem's vision to be America's valued health partner. This is truly a compelling opportunity to positively impact the health and well-being of our members and advance our commitment to expand access to high-quality, affordable health care for consumers. It will also save consumers more than $2 billion of medical costs annually, directly benefiting the most vulnerable populations in the country. 
I also would like to briefly address the upcoming trial with the Department of Justice, which will begin on November 21. We continue to believe the DOJ's action to sue to block the acquisition is based on a flawed analysis and a misunderstanding of the dynamic competitive and heavily regulated health care landscape, and we're fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court. 
In terms of the court proceeding, the judge has decided to bifurcate the issues and will first hear evidence on the National Accounts issue. If the judge decides in our favor on the National Account issue, we will then move forward and try the other 2 remaining issues, with a decision on those issues being rendered before the end of January. 
To summarize, we are in the process of updating our long-term growth plan and expect to target improved core earnings growth rates beyond 2017. The Individual ACA-compliant headwinds in our enrollment mix discussed previously represent a meaningful challenge to achieving our $14 earnings target in 2018. And we expect to provide additional clarity around our long-term growth prospects after the Cigna transaction process is complete. 
With that, operator, please open the queue for questions."

So thank you for the question. Associated with our Individual exchange business, we certainly did, in the second quarter, indicate losses and that we expect that our operating margins are going to be on the mid-single-digit loss for the year. Now during the third quarter, the reserve development was okay. The trend has been moderated a bit. And we still expect those losses in the same general range of what we said, maybe just a little bit better than we had indicated. In terms of 2017, reinsurance is obviously a very important factor, but it's only one aspect of pricing and one aspect of the overall structure of the program. We've got rate increases that average in excess of 20% across the country. I think there's been studies that have been published that have stated that our rate increases are a little bit higher than the average rate increases. We've made adjustments to product offerings. We've changed networks. We've enhanced product designs. We've done many, many things to improve affordability of the specific product mix. So we feel very good about the previous guidance that we provided, that we're really targeting a small profit margin in 2017 and then returning to more closely related to target margins in 2018 and beyond."

As you know, the contract went live earlier this year, and obviously, we're very concerned because it has experienced a deterioration that certainly exceeded our forecast expectations regarding the medical loss ratio.

I commented in our discussions just a moment ago that we have realized some positive effect from that discussion. And quite frankly, we're hoping for more. Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, and again, we're hoping for a better outcome with respect to more discussion. With respect to the legal construct of the contract, we are examining our position. We, quite frankly, are awaiting the state to respond to the inquiries that we've submitted to them. And I think it's a little early for us to maybe put commentary out regarding our legal position, given the fact that there's still administrative considerations that are working their way through the system. And we're hopeful for a very positive outcome at the end of that review. We are concerned about the actuarial soundness of the rates. And that's been expressed by all of the MCOs from the get go. We are engaged in an extensive process of meetings, as I mentioned. And we'll continue to be deeply concerned until we get a resolution to this.

To your point, what we're looking for are a variety of fixes such as elimination of the health insurance tax or at least extending the 2017 moratorium.

We are also looking at additional adjustments to the special enrollment periods, which we believe the -- needs to be continually narrowed with respect to the variety and number of special enrollments.

And I think it'd probably be premature to throw a number out until we've worked through that process. So we will update that and provide more clarity on our fourth quarter call. Associated with the general and administrative expenses, I think maybe I'll just repeat sort of the commentary from last time. It's down quite substantially in 2016. And a little more than half of it is a good, sustainable run rate, meaningful decrease in SG&A expense. That has to do with more efficient processes, better performance in some of the administrative and core areas of the company. And we grew into our membership. We had a really good membership year from both a membership and premium prospective, raising guidance on that. And we're able to do that by maintaining our administrative expense levels. Obviously, then the ratio went down. The other half, or a little less than the other half, were more onetime items, and those are nonsustainable. And the most significant part of those other, less than the other half is our incentive compensation plans. As we've stated, we're a pay-for-performance company, and we had our promises to Wall Street in what we expected earnings to be, and we ensured that we delivered those earnings. And unfortunately, we had to lower our incentive compensation expense as part of that process. So a little less than half will come back in 2017."

So like, for instance, California still has 11 competitors, Virginia still has 8 competitors, just to rattle off a couple of our states. In terms of the risk pool, we believe that we understand the risk pool. We're very good at the Individual marketplace. We've been the #1 Individual market carrier for years and years prior to the ACA.

Number one, on average, our price point for targeted bronze and silver plans in the marketplace is higher than our competitors. We certainly recognize that and acknowledge it. And while the number of competitors in our markets has declined overall versus 2016, for the most part, those declines are in less populated areas, such as the rural market, where we have had historically high market shares. There's -- on the flip side, there's really still substantial competition across all of our markets, those served markets, most notably in these highly dense urban markets. And finally, some of the largest markets did not see any significant reduction in competition. For example, California still has 11 competitors, down 1 from last year. Virginia still has 8. Georgia still has 5. So we know we're in highly competitive markets, and we believe we will compete very effectively. But again, I think we've very effectively managed the price points with respect to the products that we've offered in the marketplace. And so we have a fairly good outlook, as John commented earlier in his remarks, about our expected margins. And as I said then to follow on to that, we'll be evaluating our situation in those markets, all of our markets, through the beginning of the year to see how well we perform and how well the regulatory adjustments play out leading up to midyear."

We've been the #1 company in growing the ASO large group national membership over the last several years, and we've made quite a nice margin percentage on that business, but it's very small dollars. And so now the focus is to take the fact that we do have best-in-class discounts and the most sophisticated purchasers of coverage are picking us.

And 2016 was interesting because what we ended up seeing was a flight to safety, and that was one of the reasons that our 2016 Individual exchange membership grew more than expectations. And so if you go backwards a year and then you look at the number of co-ops who are in our markets that failed, it was a significant impact on our membership. And then as those customers then went into the marketplace, they -- as I said, it was a flight to safety, they went for Blue. I think the real key difference in the expectations in '16 and the expectations in '17 is, really, the amount of exits within our markets of carriers and who the exits were and how much membership those that exited had. So long story short, the co-ops in certain markets were -- had extremely high market share, and they went insolvent and their market share then was absorbed. Where in 2017, while we certainly have some exits of carriers in our markets, they do not have the breadth or the magnitude of the market share that the ones who exited a year ago had. Associated with the premium deficiency reserves, we have none recorded. We had none recorded in 2015. We have none recorded in 2016. It's a very easy question. Which means that our results are pure, our results are clean and that we don't have the puts and takes that maybe you have in some of the other companies that you're modeling."

I think, John, you said the results were very consistent with your expectations. And just looking at sort of the cadence of earnings, you saw some mid- to high single-digit growth in the first half, a big decline of double-digit percentage on EPS in 3Q and now an expected increase back in 4Q. And so I guess, if that's all very expected, what changed this year from a seasonality perspective? And then on the long term, from a strategic perspective, when you guys announced the Cigna deal, and I know we're going back 1.5 years now, you talked about Cigna bringing commercial expertise and exposure to Medicare, the strong Specialty and then the international segment. And so I'm curious kind of where those priorities sit today. And in the case that the judge disagrees with you guys and the transaction does not move forward, how do you guys think about the reaction? Is there a need for scale? Is there an appetite to do other stuff?"

Please note that we do have the G&A offset that allows us to enjoy the growth in EPS year-over-year. But it's not that there was a significant change in seasonality patterns or a huge business flux as much as it was some of the very specific items that we pointed out to as headwinds for 2016 continue to be headwinds throughout the fourth quarter.

And we're still maintaining our market share. We still believe that we can hit the target margins that we had for those things.
