We reported a strong quarter this morning, wrapping up an excellent first half to our fiscal 2016. Our second quarter revenues increased 23% to $31.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 14% to $726 million. And we reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 8% over the prior year. 
Our organization continues to demonstrate the discipline necessary to compete in a very dynamic environment and the capacity and readiness to take the actions to position us to sustain growth over the long term.
We are confident about our position and our ability to create value for health systems experiencing change. And we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $5.15 to $5.35. This range represents an 18% to 22% growth rate over our fiscal 2015.
Most of our reporting segments demonstrated strong operating performance in the second quarter. Specifically, the Pharmaceutical segment reported significant profit growth and the Medical segment showed strong underlying performance, largely masked by the Cordis-related inventory fair value step up. Adjusting for this, both segments reported robust revenues and double-digit growth in segment profit.
Turning to our segments. 
Our Pharmaceutical segment continued its momentum with a very strong second quarter. Revenue for the Pharma segment increased 25% to $28.3 billion and segment profit increased 16% to $627 million. 
Over the past few years, we have referred a number of times to the importance of having deep expertise in 2 specific areas in our pharmaceutical business: in our drugs, which represent the vast majority of prescriptions filled in the U.S.; and specialty pharmaceuticals, which account for many new launches and a significant number of development projects in the pipeline of the pharmaceutical industry. As you know, these products tend to require a very distant capabilities. We continued to show excellent progress in both of these areas.
As it relates to generics, we continued to grow our base of customers, spanning independent pharmacies, chain, mail-order, institutional and hospital pharmacies. Our generics program is designed to meet the needs of our pharmacy customers to recognize that generic drugs are extremely important to support their patients. And our program has strengthened through the purchasing capacity of Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health. 
While our generics program is an important offering for all of our customers and for us, it is also a broad and deep range of services that we provide to these customers, which enable pharmacists to provide clinical support, both to their patients and to the physicians with whom these pharmacists will increasingly be coordinating.
As more precision medicine emerges from the pipelines of the pharmaceutical industry, our Specialty Solutions group built the linkages between biopharmaceutical manufacturers and physicians, and it help manage the complexity in delivering this important care to patients. Our Specialty Solutions business continues its steep growth trajectory, growing both in our base of provider customers we serve and in the tools that make us an outstanding partner to biopharmaceutical companies. We are confident that our Specialty Solutions sales will exceed $8 billion for our fiscal 2016.
Our Medical segment continues its repositioning, and it's adding value through reinvigorated distribution businesses, new product lines and services, as well as new channels inside and outside of the U.S. Revenue for the Medical segment was up 9% to $3.2 billion. Segment profit declined to 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. If you remember, that this is the first quarter that includes the impact from the Cordis-related inventory step up. Excluding that impact, Medical segment profit growth was 10% versus the prior year.
Mike will provide more color in his commentary.
The work that we're doing in consumables, physician preference items, medical suppliers to the home, our service offering and discharge management all align with the trend towards value-based payment models. Related to this is our ability to bring our increasingly complex customers the full Cardinal Health portfolio across our Medical and Pharmaceutical segments that will help as new payment and delivery models begin to emerge.
Our business in China continues to grow at double-digit rates. Of course, China has been the subject of considerable economic news over this past months. And while the economic slowdown has significant impact for many industrials, the impact in the services sector has been more muted. Health care specifically continues to be a national priority. China's policy reforms, aging population, public health issues and expanding middle-class have created increased opportunities for scale health care solutions, and we expect the health care market in China to continue to grow.
Finally, a few words on Cordis. 
As you know, we closed the acquisition of Cordis on October 2, 2015. This is not a simple integration process, and our teams are doing an outstanding job managing well and is on target.
Of greater significance, on day 1, we were ready to serve customers and their patients seamlessly in markets across the globe. Our new Cordis leadership team is off to a strong start and this reinforces our optimism that Cordis will serve as a platform for growth. As the health care market introduces paper value models, our physician preference items strategy is designed to help our customers meet this challenge.
Our offering of products, combined with business model innovation that include services and analytics, creates real value for our customers. Cost effective, meaningful and measurable solutions, this is at the heart of our value proposition.
We closed out the first half of fiscal 2016 with strong results and well-positioned for long-term growth. Ours is an organization that internalizes its mission. In seeing our people work to serve our customers to the extreme weather at the last few weeks is a reminder of their deep commitment, not only to our customers, but also to their patients, and I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their work. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

As George mentioned, we had a strong quarter. And halfway through our fiscal 2016, we're off to a good start. We feel comfortable reaffirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance range. In my remarks, I first want to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail and then I'll end with some additional color on our expectations for the full year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.
Second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.30, growth of 8% versus the prior year. 
Starting with consolidated company results, revenues were $31.4 billion, growth of 23%. Based on what we've seen through the first half of the year, we are updating our full year revenue assumption from midteens to mid to high teens percentage growth versus the prior year.
Total company non-GAAP gross margin dollars were up 13%. Consolidated company SG&A increased by 13% versus the prior year, with the vast majority due to acquisitions. We remain focused on disciplined management of our core SG&A to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. Result in non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $726 million, an increase of 14% versus the prior year. 
Below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $43 million for the quarter. This is an increase versus the prior year, primarily due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and the Harvard Drug Group.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 37%. While this is 3 percentage points higher than the prior year, it is common for the rate to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. For the full fiscal year, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35.5% and 37%.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were nearly 332 million shares, slightly fewer shares versus the second quarter last year. We did not repurchase shares in the quarter and had about $700 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program. As I've said in the past, we will continue to evaluate share repurchases opportunistically in the context of our overall capital deployment strategy.
In the quarter, operations generated cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion. As a reminder, quarterly operating cash flows can be affected by timing. It's more representative to look at operating cash flow over a longer period, such as the first half of our fiscal year. Operating cash flow for the 6-month period was $1.4 billion.
At the end of the second quarter, we had a cash balance of $2.3 billion, with $394 million held internationally. 
Overall, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet.
I'll now review segment performance, starting with Pharmaceutical segment. 
In the second quarter, the Pharma segment increased revenues by 25% to $28.3 billion. This was a result of continued growth in our existing and new customer relationships, and to a lesser degree, the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. 
Segment profit increased 16% to $627 million, driven by growth from existing and new customer relationships, which includes strong performance from our generics program. The acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical also contributed to segment profit growth in the quarter.
Segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 17 basis points versus the prior year. As we previously mentioned, our new relationship with a large mail-order customer, while positive from an earnings and capital standpoint, was dilutive to margin rates.
Our integration of Harvard Drug continues to go well. And while still early, we are on track to achieve our accretion target of greater than $0.15 in this fiscal year and greater than $0.20 for fiscal '17. 
Our Specialty business had strong double-digit growth, which includes the contribution from the acquisition of Metro Medical, which is also going well.
Of late, many of you have been asking us about branded and generic manufacturer pricing. I'll share our current view which is consistent with what we recently communicated at our mid-January webcasted event. We continued to model that branded manufacturer price increases will generally be similar to historical levels. This would be in line with our FY '16 assumptions.
As it relates to generic pricing, over the last 18 months, our commentary and assumptions have been that generic inflation would moderate. In our fiscal '15, that moderation was about as we expected. When we provided assumptions for our fiscal 16, we communicated that we expected further moderation. In fact, we are seeing moderation in generic pricing, although as we recently shared, it is somewhat steeper than we had originally modeled. That being said, generic manufacturer pricing is only one piece of our overall generics program, which, in total, we still see as meeting our expectations.
Our solid work in sourcing, attracting new customers, penetrating existing customers, utilizing data and analytics, as well as executing on new item launches, has been key in our overall success. I continue to be excited about our overall generics program and the different components we have created to ensure long-term sustainability.
Overall, this was another solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment, and while there are always puts and takes, the quarter was largely in line with our assumptions.
Now let's go to the Medical segment performance. 
Second quarter revenues grew 9% to $3.2 billion, driven by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Our At Home business, which grew double digits, also contributed to top line growth for the segment. 
Segment profit decreased 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. As a reminder, this was the first quarter that included the acquisition of Cordis and the related impact of the inventory fair value step up. Excluding the step up of $21 million, the Medical segment profit grew 10%.
The total step up came in at about $0.08, which is lower than the $0.13 to $0.15 of EPS impact we had anticipated. We expensed $0.04 in Q2, and we will do the same in Q3. There will be no inventory fair value step up to recognize in Q4.
In this quarter, the favorability of the step up as compared to our original guidance was offset by some one-time items resulting from the execution of the transaction, as well as FX. Looking to Q3, we expect the step up favorability and FX to be awash. 
Setting those nonoperating pieces aside, as George mentioned, Cordis is off to a good start, with all key personnel in place and day-to-day operations up and running. 
As we integrate the Cordis business through the remainder of our fiscal year, we continued to be excited and will work to drive efficiencies. As we previously shared, in FY '17, we still expect the transaction to be greater than $0.20 accretive and increasingly accretive thereafter. We are also working towards achieving the $100 million of annual synergies as we exit our fiscal 2018.
Switching to other pieces of our Medical business. 
As expected, from an operational standpoint, our Canadian business has stabilized, though foreign currency created a bit of a headwind. The team there continues to work diligently to ensure we position our business for the future. Our Cardinal Health brand products continued to grow over and above the incremental increase from Cordis. Notably, we saw this growth in our strategic accounts, which are those customers that we have identified as key partners in the continually evolving health care landscape.
Turning to Slide #6, you will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. 
The $0.32 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, as well as a $39 million LIFO-related charge. 
With the first half behind us, there are 2 variables I'd note that probably have the most impact on us achieving the very high end of our guidance range for the full year: the First is generic manufacturing pricing levels and the second is the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates related to our specific businesses. These items, moving in our favor, would push us towards the achievement of the very top end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.35 that we affirm this morning. As a reminder, this is a growth of 18% to 22% to the prior year.
While there are a few moving parts, our overall breadth and presence across the continuum of care provides us with the confidence to deliver on our commitment. I believe we have positioned ourselves well in the first half. We continue to be focused on our customers and have the talent to drive results and execute against our strategic priorities.

So we are seeing FX be both positive and negative depending on which country we're talking about and whether or not we're talking about on the manufacturing side or on the commercial operations. And so clearly, with Cordis, we are getting some additional exposure with FX with 70% of that business being overseas. But to be able to actually get any detail about how that FX will be impacting our business exactly, it's really difficult to do that and not something at this time that I'd be comfortable with talking about, but it's something that we'll take a look at as we look forward and decide how much more color we can provide."

Now as I've mentioned, there's other things going in the direction which is why we reaffirmed our overall increased guidance. But the 2 things that we think that would need to go back to more similar to the first half would be FX and generic pricing. If they were to return to more similar levels as where they were in the first part of this fiscal year, then that would enable us to get to the very high end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance."

Can you just help us philosophically understand maybe some of the differences, at least, as you see it for Cardinal relative to the peers?"

I think what I would say is that, as you guys look at peer groups, again, we have many different competitors in different lines of business, I always have to remind you of that. But I think every business is different. Everybody's product line is different. Their product mixes are different and their customer mixes are different. So from our standpoint, we've devoted a lot of in energy over these last 7 years to positioning ourselves, both in terms of product line and in terms of customer mix, to be on what we think are the right side of trends. And so, again, this is not -- for me, a comment on anybody else, but on our business, I think our teams have done a good job of segmenting our markets, understanding what their needs are and how we can attach value from our work to theirs. It's been a long process, but I think we are generally doing that very effectively. So it's a hard question to answer as a comparative answer. But I think I can describe our organization which is a very much focused on certain key trends, and we have been for quite some time and then really disciplined execution around the priorities that are tied to those."

And I think, again, you can look around in the country and different health systems and they are all responding differently. There are, of course, pressures from, as you said, the public and the private sector to move to some new financing models, and which focus more on outcomes than activity. And I think everybody is at a different stage of adapting to that. What we've tried to do is make sure we're in a position to compete in either model. In a fee-for-service model, we know how to do that and we are very, as Mike said, disciplined by that. But we started to build some tools that allow us to be a valued partner in models that are emerging.

And as you know that, by definition, an aspiration means it's something you think you can achieve but it's hard to reach and something that you've got to get out and execute and get a lot of things done to do, and we're not backing away from that aspiration. But it's not only growing the Cordis products, it's the other Cardinal Health brand, it's growing the At Home business, which also had a nice revenue growth this quarter. It's also our services businesses which tend to be higher margin rate. And we've always said all along that to get to that rate, there will probably be additional M&A to get there.

Obviously, George, I won't be able to get into lots of detail, but I'll give you a little bit information to see if I can be helpful. First of all, we can make money in both the inflationary environment on generics or a deflationary environment. Historically, generics has been a deflationary environment, and we've been able to make money in that. And so I look at it as 2 ways. Think about this way. When generics are going up in price, you do make some inventory revaluation income, some people call that buy side margins. And so in a deflating market, you don't make the upside on the inventory inflation, but you're protected from any inventory exposure. You get for stock adjusted. So you basically, in an inflating environment, make the money on the extra bucket of money on the inventory inflation. But in both environments, you are able to reprice to the customer and be able to adjust your pricing in order to work on your margins. But I think one of the keys you have to remember, whether you're in a inflationary or a deflationary environment, every single day, our goal is to keep our customers competitive. And our pricing is often, it's not often, is based on what we need to do to be able to sell the product and keep our customers competitive as they look at things like reimbursement that impact them every sing day. And so that's really important to us. And there's a lot more levers than just generic pricing. As I mentioned before, our ability to launch drugs effectively, penetrate current customers and existing customers. Red Oak has clearly been a driver of our ability there. There's just a lot of pieces that go together, and it's hard to disconnect any one of those and try to quantify those when it's all blended together."

We work really, really hard to make sure no matter what size you are, whether you're in medical or in pharma, that you're seen as important. I think it's one of the things that Red Oak has done a good job of. It's also is working hard to treat every manufacturer like an equal partner. But as you think about the pricing, sure, I think most suppliers were always going to say that their fees are too high. But we are very, very disciplined about how we charge our fees. And we look at things like line extensions, whether they're controlled drugs, whether they're refrigerated drugs. All those different costs that we incur that they would have to incur that if they were to go direct, we look at those to understand what we should charge as a fee. And so we work incredibly hard to make sure that we don't charge fees to manufacturers that would be more expensive than them going around us. And so I feel really confident with our model and our pricing that we are the most efficient way of getting products through the supply channel. I don't see any country that's more efficient or any supply chain that's more efficient than the United States.

No, no real fundamental changes to the way we're pricing or the competitive environment or anything like that. This is merely the 18 basis points is really, the majority of it is the addition of a new customer that was added in the quarter that was at lower margin rates. And remember, we talked about this. This is a situation, while the margin rates are lower, the amount of capital that we deploy is incredibly efficient, and so we're willing to take lower margin rates when we have the ability to manage our capital effectively. As far as the sequential drop, remember, last quarter, we did mention that there was about $0.11 in that quarter that we said were kind of like one-timers, part of it being those generic items that we're operating a little bit differently than we anticipated. And then also, we had the acceleration of some of the benefits of our M&A in the quarter that was a little bit better than we thought. So if you think about $0.11 of kind of extra in last quarter, the reason that we talked about back then it was to give you some insight that, that was kind of the way to think about how this quarter would be. So this was much in line with what we expected for this quarter."

But in terms of, overall, our ability to source products is doing better, our ability to penetrate existing and new customers is going very well. Our use of data and analytics and how we price our products is going really well. So when you wrap it all together, I still feel like our overall generics program is performing about as we expected, but there, it's just coming in a little bit differently.

We've renegotiated our contracts over the last several years with manufacturers, as well as, if you look at the overall supply line and our commitment to inventory, it takes about 6 months before any type of changes in commodities will have an impact on us. And then the last bucket is that we have a lot of different commodities and not all move with oil.

And we really want to focus on how can we be the best possible partner for our generic partners and trying to manage inventory more from a supply standpoint versus a pricing standpoint was the way that we felt that it would go. It was better for the manufacturers, and we thought, over the long run, it would improve our relationships, and hopefully, make them stickier, as well as lead to a better everyday low price for us. And so we did that. And that philosophy was also shared by CVS when we formed Red Oak is that, our focus is at Red Oak is how can we be the absolute best partner to our manufacturers. Obviously, we want to get a great price, but we want to be transparent, we want to be easy to do business with, we want them to want to come do business with us, and one of that way is helping smooth out fluctuations in the supply chain, which is something that we've done for a while that I think maybe has made us a little different from an exposure standpoint to the declines in pricing."

We reported a strong quarter this morning, wrapping up an excellent first half to our fiscal 2016. Our second quarter revenues increased 23% to $31.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 14% to $726 million. And we reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 8% over the prior year. 
Our organization continues to demonstrate the discipline necessary to compete in a very dynamic environment and the capacity and readiness to take the actions to position us to sustain growth over the long term.
We are confident about our position and our ability to create value for health systems experiencing change. And we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $5.15 to $5.35. This range represents an 18% to 22% growth rate over our fiscal 2015.
Most of our reporting segments demonstrated strong operating performance in the second quarter. Specifically, the Pharmaceutical segment reported significant profit growth and the Medical segment showed strong underlying performance, largely masked by the Cordis-related inventory fair value step-up. Adjusting for this, both segments reported robust revenues and double-digit growth in segment profit.
Turning to our segments. 
Our Pharmaceutical segment continued its momentum with a very strong second quarter. Revenue for the Pharma segment increased 25% to $28.3 billion and segment profit increased 16% to $627 million. 
Over the past few years, we have referred a number of times to the importance of having deep expertise in 2 specific areas in our pharmaceutical business: In our drugs, which represent the vast majority of prescriptions filled in the U.S.; and specialty pharmaceuticals, which account for many new launches and a significant number of development projects in the pipeline of the pharmaceutical industry. As you know, these products tend to require very distant capabilities. We continued to show excellent progress in both of these areas.
As it relates to generics, we continued to grow our base of customers, spanning independent pharmacies, chain, mail-order, institutional and hospital pharmacies. Our generics program is designed to meet the needs of our pharmacy customers to recognize that generic drugs are extremely important to support their patients. And our program has strengthened through the purchasing capacity of Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health. 
While our generics program is an important offering for all of our customers and for us, it is also the broad and deep range of services that we provide to these customers, which enable pharmacists to provide clinical support, both to their patients and to the physicians with whom these pharmacists will increasingly be coordinating.
As more precision medicine emerges from the pipelines of the pharmaceutical industry, our Specialty Solutions group built the linkages between biopharmaceutical manufacturers and physicians, and it helps manage the complexity in delivering this important care to patients. Our Specialty Solutions business continues its steep growth trajectory, growing both in our base of provider customers we serve and in the tools that make us an outstanding partner to biopharmaceutical companies. We are confident that our Specialty Solutions sales will exceed $8 billion for our fiscal 2016.
Our Medical segment continues its repositioning, and it's adding value through reinvigorated distribution businesses, new product lines and services, as well as new channels inside and outside of the U.S. Revenue for the Medical segment was up 9% to $3.2 billion. Segment profit declined to 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. If you remember that this is the first quarter that includes the impact from the Cordis-related inventory step-up. Excluding that impact, Medical segment profit growth was 10% versus the prior year. Mike will provide more color in his commentary.
The work that we're doing in consumables, physician preference items, medical suppliers to the home, our service offerings and discharge management all align with the trend towards value-based payment models. Related to this is our ability to bring our increasingly complex customers the full Cardinal Health portfolio across both our Medical and Pharmaceutical segments that will help as new payment and delivery models begin to emerge.
Our business in China continues to grow at double-digit rates. Of course, China has been a subject of considerable economic news over these past months. And while the economic slowdown has significant impact for many industrials, the impact in the services sector has been more muted. Health care specifically continues to be a national priority. China's policy reforms, aging population, public health issues and expanding middle-class have created increased opportunities for scale health care solutions, and we expect the health care market in China to continue to grow.
Finally, a few words on Cordis. 
As you know, we closed this acquisition of Cordis on October 2, 2015. This is not a simple integration process, and our teams are doing an outstanding job managing all the [indiscernible] and is on target.
Of greater significance, on day 1, we were ready to serve customers and their patients seamlessly in markets across the globe. Our new Cordis leadership team is off to a strong start and this reinforces our optimism that Cordis will serve as a platform for growth. As the health care market introduces paper value models, our physician preference items strategy is designed to help our customers meet this challenge.
Our offering of products, combined with business model innovation that include services and analytics, creates real value for our customers. Cost effective, meaningful and measurable solutions, this is at the heart of our value proposition.
We closed out the first half of fiscal 2016 with strong results and well position for long-term growth. Ours is an organization that internalizes its mission. And seeing our people work to serve our customers to the extreme weather at the last few weeks is a reminder of their deep commitment, not only to our customers, but also to their patients, and I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their work. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

As George mentioned, we had a strong quarter. And halfway through our fiscal 2016, we're off to a good start. We feel comfortable reaffirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance range. In my remarks, I first want to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail and then I'll end with some additional color on our expectations for the full year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.
Second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.30, growth of 8% versus the prior year. 
Starting with consolidated company results, revenues were $31.4 billion, growth of 23%. Based on what we've seen through the first half of the year, we are updating our full year revenue assumption from mid-teens to mid to high teens percentage growth versus the prior year.
Total company non-GAAP gross margin dollars were up 13%. Consolidated company SG&A increased by 13% versus the prior year, with the vast majority due to acquisitions. We remain focused on disciplined management of our core SG&A to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $726 million, an increase of 14% versus the prior year. 
Below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $43 million for the quarter. This is an increase versus the prior year, primarily due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and the Harvard Drug Group.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 37%. While this is 3 percentage points higher than the prior year, it is common for the rate to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For the full fiscal year, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35.5% and 37%.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were nearly 332 million shares, slightly fewer shares versus the second quarter last year. We did not repurchase shares in the quarter and had about $700 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. As I said in the past, we will continue to evaluate share repurchases opportunistically in the context of our overall capital deployment strategy.
In the quarter, operations generated cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion. As a reminder, quarterly operating cash flows can be affected by timing. It's more representative to look at operating cash flow over a longer period, such as the first half of our fiscal year. Operating cash flow for the 6-month period was $1.4 billion.
At the end of the second quarter, we had a cash balance of $2.3 billion, with $394 million held internationally. 
Overall, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet.
I'll now review segment performance, starting with the Pharmaceutical segment. 
In the second quarter, the Pharma segment increased revenues by 25% to $28.3 billion. This was a result of continued growth in our existing and new customer relationships and, to a lesser degree, the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. 
Segment profit increased 16% to $627 million, driven by growth from existing and new customer relationships, which includes strong performance from our generics program. The acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical also contributed to segment profit growth in the quarter.
Segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 17 basis points versus the prior year. As we previously mentioned, our new relationship with a large mail-order customer, while positive from an earnings and capital standpoint, was dilutive to margin rates.
Our integration of Harvard Drug continues to go well. And while still early, we are on track to achieve our accretion target of greater than $0.15 in this fiscal year and greater than $0.20 for fiscal '17. 
Our Specialty business had strong double-digit growth, which includes the contribution from the acquisition of Metro Medical, which is also going well.
Of late, many of you have been asking us about branded and generic manufacturer pricing. I'll share our current view, which is consistent with what we recently communicated at a mid-January webcasted event. We continued to model that branded manufacturer price increases will generally be similar to historical levels. This would be in line with our FY '16 assumptions.
As it relates to generic pricing, over the last 18 months, our commentary and assumptions have been that generic inflation would moderate. In our fiscal '15, that moderation was about as we expected. When we provided assumptions for our fiscal 16, we communicated that we expected further moderation. In fact, we are seeing moderation in generic pricing, although as we recently shared, it is somewhat steeper than we had originally modeled. That being said, generic manufacturer pricing is only one piece of our overall generics program, which, in total, we still see as meeting our expectations.
Our solid work in sourcing, attracting new customers, penetrating existing customers, utilizing data and analytics, as well as executing on new item launches, has been key in our overall success. I continue to be excited about our overall generics program and the different components we have created to ensure long-term sustainability.
Overall, this was another solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment, and while there are always puts and takes, the quarter was largely in line with our assumptions.
Now let's go to the Medical segment performance. Second quarter revenues grew 9% to $3.2 billion, driven by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Our At Home business, which grew double digits, also contributed to top line growth for the segment. Segment profit decreased 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. As a reminder, this was the first quarter that included the acquisition of Cordis and the related impact of the inventory fair value step-up. Excluding the step-up of $21 million, the Medical segment profit grew 10%.
The total step-up came in at about $0.08, which is lower than the $0.13 to $0.15 of EPS impact we had anticipated. We expensed $0.04 in Q2, and we will do the same in Q3. There will be no inventory fair value step-up to recognize in Q4.
In this quarter, the favorability of the step-up as compared to our original guidance was offset by some one-time items resulting from the execution of the transaction, as well as FX. Looking to Q3, we expect the step-up favorability and FX to be awash. 
Setting those nonoperating pieces aside, as George mentioned, Cordis is off to a good start, with all key personnel in place and day-to-day operations up and running. 
As we integrate the Cordis business through the remainder of our fiscal year, we continued to be excited and will work to drive efficiencies. As we previously shared, in FY '17, we still expect the transaction to be greater than $0.20 accretive and increasingly accretive thereafter. We are also working towards achieving the $100 million of annual synergies as we exit our fiscal 2018.
Switching to other pieces of our Medical business. As expected, from an operational standpoint, our Canadian business has stabilized, though foreign currency created a bit of a headwind. The team there continues to work diligently to ensure we position our business for the future. Our Cardinal Health brand products continued to grow over and above the incremental increase from Cordis. Notably, we saw this growth in our strategic accounts, which are those customers that we have identified as key partners in the continually evolving health care landscape.
Turning to Slide #6, you will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. 
The $0.32 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, as well as a $39 million LIFO-related charge. 
With the first half behind us, there are 2 variables I'd note that probably have the most impact on us achieving the very high end of our guidance range for the full year: The First is generic manufacturing pricing levels and the second is the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates related to our specific businesses. These items, moving in our favor, would push us towards the achievement of the very top end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.35 that we affirm this morning. As a reminder, this is a growth of 18% to 22% to the prior year.
While there are a few moving parts, our overall breadth and presence across the continuum of care provides us with the confidence to deliver on our commitment. I believe we have positioned ourselves well in the first half. We continue to be focused on our customers and have the talent to drive results and execute against our strategic priorities.

Obviously, we have an enormous health care system that's been operating with a certain financing model for many, many years. And so change doesn't happen overnight. We don't expect it to. So I think what's going to happen is, where is the process? We'll be living in a world, in which both the fee-for-service model exists and alternate models are emerging. And I think, again, you can look around in the country and different health systems and they are all responding differently. There are, of course, pressures from, as you said, the public and the private sector to move to some new financing models, and which focus more on outcomes than activity. And I think everybody is at a different stage of adapting to that. What we've tried to do is make sure we're in a position to compete in either model. In a fee-for-service model, we know how to do that. I think we are very, as Mike said, disciplined about that. But we started to build some tools that allow us to be a valued partner in models that are emerging. So I think as you're describing, it's a mixed bag around the system, but the pressures to move towards some kind of value-based model exist, and that's probably true here. It's probably true elsewhere in the world as well."

Obviously, George, I won't be able to get into lots of detail, but I'll give you a little bit information to see if I can be helpful. First of all, we can make money in both the inflationary environment on generics or deflationary environment. History -- historically, generics has been a deflationary environment, and we've been able to make money in that. And so I look at it as 2 ways. Think about this way: When generics are going up in price, you do make some inventory revaluation income. Some people call that buy side margins. And so, in a deflating market, you don't make the upside on the inventory inflation, but you're protected from any inventory exposure. You get floor stock adjusted. So you basically, in an inflating environment, make the money on -- the extra bucket of money on the inventory inflation. But in both environments, you are able to reprice to the customer and be able to adjust your pricing in order to work on your margins. But I think one of the keys you have to remember, whether you're in a inflationary or a deflationary environment, every single day, our goal is to keep our customers competitive. And our pricing is often -- it's not often, is based on what we need to do to be able to sell the product and keep our customers competitive as they look at things like reimbursement that impact them every sing day. And so that's really important to us. And there's a lot more levers than just generic pricing. As I mentioned before, our ability to launch drugs effectively, penetrate current customers and existing customers. Red Oak has clearly been a driver of our ability there. There's just a lot of pieces that go together, and it's hard to disconnect any one of those and try to quantify those when it's all blended together."

I know that brand drugs as a portion of the margin -- as the portion of the total segment margin are a smaller piece. But how should we think about how important those fees from the smaller and midsized branded guys are? And kind of what's the risk to that segment of the business, if they're consolidated alike?"

I think all of our manufacturing partners are important to us. We work really, really hard to make sure no matter what size you are, whether you're in medical or in pharma, that you're seen as important. I think it's one of the things that Red Oak has done a good job of. It's also is working hard to treat every manufacturer like an equal partner. But as you think about the pricing, sure, I think most suppliers were always going to say that their fees are too high. But we are very, very disciplined about how we charge our fees. And we look at things like line extensions, whether they're controlled drugs, whether they're refrigerated drugs. All those different costs that we incur that they would have to incur that if they were to go direct, we look at those to understand what we should charge as a fee. And so we work incredibly hard to make sure that we don't charge fees to manufacturers that would be more expensive than them going around us. And so I feel really confident with our model and our pricing that we are the most efficient way of getting products through the supply channel. I don't see any country that's more efficient or any supply chain that's more efficient than the United States.

So we just try to stay very close to it. It can vary by product, and it can vary by different classes of drugs.

As far as the sequential drop, remember, last quarter, we did mention that there was about $0.11 in that quarter that we said were kind of like one-timers, part of it being those generic items that we're operating a little bit differently than we anticipated.

There's always the good negotiation every time one of these happen. Everybody wants to pay lower. We want to get paid more. We spent a lot of time talking about the various dynamics of the manufacturers mix and whether their line extension gone up or down, whether or not they have changed their mix as far as controlled drugs or refrigerated items. And so we worked through all those. We have incredibly productive relationships with our manufacturers. And so I would tell you that the way these are going still trending the way they have historically, and there are still about 80% or so of the margins are coming from a noncontingent standpoint and roughly 20% or so are coming from what we call a contingent basis, which means that inflation can drive the actual value of the dollars when we talk about contingent versus noncontingent."

We expect generic launches for this year to be slightly less than this past year. But in terms of, overall, our ability to source products is doing better, our ability to penetrate existing and new customers is going very well. Our use of data and analytics and how we price our products is going really well. So when you wrap it all together, I still feel like our overall generics program is performing about as we expected, but there, it's just coming in a little bit differently. Other than that, I really can't split it down more. It's actually even if I wanted to, it's incredibly difficult because they're all so interrelated on how we work with customers.

We've renegotiated our contracts over the last several years with manufacturers, as well as if you look at the overall supply line and our commitment to inventory, it takes about 6 months before any type of changes in commodities will have an impact on us. And then the last bucket is that we have a lot of different commodities and not all move with oil.

And we really want to focus on how can we be the best possible partner for our generic partners and trying to manage inventory more from a supply standpoint versus a pricing standpoint was the way that we felt that it would go. It was better for the manufacturers, and we thought, over the long run, it would improve our relationships and, hopefully, make them stickier, as well as lead to a better everyday low price for us. And so we did that. And that philosophy was also shared by CVS when we formed Red Oak is that our focuses at Red Oak is, how can we be the absolute best partner to our manufacturers. Obviously, we want to get a great price, but we want to be transparent, we want to be easy to do business with, we want them to want to come do business with us, and one of that way is helping smooth out fluctuations in the supply chain, which is something that we've done for a while that, I think, maybe has made us a little different from an exposure standpoint to the declines in pricing."

We reported a strong quarter this morning, wrapping up an excellent first half to our fiscal 2016. Our second quarter revenues increased 23% to $31.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 14% to $726 million. And we reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 8% over the prior year. 
Our organization continues to demonstrate the discipline necessary to compete in a very dynamic environment and the capacity and readiness to take the actions to position us to sustain growth over the long term.
We are confident about our position and our ability to create value for health systems experiencing change. And we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $5.15 to $5.35. This range represents an 18% to 22% growth rate over our fiscal 2015.
Most of our reporting segments demonstrated strong operating performance in the second quarter. Specifically, the Pharmaceutical segment reported significant profit growth and the Medical segment showed strong underlying performance, largely masked by the Cordis-related inventory fair value step-up. Adjusting for this, both segments reported robust revenues and double-digit growth in segment profit.
Turning to our segments. 
Our Pharmaceutical segment continued its momentum with a very strong second quarter. Revenue for the Pharma segment increased 25% to $28.3 billion and segment profit increased 16% to $627 million. 
Over the past few years, we have referred a number of times to the importance of having deep expertise in 2 specific areas in our Pharmaceutical business: in our drugs, which represent the vast majority of prescriptions filled in the U.S.; and specialty pharmaceuticals, which account for many new launches and a significant number of development projects in the pipeline of the pharmaceutical industry. As you know, these products tend to require very distinct capabilities. We continue to show excellent progress in both of these areas.
As it relates to generics, we continued to grow our base of customers, spanning independent pharmacies, chain, mail order, institutional and hospital pharmacies. Our generics program is designed to meet the needs of our pharmacy customers who recognize that generic drugs are extremely important to support their patients. And our program has strengthened through the purchasing capacity of Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health. 
While our generics program is an important offering for all of our customers and for us, it is also the broad and deep range of services that we provide to these customers which enable pharmacists to provide clinical support, both to their patients and to the physicians with whom these pharmacists will increasingly be coordinating.
As more precision medicine emerges from the pipelines of the pharmaceutical industry, our Specialty Solutions group builds the linkages between biopharmaceutical manufacturers and physicians, and it helps manage the complexity in delivering this important care to patients. Our Specialty Solutions business continues its steep growth trajectory, growing both in our base of provider customers we serve and in the tools that make us an outstanding partner to biopharmaceutical companies. We are confident that our Specialty Solutions sales will exceed $8 billion for our fiscal 2016.
Our Medical segment continues its repositioning, and it's adding value through reinvigorated distribution businesses, new product lines and services, as well as new channels inside and outside of the U.S. Revenue for the Medical segment was up 9% to $3.2 billion. Segment profit declined 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. If you remember, this is the first quarter that includes the impact from the Cordis-related inventory step-up. Excluding that impact, Medical segment profit growth was 10% versus the prior year. Mike will provide more color in his commentary.
The work that we're doing in consumables, physician preference items, medical supplies to the home, our service offerings and discharge management, all align with the trend towards value-based payment models. Related to this is our ability to bring our increasingly complex customers the full Cardinal Health portfolio across both our Medical and Pharmaceutical segments that will help as new payment and delivery models begin to emerge.
Our business in China continues to grow at double-digit rates. Of course, China has been a subject of considerable economic news over these past months. And while the economic slowdown has significant impact for many industrials, the impact in the services sector has been more muted. Health care, specifically, continues to be a national priority. China's policy reforms, aging population, public health issues and expanding middle-class have created increased opportunities for scale health care solutions, and we expect the health care market in China to continue to grow.
Finally, a few words on Cordis. 
As you know, we closed this acquisition of Cordis on October 2, 2015. This is not a simple integration process, and our teams are doing an outstanding job managing all the many moving parts [indiscernible] and is on target.
Of greater significance, on day 1, we were ready to serve customers and their patients seamlessly in markets across the globe. Our new Cordis leadership team is off to a strong start, and this reinforces our optimism that Cordis will serve as a platform for growth. As the health care market introduces fee-for-value models, our physician-preference-item strategy is designed to help our customers meet this challenge.
Our offering of products, combined with business model innovation that includes services and analytics, creates real value for our customers. Cost effective, meaningful and measurable solutions: This is at the heart of our value proposition.
We closed out the first half of fiscal 2016 with strong results and well positioned for long-term growth. Ours is an organization that internalizes its mission. And seeing our people work to serve our customers through the extreme weather at the last few weeks is a reminder of their deep commitment, not only to our customers, but also to their patients, and I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their work. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Starting with consolidated company results. Revenues were $31.4 billion, growth of 23%. Based on what we've seen through the first half of the year, we are updating our full year revenue assumption from mid-teens to mid to high teens percentage growth versus the prior year.
Total company non-GAAP gross margin dollars were up 13%. Consolidated company SG&A increased by 13% versus the prior year, with the vast majority due to acquisitions. We remain focused on disciplined management of our core SG&A to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $726 million, an increase of 14% versus the prior year. 
Below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $43 million for the quarter. This is an increase versus the prior year, primarily due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and the Harvard Drug Group.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 37%. While this is 3 percentage points higher than the prior year, it is common for the rate to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For the full fiscal year, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35.5% and 37%.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were nearly 332 million shares, slightly fewer shares versus the second quarter last year. We did not repurchase shares in the quarter and had about $700 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. As I said in the past, we will continue to evaluate share repurchases opportunistically in the context of our overall capital deployment strategy.
In the quarter, operations generated cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion. As a reminder, quarterly operating cash flows can be affected by timing. It's more representative to look at operating cash flow over a longer period, such as the first half of our fiscal year. Operating cash flow for the 6-month period was $1.4 billion.
At the end of the second quarter, we had a cash balance of $2.3 billion, with $394 million held internationally. 
Overall, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet.
I'll now review segment performance, starting with the Pharmaceutical segment. 
In the second quarter, the Pharma segment increased revenues by 25% to $28.3 billion. This was a result of continued growth in our existing and new customer relationships and, to a lesser degree, the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. 
Segment profit increased 16% to $627 million, driven by growth from existing and new customer relationships, which includes strong performance from our generics program. The acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical also contributed to segment profit growth in the quarter.
Segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 17 basis points versus the prior year. As we previously mentioned, our new relationship with a large mail-order customer, while positive from an earnings and capital standpoint, was dilutive to margin rates.
Our integration of Harvard Drug continues to go well. And while still early, we are on track to achieve our accretion targets of greater than $0.15 in this fiscal year and greater than $0.20 for fiscal '17. 
Our Specialty business had strong double-digit growth, which includes the contribution from the acquisition of Metro Medical, which is also going well.
Of late, many of you have been asking us about branded and generic manufacturer pricing. I'll share our current view, which is consistent with what we recently communicated at a mid-January webcasted event. We continue to model that branded manufacturer price increases will generally be similar to historical levels. This would be in line with our FY '16 assumptions.
As it relates to generic pricing, over the last 18 months, our commentary and assumptions have been that generic inflation would moderate. In our fiscal '15, that moderation was about as we expected. When we provided assumptions for our fiscal 16, we communicated that we expected further moderation. In fact, we are seeing moderation in generic pricing, although as we recently shared, it is somewhat steeper than we had originally modeled. That being said, generic manufacturer pricing is only one piece of our overall generics program, which, in total, we still see as meeting our expectations.
Our solid work in sourcing, attracting new customers, penetrating existing customers, utilizing data and analytics, as well as executing on new item launches, has been key in our overall success. I continue to be excited about our overall generics program and the different components we have created to ensure long-term sustainability.
Overall, this was another solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment, and while there are always puts and takes, the quarter was largely in line with our assumptions.
Now let's go to the Medical segment performance. Second quarter revenues grew 9% to $3.2 billion, driven by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Our at-home business, which grew double digits, also contributed to top line growth for the segment. Segment profit decreased 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. As a reminder, this was the first quarter that included the acquisition of Cordis and the related impact of the inventory fair value step-up. Excluding the step-up of $21 million, the Medical segment profit grew 10%.
The total step-up came in at about $0.08, which is lower than the $0.13 to $0.15 of EPS impact we had anticipated. We expensed $0.04 in Q2, and we will do the same in Q3. There will be no inventory fair value step-up to recognize in Q4.
In this quarter, the favorability of the step-up as compared to our original guidance was offset by some onetime items resulting from the execution of the transaction, as well as FX. Looking to Q3, we expect the step-up favorability and FX to be a wash. 
Setting those nonoperating pieces aside, as George mentioned, Cordis is off to a good start, with all key personnel in place and day-to-day operations up and running. 
As we integrate the Cordis business through the remainder of our fiscal year, we continue to be excited and will work to drive efficiencies. As we previously shared, in FY '17, we still expect the transaction to be greater than $0.20 accretive and increasingly accretive thereafter. We are also working towards achieving the $100 million of annual synergies as we exit our fiscal 2018.
Switching to other pieces of our Medical business. As expected, from an operational standpoint, our Canadian business has stabilized, though foreign currency created a bit of a headwind. The team there continues to work diligently to ensure we position our business for the future. Our Cardinal Health brand products continued to grow over and above the incremental increase from Cordis. Notably, we saw this growth in our strategic accounts, which are those customers that we have identified as key partners in the continually evolving health care landscape.
Turning to Slide #6, you will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. 
The $0.32 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, as well as a $39 million LIFO-related charge. 
With the first half behind us, there are 2 variables I'd note that probably have the most impact on us achieving the very high end of our guidance range for the full year: The first is generic manufacturing pricing levels and the second is the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates related to our specific businesses. These items moving in our favor would push us towards the achievement of the very top end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.35 that we reaffirmed this morning. As a reminder, this is a growth of 18% to 22% to the prior year.
While there are a few moving parts, our overall breadth and presence across the continuum of care provides us with the confidence to deliver on our commitments. I believe we have positioned ourselves well in the first half. We continue to be focused on our customers and have the talent to drive results and execute against our strategic priorities.

There are, of course, pressures from, as you said, the public and the private sector to move to some new financing models, and which focus more on outcomes than activity. And I think everybody is at a different stage of adapting to that. What we've tried to do is make sure we're in a position to compete in either model. In a fee-for-service model, we know how to do that. I think we are very, as Mike said, disciplined about that.

And then secondly, I think you had a goal out in the marketplace around where you can get the margin on the Medical segment over time. If I back out the onetime item around inventory step-up in the quarter, it looks like the margins are trending just above 4%. So can you talk to us about how do you reach that goal of above 5% over the next couple of years? Is it the private-label products? What are the things that we need to see in that segment?

I think, first of all, our Cardinal Health brand products, even if you pull out Cordis, still were able to grow.

As you know, there is many margin initiatives in Medical that we can get to -- go after, getting to our aspiration of 5.75%. And as you know that by definition, an aspiration means it's something you think you can achieve, but it's hard to reach and something that you've got to execute and get a lot of things done to do, and we're not backing away from that aspiration. But it's not only growing the Cordis products, it's the other Cardinal Health brand, it's growing the at-home business, which also had a nice revenue growth this quarter. It's also our services businesses, which tend to be higher margin rates. And we've always said all along that to get to that rate, there will probably be additional M&A to get there. And so we're going to continue to evaluate, in a very disciplined way, other M&A opportunities to reach that goal."

Obviously, George, I won't be able to get into lots of detail, but I'll give you a little bit information to see if I can be helpful. First of all, we can make money in both an inflationary environment on generics or a deflationary environment. History -- historically, generics has been a deflationary environment, and we've been able to make money in that. And so I look at it as 2 ways. Think about it this way: When generics are going up in price, you do make some inventory revaluation income. Some people call that buy-side margins. And so, in a deflating market, you don't make the upside on the inventory inflation, but you're protected from any inventory exposure. You get floor stock adjusted. So you basically, in an inflating environment, make the money on -- the extra bucket of money on the inventory inflation. But in both environments, you are able to reprice to the customer and be able to adjust your pricing in order to work on your margins. But I think one of the keys you have to remember, whether you're in an inflationary or a deflationary environment, every single day, our goal is to keep our customers competitive. And our pricing is often -- it's not often, is based on what we need to do to be able to sell the products and keep our customers competitive as they look at things like reimbursement that impact them every single day. And so that's really important to us. And there's a lot more levers than just generic pricing. As I mentioned before, our ability to launch drugs effectively, penetrate current customers and existing customers, Red Oak has clearly been a driver of our ability there. There's just a lot of pieces that go together, and it's hard to disconnect any one of those and try to quantify those when it's all blended together."

I know that brand drugs as a portion of the margin -- as the portion of the total segment margin are a smaller piece. But how should we think about how important those fees from the smaller and midsized branded guys are? And kind of what's the risk to that segment of the business if they're consolidated away?"

I think all of our manufacturing partners are important to us. We work really, really hard to make sure, no matter what size you are, whether you're in medical or in pharma, that you're seen as important. I think it's one of the things that Red Oak has done a good job of also, is working hard to treat every manufacturer like an equal partner. But as you think about the pricing, sure, I think most suppliers were always going to say that their fees are too high. But we are very, very disciplined about how we charge our fees. And we look at things like line extensions, whether they're controlled drugs, whether they're refrigerated drugs. All those different costs that we incur that they would have to incur that if they were to go direct, we look at those to understand what we should charge as a fee. And so we work incredibly hard to make sure that we don't charge fees to manufacturers that would be more expensive than them going around us. And so I feel really confident, with our model and our pricing, that we are the most efficient way of getting products through the supply channel. I don't see any country that's more efficient or any supply chain that's more efficient than the United States. And I think the other piece is, I can't even remember the last time there's been any significant supply chain integrity issue in the U.S. And so that's -- that, to me, is incredibly important."

I do think that, as Mike described, all of our customers are influenced by the reimbursement dynamics, how they are compensated, and that can come either from the private sector or the public sector. I think what can be worrisome to them is when there is lags between how they get compensated and reimbursement or how they're -- not just time lags, but lags in general, between what their costs look like and what their reimbursement looks like. So we just try to stay very close to it. It can vary by product, and it can vary by different classes of drugs. But I do think it's an environment which has, as you guys have all said, a lot of attention on this. We try to stay very close to it.

As far as the sequential drop, remember, last quarter, we did mention that there was about $0.11 in that quarter that we said were kind of like onetimers, part of it being those generic items that were operating a little bit differently than we anticipated. And then also, we had the acceleration of some of the benefits of our M&A in the quarter. That was a little bit better than we thought.

From a moving-part standpoint, I would tell you that the 2 things that we said would moderate this, as you -- as we talked about a couple of times, was generic inflation. And as I've mentioned, it's moderated a little bit more than we had modeled. We expect generic launches for this year to be slightly less than this past year. But in terms of overall, our ability to source products is doing better, our ability to penetrate existing and new customers is going very well. Our use of data and analytics and how we price our products is going really well. So when you wrap it all together, I still feel like our overall generics program is performing about as we expected, but there -- it's just coming in a little bit differently. Other than that, I really can't split it down more. It's actually -- even if I wanted to, it's incredibly difficult because they're all so interrelated on how we work with customers. It's very difficult to split it apart."

And so I think there are many customers in the system that actually have done, for years, a blend of buying generics, some directly, some through distribution partners. And so even small swings in those percentages can be beneficial to us. We think our value proposition is very strong, as Mike said, and getting increasingly strong, so we're hoping that we can continue to attract those customers."

And then the other thing to remember is that we've employed a lot of -- a host of hedging strategies. We've renegotiated our contracts over the last several years with manufacturers, as well as if you look at the overall supply line and our commitment to inventory, it takes about 6 months before any type of changes in commodities will have an impact on us. And then the last bucket is that we have a lot of different commodities, and not all move with oil. And so we're -- probably 5 to 10 years ago, oil was a much better proxy for how our commodities would go. It's very different today when you look at our mix of commodities that we buy.

And we really want to focus on how can we be the best possible partner for our generic partners, and trying to manage inventory more from a supply standpoint versus a pricing standpoint was the way that we felt that it would go. It was better for the manufacturers, and we thought, over the long run, it would improve our relationships and, hopefully, make them stickier, as well as lead to a better everyday low price for us. And so we did that. And that philosophy was also shared by CVS when we formed Red Oak, is that our focus is -- at Red Oak is how can we be the absolute best partner to our manufacturers. Obviously, we want to get a great price, but we want to be transparent, we want to be easy to do business with, we want them to want to come do business with us, and one of the ways is helping smooth out fluctuations in the supply chain, which is something that we've done for a while that, I think, maybe has made us a little different from an exposure standpoint to the declines in pricing."

We reported a strong quarter this morning, wrapping up an excellent first half to our fiscal 2016. Our second quarter revenues increased 23% to $31.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 14% to $726 million. And we reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 8% over the prior year. 
Our organization continues to demonstrate the discipline necessary to compete in a very dynamic environment and the capacity and readiness to take the actions to position us to sustain growth over the long term.
We are confident about our position and our ability to create value for health systems experiencing change. And we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $5.15 to $5.35. This range represents an 18% to 22% growth rate over our fiscal 2015.
Most of our reporting segments demonstrated strong operating performance in the second quarter. Specifically, the Pharmaceutical segment reported significant profit growth and the Medical segment showed strong underlying performance, largely masked by the Cordis-related inventory fair value step-up. Adjusting for this, both segments reported robust revenues and double-digit growth in segment profit.
Turning to our segments. 
Our Pharmaceutical segment continued its momentum with a very strong second quarter. Revenue for the Pharma segment increased 25% to $28.3 billion and segment profit increased 16% to $627 million. 
Over the past few years, we have referred a number of times to the importance of having deep expertise in 2 specific areas in our Pharmaceutical business: in our drugs, which represent the vast majority of prescriptions filled in the U.S.; and specialty pharmaceuticals, which account for many new launches and a significant number of development projects in the pipeline of the pharmaceutical industry. As you know, these products tend to require very distinct capabilities. We continue to show excellent progress in both of these areas.
As it relates to generics, we continued to grow our base of customers, spanning independent pharmacies, chain, mail order, institutional and hospital pharmacies. Our generics program is designed to meet the needs of our pharmacy customers who recognize that generic drugs are extremely important to support their patients. And our program has strengthened through the purchasing capacity of Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health. 
While our generics program is an important offering for all of our customers and for us, it is also the broad and deep range of services that we provide to these customers which enable pharmacists to provide clinical support, both to their patients and to the physicians with whom these pharmacists will increasingly be coordinating.
As more precision medicine emerges from the pipelines of the pharmaceutical industry, our Specialty Solutions group builds the linkages between biopharmaceutical manufacturers and physicians, and it helps manage the complexity in delivering this important care to patients. Our Specialty Solutions business continues its steep growth trajectory, growing both in our base of provider customers we serve and in the tools that make us an outstanding partner to biopharmaceutical companies. We are confident that our Specialty Solutions sales will exceed $8 billion for our fiscal 2016.
Our Medical segment continues its repositioning, and it's adding value through reinvigorated distribution businesses, new product lines and services as well as new channels inside and outside of the U.S. Revenue for the Medical segment was up 9% to $3.2 billion. Segment profit declined 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. If you remember, this is the first quarter that includes the impact from the Cordis-related inventory step-up. Excluding that impact, Medical segment profit growth was 10% versus the prior year. Mike will provide more color in his commentary.
The work that we're doing in consumables, physician preference items, medical supplies to the home, our service offerings and discharge management, all align with the trend towards value-based payment models. Related to this is our ability to bring our increasingly complex customers the full Cardinal Health portfolio across both our Medical and Pharmaceutical segments that will help as new payment and delivery models begin to emerge.
Our business in China continues to grow at double-digit rates. Of course, China has been a subject of considerable economic news over these past months. And while the economic slowdown has significant impact for many industrials, the impact in the services sector has been more muted. Health care, specifically, continues to be a national priority. China's policy reforms, aging population, public health issues and expanding middle-class have created increased opportunities for scale health care solutions, and we expect the health care market in China to continue to grow.
Finally, a few words on Cordis. 
As you know, we closed this acquisition of Cordis on October 2, 2015. This is not a simple integration process, and our teams are doing an outstanding job managing all the many moving parts [indiscernible] and is on target.
Of greater significance, on day 1, we were ready to serve customers and their patients seamlessly in markets across the globe. Our new Cordis leadership team is off to a strong start, and this reinforces our optimism that Cordis will serve as a platform for growth. As the health care market introduces fee-for-value models, our physician-preference-item strategy is designed to help our customers meet this challenge.
Our offering of products, combined with business model innovation that includes services and analytics, creates real value for our customers. Cost effective, meaningful and measurable solutions: This is at the heart of our value proposition.
We closed out the first half of fiscal 2016 with strong results and well positioned for long-term growth. Ours is an organization that internalizes its mission. And seeing our people work to serve our customers through the extreme weather at the last few weeks is a reminder of their deep commitment, not only to our customers, but also to their patients, and I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their work. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

As George mentioned, we had a strong quarter. And halfway through our fiscal 2016, we're off to a good start. We feel comfortable reaffirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance range. In my remarks, I first want to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail, and then I'll end with some additional color on our expectations for the full year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.
Second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.30, growth of 8% versus the prior year. 
Starting with consolidated company results. Revenues were $31.4 billion, growth of 23%. Based on what we've seen through the first half of the year, we are updating our full year revenue assumption from mid-teens to mid to high teens percentage growth versus the prior year.
Total company non-GAAP gross margin dollars were up 13%. Consolidated company SG&A increased by 13% versus the prior year, with the vast majority due to acquisitions. We remain focused on disciplined management of our core SG&A to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $726 million, an increase of 14% versus the prior year. 
Below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $43 million for the quarter. This is an increase versus the prior year, primarily due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and the Harvard Drug Group.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 37%. While this is 3 percentage points higher than the prior year, it is common for the rate to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For the full fiscal year, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35.5% and 37%.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were nearly 332 million shares, slightly fewer shares versus the second quarter last year. We did not repurchase shares in the quarter and had about $700 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. As I said in the past, we will continue to evaluate share repurchases opportunistically in the context of our overall capital deployment strategy.
In the quarter, operations generated cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion. As a reminder, quarterly operating cash flows can be affected by timing. It's more representative to look at operating cash flow over a longer period, such as the first half of our fiscal year. Operating cash flow for the 6-month period was $1.4 billion.
At the end of the second quarter, we had a cash balance of $2.3 billion, with $394 million held internationally. 
Overall, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet.
I'll now review segment performance, starting with the Pharmaceutical segment. 
In the second quarter, the Pharma segment increased revenues by 25% to $28.3 billion. This was a result of continued growth in our existing and new customer relationships and, to a lesser degree, the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. 
Segment profit increased 16% to $627 million, driven by growth from existing and new customer relationships, which includes strong performance from our generics program. The acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical also contributed to segment profit growth in the quarter.
Segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 17 basis points versus the prior year. As we previously mentioned, our new relationship with a large mail-order customer, while positive from an earnings and capital standpoint, was dilutive to margin rates.
Our integration of Harvard Drug continues to go well. And while still early, we are on track to achieve our accretion targets of greater than $0.15 in this fiscal year and greater than $0.20 for fiscal '17. 
Our Specialty business had strong double-digit growth, which includes the contribution from the acquisition of Metro Medical, which is also going well.
Of late, many of you have been asking us about branded and generic manufacturer pricing. I'll share our current view, which is consistent with what we recently communicated at a mid-January webcasted event. We continue to model that branded manufacturer price increases will generally be similar to historical levels. This would be in line with our FY '16 assumptions.
As it relates to generic pricing, over the last 18 months, our commentary and assumptions have been that generic inflation would moderate. In our fiscal '15, that moderation was about as we expected. When we provided assumptions for our fiscal 16, we communicated that we expected further moderation. In fact, we are seeing moderation in generic pricing, although as we recently shared, it is somewhat steeper than we had originally modeled. That being said, generic manufacturer pricing is only one piece of our overall generics program, which, in total, we still see as meeting our expectations.
Our solid work in sourcing, attracting new customers, penetrating existing customers, utilizing data and analytics as well as executing on new item launches, has been key in our overall success. I continue to be excited about our overall generics program and the different components we have created to ensure long-term sustainability.
Overall, this was another solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment, and while there are always puts and takes, the quarter was largely in line with our assumptions.
Now let's go to the Medical segment performance. Second quarter revenues grew 9% to $3.2 billion, driven by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Our at-home business, which grew double digits, also contributed to top line growth for the segment. Segment profit decreased 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. As a reminder, this was the first quarter that included the acquisition of Cordis and the related impact of the inventory fair value step-up. Excluding the step-up of $21 million, the Medical segment profit grew 10%.
The total step-up came in at about $0.08, which is lower than the $0.13 to $0.15 of EPS impact we had anticipated. We expensed $0.04 in Q2, and we will do the same in Q3. There will be no inventory fair value step-up to recognize in Q4.
In this quarter, the favorability of the step-up as compared to our original guidance was offset by some onetime items resulting from the execution of the transaction as well as FX. Looking to Q3, we expect the step-up favorability and FX to be a wash. 
Setting those nonoperating pieces aside, as George mentioned, Cordis is off to a good start, with all key personnel in place and day-to-day operations up and running. 
As we integrate the Cordis business through the remainder of our fiscal year, we continue to be excited and will work to drive efficiencies. As we previously shared, in FY '17, we still expect the transaction to be greater than $0.20 accretive and increasingly accretive thereafter. We are also working towards achieving the $100 million of annual synergies as we exit our fiscal 2018.
Switching to other pieces of our Medical business. As expected, from an operational standpoint, our Canadian business has stabilized, though foreign currency created a bit of a headwind. The team there continues to work diligently to ensure we position our business for the future. Our Cardinal Health brand products continued to grow over and above the incremental increase from Cordis. Notably, we saw this growth in our strategic accounts, which are those customers that we have identified as key partners in the continually evolving health care landscape.
Turning to Slide #6, you will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. 
The $0.32 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs as well as a $39 million LIFO-related charge. 
With the first half behind us, there are 2 variables I'd note that probably have the most impact on us achieving the very high end of our guidance range for the full year: The first is generic manufacturing pricing levels and the second is the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates related to our specific businesses. These items moving in our favor would push us towards the achievement of the very top end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.35 that we reaffirmed this morning. As a reminder, this is a growth of 18% to 22% to the prior year.
While there are a few moving parts, our overall breadth and presence across the continuum of care provides us with the confidence to deliver on our commitments. I believe we have positioned ourselves well in the first half. We continue to be focused on our customers and have the talent to drive results and execute against our strategic priorities.

But the 2 things that we think that would need to go back to more similar to the first half would be FX and generic pricing.

And as you know that by definition, an aspiration means it's something you think you can achieve, but it's hard to reach and something that you've got to execute and get a lot of things done to do, and we're not backing away from that aspiration. But it's not only growing the Cordis products, it's the other Cardinal Health brand, it's growing the at-home business, which also had a nice revenue growth this quarter.

Obviously, George, I won't be able to get into lots of detail, but I'll give you a little bit information to see if I can be helpful. First of all, we can make money in both an inflationary environment on generics or a deflationary environment. History -- historically, generics has been a deflationary environment, and we've been able to make money in that. And so I look at it as 2 ways. Think about it this way: When generics are going up in price, you do make some inventory revaluation income. Some people call that buy-side margins. And so in a deflating market, you don't make the upside on the inventory inflation, but you're protected from any inventory exposure. You get floor stock adjusted. So you basically, in an inflating environment, make the money on -- the extra bucket of money on the inventory inflation. But in both environments, you are able to reprice to the customer and be able to adjust your pricing in order to work on your margins. But I think one of the keys you have to remember, whether you're in an inflationary or a deflationary environment, every single day, our goal is to keep our customers competitive. And our pricing is often -- it's not often, is based on what we need to do to be able to sell the products and keep our customers competitive as they look at things like reimbursement that impact them every single day. And so that's really important to us. And there's a lot more levers than just generic pricing. As I mentioned before, our ability to launch drugs effectively, penetrate current customers and existing customers, Red Oak has clearly been a driver of our ability there. There's just a lot of pieces that go together, and it's hard to disconnect any one of those and try to quantify those when it's all blended together."

But how should we think about how important those fees from the smaller and midsized branded guys are? And kind of what's the risk to that segment of the business if they're consolidated away?"

We work really, really hard to make sure, no matter what size you are, whether you're in medical or in pharma, that you're seen as important. I think it's one of the things that Red Oak has done a good job of also, is working hard to treat every manufacturer like an equal partner. But as you think about the pricing, sure, I think most suppliers were always going to say that their fees are too high. But we are very, very disciplined about how we charge our fees. And we look at things like line extensions, whether they're controlled drugs, whether they're refrigerated drugs. All those different costs that we incur that they would have to incur that if they were to go direct, we look at those to understand what we should charge as a fee. And so we work incredibly hard to make sure that we don't charge fees to manufacturers that would be more expensive than them going around us. And so I feel really confident, with our model and our pricing, that we are the most efficient way of getting products through the supply channel. I don't see any country that's more efficient or any supply chain that's more efficient than the United States. And I think the other piece is, I can't even remember the last time there's been any significant supply chain integrity issue in the U.S. And so that's -- that, to me, is incredibly important."

I do think that, as Mike described, all of our customers are influenced by the reimbursement dynamics, how they are compensated, and that can come either from the private sector or the public sector. I think what can be worrisome to them is when there is lags between how they get compensated and reimbursement or how they're -- not just time lags, but lags in general, between what their costs look like and what their reimbursement looks like. So we just try to stay very close to it. It can vary by product, and it can vary by different classes of drugs. But I do think it's an environment which has, as you guys have all said, a lot of attention on this. We try to stay very close to it.

As far as the sequential drop, remember, last quarter, we did mention that there was about $0.11 in that quarter that we said were kind of like onetimers, part of it being those generic items that were operating a little bit differently than we anticipated. And then also, we had the acceleration of some of the benefits of our M&A in the quarter. That was a little bit better than we thought.

And so I think there are many customers in the system that actually have done, for years, a blend of buying generics, some directly, some through distribution partners. And so even small swings in those percentages can be beneficial to us. We think our value proposition is very strong, as Mike said, and getting increasingly strong, so we're hoping that we can continue to attract those customers."

And then the other thing to remember is that we've employed a lot of -- a host of hedging strategies. We've renegotiated our contracts over the last several years with manufacturers as well as if you look at the overall supply line and our commitment to inventory, it takes about 6 months before any type of changes in commodities will have an impact on us. And then the last bucket is that we have a lot of different commodities, and not all move with oil. And so we're -- probably 5 to 10 years ago, oil was a much better proxy for how our commodities would go. It's very different today when you look at our mix of commodities that we buy.

And we really want to focus on how can we be the best possible partner for our generic partners, and trying to manage inventory more from a supply standpoint versus a pricing standpoint was the way that we felt that it would go. It was better for the manufacturers, and we thought, over the long run, it would improve our relationships and, hopefully, make them stickier as well as lead to a better everyday low price for us. And so we did that. And that philosophy was also shared by CVS when we formed Red Oak, is that our focus is -- at Red Oak is how can we be the absolute best partner to our manufacturers. Obviously, we want to get a great price, but we want to be transparent, we want to be easy to do business with, we want them to want to come do business with us, and one of the ways is helping smooth out fluctuations in the supply chain, which is something that we've done for a while that, I think, maybe has made us a little different from an exposure standpoint to the declines in pricing."

We had a very strong and balanced third quarter. So let me get right to the numbers. 
First, revenue for the period was up 21% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 20% versus the prior year, and non-GAAP operating earnings of $788 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 20% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.43. And as we move into our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range to $517 million to $527 million. The midpoint of this range would imply a growth rate of 12% for Q4 and a growth rate of 19% for the full year.
I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will go into the financials in a moment, but let me first provide you with more context on our business lines.
Both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments had a strong third quarter, reporting double-digit revenue and profit growth versus the prior year. 
Starting with the results from our Pharmaceutical segment. 
First, revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 22% to $27.5 billion and segment profit increased to 16% to $660 million. Overall, we saw a solid performance across the segment, with significant contributions from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty. 
Second, our Pharmaceutical Distribution business performed extremely well in the period. We continued to quickly respond to our customers needs and strengthen our relationships through our value-added service offerings, and as a result, have outpaced the market in all sciences of trade. Our team has moved decisively with the integration of Harvard Drug, and we are on track to deliver our financial targets for this transaction.
As you know, generic pharmaceuticals play an important role in our pharmaceutical offering and will continue to play an important role in the overall health care system. I'd like to take a few moments to share my thoughts on the environment around generics in the U.S. 
As demographic is driving demand and breakthrough science opening the door to new treatments, and in some cases, cures for our most dangerous, costly and complex diseases, generic drugs are a key component to our systems ability to contain costs through competition and provided needed headspace to help fund pharmaceutical innovation.
We do see some dynamics in the current generics environment, which I'd like to highlight, and which have some financial implications for the near term. 
First, demand is up. We all know the pressure that aging baby boomers are putting on the health care system, and that pressure will continue to drive volume and growth for years to come.
Second, the cycle of patent explorations is never a straight line. It has peaks and valleys with launch and lifecycle of end market brand drugs. Right now, we are in a period of relatively fewer generic launches. This has been true in recent quarters, and we would expect this pattern to continue until our FY '17, with the value from new launches being down from FY '16. As you know, this can change based on patent cases. And we'll provide you with more clarity around our launch expectations for next year when we finished our FY '16 and guide for FY '17.
Third, the flow of NDA approvals coming out of the FDA has significantly increased. The average number of yearly NDA approvals in the period between 2012 and 2015 was 155 per year. The number of NDAs approved just in the 6-month period between November of 2015 and March of 2016 was 279. The FDA is clearly working through its backlog. Combining this with the heightened election cycle this discourse around the cost and value pharmaceuticals, we might expect that across the portfolio, in the aggregate, we would see a relatively flat to slightly down generic manufacturing inflation rate in the near future.
Finally, this has been a year in which strategic moves among numerous players in the retail and the non-retail sectors has shifted many long-standing generic affiliations. This has naturally caused some competitive realignment, which we'd expect to settle out at the coming months unfold.
Given all of these factors, we anticipate that the contribution from generics will be more muted in the near term. That is a challenge, but we are well-positioned, well prepared. And we'll be working closely with our customers and drawing in the capabilities of their sourcing through Red Oak.
Turning to our specialty solutions group. 
We continue our track record of delivering very strong double-digit growth. We serve and support our provider customers across a broad range of therapeutic areas, and were expanding our services to support biopharmaceutical companies. This positioning is extremely important as innovative new pharmaceuticals emergers from biopharma pipeline.
Finally, on the Pharmaceutical segment. We are beginning to see an uptick in product volumes in our nuclear business. We are delivering and driving efficiencies in the nuclear diagnostics space, and at the same time, are looking forward to participating in the manufacture and distribution of new therapeutic Red Oak biopharmaceuticals. 
Overall, a very solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment.
Turning to our Medical segment. 
Our Medical segment put us some strong numbers in the period. We continue to deliver the tools, services and technologies that set thousands of care providers depend on everyday. As a result, third quarter revenue was up 13% versus the prior year to $3.1 billion. And segment profit increased 26% to $128 million. As a reminder, this quarter included the negative impact of the Cordis-related fair value step up, which Mike will cover. 
Our year-over-year growth for the quarter was not only a result of strategic acquisitions, which did contribute nicely, but also the result of some very positive contribution from existing lines of business, which continued to get stronger. We continued to see growth in the number of accounts we serve and in the range of product lines they purchase from us.
In the period, we saw a growth in Cardinal Health consumables. services to hospitals and health system, surgical kit, lab products and Cardinal Health at home. Don and his team are driving strong performance, and we are very excited to see this kind of growth. And importantly, our strategic positioning in the market has been doubly[ph] crafted and is being effectively executed.
For example, we have identified the activities and process of discharge into the post acute arena as an important area of dysfunction in the overall health care system. We have taken some important steps, including the acquisitions of naviHealth and, which strengthened our ability in play an important role in helping our customers navigate this critical stage. These capabilities are particularly relevant as we see the emergence of more value-based payment lines.
Finally, on Medical. The integration of Cordis remains on track. Under the leadership of Cordis President, David Wilson, we have trained and merged our Cordis and closure U.S. teams. We have finalized our worldwide leadership teams, appointing a new President in Japan and a new operations leader for our Cordis headquarters into Switzerland. We are bringing the best of Cordis and Cardinal Health together, and care providers, patients and investors will see real benefits.
We do have some important work in front of us though. Of course, we want to make sure that what we call the Day 2[ph] countries are closed and integrated. We've seen some encouraging growth in the EU and we'd like to see a similar pattern in our Asian markets. And we think there's significant opportunity to expand the Cordis product portfolio.
Let me close with an important point. 
At a time when powerful forces are reshaping the health care landscape, Cardinal Health is not just prepared to respond, but placed to lead. We worked hard to create a balanced portfolio of products and services that deliver real solutions that address our customers most pressing challenges. We deliver value across the lines of traditional customer grouping to market and from a fully integrated Cardinal Health portfolio. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

In my comments, I'll first provide some context around our third quarter performance. Then I'll give some additional color on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.
Starting with consolidated company results. 
Third quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.43, a 20% growth versus the prior year. This was due to solid performance in both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, which I'll discuss in detail later.
Total company revenues grew 21% versus the prior year to $30.7 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin dollars grew 17%. 
Consolidated company SG&A increased by 14% versus the prior year, almost entirely due to acquisitions. Our core SG&A continues to be an area of focus, with a disciplined approach to ensure that we maintain a lien, efficient organization. 
Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $788 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year.
Moving below the operating line. 
Net interest and other expense was $44 million. Again, this quarter, the increase versus the prior year is due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and the Harvard Drug Group.
The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 36.6%, flat to the rate in the prior-year quarter.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 331 million, 3 million shares lower than the third quarter in the prior year. During the quarter, we repurchased $300 million worth of shares, and as of the end of the quarter, had slightly under $400 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program.
Cash flow from operations was nearly $920 million. And at the end of the third quarter, we have $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
Our strong cash flow is the result of our robust earnings growth, as well as our efficient management of working capital by our teams. As always, we remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment.
Moving on to segment performance, let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment. 
Revenues grew 22% to $27.5 billion due to continued growth from new and existing customers, as well as the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. 
Segment profit was $668 million, an increase of 16% versus the prior year. There were 2 primary drivers of our profit growth in the quarter. The first is the acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical, which are integrating well and meeting our financial targets. The second is the continued growth in pharmaceutical distribution of new and existing customers, which includes our generics program. Also, while not the primary drivers in the quarter, both specialty and nuclear were contributors, with specialty continuing its double-digit growth and is on track to deliver at least $8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2016.
Pharma segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 11 basis points versus the prior year. This is a mixed dynamic due to the new relationship with a large mail order customer, which began in our second quarter. As a reminder, while the new contract has a dilutive affect to margin rate, it is positive from an earnings and capital standpoint.
In our Medical segment, we saw the same sort of uplift across the breadth of our businesses. Revenues grew 13% to $3.1 billion, driven by contribution from acquisitions net of divestitures, as well as growth from all of our existing businesses.
Medical segment profit grew 26% to $128 million. This was driven by the net contributions from acquisitions, as well as Cardinal Health brand products. As you may recall, this quarter, like Q2, includes the Cordis inventory fair value step-up, which was $21 million in each quarter.
Let me give you a little more color on Cordis. 
First, the onboarding of Cordis continues to progress well. We have filled the key roles with excellent talent and are focused on execution. As I mentioned last quarter, the expected favorability of the lower inventory step-up was a wash with the foreign exchange impact that was greater than we had originally modeled. As we work through the transaction, there are a few mechanics, such as the timing of exiting our transition service agreements with J&J, the closing of Day 2 countries and the ramping up and down of certain expenses, that could result in variability between quarters. As you can imagine, all of these moving parts can lead to Cordis results that may not be linear for a few more quarters. Specifically, some of these caused margin rates to be somewhat elevated in the third quarter versus how they may look over the next few quarters. If anything significant occurs, we will let you know, but again, overall, Cordis is performing well.
Organic growth of our Cardinal Health brand products was the primary driver of a 42 basis points increase in the Q3 Medical segment profit rates to just over 4%. Our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio includes private label consumables and physician preference items. These lines of business are important value drivers for our customers and are key to margin expansion.
Of particular note, this offering is resonating with our customers. In the quarter, Cardinal Health brand product growth was in the low double digits within our strategic accounts. Additionally, the value of the breadth of our offering is also gaining traction, as our strategic accounts once again grew well above the market this quarter.
Before I move to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, let me touch briefly on China, which reports in both segments. In spite of well-documented macroeconomic conditions, our businesses in China continue to perform well, with strong double-digit top and bottom line growth for the quarter.
Turning to Slide #6, you will see our consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation for the quarter. 
The $0.26 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.
Now I'll update you on our thoughts for the remainder of fiscal '16. 
Based on our current assumptions, we've tightened our non-GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $5.17 to $5.27 or a growth of 18% to 20% versus the prior year. This range implies fourth quarter guidance of $1.07 to $1.17 non-GAAP earnings per share, a 12% growth at the midpoint.
Looking sequentially to Q4, 4 things essentially explain the variance from Q3. 
First, we typically see higher brand inflation activity in the third quarter, which comes down in the fourth quarter. We expect this fiscal year will be consistent with this historical trend. Second, as a result of the acquisition of Safeway by, we stopped servicing them as of April 1, which has an impact on our fourth quarter comparison. The final 2 are a higher tax rate and a handful of smaller corporate items.
For our full year fiscal year guidance, recall that in the prior quarter, I mentioned that foreign exchange and the generic pricing environment could impact us in reaching the very high end of our prior range. Neither turned in our favor. Foreign exchange hasn't moved much from our prior expectations. And as for generic drug pricing, we expect the environment to be similar to what we experienced towards the end of Q3, which was slightly deflationary.
Moving on to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll walk through the updated corporate assumptions that reflect what we expect as we close out fiscal 2016.
First, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 35.5% to the 36.5%. Next, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be between 330 million and 331 million shares. In addition, we have lowered our expected range for net interest and other expense to $185 million to $200 million. Also, we expect that our full year CapEx spend will be in the range of $450 million to $480 million. And finally, our updated assumption on acquisition-related intangible amortization will be about $348 million or $0.68 per share.
Now I want to take the opportunity to share a few preliminary thoughts on what we believe will be some of the key drivers in FY '17. We still have work to do on sizing each of these, so my thoughts will be more qualitative than quantitative. 
Starting with the Medical segment. We expect strong growth to be led by our Cardinal Health brand products, which will include Cordis. As a reminder, FY '17 will not have the negative impact from the inventory step-up. Also, we expect growth in our post-acute initiatives, which includes our Cardinal Health at Home business. As in past years, we would still expect repricing on national brand to be a headwind.
Moving to the Pharma segment. As we mentioned, the Safeway contract has expired and will be a factor until anniversary it in the Q3 of next year. Under our genetics program, we expect continued strong performance from Red Oak. As it relates to new item launches, due to the timing of our fiscal year and a shifting of a few product launches, we expect the contribution in FY '17 to be less than FY '16. Also, we are currently expecting generic inflation to be less in FY '17.
As I mentioned in our Q4 FY '15 call, we initiated a multi-year program to refresh our information systems in our Pharmaceutical segment. This investment is being made to support our significant customer growth and acquisitions. Per our plan, FY '17 expenses related to this program will be more than what we incur in FY '16. We have outstanding talent and metrics in place to ensure success.
Lastly, we expect to continue with our current momentum in the specialty business. 
As we complete our budgeting process this summer, we will finalize our FY '17 outlook and we'll provide additional clarity on our Q4 of fiscal '16 call in August.
Let me close by expressing my appreciation to our people who delivered a record quarter in Q3, who continue to do things necessary to position us on the right side of health care trends and who I know will work tirelessly and with discipline to achieve our goals, and of course, serve our customers and their patients.
Operator, let's go to the questions."

I guess I'll just go back a little bit to emphasize what I talked about and see if that's helpful. So I'm not sure if things changed a lot in the sense if you think about what typically often happens between Q3 and Q4 as it relates to the branded inflation piece, that is what we're seeing sequentially, both in Pharma and in Med, we see a stronger Q3 from price increase activity on branded products. So we're planning to see that again in our Q4, so that's #1. Second of all, the Safeway contract expired and we quit servicing the business on April 1, so we have a full quarter of the impact of Safeway. Those are the 2 biggest drivers sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And then we are expecting a higher tax rate in Q4, which will have impacts sequentially on it. And then also, there's just some corporate items, several smaller corporate items that we expect to happen in our fourth quarter. And then -- so that's kind of maybe helps a little bit for a chunk of it. And then the other piece, if you think back to our last quarter, what we were trying to help everybody understand is to get to that top end of our range, we really need to see OpEx rebound and generic inflation change, and neither one did. We didn't really much change at all in FX and so we're not seeing any pickup from that in the fourth quarter. And then generic inflation, in the fourth quarter, we're expecting it to be more like what we saw on the last part of Q3, which as you know, as we mentioned before, was declining in the back part of Q3."

So this is all sort of part of the dynamic that affects the overall pricing environment. So that's sort of what I was trying to capture, which is that this is not a single factor, but we're seeing a numbers of factors that naturally come together. As it relates to, I was really referring to some of the big moves that have occurred over the course of the year. You have CVS buying Target and Omni Care, you've got the move with Albertsons and Safeway, you've got Walgreens and . And so I think those kind of big have a tendency to create a little bit of sort of short-term disturbances and then they just sort of settle out. And I just wanted to highlight that but I think what we're describing here is more -- again, as Mike said, it is quite different than it was at the early part of the year of our fiscal '16 and that sort of what we're describing.

But clearly, you're absolutely right. The largest piece of that branded inflation component happens in Pharma distribution. And sequentially, Q4 is always a much smaller quarter than Q3. And then the Safeway piece is the other piece. So yes, on Pharma, that would be it. As far as Medical goes, yes, that's why I was trying to give you a little color, as we're bringing on Cordis with you, again, some of the things I mentioned, and we've got several different types of transaction service agreements that we have in place with J&J, each with different timing of when we roll off with those and how we can work through those. We have different Day 2 countries coming in on different timing. And then we have certain expenses where we're ramping up on new headcount and then also getting after the synergies and taking expenses out in other areas. So all of those things create some variability between quarters. And so, again, those quarter's results may not quite be as linear as you would expect them to be for a few more quarters until things kind of normalize for us."

You know that they have expressed publicly in the Congress that they are really working hard to dig out of the backlog.

There are certainly systems who are very much on top of some of these trends and pushing very hard to improve efficiencies through standardization. And there are others that are at a different stage. So it really varies across the country and across the systems. And I would also say, different programs have different sales cycles. So for example, on the consumables side, you're probably going to have a faster sales cycle than you have, for example, than on the physician preference item where you want it -- there requires a little bit more buy in in the system. So I think you have to look at those a little bit differently from the sort of commodity-type consumables to products that are more used in the traditional physician preference. So again, it varies a little bit by product type and it certainly varies a lot by system. Overall, directionally, as we've seen more bundled payment models, more payment for performance, shifting financing models, I would say this trend is well understood and most institutions are trying to push in that direction. It's probably a good news for us."

Let me start by saying, it doesn't really have a much impact on us very specifically, so that's important to note upfront. I think this is, again, an attempt, we'll see CMS try to continue to do things to contain cost, to push us towards a more value-based system. Directionally, we understand that. That's just very, very hard to do and they've got to be careful as they did as not to hurt providers who really are working hard to deliver care every day. And I think what they bumped into here was some very strong pushback in the provider world, so I do think we'll see an active CMS. We expect that. I think they will make proposals regularly. Some of those will come through and stick, and I think some the system will say, those are tough for us to adopt and they'll have adverse consequences, and this is probably one of the ones where the market pushed back and particularly positions and particularly painful for them.

I think some of these programs, we just have remember, are in their early phases. But there is, Charles, I think, no question that there is a push both from the public through Medicare, Medicaid and through private payers to try to encourage payment models that are not fee-for-service, so that has some kind of value-based program. The tools that we have in naviHealth are really interesting. And again, remember that these have been primarily directed through the naviHealth's history at helping hospitals a direct care post-acute. But I think that, that skill set of being able to look at how to identify different ways of creating payment models, how do you help the hospitals that are going to have to live in that world, how do you help them navigate this, I think what we have in naviHealth is enormously valuable. And I think it's actually for a relatively small business, it's generated a lot of discussion between us and our customers. But again, PPCI is early, CMII, looking at that private program, early days in all of these, but the direction I think is unambiguous. I think there is more push to move away, to the extent possible, from the fee-for-service. And I think the tools of naviHealth and the work that we do in, you know, touches 600 hospitals in their customer base and 8,000 post-acute providers, those kinds of tools I think are going to be increasingly valuable to us."

We had a very strong and balanced third quarter. So let me get right to the numbers.  First, revenue for the period was up 21% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 20% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating earnings of $788 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 20% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.43. And as we move into our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range to $517 million to $527 million. The midpoint of this range would imply a growth rate of 12% for Q4 and a growth rate of 19% for the full year.
I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will go into the financials in a moment, but let me first provide you with more context on our business lines.
Both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments had a strong third quarter, reporting double-digit revenue and profit growth versus the prior year. 
Starting with the results from our Pharmaceutical segment.  First, revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 22% to $27.5 billion, and segment profit increased to 16% to $660 million. Overall, we saw solid performance across the segment, with significant contributions from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty.
Second, our Pharmaceutical Distribution business performed extremely well in the period. We continued to quickly respond to our customers' needs and strengthen our relationships through our value-added service offerings and as a result, have outpaced the market in all sciences of trade. Our team has moved decisively with the integration of Harvard Drug, and we are on track to deliver our financial targets for this transaction.
As you know, generic pharmaceuticals play an important role in our pharmaceutical offering and will continue to play an important role in the overall health care system. I'd like to take a few moments to share my thoughts on the environment around generics in the U.S. 
With demographics driving demand and breakthrough science opening the door to new treatments and in some cases, cures for our most dangerous, costly and complex diseases, generic drugs are a key component to our systems ability to contain costs through competition and provided needed headspace to help fund the pharmaceutical innovation.
We do see some dynamics in the current generics environment, which I'd like to highlight, and which have some financial implications for the near term.
First, demand is up. We all know the pressure that aging baby boomers are putting on the health care system, and that pressure will continue to drive volume and growth for years to come.
Second, the cycle of patent explorations is never a straight line. It has peaks and valleys with launch and lifecycle of end market brand drugs. Right now, we are in a period of relatively fewer generic launches. This has been true in recent quarters, and we would expect this pattern to continue into our FY '17, with the value from new launches being down from FY '16. As you know, this can change based on patent cases, and we'll provide you with more clarity around our launch expectations for next year when we finished our FY '16 and guide for FY '17.
Third, the flow of new ANDA approvals coming out of the FDA has significantly increased. The average number of yearly ANDA approvals in the period between 2012 and 2015 was 155 per year. The number of ANDAs approved just in the 6-month period between November of 2015 and March of 2016 was 279. The FDA is clearly working through its backlog. Combining this with the heightened election cycle discourse around the cost and value of pharmaceuticals, we might expect that across the portfolio, in the aggregate, we would see a relatively flat to slightly down generic manufacturing inflation rate in the near future.
Finally, this has been a year in which strategic moves among numerous players in the retail and non-retail sectors has shifted many long-standing generic affiliations. This has naturally caused some competitive realignment, which we'd expect to settle out at the coming months unfold.
Given all of these factors, we anticipate that the contribution from generics would be more muted in the near term. That is a challenge, but we are well positioned, well prepared. And we'll be working closely with our customers and drawing in the capabilities of our sourcing through Red Oak.
Turning to our Specialty Solutions group. 
We continue our track record of delivering very strong double-digit growth. We serve and support our provider customers across a broad range of therapeutic areas, and we're expanding our services to support biopharmaceutical companies. This positioning is extremely important as a flow of new innovative pharmaceuticals emerges from biopharma pipeline.
Finally, on the Pharmaceutical segment, we are beginning to see an uptick in product volumes in our nuclear business. We are delivering and driving efficiencies in the nuclear diagnostic space and at the same time, are looking forward to participating in the manufacture and distribution of new therapeutic radio biopharmaceuticals.
Overall, a very solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment.
Turning to our Medical segment.  Our Medical segment put us some strong numbers in the period. We continue to deliver the tools, services and technologies that set thousands of care providers depend on every day. As a result, third quarter revenue was up 13% versus the prior year to $3.1 billion, and segment profit increased 26% to $128 million. As a reminder, this quarter included the negative impact of the Cordis-related fair value step-up, which Mike will cover.
Our year-over-year growth for the quarter was not only a result of strategic acquisitions, which did contribute nicely, but also the result of some very positive contribution from existing lines of business, which continued to get stronger. We continue to see growth in the number of accounts we serve and in the range of product lines they purchase from us.
In the period, we saw a growth in Cardinal Health consumables. services to hospitals and health system, surgical kits, lab products and Cardinal Health at Home. Don and his team are driving strong performance, and we are very excited to see this kind of growth. And importantly, our strategic positioning in the market has been doubly [ph] crafted and is being effectively executed.
For example, we've identified the activities and process of discharge into the post acute arena as an important area of dysfunction in the overall health care system. We have taken some important steps, including the acquisitions of naviHealth and Curaspan, which strengthen our ability to play an important role in helping our customers navigate this critical stage. These capabilities are particularly relevant as we see the emergence of more value-based payment models.
Finally, on Medical. The integration of Cordis remains on track. Under the leadership of Cordis President, David Wilson, we have trained and merged our Cordis and AccessClosure U.S. commercial teams. We have finalized our worldwide leadership teams, appointing a new President in Japan and a new operations leader for our Cordis headquarters in Zug, Switzerland. We are bringing the best of Cordis and Cardinal Health together, and care providers, patients and investors will see real benefits.
We do have some important work in front of us though. Of course, we want to make sure that what we call as a Day 2 Countries are closed and integrated. We've seen some encouraging growth in the EU, and we'd like to see a similar pattern in our Asian markets. And we think there's significant opportunity to expand the Cordis product portfolio.
Let me close with an important point.
At a time when powerful forces are reshaping the health care landscape, Cardinal Health is not just prepared to respond, but placed to lead. We worked hard to create a balanced portfolio of products and services that deliver real solutions that address our customers' most pressing challenges. We deliver value across the lines of traditional customer groupings in markets and from a fully integrated Cardinal Health portfolio.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

In my comments, I'll first provide some context around our third quarter performance. Then I'll give some additional color on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.
Starting with consolidated company results.  Third quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.43, a 20% growth versus the prior year. This was due to solid performance in both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, which I'll discuss in detail later.
Total company revenues grew 21% versus the prior year to $30.7 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin dollars grew 17%. 
Consolidated company SG&A increased by 14% versus the prior year, almost entirely due to acquisitions. Our core SG&A continues to be an area of focus, with a disciplined approach to ensure that we maintain a Lean, efficient organization. 
Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $788 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year.
Moving below the operating line.  Net interest and other expense was $44 million. Again, this quarter, the increase versus the prior year is due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and the Harvard Drug Group.
The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 36.6%, flat to the rate in the prior year quarter.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 331 million, 3 million shares lower than the third quarter in the prior year. During the quarter, we repurchased $300 million worth of shares and as of the end of the quarter, at slightly under $400 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
Cash flow from operations was nearly $920 million, and at the end of the third quarter, we had $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
Our strong cash flow is the result of our robust earnings growth as well as our efficient management of working capital by our teams. As always, we remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment.
Moving on to segment performance. Let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment.  Revenues grew 22% to $27.5 billion due to continued growth from new and existing customers as well as the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical.
Segment profit was $660 million, an increase of 16% versus the prior year. There were 2 primary drivers of our profit growth in the quarter. The first is the acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical, which are integrating well and meeting our financial targets. The second is the continued growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution of new and existing customers, which includes our generics program. Also, while not the primary drivers in the quarter, both specialty and nuclear were contributors, with specialty continuing its double-digit growth and is on track to deliver at least $8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2016.
Pharma segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 11 basis points versus the prior year. This is a mixed dynamic due to the new relationship with a large mail order customer, which began in our second quarter. As a reminder, while the new contract has a dilutive affect to margin rate, it is positive from an earnings and capital standpoint.
In our Medical segment, we saw the same sort of uplift across the breadth of our businesses. Revenues grew 13% to $3.1 billion, driven by contribution from acquisitions, net of divestitures, as well as growth from all of our existing businesses.
Medical segment profit grew 26% to $128 million. This was driven by the net contributions from acquisitions as well as Cardinal Health brand products. As you may recall, this quarter, like Q2, includes the Cordis inventory fair value step-up, which was $21 million in each quarter.
Let me give you a little more color on Cordis.  First, the onboarding of Cordis continues to progress well. We have filled the key roles with excellent talent and are focused on execution. As I mentioned last quarter, the expected favorability of the lower inventory step-up was a wash, with the foreign exchange impact that was greater than we had originally modeled. 
As we work through the transaction, there are a few mechanics, such as the timing of exiting our transition service agreements with J&J, the closing of Day 2 Countries and the ramping up and down of certain expenses, that could result in variability between quarters. As you can imagine, all of these moving parts can lead to Cordis results that may not be linear for a few more quarters. Specifically, some of these caused margin rates to be somewhat elevated in the third quarter versus how they may look over the next few quarters. If anything significant occurs, we will let you know, but again, overall, Cordis is performing well.
Organic growth of our Cardinal Health brand products was the primary driver of a 42 basis points increase in the Q3 Medical segment profit rates to just over 4%. Our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio includes private label consumables and physician preference items. These lines of business are important value drivers for our customers and are key to margin expansion.
Of particular note, this offering is resonating with our customers. In the quarter, Cardinal Health brand product growth was in the low double digits within our strategic accounts. Additionally, the value of the breadth of our offering is also gaining traction, as our strategic accounts once again grew well above the market this quarter.
Before I move to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, let me touch briefly on China, which reports in both segments. In spite of well-documented macroeconomic conditions, our businesses in China continue to perform well, with strong double-digit top and bottom line growth for the quarter.
Turning to Slide #6. You will see our consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation for the quarter. 
The $0.26 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.
Now I'll update you on our thoughts for the remainder of fiscal '16.  Based on our current assumptions, we've tightened our non-GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $5.17 to $5.27 or a growth of 18% to 20% versus the prior year. This range implies fourth quarter guidance of $1.07 to $1.17 non-GAAP earnings per share, a 12% growth at the midpoint.
Looking sequentially to Q4, 4 things essentially explain the variance from Q3.
First, we typically see higher brand inflation activity in the third quarter, which comes down in the fourth quarter. We expect this fiscal year will be consistent with this historical trend. Second, as a result of the acquisition of Safeway by Albertsons, we stopped servicing them as of April 1, which has an impact on our fourth quarter comparison. The final 2 are a higher tax rate and a handful of smaller corporate items.
For our full year fiscal year guidance, recall that in the prior quarter, I mentioned that foreign exchange and the generic pricing environment could impact us in reaching the very high end of our prior range. Neither turned in our favor. Foreign exchange hasn't moved much from our prior expectations. And as for generic drug pricing, we expect the environment to be similar to what we experienced towards the end of Q3, which was slightly deflationary.
Moving on to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll walk through the updated corporate assumptions that reflect what we expect as we close out fiscal 2016.
First, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 35.5% to 36.5%. Next, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be between 330 million and 331 million shares. In addition, we've lowered our expected range for net interest and other expense to $185 million to $200 million. Also we expect that our full year CapEx spend will be in the range of $450 million to $480 million. And finally, our updated assumption on acquisition-related intangible amortization will be about $348 million or $0.68 per share.
Now I want to take the opportunity to share a few preliminary thoughts on what we believe will be some of the key drivers in FY '17. We still have work to do on sizing each of these, so my thoughts will be more qualitative than quantitative.
Starting with the Medical segment. We expect strong growth to be led by our Cardinal Health brand products, which will include Cordis. As a reminder, FY '17 will not have the negative impact from the inventory step-up. Also, we expect growth in our post-acute initiatives, which includes our Cardinal Health at Home business. As in past years, we would still expect repricing on national brand to be a headwind.
Moving to the Pharma segment. As we mentioned, the Safeway contract has expired and will be a factor until we anniversary it in the Q3 of next year. Our -- under our genetics program, we expect continued strong performance from Red Oak. As it relates to new item launches, due to the timing of our fiscal year and a shifting of a few product launches, we expect the contribution in FY '17 to be less than FY '16. Also, we are currently expecting generic inflation to be less in FY '17.
As I mentioned in our Q4 FY '15 call, we initiated a multi-year program to refresh our information systems in our Pharmaceutical segment. This investment is being made to support our significant customer growth and acquisitions. Per our plan, FY '17 expenses related to this program will be more than what we incur in FY '16. We have outstanding talent and metrics in place to ensure success.
Lastly, we expect to continue with our current momentum in the specialty business. 
As we complete our budgeting process this summer, we will finalize our FY '17 outlook, and we'll provide additional clarity on our Q4 fiscal '16 call in August.
Let me close by expressing my appreciation to our people who delivered a record quarter in Q3, who continue to do things necessary to position us on the right side of health care trends and who I know will work tirelessly and with discipline to achieve our goals and of course, serve our customers and their patients.

I guess I'll just go back a little bit to emphasize what I talked about and see if that's helpful. So I'm not sure if things changed a lot in the sense if you think about what typically often happens between Q3 and Q4 as it relates to the branded inflation piece, that is what we're seeing sequentially, both in Pharma and in Med, we see a stronger Q3 from price increase activity on branded products. So we're planning to see that again in our Q4, so that's #1. Second of all, the Safeway contract expired, and we quit servicing the business on April 1. So we have a full quarter of the impact of Safeway. Those are the 2 biggest drivers sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And then we are expecting a higher tax rate in Q4, which will have impact sequentially on it, and then also, there's just some corporate items -- several smaller corporate items that we expect to happen in our fourth quarter. And then if -- so that's kind of maybe helps a little bit for a chunk of it. And then the other piece, if you think back to our last quarter, what we were trying to help everybody understand is to get to that top end of our range. We really need to see FX rebound and generic inflation change, and neither one did. We didn't see really much change at all in FX, and so we're not seeing any pickup from that in the fourth quarter. And then generic inflation, in the fourth quarter, we're expecting it to be more like what we saw on the last part of Q3, which as you know, as we mentioned before, was declining in the back part of Q3."

So this is all sort of part of the dynamic that affects the overall pricing environment. So that's sort of what I was trying to capture, which is that this is not a single factor, but we're seeing a numbers of factors that actually come together. As it relates to environment, I was really referring to some of the big moves that have occurred over the course of the year. You have CVS buying Target and Omnicare, you've got the move with Albertsons and Safeway, you've got Walgreens and Rite Aid.  And so I think those kinds of big moves have a tendency to create a little bit of sort of short-term disturbance and then they just sort of settle out.

So I think, increasingly, that discussion is occurring with our largest customers. They understand that complexity is increasing, and that those partners that can help them navigate that are probably more attractive as they go forward and I think that was sort of a differentiator for us.

As far as Medical goes, yes, that's why I was trying to give you a little color, as we're bringing on Cordis with you -- again, some of the things I mentioned, and we've got several different types of transition service agreements that we have in place with J&J, each with different timing of when we roll off those and how we can work through those.

Whether or not they're targeting specific drugs is really hard to say. I don't think we would have line of sight on that.

There are certainly systems who are very much on top of some of these trends and pushing very hard to improve efficiencies through standardization. And there are others that are just at a different stage. So it really varies across the country and across the systems. And I would also say, different programs have different sales cycles. So for example, on the consumables side, you're probably going to have a faster sales cycle than you have, for example, than as the physician preference item where you want -- there requires a little bit more buy in in the system. So I think you'd have to look at those a little bit differently from the sort of commodity-type consumables to products that are more used in the traditional physician preference. So again, it varies a little bit by product type, and it certainly varies a lot by system. Overall, directionally, as we've seen more bundled payment models, more payment for performance, shifting financing models, I would say this trend is well understood and most institutions are trying to push in that direction. It's probably good news for us."

As it relates to the Med B proposal, as you know, this was -- I got a lot of attention and got a lot of pushback. Let me start by saying, it doesn't really have a much impact on us very specifically. So that's important to note upfront. I think this is, again, an attempt. We'll see CMS try to continue to do things to contain cost, to push us towards a more value-based system. Directionally, we understand that. That's just very, very hard to do, and they've got to be careful if they do that not to hurt providers who really are working hard to deliver care every day. And I think what they bumped into here was some very strong pushback in the provider world. So I do think we'll see an active CMS. We expect that. I think they will make proposals regularly. Some of those will come through and stick, and I think some where the system will say, those are tough for us to adopt and they have adverse consequences. And this is probably one of those ones where the market pushed back and particularly positioned saying this was particularly painful for them.

And so I guess we -- hypothetically, the answer is yes, but we have to just recognize, we're in very early days on the biosimilars side, and I think a lot to play out still."

I think, in general, consolidation is a phenomenon that we've experienced over a lot of years. We're sort of used to it. I think the question that we think about when we look at those consolidated customers is not just, are they bigger, but they have new kinds of needs, the stick needs where we have tools that can support them. So I think the key for us as we think about these is not just whether or not we can be efficient in order to be price competitive.

I think some of these programs, we just have to remember, are in their early phases. But there is, Charles, I think, no question that there is a push both from the public through Medicare or Medicaid and through private payers to try to encourage payment models that are not fee-for-service, so that has some kind of value-based program. The tools that we have in naviHealth are really interesting. And again, remember that these have been primarily directed through the naviHealth's history at helping hospitals a direct care post-acute. But I think that, that skill set of being able to look at how to identify different ways of creating payment models, how do you help the hospitals that are going to have to live in that world, how do you help them navigate this, I think what we have in naviHealth is enormously valuable. And I think it's actually for a relatively small business, it's generated a lot of discussion between us and our customers. But again, BPCI is early, CMMI, looking at that program early days and all of these, but the direction, I think, is unambiguous. I think there is more push to move away, to the extent possible, from the fee-for-service. And I think the tools of naviHealth and the work that we do in Curaspan, which touches 600 hospitals in their customer base and 8,000 post-acute providers. Those kinds of tools, I think, are going to be increasingly valuable to us."

We had a very strong and balanced third quarter. So let me get right to the numbers.  First, revenue for the period was up 21% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 20% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating earnings of $788 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 20% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.43. And as we move into our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range to $517 million to $527 million. The midpoint of this range would imply a growth rate of 12% for Q4 and a growth rate of 19% for the full year.
I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will go into the financials in a moment, but let me first provide you with more context on our business lines.
Both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments had a strong third quarter, reporting double-digit revenue and profit growth versus the prior year. 
Starting with the results from our Pharmaceutical segment.  First, revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 22% to $27.5 billion, and segment profit increased 16% to $660 million. Overall, we saw solid performance across the segment, with significant contributions from Pharmaceutical Distribution and specialty.
Second, our Pharmaceutical Distribution business performed extremely well in the period. We continue to quickly respond to our customers' needs and strengthen our relationships through our value-added service offerings and as a result, have outpaced the market in all classes of trade. Our team has moved decisively with the integration of Harvard Drug, and we are on track to deliver our financial targets for this transaction.
As you know, generic pharmaceuticals play an important role in our pharmaceutical offering and will continue to play an important role in the overall health care system. I'd like to take a few moments to share my thoughts on the environment around generics in the U.S. 
With demographics driving demand and breakthrough science opening the door to new treatments and, in some cases, cures for our most dangerous, costly and complex diseases, generic drugs are a key component to our system's ability to contain costs through competition and provided needed headspace to help fund pharmaceutical innovation.
We do see some dynamics in the current generics environment, which I'd like to highlight, and which have some financial implications for the near term.
First, demand is up. We all know the pressure that aging baby boomers are putting on the health care system, and that pressure will continue to drive volume and growth for years to come.
Second, the cycle of patent expirations is never a straight line. It has peaks and valleys with launch and lifecycle of in-market brand drugs. Right now, we are in a period of relatively fewer generic launches. This has been true in recent quarters, and we would expect this pattern to continue into our FY '17, with the value from new launches being down from FY '16. As you know, this can change based on patent cases, and we'll provide you with more clarity around our launch expectations for next year when we finish our FY '16 and guide for FY '17.
Third, the flow of new ANDA approvals coming out of the FDA has significantly increased. The average number of yearly ANDA approvals in the period between 2012 and 2015 was 155 per year. The number of ANDAs approved just in the 6-month period between November of 2015 and March of 2016 was 279. The FDA is clearly working through its backlog. Combining this with the heightened election cycle discourse around the cost and value of pharmaceuticals, we might expect that across the portfolio, in the aggregate, we would see a relatively flat to slightly down generic manufacturing inflation rate in the near future.
Finally, this has been a year in which strategic moves among numerous players in the retail and non-retail sectors has shifted many long-standing generic affiliations. This has naturally caused some competitive realignment, which we'd expect to settle out as the coming months unfold.
Given all of these factors, we anticipate that the contribution from generics would be more muted in the near term. That is a challenge, but we are well positioned, well prepared, and we'll be working closely with our customers and drawing on the capabilities of our sourcing through Red Oak.
Turning to our Specialty Solutions group. 
We continue our track record of delivering very strong double-digit growth. We serve and support our provider customers across a broad range of therapeutic areas, and we're expanding our services to support biopharmaceutical companies. This positioning is extremely important as the flow of new innovative pharmaceuticals emerges from biopharma pipelines.
Finally, on the Pharmaceutical segment. We are beginning to see an uptick in product volumes in our nuclear business. We are delivering and driving efficiencies in the nuclear diagnostic space and at the same time, are looking forward to participating in the manufacture and distribution of new therapeutic radio biopharmaceuticals.
Overall, a very solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment.
Turning to our Medical segment.  Our Medical segment put up some strong numbers in the period. We continue to deliver the tools, services and technologies that set [ph] thousands of care providers depend on every day. As a result, third quarter revenue was up 13% versus the prior year to $3.1 billion, and segment profit increased 26% to $128 million. As a reminder, this quarter included the negative impact of the Cordis-related fair value step-up, which Mike will cover.
Our year-over-year growth for the quarter was not only a result of strategic acquisitions, which did contribute nicely, but also the result of some very positive contributions from existing lines of business, which continued to get stronger. We continue to see growth in the number of accounts we serve and in the range of product lines they purchase from us.
In the period, we saw growth in Cardinal Health consumables, services to hospitals and health systems, surgical kits, lab products and Cardinal Health at Home. Don and his team are driving strong performance, and we are very excited to see this kind of growth. And importantly, our strategic positioning in the market has been thoughtfully crafted and is being effectively executed.
For example, we've identified the activities and process of discharge into the post-acute arena as an important area of dysfunction in the overall health care system. We have taken some important steps, including the acquisitions of naviHealth and Curaspan, which strengthen our ability to play an important role in helping our customers navigate this critical stage. These capabilities are particularly relevant as we see the emergence of more value-based payment models.
Finally, on Medical. The integration of Cordis remains on track. Under the leadership of Cordis President, David Wilson, we have trained and merged our Cordis and AccessClosure U.S. commercial teams. We have finalized our worldwide leadership teams, appointing a new president in Japan and a new operations leader for our Cordis headquarters in Zug, Switzerland. We are bringing the best of Cordis and Cardinal Health together, and care providers, patients and investors will see real benefits.
We do have some important work in front of us though. Of course, we want to make sure that what we call the Day 2 [ph] countries are closed and integrated. We've seen some encouraging growth in the EU, and we'd like to see a similar pattern in our Asian markets. And we think there's significant opportunity to expand the Cordis product portfolio.
Let me close with an important point.
At a time when powerful forces are reshaping the health care landscape, Cardinal Health is not just prepared to respond, but poised to lead. We've worked hard to create a balanced portfolio of products and services that deliver real solutions that address our customers' most pressing challenges. We deliver value across the lines of traditional customer groupings and markets and from a fully integrated Cardinal Health portfolio.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

In my comments, I'll first provide some context around our third quarter performance. Then I'll give some additional color on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.
Starting with consolidated company results.  Third quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.43, a 20% growth versus the prior year. This was due to solid performance in both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, which I'll discuss in detail later.
Total company revenues grew 21% versus the prior year to $30.7 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin dollars grew 17%. 
Consolidated company SG&A increased by 14% versus the prior year, almost entirely due to acquisitions. Our core SG&A continues to be an area of focus, with a disciplined approach to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. 
Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $788 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year.
Moving below the operating line.  Net interest and other expense was $44 million. Again, this quarter, the increase versus the prior year is due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and the Harvard Drug Group.
The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 36.6%, flat to the rate in the prior year quarter.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 331 million, 3 million shares lower than the third quarter in the prior year. During the quarter, we repurchased $300 million worth of shares and as of the end of the quarter, had slightly under $400 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
Cash flow from operations was nearly $920 million, and at the end of the third quarter, we had $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
Our strong cash flow is the result of our robust earnings growth as well as our efficient management of working capital by our teams. As always, we remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment.
Moving on to segment performance. Let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment.  Revenues grew 22% to $27.5 billion due to continued growth from new and existing customers as well as the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical.
Segment profit was $660 million, an increase of 16% versus the prior year. There were 2 primary drivers of our profit growth in the quarter. The first is the acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical, which are integrating well and meeting our financial targets. The second is the continued growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution of new and existing customers, which includes our generics program. Also, while not the primary drivers in the quarter, both specialty and nuclear were contributors, with specialty continuing its double-digit growth and is on track to deliver at least $8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2016.
Pharma segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 11 basis points versus the prior year. This is a mix dynamic due to the new relationship with a large mail order customer, which began in our second quarter. As a reminder, while the new contract has a dilutive effect to margin rate, it is positive from an earnings and capital standpoint.
In our Medical segment, we saw the same sort of uplift across the breadth of our businesses. Revenues grew 13% to $3.1 billion, driven by contribution from acquisitions, net of divestitures, as well as growth from all of our existing businesses.
Medical segment profit grew 26% to $128 million. This was driven by the net contributions from acquisitions as well as Cardinal Health brand products. As you may recall, this quarter, like Q2, includes the Cordis inventory fair-value step-up, which was $21 million in each quarter.
Let me give you a little more color on Cordis.  First, the onboarding of Cordis continues to progress well. We have filled the key roles with excellent talent and are focused on execution. As I mentioned last quarter, the expected favorability of the lower inventory step-up was a wash with the foreign exchange impact that was greater than we had originally modeled. 
As we work through the transaction, there are a few mechanics, such as the timing of exiting our transition service agreements with J&J, the closing of Day 2 [ph] countries and the ramping up and down of certain expenses, that could result in variability between quarters. As you can imagine, all of these moving parts can lead to Cordis results that may not be linear for a few more quarters. Specifically, some of these caused margin rates to be somewhat elevated in the third quarter versus how they may look over the next few quarters. If anything significant occurs, we will let you know, but again, overall, Cordis is performing well.
Organic growth of our Cardinal Health brand products was the primary driver of a 42 basis points increase in the Q3 Medical segment profit rates to just over 4%. Our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio includes private-label consumables and physician preference items. These lines of business are important value drivers for our customers and are key to margin expansion.
Of particular note, this offering is resonating with our customers. In the quarter, Cardinal Health brand product growth was in the low double digits within our strategic accounts. Additionally, the value of the breadth of our offering is also gaining traction, as our strategic accounts once again grew well above the market this quarter.
Before I move to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, let me touch briefly on China, which reports in both segments. In spite of well-documented macroeconomic conditions, our businesses in China continue to perform well, with strong double-digit top and bottom line growth for the quarter.
Turning to Slide #6. You will see our consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation for the quarter. 
The $0.26 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.
Now I'll update you on our thoughts for the remainder of fiscal '16.  Based on our current assumptions, we've tightened our non-GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $5.17 to $5.27 or a growth of 18% to 20% versus the prior year. This range implies fourth quarter guidance of $1.07 to $1.17 non-GAAP earnings per share, a 12% growth at the midpoint.
Looking sequentially to Q4, 4 things essentially explain the variance from Q3.
First, we typically see higher brand inflation activity in the third quarter, which comes down in the fourth quarter. We expect this fiscal year will be consistent with this historical trend. Second, as a result of the acquisition of Safeway by Albertsons, we stopped servicing them as of April 1, which has an impact on our fourth quarter comparison. The final 2 are a higher tax rate and a handful of smaller corporate items.
For our full year fiscal year guidance, recall that in the prior quarter, I mentioned that foreign exchange and the generic pricing environment could impact us in reaching the very high end of our prior range. Neither turned in our favor. Foreign exchange hasn't moved much from our prior expectations. And as for generic drug pricing, we expect the environment to be similar to what we experienced towards the end of Q3, which was slightly deflationary.
Moving on to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll walk through the updated corporate assumptions that reflect what we expect as we close out fiscal 2016.
First, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 35.5% to 36.5%. Next, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be between 330 million and 331 million shares. In addition, we've lowered our expected range for net interest and other expense to $185 million to $200 million. Also we expect that our full year CapEx spend will be in the range of $450 million to $480 million. And finally, our updated assumption on acquisition-related intangible amortization will be about $348 million or $0.68 per share.
Now I want to take the opportunity to share a few preliminary thoughts on what we believe will be some of the key drivers in FY '17. We still have work to do on sizing each of these, so my thoughts will be more qualitative than quantitative.
Starting with the Medical segment. We expect strong growth to be led by our Cardinal Health brand products, which will include Cordis. As a reminder, FY '17 will not have the negative impact from the inventory step-up. Also, we expect growth in our post-acute initiatives, which includes our Cardinal Health at Home business. As in past years, we would still expect repricing on national brands to be a headwind.
Moving to the Pharma segment. As we mentioned, the Safeway contract has expired and will be a factor until we anniversary it in the Q3 of next year. Our -- under our generics program, we expect continued strong performance from Red Oak. As it relates to new item launches, due to the timing of our fiscal year and a shifting of a few product launches, we expect the contribution in FY '17 to be less than FY '16. Also, we are currently expecting generic inflation to be less in FY '17.
As I mentioned in our Q4 FY '15 call, we initiated a multi-year program to refresh our information systems in our Pharmaceutical segment. This investment is being made to support our significant customer growth and acquisitions. Per our plan, FY '17 expenses related to this program will be more than what we incur in FY '16. We have outstanding talent and metrics in place to ensure success.
Lastly, we expect to continue with our current momentum in the specialty business. 
As we complete our budgeting process this summer, we will finalize our FY '17 outlook, and we'll provide additional clarity on our Q4 fiscal '16 call in August.

But I guess I'm still trying to parse out what was incremental relative to what you had line of sight into previously. If I just look at the implied 4Q guidance you guys highlighted, having a hard time based off the trends in both segments seeing how growth will slow as much as you're implying. So I guess, really, just if you could go back to some of the buckets you highlighted. What kind of moved against you from where you were thinking about the year previously to how you're thinking about the fourth quarter now?"

I guess I'll just go back a little bit to emphasize what I talked about and see if that's helpful. So I'm not sure if things changed a lot in the sense if you think about what typically often happens between Q3 and Q4 as it relates to the branded inflation piece, that is what we're seeing sequentially. Both in Pharma and in Med, we see a stronger Q3 from price increase activity on branded products. So we're planning to see that again in our Q4, so that's #1. Second of all, the Safeway contract expired, and we quit servicing the business on April 1. So we have a full quarter of the impact of Safeway. Those are the 2 biggest drivers sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And then we are expecting a higher tax rate in Q4, which will have impact sequentially on it, and then also, there's just some corporate items -- several smaller corporate items that we expect to happen in our fourth quarter. And then if -- so that kind of maybe helps a little bit for a chunk of it. And then the other piece, if you think back to our last quarter, what we were trying to help everybody understand is to get to that top end of our range, we really needed to see FX rebound and generic inflation change, and neither one did. We didn't see really much change at all in FX, and so we're not seeing any pickup from that in the fourth quarter. And then generic inflation, in the fourth quarter, we're expecting it to be more like what we saw in the last part of Q3, which as you know, as we mentioned before, was declining in the back part of Q3."

George, let me start with the second part in a sense, because as I described in the call, there is sort of a number of factors at work here, including the launch cycle; the rate of approvals, which creates more products in the system; reimbursement dynamics, which our customers feel. So this is all sort of part of the dynamic that affects the overall pricing environment. So that's sort of what I was trying to capture, which is that this is really not a single factor, but we're seeing a numbers of factors that actually come together. As it relates to realignment, I was really referring to some of the big moves that have occurred over the course of the year. You have CVS buying Target and Omnicare, you've got the move with Albertsons and Safeway, you've got Walgreens and Rite Aid.  And so I think those kinds of big moves have a tendency to create a little bit of sort of short-term disturbance and then they just sort of settle out. And I just wanted to highlight that. But I think what we're describing here is more -- again, as Mike said, it is quite different than it was at the early part of the year of our fiscal '16, and that's sort of what we're describing.

I think, again, I don't want to speak -- it's not fair for me to speak for Kaiser, but I think the general dialogue was really about the future, about the evolution of their business, how they're going to have to serve a customer base that continues to be treated in different care settings and our ability to take care of that as well as the services and technologies that we may be able to bring to them that improve efficiencies in their operations. So I think, increasingly, that discussion is occurring with our largest customers. They understand that complexity is increasing and that those partners that can help them navigate that are probably more attractive as they go forward, and I think that was sort of a differentiator for us.

I could not comment on the status of any of those. It's not appropriate.

As we're bringing on Cordis with you -- again, some of the things I mentioned, and we've got several different types of transition service agreements that we have in place with J&J, each with different timing of when we roll off of those and how we can work through those.

Whether or not they're targeting specific drugs is really hard to say. I don't think we would have line of sight on that. You know that they've expressed publicly and to Congress that they are really working hard to dig out of the backlog.

There are certainly systems who are very much on top of some of these trends and pushing very hard to improve efficiencies through standardization. And there are others that are just at a different stage. So it really varies across the country and across the systems. And I would also say, different programs have different sales cycles. So for example, on the consumables side, you're probably going to have a faster sales cycle than you have, for example, than on the physician preference item where you want -- there requires a little bit more buy-in in the system. So I think you'd have to look at those a little bit differently from the sort of commodity-type consumables to products that are more used in the traditional physician preference area. So again, it varies a little bit by product type, and it certainly varies a lot by system. Overall, directionally, as we've seen more bundled payment models, more payment for performance, shifting financing models, I would say this trend is well understood and most institutions are trying to push in that direction. It's probably good news for us."

As it relates to the Med B proposal, as you know, this was -- it got a lot of attention and got a lot of pushback. Let me start by saying, it doesn't really have much impact on us very specifically. So that's important to note upfront. I think this is, again, an attempt. We'll see CMS try to continue to do things to contain cost, to push us towards a more value-based system. Directionally, we understand that. That's just very, very hard to do, and they've got to be careful if they do that not to hurt providers who really are working hard to deliver care every day. And I think what they bumped into here was some very strong pushback in the provider world. So I do think we'll see an active CMS. We expect that. I think they will make proposals regularly. Some of those will come through and stick, and I think some where the system will say those are tough for us to adopt and they have adverse consequences. And this is probably one of those ones where the market pushed back, and particularly physicians saying this was particularly painful for them.

And so I guess we -- hypothetically, the answer is yes, but we have to just recognize, we're in very early days on the biosimilars side, and I think a lot to play out still."

I think, in general, consolidation is a phenomenon that we've experienced over a lot of years. We're sort of used to it. I think the question that we think about when we look at those consolidated customers is not just are they bigger, but do they have new kinds of needs, distinct needs where we have tools that can support them. So I think the key for us as we think about these is not just whether or not we can be efficient in order to be price competitive, but as those combinations occur, do we have unique sets of skills that allow us to create value for those merged or different kinds of entities. I think, increasingly, we do. So I think it's clear that we have scale and that we can be price competitive.

The tools that we have in naviHealth are really interesting. And again, remember that these have been primarily directed through the naviHealth's history at helping hospitals direct care post-acute. But I think that, that skill set of being able to look at how to identify different ways of creating payment models, how do you help the hospitals that are going to have to live in that world, how do you help them navigate this, I think what we have in naviHealth is enormously valuable. And I think it's actually -- for a relatively small business, it's generated a lot of discussion between us and our customers. But again, BPCI is early. CMMI looking at that program, early days in all of these, but the direction, I think, is unambiguous. I think there is more push to move away, to the extent possible, from the fee-for-service. And I think the tools of naviHealth and the work that we do in Curaspan, which touches 600 hospitals in their customer base and 8,000 post-acute providers, those kinds of tools, I think, are going to be increasingly valuable to us."

We had a very strong and balanced third quarter. So let me get right to the numbers. First, revenue for the period was up 21% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 20% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating earnings of $788 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 20% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.43. And as we move into our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range to $517 million to $527 million. The midpoint of this range would imply a growth rate of 12% for Q4 and a growth rate of 19% for the full year.
I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will go into the financials in a moment, but let me first provide you with more context on our business lines.
Both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments had a strong third quarter, reporting double-digit revenue and profit growth versus the prior year. 
Starting with the results from our Pharmaceutical segment. First, revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 22% to $27.5 billion, and segment profit increased 16% to $660 million. Overall, we saw solid performance across the segment, with significant contributions from Pharmaceutical Distribution and specialty.
Second, our Pharmaceutical Distribution business performed extremely well in the period. We continue to quickly respond to our customers' needs and strengthen our relationships through our value-added service offerings and as a result, have outpaced the market in all classes of trade. Our team has moved decisively with the integration of Harvard Drug, and we are on track to deliver our financial targets for this transaction.
As you know, generic pharmaceuticals play an important role in our pharmaceutical offering and will continue to play an important role in the overall health care system. I'd like to take a few moments to share my thoughts on the environment around generics in the U.S. 
With demographics driving demand and breakthrough science opening the door to new treatments and, in some cases, cures for our most dangerous, costly and complex diseases, generic drugs are a key component to our system's ability to contain costs through competition and provided needed headspace to help fund pharmaceutical innovation.
We do see some dynamics in the current generics environment, which I'd like to highlight, and which have some financial implications for the near term.
First, demand is up. We all know the pressure that aging baby boomers are putting on the health care system, and that pressure will continue to drive volume and growth for years to come.
Second, the cycle of patent expirations is never a straight line. It has peaks and valleys with launch and lifecycle of in-market brand drugs. Right now, we are in a period of relatively fewer generic launches. This has been true in recent quarters, and we would expect this pattern to continue into our FY '17, with the value from new launches being down from FY '16. As you know, this can change based on patent cases, and we'll provide you with more clarity around our launch expectations for next year when we finish our FY '16 and guide for FY '17.
Third, the flow of new ANDA approvals coming out of the FDA has significantly increased. The average number of yearly ANDA approvals in the period between 2012 and 2015 was 155 per year. The number of ANDAs approved just in the 6-month period between November of 2015 and March of 2016 was 279. The FDA is clearly working through its backlog. Combining this with the heightened election cycle discourse around the cost and value of pharmaceuticals, we might expect that across the portfolio, in the aggregate, we would see a relatively flat to slightly down generic manufacturing inflation rate in the near future.
Finally, this has been a year in which strategic moves among numerous players in the retail and non-retail sectors has shifted many long-standing generic affiliations. This has naturally caused some competitive realignment, which we'd expect to settle out as the coming months unfold.
Given all of these factors, we anticipate that the contribution from generics would be more muted in the near term. That is a challenge, but we are well positioned, well prepared, and we'll be working closely with our customers and drawing on the capabilities of our sourcing through Red Oak.
Turning to our Specialty Solutions group. 
We continue our track record of delivering very strong double-digit growth. We serve and support our provider customers across a broad range of therapeutic areas, and we're expanding our services to support biopharmaceutical companies. This positioning is extremely important as the flow of new innovative pharmaceuticals emerges from biopharma pipelines.
Finally, on the Pharmaceutical segment. We are beginning to see an uptick in product volumes in our nuclear business. We are delivering and driving efficiencies in the nuclear diagnostic space and at the same time, are looking forward to participating in the manufacture and distribution of new therapeutic radio biopharmaceuticals.
Overall, a very solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment.
Turning to our Medical segment. Our Medical segment put up some strong numbers in the period. We continue to deliver the tools, services and technologies that set [ph] thousands of care providers depend on every day. As a result, third quarter revenue was up 13% versus the prior year to $3.1 billion, and segment profit increased 26% to $128 million. As a reminder, this quarter included the negative impact of the Cordis-related fair value step-up, which Mike will cover.
Our year-over-year growth for the quarter was not only a result of strategic acquisitions, which did contribute nicely, but also the result of some very positive contributions from existing lines of business, which continued to get stronger. We continue to see growth in the number of accounts we serve and in the range of product lines they purchase from us.
In the period, we saw growth in Cardinal Health consumables, services to hospitals and health systems, surgical kits, lab products and Cardinal Health at Home. Don and his team are driving strong performance, and we are very excited to see this kind of growth. And importantly, our strategic positioning in the market has been thoughtfully crafted and is being effectively executed.
For example, we've identified the activities and process of discharge into the post-acute arena as an important area of dysfunction in the overall health care system. We have taken some important steps, including the acquisitions of naviHealth and Curaspan, which strengthen our ability to play an important role in helping our customers navigate this critical stage. These capabilities are particularly relevant as we see the emergence of more value-based payment models.
Finally, on Medical. The integration of Cordis remains on track. Under the leadership of Cordis President, David Wilson, we have trained and merged our Cordis and AccessClosure U.S. commercial teams. We have finalized our worldwide leadership teams, appointing a new president in Japan and a new operations leader for our Cordis headquarters in Zug, Switzerland. We are bringing the best of Cordis and Cardinal Health together, and care providers, patients and investors will see real benefits.
We do have some important work in front of us though. Of course, we want to make sure that what we call the Day 2 [ph] countries are closed and integrated. We've seen some encouraging growth in the EU, and we'd like to see a similar pattern in our Asian markets. And we think there's significant opportunity to expand the Cordis product portfolio.
Let me close with an important point.
At a time when powerful forces are reshaping the health care landscape, Cardinal Health is not just prepared to respond, but poised to lead. We've worked hard to create a balanced portfolio of products and services that deliver real solutions that address our customers' most pressing challenges. We deliver value across the lines of traditional customer groupings and markets and from a fully integrated Cardinal Health portfolio.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

In my comments, I'll first provide some context around our third quarter performance. Then I'll give some additional color on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.
Starting with consolidated company results. Third quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.43, a 20% growth versus the prior year. This was due to solid performance in both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, which I'll discuss in detail later.
Total company revenues grew 21% versus the prior year to $30.7 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin dollars grew 17%. 
Consolidated company SG&A increased by 14% versus the prior year, almost entirely due to acquisitions. Our core SG&A continues to be an area of focus, with a disciplined approach to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. 
Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $788 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year.
Moving below the operating line. Net interest and other expense was $44 million. Again, this quarter, the increase versus the prior year is due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and the Harvard Drug Group.
The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 36.6%, flat to the rate in the prior year quarter.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 331 million, 3 million shares lower than the third quarter in the prior year. During the quarter, we repurchased $300 million worth of shares and as of the end of the quarter, had slightly under $400 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
Cash flow from operations was nearly $920 million, and at the end of the third quarter, we had $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
Our strong cash flow is the result of our robust earnings growth as well as our efficient management of working capital by our teams. As always, we remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment.
Moving on to segment performance. Let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment. Revenues grew 22% to $27.5 billion due to continued growth from new and existing customers as well as the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical.
Segment profit was $660 million, an increase of 16% versus the prior year. There were 2 primary drivers of our profit growth in the quarter. The first is the acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical, which are integrating well and meeting our financial targets. The second is the continued growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution of new and existing customers, which includes our generics program. Also, while not the primary drivers in the quarter, both specialty and nuclear were contributors, with specialty continuing its double-digit growth and is on track to deliver at least $8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2016.
Pharma segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 11 basis points versus the prior year. This is a mix dynamic due to the new relationship with a large mail order customer, which began in our second quarter. As a reminder, while the new contract has a dilutive effect to margin rate, it is positive from an earnings and capital standpoint.
In our Medical segment, we saw the same sort of uplift across the breadth of our businesses. Revenues grew 13% to $3.1 billion, driven by contribution from acquisitions, net of divestitures, as well as growth from all of our existing businesses.
Medical segment profit grew 26% to $128 million. This was driven by the net contributions from acquisitions as well as Cardinal Health brand products. As you may recall, this quarter, like Q2, includes the Cordis inventory fair-value step-up, which was $21 million in each quarter.
Let me give you a little more color on Cordis. First, the onboarding of Cordis continues to progress well. We have filled the key roles with excellent talent and are focused on execution. As I mentioned last quarter, the expected favorability of the lower inventory step-up was a wash with the foreign exchange impact that was greater than we had originally modeled. 
As we work through the transaction, there are a few mechanics, such as the timing of exiting our transition service agreements with J&J, the closing of Day 2 [ph] countries and the ramping up and down of certain expenses, that could result in variability between quarters. As you can imagine, all of these moving parts can lead to Cordis results that may not be linear for a few more quarters. Specifically, some of these caused margin rates to be somewhat elevated in the third quarter versus how they may look over the next few quarters. If anything significant occurs, we will let you know, but again, overall, Cordis is performing well.
Organic growth of our Cardinal Health brand products was the primary driver of a 42 basis points increase in the Q3 Medical segment profit rates to just over 4%. Our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio includes private-label consumables and physician preference items. These lines of business are important value drivers for our customers and are key to margin expansion.
Of particular note, this offering is resonating with our customers. In the quarter, Cardinal Health brand product growth was in the low double digits within our strategic accounts. Additionally, the value of the breadth of our offering is also gaining traction, as our strategic accounts once again grew well above the market this quarter.
Before I move to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, let me touch briefly on China, which reports in both segments. In spite of well-documented macroeconomic conditions, our businesses in China continue to perform well, with strong double-digit top and bottom line growth for the quarter.
Turning to Slide #6. You will see our consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation for the quarter. 
The $0.26 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.
Now I'll update you on our thoughts for the remainder of fiscal '16. Based on our current assumptions, we've tightened our non-GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $5.17 to $5.27 or a growth of 18% to 20% versus the prior year. This range implies fourth quarter guidance of $1.07 to $1.17 non-GAAP earnings per share, a 12% growth at the midpoint.
Looking sequentially to Q4, 4 things essentially explain the variance from Q3.
First, we typically see higher brand inflation activity in the third quarter, which comes down in the fourth quarter. We expect this fiscal year will be consistent with this historical trend. Second, as a result of the acquisition of Safeway by Albertsons, we stopped servicing them as of April 1, which has an impact on our fourth quarter comparison. The final 2 are a higher tax rate and a handful of smaller corporate items.
For our full year fiscal year guidance, recall that in the prior quarter, I mentioned that foreign exchange and the generic pricing environment could impact us in reaching the very high end of our prior range. Neither turned in our favor. Foreign exchange hasn't moved much from our prior expectations. And as for generic drug pricing, we expect the environment to be similar to what we experienced towards the end of Q3, which was slightly deflationary.
Moving on to Slide 9 of the presentation, I'll walk through the updated corporate assumptions that reflect what we expect as we close out fiscal 2016.
First, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 35.5% to 36.5%. Next, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be between 330 million and 331 million shares. In addition, we've lowered our expected range for net interest and other expense to $185 million to $200 million. Also we expect that our full year CapEx spend will be in the range of $450 million to $480 million. And finally, our updated assumption on acquisition-related intangible amortization will be about $348 million or $0.68 per share.
Now I want to take the opportunity to share a few preliminary thoughts on what we believe will be some of the key drivers in FY '17. We still have work to do on sizing each of these, so my thoughts will be more qualitative than quantitative.
Starting with the Medical segment. We expect strong growth to be led by our Cardinal Health brand products, which will include Cordis. As a reminder, FY '17 will not have the negative impact from the inventory step-up. Also, we expect growth in our post-acute initiatives, which includes our Cardinal Health at Home business. As in past years, we would still expect repricing on national brands to be a headwind.
Moving to the Pharma segment. As we mentioned, the Safeway contract has expired and will be a factor until we anniversary it in the Q3 of next year. Our -- under our generics program, we expect continued strong performance from Red Oak. As it relates to new item launches, due to the timing of our fiscal year and a shifting of a few product launches, we expect the contribution in FY '17 to be less than FY '16. Also, we are currently expecting generic inflation to be less in FY '17.
As I mentioned in our Q4 FY '15 call, we initiated a multi-year program to refresh our information systems in our Pharmaceutical segment. This investment is being made to support our significant customer growth and acquisitions. Per our plan, FY '17 expenses related to this program will be more than what we incur in FY '16. We have outstanding talent and metrics in place to ensure success.
Lastly, we expect to continue with our current momentum in the specialty business. 
As we complete our budgeting process this summer, we will finalize our FY '17 outlook, and we'll provide additional clarity on our Q4 fiscal '16 call in August.

But I guess I'm still trying to parse out what was incremental relative to what you had line of sight into previously. If I just look at the implied 4Q guidance you guys highlighted, having a hard time based off the trends in both segments seeing how growth will slow as much as you're implying. So I guess, really, just if you could go back to some of the buckets you highlighted. What kind of moved against you from where you were thinking about the year previously to how you're thinking about the fourth quarter now?"

I guess I'll just go back a little bit to emphasize what I talked about and see if that's helpful. So I'm not sure if things changed a lot in the sense if you think about what typically often happens between Q3 and Q4 as it relates to the branded inflation piece, that is what we're seeing sequentially. Both in Pharma and in Med, we see a stronger Q3 from price increase activity on branded products. So we're planning to see that again in our Q4, so that's #1. Second of all, the Safeway contract expired, and we quit servicing the business on April 1. So we have a full quarter of the impact of Safeway. Those are the 2 biggest drivers sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And then we are expecting a higher tax rate in Q4, which will have impact sequentially on it, and then also, there's just some corporate items -- several smaller corporate items that we expect to happen in our fourth quarter. And then if -- so that kind of maybe helps a little bit for a chunk of it. And then the other piece, if you think back to our last quarter, what we were trying to help everybody understand is to get to that top end of our range, we really needed to see FX rebound and generic inflation change, and neither one did. We didn't see really much change at all in FX, and so we're not seeing any pickup from that in the fourth quarter. And then generic inflation, in the fourth quarter, we're expecting it to be more like what we saw in the last part of Q3, which as you know, as we mentioned before, was declining in the back part of Q3."

George, let me start with the second part in a sense, because as I described in the call, there is sort of a number of factors at work here, including the launch cycle; the rate of approvals, which creates more products in the system; reimbursement dynamics, which our customers feel. So this is all sort of part of the dynamic that affects the overall pricing environment. So that's sort of what I was trying to capture, which is that this is really not a single factor, but we're seeing a numbers of factors that actually come together. As it relates to realignment, I was really referring to some of the big moves that have occurred over the course of the year. You have CVS buying Target and Omnicare, you've got the move with Albertsons and Safeway, you've got Walgreens and Rite Aid. And so I think those kinds of big moves have a tendency to create a little bit of sort of short-term disturbance and then they just sort of settle out. And I just wanted to highlight that. But I think what we're describing here is more -- again, as Mike said, it is quite different than it was at the early part of the year of our fiscal '16, and that's sort of what we're describing.

I think, again, I don't want to speak -- it's not fair for me to speak for Kaiser, but I think the general dialogue was really about the future, about the evolution of their business, how they're going to have to serve a customer base that continues to be treated in different care settings and our ability to take care of that as well as the services and technologies that we may be able to bring to them that improve efficiencies in their operations. So I think, increasingly, that discussion is occurring with our largest customers. They understand that complexity is increasing and that those partners that can help them navigate that are probably more attractive as they go forward, and I think that was sort of a differentiator for us. Again, being careful of not to speak for them. There are other lines of business, obviously, that we serve to the market, and Kaiser is looking at those. I could not comment on the status of any of those. It's not appropriate.

As we're bringing on Cordis with you -- again, some of the things I mentioned, and we've got several different types of transition service agreements that we have in place with J&J, each with different timing of when we roll off of those and how we can work through those.

There are certainly systems who are very much on top of some of these trends and pushing very hard to improve efficiencies through standardization. And there are others that are just at a different stage. So it really varies across the country and across the systems. And I would also say, different programs have different sales cycles. So for example, on the consumables side, you're probably going to have a faster sales cycle than you have, for example, than on the physician preference item where you want -- there requires a little bit more buy-in in the system. So I think you'd have to look at those a little bit differently from the sort of commodity-type consumables to products that are more used in the traditional physician preference area. So again, it varies a little bit by product type, and it certainly varies a lot by system. Overall, directionally, as we've seen more bundled payment models, more payment for performance, shifting financing models, I would say this trend is well understood and most institutions are trying to push in that direction. It's probably good news for us."

As it relates to the Med B proposal, as you know, this was -- it got a lot of attention and got a lot of pushback. Let me start by saying, it doesn't really have much impact on us very specifically. So that's important to note upfront. I think this is, again, an attempt. We'll see CMS try to continue to do things to contain cost, to push us towards a more value-based system. Directionally, we understand that. That's just very, very hard to do, and they've got to be careful if they do that not to hurt providers who really are working hard to deliver care every day. And I think what they bumped into here was some very strong pushback in the provider world. So I do think we'll see an active CMS. We expect that. I think they will make proposals regularly. Some of those will come through and stick, and I think some where the system will say those are tough for us to adopt and they have adverse consequences. And this is probably one of those ones where the market pushed back, and particularly physicians saying this was particularly painful for them.

I think, first of all, that this is still sort of unraveling -- not unraveling, probably unwinding. It's still -- some of these are still in regulatory approval. I think, in general, consolidation is a phenomenon that we've experienced over a lot of years. We're sort of used to it. I think the question that we think about when we look at those consolidated customers is not just are they bigger, but do they have new kinds of needs, distinct needs where we have tools that can support them. So I think the key for us as we think about these is not just whether or not we can be efficient in order to be price competitive, but as those combinations occur, do we have unique sets of skills that allow us to create value for those merged or different kinds of entities. I think, increasingly, we do. So I think it's clear that we have scale and that we can be price competitive. But I think it's also other things that we want to be able to bring to any player, whether or not that's on the institutional side, in hospital and health systems or whether it's on the retail side."

The tools that we have in naviHealth are really interesting. And again, remember that these have been primarily directed through the naviHealth's history at helping hospitals direct care post-acute. But I think that, that skill set of being able to look at how to identify different ways of creating payment models, how do you help the hospitals that are going to have to live in that world, how do you help them navigate this, I think what we have in naviHealth is enormously valuable. And I think it's actually -- for a relatively small business, it's generated a lot of discussion between us and our customers. But again, BPCI is early. CMMI looking at that program, early days in all of these, but the direction, I think, is unambiguous. I think there is more push to move away, to the extent possible, from the fee-for-service. And I think the tools of naviHealth and the work that we do in Curaspan, which touches 600 hospitals in their customer base and 8,000 post-acute providers, those kinds of tools, I think, are going to be increasingly valuable to us."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining our fourth quarter and end of the year call.
Health care is at an inflection point. The demand from an aging publishing, the challenges in public health and continued policy debates around cost, quality and access have significant implications for economies around the globe and families close to home. They require adaptive and meaningful action from our industry. The simple truth is we are experiencing the most dynamic and rapid change in the history of health care. At Cardinal Health, we are acutely aware of the need to adapt, innovate and lead.
Our teams worked hard this past year, integrating new product teams, building and acquiring additional capabilities and finding more efficient and effective ways to deliver real value, while never losing sight of the ultimate goal, serving patients and their families.
This was also a period in which I participated in health care system in a very personal way. I lost both of my parents in these last 15 months. I had the opportunity to witness the technical skills, the dedication and the compassion of caregivers, from physicians to hospice workers, as well as the extraordinary power. I also had the opportunity to see how complex our system remains, how disconnected the elements of care can be and how difficult it can be for a person to retain their dignity when they need it most. Health care is at its core, personal. This is what inspires all of us at Cardinal Health to do our work everyday. Every priority we set, every strategic move that we make, we know that at the center of all of this is that patient, a mother or father, a sister or brother, our son or daughter, our friend. As I highlight our Q4 and full year performance and put the year in context, I will keep those patients at the forefront of our conversation.
Also, as I've done in past years at year-end, I'll spend a few minutes providing some commentary on the big picture for our business and our future. And then I'll turn it over to Mike who will go into further detail in the financials, our assumptions for the year ahead and our long-term aspirations.
We delivered a solid fourth quarter, closing out an outstanding fiscal 2016, thanks to the incredible hard work of our integrated teams, from medical to pharma to corporate.
First, revenue for the quarter was up 14% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 5% versus the prior year in non-GAAP operating earnings of $643 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 14% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.14.
For the year, we delivered strong impressive results in fiscal 2016 across the enterprise. Full year revenues were up 19% versus the prior year to a record $121.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up 17% versus the prior year to $2.9 billion, also a record. And non-GAAP earnings per share was up 20% to $5.24.
I cannot say enough about the dedication, teamwork and commitment that our more than 37,000 people demonstrated this year. This record achievement is their milestone. These results were indeed a true effort rooted in our culture of collaboration. Both the pharmaceutical and medical segments achieved meaningful measurable growth, while strengthening our overall competitive and strategic position. That's the result of their disciplined and determined execution, delivering the highest levels of service to our customers, driving operating efficiencies, managing our rock solid balance sheet and integrating the operations of our important acquisitions.
First, let's look at the strong year our Pharmaceutical segment had. 
Full year revenue was up 20% versus fiscal 2015 to $109 billion, and we had reported an increase of 19% versus the prior year in segment profit of $2.5 million[ph] .
Don and his team spent this past year deepening their relationships with the existing customers, while welcoming new ones. He has successfully competed the integration of the Harvard Drug Team, building on our first rate generic offering. As for existing customers, we grew our retail independent footprint over the course of the fiscal year, increasing the number of customers we serve. 2 weeks ago, we hosted a record 9,300 attendees at our Annual Retail Business Conference in Chicago where independent pharmacies shared their unique insights about how they serve their communities, as well as the pressure they face.
As a result of this regular engagement, the Cardinal health team has a single[ph] post driving meaningful relationships with our customers and working directly to help them be more efficient to drive the outcomes their patients deserve. This is how we operate, foot on the ground, understanding our customers needs.
Throughout our Pharma business, you can see that our world-class supply tools provide patient service offerings and help reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve quality for providers and the patients they serve. As an example, the Cardinal Health Pharmacy network, which includes thousands of locally owned pharmacies as members, provides comprehensive services to monitor and elevate performance, improve adherence, and manage compliance and credentials. Our pharmacies consistently rank among the highest in customer satisfaction, a testament to the fact their offerings are helping our customers achieve their quality star ratings.
And of course, our first rate genetics program, strengthened by Red Oak Sourcing, our partnership with CVS Health, continues to be a source of value for our customers, their patients and our shareholders.
For those who might question whether the entrepreneurial spirits is driving in America, listening to these business leaders share their experiences about running a small business, while working to make their communities stronger serves as a powerful rebuttal to that narrative.
Specialty solutions also delivered an outstanding fiscal 2016. Building on its proven track record of growth, business modeling, but exceeding the $8 billion revenue target we shared with you for fiscal 2016.
Our specialist solutions group successfully completed the integration of Metro Medical, which expands our ability to serve customers in some important therapeutic areas such as rheumatology, nephrology and oncology, now and well into the future.
We're continuing to add new biopharma tools and services to our portfolio, which positions us for strong steady growth today and tomorrow.
Our work in specialty links directly to the outcomes of major scientific breakthroughs coming from the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.
Our nuclear business has regained its footing. We have moved beyond radio diagnostics and into radiopharmaceuticals, exploring the potential for new life treatments for cancer patients.
The way that we are working with bio on the project, their treatment for prostate cancer, integrating manufacturing to dose compounding is just one example of the cutting edge work that we are doing in the nuclear segment.
To conclude in the Pharma segment. While the generics environment presents some near-term challenges for our pharmaceutical distribution business on a comparative basis, we feel extremely good about the way the entire segment has competed in 2016. and positive about our competitive positioning going forward.
Fiscal 2016 was a real tipping point for our Medical segment, producing exceptional results. Full year revenue from Medical segment was up 9% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion. And we reported an increase of 6% versus FY '15 in the segment profit of $457 million.
These results are a true testament to how we are working seamlessly and successfully with our provider and manufacturer partners as they seek to serve patients more efficiently with less waste to aid in delivering safer, higher quality care.
Our optic rate and services in our inventory management tools are delivering real and measurable results to our partners. And their considerable expansion of our Cardinal Health line of consumables drive both standardization and value. In just the last 2 years, we've added over 26[ph][indiscernible]  Products to help providers greater standardization and the store more cost effectively.
While health care systems continued to wrestle with the evolving payment model, moving from a fee-for-service model to one that is more value based, Cardinal Health is providing products and services to help our customers manage through these important changes. Our physician preference items strategy allows us to integrate products and services that help our partners deliver care in a cost effective and higher quality manner for these patients.
Don Kesey and his team did a tremendous job closing the quarter's[ph] acquisition on time and managing the integration into Cardinal Health with discipline and a focus on the patients.
Our global cross-functional teams have been performing at a high-level, and we hit our integration and performance benchmarks.
To stay on the theme of evolving payment models, we can draw a straight line between this trend and our work in discharge management and post-acute. Our solution offered through naviHealth, right care and AssuraMed position to help providers and payers manage the complex processes of discharge. With these tools, we can help direct patients to the optimum type of care, build the linkages to post acute setting, and through our at home business, supply medical products to patients in their home, improving their health care experience. These are important solutions as the population ages and the health systems adapt.
While we are proud of the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016, we know that our health care system continues to undergo rapid transformation, and we know that changes are necessary to this new environment. First, care needs to be more coordinated, more efficient and centered around the patient. Second, our higher priority must be placed on delivering the right care at the right time and using the right evidence based protocols and standards and in the right setting. Third, a greater focus must be placed on patient outcomes, not activity. Lastly, and certainly not insignificantly, we are seeing daily the potential for science and technology to change the health care journey.
The significance and pace of change, just last week, CMS released another proposed mandatory bundled payment model for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft and surgical hip femur fracture treatment episodes in their Medicare population. Similar to the now finalized rule around comprehensive joint replacement, acute-care hospitals would be our financial at the sort of care from an inpatient admission to 90 days for discharge.
Our work in physician preference items where we can focus on episodic care across the continuum of care, from device to inventory management to discharge management to patient follow-up, all provide us compete in an environment which they will increasingly be compensated around that episode of care.
The capabilities resonate in naviHealth, right care and, all strengthen our ability to deliver real and measurable value at a time when providers are being asked to be among risk.
While the initiative coming out of CMS can create some challenges for provider, we see the goal of the 1 hospital that work together with physicians and other providers towards complications to prevent hospital and speed recovery as an important direction for the future of health care. We have participated directly in bundles programs, and we'll continue to work very closely with providers and payers, as well as CMS, to do our part to best serve our patients.
As we position Cardinal Health for the future, we're always looking for new ways to better serve providers and patients, while driving value for our shareholders. We enter fiscal 2017 well prepared and positioned to weather some short-term challenges, particularly around the generic pharmaceutical environment. At Cardinal Health, we are committed to exploring avenues by which we can turn the systems challenges today into breakthroughs and opportunities tomorrow. We are both realistic and optimistic about our industry and the future.
With this as a backdrop, we are providing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for FY '17 of $5.48 to $5.73, which equates to a growth rate of 5% to 9%.
Health care is also about people. Every technical solution consider, every innovation in which we invest, and every team that we welcome at Cardinal Health family are all focused on the same phases, those are the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters and friends that we served as patients. We all have a part to play for the next-generation of health care. And I believe that as long as we're focused on those patients and families and our communities, we'll make the right decisions, the right investment and the right moves to be successful now and well into the future.
I'd like to thank our customers for their trust, our manufacturer partners for their shared goal of great patient care, our shareholders for their support and all of our employees for their deep commitment.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss more of our financials and our outlook for the future."

George said our team delivered another strong year of earnings growth and cash flow in fiscal '16. And this just highlights the great work of our pharmaceutical, medical and corporate teams to deliver these record results for our customers and our shareholders. Our proven track record of success, combined with our aspirational goals, position us to deliver meaningful, measurable value for our shareholders now and well into the future. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment, including our dependable dividend payout ratio of 30% to 35%. We also continued to aspire to a non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate over any 3-year period of 10% to 15%.
So with that additional context, I'd like to go into more detail on our fourth quarter results, then our full year highlights, and finally, a preview of our expectations for fiscal 2017, including some of our underlying assumptions. I have a lot to cover, but I'll leave plenty of time to answer all of your questions.
Please note that, with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website will be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.
Let me start by discussing the strong year-over-year financial performance our team delivered this quarter and year. You can follow along on slides 3 through 12 in our earnings presentation.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 16% to $1.02, while non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $1.14. These results contributed to full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of nearly 20% to $4.32 and $5.24, respectively.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 14% to $31.4 billion, while full year revenue grew 19% to a record $121.5 billion.
GAAP gross margin dollars grew more than 14% in the fourth quarter, and gross margin rate increased by 1 basis point, which includes a $51 million LIFO benefit that we recognized in the quarter.
Fiscal '16 GAAP gross margin dollars increased 15%, while gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points, primarily from the impact of mix as we onboarded a new mail order customer in our Pharmaceutical segment.
Non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased 11% in the fourth quarter and 15% versus the prior full year. Non-GAAP gross margin rate declined in the fourth quarter and full year by 15 and 19 basis points, respectively, again, due primarily to the new customer I just mentioned.
SG&A expenses increased in the quarter and year, as we anticipated, largely as a result of our strategic acquisition, many of which George spoke about in his comments.
Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 11% and 5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter and grew 14% and 17%, respectively, for the full fiscal year.
As anticipated, net interest and other expense increased versus the prior year's fourth quarter and year, primarily due to the debt issued in Q4 of fiscal '15.
The GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.8%. As expected, our non-GAAP ETR was lower at 37.6%. As many of you may remember, in Q4 FY '15, we had an unusually high tax rate because of increased reserves related to certain federal and state tax matters. For FY '16, full year GAAP tax rate was 37.1% and non-GAAP ETR was 36%.
Our fourth quarter and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 327 million and 330 million, respectively.
During the fourth quarter, we put forward $350 million worth of share repurchases. This brought our fiscal 2016 share repurchases to about $650 million, which, combined with our differentiated dividend payout, totals $1.2 billion in cash returned to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased another $250 million of shares in July, which leaves us with $793 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program.
Moving on to consolidated cash flows. 
We generated approximately $640 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. This brought the fiscal '16 cash from operations to a record $3 billion. And we saw a strong contributions from both segments. We also deployed $465 million in capital expenditures, primarily in order to refresh our existing infrastructure and support new acquisitions.
Overall, we ended June 30 with a strong balance sheet, with cash and liquid investments of approximately $2.6 billion, of which $475 million were held internationally.
Outstanding working capital management by our teams resulted in this strong year-end cash position, and average net working capital days improved by more than a day.
Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. You can refer to slides 6 and 10.
Pharma segment revenue in the fourth quarter grew 14% to $28.2 billion, driven by growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers and to a lesser extent, performance from our specialty business.
For the year, we drove growth in existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, acquisitions and specialty by 20% to a record $109 billion. In fact, as George mentioned, the specialty team far exceeded the revenue goal we set in fiscal '16 of $8 billion.
Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $542 million, primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions, offset by the loss of Safeway. In addition, positive contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, which includes our generics program, were offset by a reduced contribution from a specific branded manufacturer agreement.
For the year, segment profit increased 19% to $2.5 billion due to growth from existing and net new Pharma distribution customers, which includes our generics program, as well as contributions from our strategic acquisition. This was partially offset by the typical customer repricings and, to a lesser extent, reduced contribution from the specific branded manufacturer agreement mentioned earlier.
Speaking of acquisitions, we've not only met, but exceeded the goals that we set for our acquisitions of the Harvard Drug Group and Metro Medical, which is a testament to the hard work of these dedicated teams. We have now lapped both acquisitions.
Segment profit rate declined by 24 basis points for the quarter and 2 basis points for the year. This was largely due to changes in product and customer mix. Performance under our generics program, which includes Red Oak Sourcing, helped to positively offset some of the full year decline.
All in all, despite a challenging environment in Q4 with the expiration of the Safeway contract and a tougher product pricing environment, we demonstrated that we have the team and talent to still deliver outstanding performance for the year.
Let's move to Slide 7 and 11 that cover the Medical segment, which had an excellent fourth quarter.
Revenue for the quarter grew more than 12% to $3.2 billion, primarily due to acquisitions and to a lesser extent, Cardinal Health brand products.
For the year, revenue grew 9% to a record $12.4 billion, driven by contributions from acquisitions and sales growth from existing businesses. 
Fourth quarter segment profit grew more than 19% to $122 million due to acquisitions and growth in Cardinal Health brand products. Full year segment profit increased 6% to $457 million due to contributions from Cardinal Health brand products, as well as the net contributions from acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by changes in the Canadian market, which affected the first half of fiscal '16 and which we've mentioned on prior calls.
Medical segment profit rate expanded by 22 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by Cardinal Health brand products, including Cordis, but declined by 12 basis points for the year, again, related to the first half pressures in Canada.
Knowing you'll have some questions on Cordis, I'd like to provide more details on our progress.
Our integration team has worked hard this year and all day 1[ph] countries are stood up in providing solutions that drive efficiency, standardization and improve patient outcomes. In fact, the Cordis team has already demonstrated measurable growth in certain geographic regions, such as Europe, which hasn't seen that type of growth in a number of years.
We continue to work on closing and standing up day 2 countries. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected variability in the margin rate between quarters as we are still working through a few intricate mechanics related to the transition service and manufacturing agreements that we have with J&J.
This variability is caused by such factors as the timing of exits, the ramping up and down of certain expenses and the impact of foreign exchange. You can see that variability sequentially in the fourth quarter segment profit rate versus last quarter, where I had indicated that the Q3 segment profit rate was somewhat elevated.
As we expected, we should be fully stood up in exiting our TSA agreements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple years longer.
Let me share a quick update on Cardinal Health China. 
Our business in China generated over $3.5 billion in revenue for the year, resulting in solid top and bottom line growth. And as many of you know, our Chinese operations serve both our pharmaceutical and medical segments, each showing significant multi-year growth.
We have 16 large scale distribution centers and operate 29 specialized retail pharmacies in 20 of the major cities across China. The team there continues to execute well through a combination of organic and inorganic. And we continued to gain share in our ranking among the top 10 health care distributors in China.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you review the Q4 fiscal '16 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on Slide 8, you'll see 3 key reconciling items that are excluded from non-GAAP EPS. 
First, amortization and other acquisition-related costs accounts for $0.32 per share. Second, net litigation recoveries, which includes proceeds of approximately $68 million in pretax and antitrust settlements, accounts for $0.13. And third, as we closed fiscal '16, we reviewed and adjusted our LIFO reserves based on the actual June 30 inventory balances. This resulted in a favorable $0.10 adjustment to GAAP EPS.
So with a very strong year behind us, let me now turn to our fiscal '17 outlook and relevant underlying assumptions. From an overall perspective, there are 2 items to note about our non-GAAP guidance range. First, all of my forward-looking comments will be focused on non-GAAP, as we do not provide GAAP future guidance due to the difficulty in predicting items that we don't include in our non-GAAP EPS. And second, our guidance doesn't include the impact of the new accounting treatment for the tax effect of shareholder based compensation. We are currently assessing whether or not we want to adopt this earlier than the required Q1 fiscal 2018 adoption date. If we do early adopt, we will keep you informed and provide you with the impact and updated guidance range.
So now, let me walk you through our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year.
Starting on Slide 14. 
We expect high single-digit percentage growth in our consolidated company revenues. And as George stated, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to grow roughly 5% to 9% for a range of $5.48 to $5.73.
On Slide 15, we've outlined 5 corporate assumptions. 
First, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35% to 37%. As I've mentioned on prior calls, we only provide full year guidance on tax rates as they have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discrete items.
Second, for fiscal '17, we are assuming diluted weighted shares outstanding in the range of 324 million to 326 million. As I mentioned earlier, we already completed $250 million of share repurchases in July, which is included in this range.
Third, we expect net interest and other expense of $190 million to $205 million. 
Fourth, we continued to view reinvestment in the business as a priority to support acquisitions and growing demand. As a result, we expect capital investments to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million.
And finally, we currently assume amortization of approximately $376 million or $0.74, which includes all acquisitions closed as of June 30. Again, this is excluded from non-GAAP.
Now moving to the segment assumptions, starting with Pharma, which you'll see on Slide 16.
Beginning with revenues, we expect a high single-digit percentage increase versus the prior year. This is based on current pricing trends, contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, offset by the loss of Safeway, which impacts most of fiscal '17. We expect Pharma segment profit for the full year to be essentially flat versus fiscal '16.
While we don't normally provide quarterly guidance, Q1 is unusual. We expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range as we navigate challenging year-over-year comps. Clearly, the trends we saw this past quarter also a factor into our guidance. Of course, this will affect our company consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter. As a result, we expect consolidated non-GAAP EPS to decline by high single to low double digits year-on-year. However, we do expect Pharma segment growth to improve and performance to be back half weighted versus the prior year.
Let me provide some additional context on Pharma.
As I mentioned just now related to revenues, we also expect the loss of Safeway to impact the Pharma segment profit in the first 3 quarters of fiscal '17. As it relates to generic manufacturer drug price increases, we expect less contribution in fiscal '17 than we've experienced in fiscal '16. We are modeling generic manufacturer price inflation[ph] in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. Also, I want to point out that in last year's Q1 fiscal '16, we have several key generic items that we have previously disclosed as being unusual and significant drivers in the quarter. These items have now experienced a meaningful deflation which creates some tough comparisons to Q1. We assume brand manufacturer price inflation to be approximately 10% for the full fiscal year.
FY '17 expenses associated with modernizing our Pharma information systems to support our significant growing demand, as well as acquisitions will be more than what we've had incurred in FY '16. As I said earlier, we have the team and talent in place to ensure success of this multi-year project. We expect incremental year-over-year earnings contribution from both Red Oak Sourcing and new item launches, as well as measurable growth within our existing customers and new customer wins. However, tat year-on-year benefit will be significantly less in fiscal '17.
Red Oak Sourcing has been and continues to be an effective and productive partnership. As we've mentioned in the past, the achievement of certain milestones would trigger the second of 2 predetermined payments beginning in fiscal '17.
Because of the excellent performance, Red Oak achieved these milestones and we will be making our second and final $10 million increase in our quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment will be $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.
There are 2 other business assumptions that we have embedded in our guidance for Pharma. 
First, we expect continued contributions from our acquisitions. For Harvard Drug, we are reaffirming our original assumption of greater than $0.20 EPS contribution to fiscal '17. And second, we expect double-digit growth in our China business and in Cardinal Health specialty solutions. We expect that specialty revenue and profit growth will continue in the double-digit again this fiscal year.
So again, to be clear, because of the exceptionally strong Q1 last year, smaller tailwinds from Red Oak Sourcing and launches, current pricing trends and the Safeway loss which impacts the majority of fiscal '17, we now expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range in Q1 and essentially flat for the year.
Let's now talk about expectations and assumptions around our Medical segment for fiscal '17, which you can find on Slide 17.
We expect revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus the prior year. We also expect double-digit segment profit growth and margin rate expansion. 
Medical segment profit growth stems mainly from 3 key assumptions. First, we continued to expect great performance from Cordis, with that acquisition adding more than $0.15 to fiscal '17 versus the prior year, net of transaction-related interest expense of $0.07 to $0.08. This is a lower accretion figure than we originally provided, largely due to currency impact, as well as some increased SG&A investments compared to our original business case. Our commitment to serving this global customer base without disruption is our highest priority. And therefore, some of the synergies originally associated with this complex acquisition will take longer to achieve than we have originally model. Second, we expect above market revenue growth, and therefore, solid contributions from Cardinal Health at home. And third, we are forecasting double-digit profit growth from Cardinal Health brands.
In Q1, we began onboarding Kaiser with a dedicated customer service team. This new contract is already embedded in our assumptions as this is the assumption that our Cardinal Health brand penetration will gradually increase over the course of this fiscal year.
On Slide 18, we provided an EPS bridge from our fiscal '16 finish to our fiscal '17 guidance midpoint of $5.61. Each category that you see on Slide 18 is a mix of headwinds and tailwinds, and the number associated with each category reflects the midpoint of a risk adjusted non-GAAP EPS contribution range.
We have tried to size each of these 4 categories for you so that you better understand the components of our growth for this fiscal year. This is not something that we plan to do on a go forward basis. However, given current market dynamics, we thought it might be helpful.
As you see on Slide 19, we expect core growth of about 3% to 6%, with capital deployment adding 2% to 3%, for a total fiscal '17 estimated growth of 5% to 9% in non-GAAP EPS.
The higher end of our guidance range contemplates greater growth from the businesses, as well as additional capital deployment either through share repurchases, acquisitions or in combinations.
Finally, I want to address the aspirational goals for fiscal '17 year-end that we outlined at the December 2013 investor day because it's important to us that we stay accountable to you, our shareholders.
At that time, we outlined 5 goals we hope to accomplish as we exited fiscal '17, and which we said will require both organic and inorganic moves. I'd like to update you on our progress towards each of these goals.
First, we targeted achieving a Pharma segment profit rate of at least 2.5%. As you know, we've grown through the addition of an important new mail order customer that helps to increase our earnings but is dilutive to margin rates. So while this goal will be difficult to achieve, we will always pursue opportunities that are both capital efficient and overall accretive to earnings.
Second, for the Medical segment, we targeted a segment profit rate of at least 5.75%. While this may take somewhat longer to achieve, the Medical team is still committed to this target. 
Third, we stated that 45% of the segment gross profit would come from Cardinal Health brands, and we are very much on track to achieve this. 
Fourth, we set out to increase income from Cardinal Health at home by more than 50%. We have already made significant progress towards achieving this goal. 
And fifth and finally, we said we want to deliver more than 70% of the Medical segment gross profit from a combination of Cardinal Health brands, services and ultimate site solutions, and we are also very much on track to deliver this.
I know I just provided a lot of information for you around our assumptions, so please feel free to ask any clarifying questions. 
Allow me to briefly close by saying fiscal '16 was truly a remarkable year for Cardinal and our well-positioned portfolio. I'd like to recognize our team for all the work that they've done and continue to do to deliver meaningful measurable results. I am confident about our plan for fiscal '17 and look forward to the year ahead. 
I'll now turn it over to the operator to start the Q&A."

First of all, you hopefully got it in color. The first 3 components net customer activity generics program in existing or remaining businesses, those numbers all represent midpoints of a guidance range -- of a range that we established for each one of these. And so just think about that there is a range for each of these. The capital deployment is essentially the bottom of the range because we have already achieved the $0.10 through the share repurchases that we've done. As far as the net customer activity, the things that are included in there would be, for instance, as you mentioned, the loss of Safeway, all of the reprices that we experienced, that we expect to experience this year in Pharma, which we expect to be at normal levels, is also well with normal medical repricings, and then the impact of any other wins or losses that we would be having in customers. The generics program bucket includes the headwind we talked about with generic drug manufacturing pricing assumption and then the tailwinds of both generic, and launches and Red Oak Sourcing, which, again, while tailwinds will be less than what we experienced in '16 versus '15, and then also our assumptions around generic penetration are in there. And our final bucket, existing or remaining businesses, that would be everything else, such as specialty China growth, Harvard, the negative impact of that we talked about, et cetera. All those other things are in that bucket. So hopefully, that gave you a little bit of color."

Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're at ea",359,"Yes. So let me just sort of respond as broadly first, Charles. I think the movement towards value based care is pretty clear. I think the horse is out of the barn in that regard. Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're at early stages in the sense. So there are certain episodes of care we're aligning on what the outcome we're looking for is where the priority measure can be quite straightforward, there are other episodes of care where it's extremely difficult in the time horizon rise in terms of measuring outcomes is more difficult. So I think we have to recognize that we're in a period of mixed system where we'll be living for some period of time with traditional fee-for-service model, as well as outcome or value based model. Not every provider or every payer is completely ready to move forward on all of those programs. We feel like we're well positioned to serve in any of those kind of markets. We're extremely efficient in driving our lines of businesses, given that fee-for-service model, but we now have some tools that are enabling particularly very large complex systems that are beginning to wrestle with these issues. We have tools that can really help them, whether or not it's reducing costs through standardization in the consumables, outcome physician preference item strategy which links the device and the services around it where they're going to be paid a set fee for an episode or the work that we're doing in post-acute and discharge management, which is really critical as you think about the amount of costs in the system post discharge. So I think we're going to leave in a world that has both models in the short term, but we really are positioned I think to create value for our customers in either model. And actually, just -- they have -- our legacy lines of business in our Medical segment during the back half of the year were actually very strong. And I again that's a testament to the fact that we can compete effectively in either one of these financing models."

And really, the reason we gave that last year it's probably not something we'll do going forward is because we want you to understand the scale and breadth of that business that we've grown so quickly that it's truly at a scale where we have all the relationships that we need with pharma manufacturers, as well as the suite of services to serve the providers downstream. We do continue to expect double-digit growth for the specialty business for '17. We're excited about both our offerings upstream to providers, as well as downstream -- or upstream to manufacturers and downstream to providers. So I think we are really well positioned in that business. I think that our margin rates, I think it's going to be higher margin rates on the upstream services to manufacturers, more a typical distribution margin rates on the downstream services to the providers."

Really the difference between the $0.20 accretion we had last year and the $0.15 that we're now updating it to is mostly FX. And obviously, that's something that we can have some impact in the way we price the stuff, but it's obviously hard to control. So the biggest piece of that change really truly is FX. What I wanted to emphasize the SG&A just a little bit was to let you know that we're incredibly committed to making sure that we do no harm to the current sales business in that as we get through our TSA agreements with J&J, that as we build up to and support it internally and then exit off of those of other agreements, we've decided to be, I guess use the word conservative in the sense that managing our expenses so that we don't cause any disruption to the supply chain and do anything that would make lives for our sales guys tougher. So we feel good about this. We feel like we have really good plans to deliver. And that's also why I mentioned before that we would have some variability between quarters, because in some cases, was we're ramping our expenses, we're still on the TSA, so we kind of have slightly doubled expenses in certain periods as we then walk off the TSAs as we move country to country."

There were -- if you remember back then, I mentioned there was a subset of a few specific generic items that we had anticipated would deflate on July 1 of last year, and they didn't. They ended up staying very -- a much higher price than we anticipated, which created a lot of extra margin on those items in Q1. Those items have subsequently deflated, and so they're not creating us much margins. So that's one of the big headwinds in Q1. You also have the Safeway piece in Q1 of this year where it was a customer that was very late in its contract life that we have fully synergized in terms of Red Oak Sourcing and had penetrated essentially about 100% of the generics there. So you have those 2 big things that are there. And then as you really look forward, the team is just doing a lot of things, as I've mentioned, around focusing on penetrating current customers which is going to continue to grow us, continuing to invest in data and analytics, some of the good work we're doing on Harvard specialty, nuclear is really improving as a business. And so I think we're going to have much better comps as we move forward over the next couple of quarters, so we would expect our second half to be much better than our first half on Pharma.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining our fourth quarter and end of the year call.
Health care is at an inflection point. The demand from an aging publishing, the challenges in public health and continued policy debates around cost, quality and access have significant implications for economies around the globe and families close to home. They require adaptive and meaningful action from our industry. The simple truth is we're experiencing the most dynamic and rapid change in the history of health care. At Cardinal Health, we are acutely aware of the need to adapt, innovate and lead.
Our teams worked hard this past year, integrating new product teams, building and acquiring additional capabilities and finding more efficient and effective ways to deliver real value, while never losing sight of the ultimate goal: serving patients and their families.
This was also a period in which I participated in the health care system in a very personal way. I lost both of my parents in these last 15 months. I had the opportunity to witness the technical skills, the dedication and the compassion of caregivers, from physicians to hospice workers, as well as the extraordinary power of science. I also had the opportunity to see how complex our system remains, how disconnected the elements of care can be and how difficult it can be for a person to retain their dignity when they need it most. Health care is, at its core, personal. This is what inspires all of us at Cardinal Health to do our work every day. Every priority we set, every strategic move that we make, we know that at the center of all of this is that patient, our mother or father, our sister or brother, our son or daughter, our friend. As I highlight our Q4 and full year performance to put the year in context, I will keep those patients at the forefront of our conversation.
Also, as I've done in past years at year-end, I'll spend a few minutes providing some commentary on the big picture for our business and our future. And then I'll turn it over to Mike who will go into further detail in the financials, our assumptions for the year ahead and our long-term aspirations.
We delivered a solid fourth quarter, closing out an outstanding fiscal 2016, thanks to the incredible hard work of our integrated teams from Medical to Pharma to corporate.
First, revenue for the quarter was up 14% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 5% versus the prior year in non-GAAP operating earnings of $643 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 14% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.14.
For the year, we delivered strong impressive results in fiscal 2016 across the enterprise. Full year revenues were up 19% versus the prior year to a record $121.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up 17% versus the prior year to $2.9 billion, also a record. And non-GAAP earnings per share was up 20% to $5.24.
I cannot say enough about the dedication, teamwork and commitment that our more than 37,000 people demonstrated this year. This record achievement is their milestone. These results were indeed a true team effort rooted in our culture of collaboration. Both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments achieved meaningful measurable growth, while strengthening our overall competitive and strategic position. That's a result of their disciplined and determined execution, delivering the highest level of service to our customers, driving operating efficiencies, managing our rock-solid balance sheet and integrating the operations of important acquisitions.
First, let's look at the strong year our Pharmaceutical segment had. Full year revenue was up 20% versus fiscal 2015 to $109 billion, and we reported an increase of 19% versus the prior year in segment profit of $2.5 billion.
Jon Giacomin and his team spent this past year deepening their relationships with existing customers, while welcoming new ones. He successfully competed the integration of the Harvard Drug team, building on our first rate generics offering. As for existing customers, we grew our retail independent footprint over the course of the fiscal year, increasing the number of customers we serve. 2 weeks ago, we hosted a record 9,300 attendees at our annual Retail Business Conference in Chicago where independent pharmacists shared their unique insights about how they serve their communities as well as the pressures they face.
As a result of this regular engagement, the Cardinal Health team had a [indiscernible] driving meaningful relationships with our customers and working directly to help them be more efficient to drive the outcomes their patients deserve. This is how we operate, boots on the ground, understanding our customers' needs.
Throughout our Pharma business, you can see that our world-class supply tools provide patient-driven service offerings and help reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve quality for providers and the patients they serve. As an example, the Cardinal Health Pharmacy network, which includes thousands of locally owned pharmacies as members, provides comprehensive services to monitor and elevate performance, improve adherence, and manage compliance and credentials. Our pharmacy is consistently ranked among the highest in customer satisfaction, a testament to the fact our offerings are helping our customers achieve their quality star ratings.
And of course, our first rate generics program, strengthened by Red Oak Sourcing, our partnership with CVS Health, continues to be a source of value for our customers, their patients and our shareholders.
For those who might question whether the entrepreneurial spirit is thriving in America, listening to these business leaders share their experiences about running a small business, while working to make their communities stronger, serves as a powerful rebuttal to that narrative.
Specialty Solutions also delivered an outstanding fiscal 2016. Building on its proven track record of growth, business not only met, but exceeded the $8 billion revenue target we shared with you for fiscal 2016.
Our Specialty Solutions group successfully completed the integration of Metro Medical, which expands our ability to serve customers in some important therapeutic areas such as rheumatology, nephrology and oncology, now and well into the future.
We're continuing to add new biopharma tools and services to our portfolio, which positions us for strong steady growth today and tomorrow.
Our work in specialty links directly to the outcomes of major scientific breakthroughs coming from the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.
Our nuclear business has regained its footing. We have moved beyond radio diagnostics and into radiopharmaceuticals, exploring the potential for new life-saving treatments for cancer patients.
The way that we are working with Bayer on the Xofigo project, their treatment for prostate cancer, integrating manufacturing to dose compounding is just one example of the cutting-edge work that we're doing in the nuclear segment.
To conclude in the Pharma segment, while the generics environment presents some near-term challenges for our pharmaceutical distribution business on a comparative basis, we feel extremely good about the way the entire segment has competed in 2016 and positive about our competitive positioning going forward.
Fiscal 2016 was a real tipping point for our Medical segment, producing exceptional results. Full year revenue from the Medical segment was up 9% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion, and we reported an increase of 6% versus FY '15 in segment profit of $457 million. These results are true testament to how we are working seamlessly and successfully with our proprietor [ph] and manufacturer partners as they seek to serve patients more efficiently with less waste to aid in delivering safer, higher quality care.
Our OptiFreight and 3PL services in our inventory management tools are delivering real and measurable results to our partners. And their considerable expansion of our Cardinal Health line of consumables drives both standardization and value. In just the last 2 years, we've added over 2,600 products to help providers with greater standardization and to source more cost-effectively.
While health care systems continue to wrestle with the evolving payment model, moving from a fee-for-service model to one that is more value-based, Cardinal Health is providing products and services to help our customers manage through these important changes. Our physician preference items strategy allows us to integrate products and services that help our partners deliver care in a cost-effective and high quality manner for their patients.
Don Casey and his team did a tremendous job closing the quarter's acquisition on time and managing the integration into Cardinal Health with discipline and a focus on the patient.
Our global cross-functional teams have been performing at a high level, and we hit our integration and performance benchmarks.
To stay on the theme of evolving payment models, we can draw a straight line between this trend and our work in discharge management and post-acute. Our solution offered through naviHealth, RightCare and Curaspan position us to help providers and payers manage the complex processes of discharge. With these tools, we can help direct patients to the optimum side of care, build the linkages to post-acute setting, and through our at Home [ph] business, supply medical products to patients in their homes, improving their health care experience. These are important solutions as the population ages and the health systems adapt.
While we are proud of the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016, we know that our health care system continues to undergo rapid transformation, and we know that changes are necessary in this new environment. First, care needs to be more coordinated, more efficient and centered around the patient. Second, our higher priority must be placed on delivering the right care at the right time, using the right evidence-based protocols and standards and in the right setting. Third, a greater focus must be placed on patient outcomes, not activity. Lastly, and certainly not insignificantly, we are seeing daily the potential for science and technology to change the health care experience.
To highlight this significant pace of change, just last week, CMS released another proposed mandatory bundled payment model for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft and surgical hip femur fracture treatment episodes in their Medicare population. Similar to the now finalized rule around comprehensive joint replacement, acute care hospitals would bear financial risk per an episode of care from an inpatient admission to 90-day-plus discharge.
Our work in physician preference items, where we can focus on an episode of care across the continuum of care, from device to inventory management to discharge management to patient follow-up, all health providers compete in an environment in which they will increasingly be compensated around that episode of care. The capabilities present at naviHealth, RightCare and Curaspan all strengthen our ability to deliver real and measurable value at a time when providers are being asked to bear more risk.
While the initiatives coming out of CMS can create some challenges for providers, we see the goal of [indiscernible] hospitals that work together with physicians and other providers towards complications to prevent hospital readmission and speed recovery as an important direction for the future of health care. We have participated directly in bundles program, and we'll continue to work very closely with providers and payers as well as CMS to do our part to best serve patients.
As we position Cardinal Health for the future, we're always looking for new ways to better serve providers and patients, while driving value for our shareholders. We enter fiscal 2017 well prepared and positioned to weather some short-term challenges, particularly around the generic pharmaceutical environment. At Cardinal Health, we are committed to exploring avenues by which we can turn the system's challenges today into breakthroughs and opportunities tomorrow. We are both realistic and optimistic about our industry and the future.
With this as a backdrop, we are providing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for FY '17 of $5.48 to $5.73, which equates to a growth rate of 5% to 9%.
Health care is ultimately about people. Every technical solution we consider, every innovation in which we invest and every team that we welcome at Cardinal Health family are all focused on the same faces, those are the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters and friends that we serve as patients. We all have a part to play to the next generation of health care. And I believe that as long as we're focused on those patients and families and our communities, we'll make the right decisions, the right investment and the right moves to be successful now and well into the future.
I'd like to thank our customers for their trust, our manufacturer partners for their shared goal of great patient care, our shareholders for their support and all of our employees for their deep commitment.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss more of our financials and our outlook for the future."

George said our team delivered another strong year of earnings growth and cash flow in fiscal '16.

George said our team delivered another strong year of earnings growth and cash flow in fiscal '16. And this just highlights the great work of our pharmaceutical, medical and corporate teams to deliver these record results for our customers and shareholders. Our proven track record of success, combined with our aspirational goals, position us to deliver meaningful, measurable value for our shareholders now and well into the future. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment, including our dependable dividend payout ratio of 30% to 35%. We also continued to aspire to a non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate over any 3-year period of 10% to 15%.
So with that additional context, I'd like to go into more detail on our fourth quarter results, then our full year highlights, and finally, a preview of our expectations for fiscal 2017, including some of our underlying assumptions. I have a lot to cover, but I'll leave plenty of time to answer all of your questions.
Please note that, with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website will be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.
Let me start by discussing the strong year-over-year financial performance our team delivered this quarter and year. You can follow along on Slides 3 through 12 in our earnings presentation.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 16% to $1.02, while non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $1.14. These results contributed to full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of nearly 20% to $4.32 and $5.24, respectively.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 14% to $31.4 billion, while full year revenue grew 19% to a record $121.5 billion. GAAP gross margin dollars grew more than 14% in the fourth quarter, and gross margin rate increased by 1 basis point, which includes a $51 million LIFO benefit that we recognized in the quarter.
Fiscal '16 GAAP gross margin dollars increased 15%, while gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points, primarily from the impact of mix as we onboarded a new mail order customer in our Pharmaceutical segment.
Non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased 11% in the fourth quarter and 15% versus the prior full year. Non-GAAP gross margin rate declined in the fourth quarter and full year by 15 and 19 basis points, respectively, again due primarily to the new customer I just mentioned.
SG&A expenses increased in the quarter and year, as we anticipated, largely as a result of our strategic acquisition, many of which George spoke about in his comments.
Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 11% and 5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter, and grew 14% and 17%, respectively, for the full fiscal year.
As anticipated, net interest and other expense increased versus the prior year's fourth quarter and year, primarily due to the debt issued in Q4 of fiscal '15.
The GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.8%. As expected, our non-GAAP ETR was lower at 37.6%. As many of you may remember, in Q4 FY '15, we had an unusually high tax rate because of increased reserves related to certain federal and state tax matters. For FY '16, full year GAAP tax rate was 37.1%, and non-GAAP ETR was 36%.
Our fourth quarter and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 327 million and 330 million, respectively.
During the fourth quarter, we pulled forward $350 million worth of share repurchases. This brought our fiscal 2016 share repurchases to about $650 million, which, combined with our differentiated dividend payout, totals $1.2 billion in cash returned to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased another $250 million of shares in July, which leaves us with $793 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
Moving on to consolidated cash flows. We generated approximately $640 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. This brought the fiscal '16 cash from operations to a record $3 billion. And we saw strong contributions from both segments, we also deployed $465 million in capital expenditures, primarily in order to refresh our existing infrastructure and support new acquisitions.
Overall, we ended June 30 with a strong balance sheet, with cash and liquid investments of approximately $2.6 billion, of which $475 million were held internationally.
Outstanding working capital management by our teams resulted in this strong year-end cash position, and average net working capital days improved by more than a day.
Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. You can refer to Slides 6 and 10.
Pharma segment revenue in the fourth quarter grew 14% to $28.2 billion, driven by growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers and, to a lesser extent, performance from our Specialty business.
For the year, we drove growth in existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, acquisitions and Specialty by 20% to a record $109 billion. In fact, as George mentioned, the specialty team far exceeded the revenue goal we set in fiscal '16 of $8 billion.
Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $542 million, primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions, offset by the loss of Safeway. In addition, positive contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, which includes our generics program, were offset by a reduced contribution from a specific branded manufacturer agreement.
For the year, segment profit increased 19% to $2.5 billion due to growth from existing and net new Pharma distribution customers, which includes our generics program, as well as contributions from our strategic acquisitions. This was partially offset by the typical customer repricings and, to a lesser extent, reduced contribution from the specific branded manufacturer agreement mentioned earlier.
Speaking of acquisitions, we've not only met but exceeded the goals that we set for our acquisitions of the Harvard Drug group and Metro Medical, which is a testament to the hard work of these dedicated teams. We've now lapped both acquisitions.
Segment profit rate declined by 24 basis points for the quarter and 2 basis points for the year. This was largely due to changes in product and customer mix. Performance under our generics program, which includes Red Oak Sourcing, helped to positively offset some of the full year decline.
All in all, despite a challenging environment in Q4 with the expiration of the Safeway contract and a tougher product pricing environment, we demonstrated that we have the team and talent to still deliver outstanding performance for the year.
Let's move to Slides 7 and 11 that cover the Medical segment, which had an excellent fourth quarter.
Revenue for the quarter grew more than 12% to $3.2 billion, primarily due to acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, Cardinal Health brand products. For the year, revenue grew 9% to a record $12.4 billion, driven by contributions from acquisitions and sales growth from existing businesses. 
Fourth quarter segment profit grew more than 19% to $122 million due to acquisitions and growth in Cardinal Health brand products. Full year segment profit increased 6% to $457 million due to contributions from Cardinal Health brand products as well as the net contributions from acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by changes in the Canadian market, which affected the first half of fiscal '16 and which we've mentioned on prior calls.
Medical segment profit rate expanded by 22 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by Cardinal Health brand products, including Cordis, but declined by 12 basis points for the year, again related to the first half pressures in Canada.
Knowing you'll have some questions on Cordis, I'd like to provide more details on our progress.
Our integration team has worked hard this year and all day 1 countries are stood up in providing solutions that drive efficiency, standardization and improved patient outcomes. In fact, the Cordis team has already demonstrated measurable growth in certain geographic regions, such as Europe, which hasn't seen that type of growth in a number of years.
We continue to work on closing and standing up day 2 countries. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected variability in the margin rate between quarters as we are still working through a few intricate mechanics related to the transition service and manufacturing agreements that we have with J&J. This variability is caused by such factors as the timing of exits, the ramping up and down of certain expenses and the impact of foreign exchange. You can see that variability sequentially in the fourth quarter segment profit rate versus last quarter, where I had indicated that the Q3 segment profit rate was somewhat elevated.
As we expected, we should be fully stood up in exiting our TSA agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, while our transition manufacturing agreement will extend for a couple years longer.
Let me share a quick update on Cardinal Health China. 
Our business in China generated over $3.5 billion in revenue for the year, resulting in solid top and bottom line growth. And as many of you know, our Chinese operations serve both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, each showing significant multi-year growth.
We have 16 large-scale distribution centers and operate 29 specialized retail pharmacies in 20 of the major cities across China. The team there continues to execute well through a combination of organic and inorganic moves. And we continue to gain share in our ranking among the top 10 health care distributors in China.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you review the Q4 fiscal '16 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on Slide 8, you'll see 3 key reconciling items that are excluded from non-GAAP EPS. 
First, amortization and other acquisition-related costs accounts for $0.32 per share. Second, net litigation recoveries, which includes proceeds of approximately $68 million in pretax and antitrust settlements, accounts for $0.13. And third, as we closed fiscal '16, we reviewed and adjusted our LIFO reserves based on the actual June 30 inventory balances. This resulted in a favorable $0.10 adjustment to GAAP EPS.
So with a very strong year behind us, let me now turn to our fiscal '17 outlook and relevant underlying assumptions. From an overall perspective, there are 2 items to note about our non-GAAP guidance range. First, all of my forward-looking comments will be focused on non-GAAP, as we do not provide GAAP future guidance due to the difficulty in predicting items that we don't include in our non-GAAP EPS. And second, our guidance doesn't include the impact of the new accounting treatment for the tax effect of shareholder-based compensation. We are currently assessing whether or not we want to adopt this earlier than the required Q1 fiscal 2018 adoption date. If we do early adopt, we will keep you informed and provide you with the impact and updated guidance range.
So now let me walk you through our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year.
Starting on Slide 14. We expect high single-digit percentage growth in our consolidated company revenues. And as George stated, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to grow roughly 5% to 9% for a range of $5.48 to $5.73.
On Slide 15, we've outlined 5 corporate assumptions. First, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35% to 37%. As I've mentioned on prior calls, we only provide full year guidance on tax rates as they have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discrete items.
Second, for fiscal '17, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 324 million to 326 million. As I mentioned earlier, we already completed $250 million of share repurchases in July, which is included in this range.
Third, we expect net interest and other expense of $190 million to $205 million. 
Fourth, we continue to view reinvestment in the business as a priority to support acquisitions and growing demand. As a result, we expect capital investments to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million.
And finally, we currently assume amortization of approximately $376 million or $0.74, which includes all acquisitions closed as of June 30. Again, this is excluded from non-GAAP.
Now moving to the segment assumptions, starting with Pharma, which you'll see on Slide 16.
Beginning with revenues, we expect a high single-digit percentage increase versus the prior year. This is based on current pricing trends, contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, offset by the loss of Safeway, which impacts most of fiscal '17. We expect Pharma segment profit for the full year to be essentially flat versus fiscal '16.
While we don't normally provide quarterly guidance, Q1 is unusual. We expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range as we navigate challenging year-over-year comps. Clearly, the trends we saw this past quarter also are factored into our guidance. Of course, this will affect our company consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter. As a result, we expect consolidated non-GAAP EPS to decline by high single to low double digits year-on-year. However, we do expect Pharma segment growth to improve and performance to be back half weighted versus the prior year.
Let me provide some additional context on Pharma.
As I mentioned just now, related to revenues, we also expect the loss of Safeway to impact Pharma segment profit for the first 3 quarters of fiscal '17. As it relates to generic manufacturer drug price increases, we expect less contribution in fiscal '17 than we've experienced in fiscal '16. We are modeling generic manufacturer price inflation in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. Also, I want to point out that in last year's Q1 fiscal '16, we had several key generic items that we have previously disclosed as being unusual and significant drivers in that quarter. These items have now experienced meaningful deflation, which creates some tough comparisons to Q1. We assume brand manufacturer price inflation to be approximately 10% for the full fiscal year.
FY '17 expenses associated with modernizing our Pharma information systems to support our significant growing demand as well as acquisitions will be more than what we've had incurred in FY '16. As I said earlier, we have the team and talent in place to ensure success of this multi-year project. We expect incremental year-over-year earnings contribution from both Red Oak Sourcing and new item launches as well as measurable growth within our existing customers and new customer wins. However, that year-on-year benefit will be significantly less in fiscal '17.
Red Oak Sourcing has been and continues to be an effective and productive partnership. As we've mentioned in the past, the achievement of certain milestones would trigger the second of 2 predetermined payments beginning in fiscal '17.
Because of the excellent performance, Red Oak achieved these milestones and we'll be even making our second and final $10 million increase in our quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment will be $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.
There are 2 other business assumptions that we have embedded in our guidance for Pharma. First, we expect continued contributions from our acquisitions. For Harvard Drug, we are reaffirming our original assumption of greater than $0.20 EPS contribution to fiscal '17. And second, we expect double-digit growth in our China business and in Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions. We expect that Specialty revenue and profit growth will continue in the double digit again this fiscal year.
So again, to be clear, because of the exceptionally strong Q1 last year, smaller tailwinds from Red Oak Sourcing and launches, current pricing trends and the Safeway loss, which impacts the majority of fiscal '17, we now expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range in Q1 and essentially flat for the year.
Let's now talk about expectations and assumptions around our Medical segment for fiscal '17, which you can find on Slide 17.
We expect revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus the prior year. We also expect double-digit segment profit growth and margin rate expansion. 
Medical segment profit growth stems mainly from 3 key assumptions. First, we continue to expect great performance from Cordis, with that acquisition adding more than $0.15 to fiscal '17 versus the prior year, net of transaction-related interest expense of $0.07 to $0.08. This is a lower accretion figure than we originally provided, largely due to currency impact as well as some increased SG&A investments compared to our original business case. 
Our commitment to serving this global customer base without disruption is our highest priority. And therefore, some of the synergies originally associated with this complex acquisition will take longer to achieve than we originally modeled. Second, we expect above-market revenue growth and, therefore, solid contributions from Cardinal Health at Home. And third, we are forecasting double-digit profit growth from Cardinal Health brands.
In Q1, we began onboarding Kaiser with a dedicated customer service team. This new contract is already embedded in our assumptions as is the assumption that our Cardinal Health brand penetration will gradually increase over the course of this fiscal year.
On Slide 18, we provided an EPS bridge from our fiscal '16 finish to our fiscal '17 guidance midpoint of $5.61. Each category that you see on Slide 18 is a mix of headwinds and tailwinds, and the number associated with each category reflects the midpoint of a risk-adjusted non-GAAP EPS contribution range.
We have tried to size each of these 4 categories for you so that you better understand the components of our growth for this fiscal year. This is not something that we plan to do on a go forward basis. However, given current market dynamics, we thought it might be helpful.
As you see on Slide 19, we expect core growth of about 3% to 6%, with capital deployment adding 2% to 3%, for a total fiscal '17 estimated growth of 5% to 9% in non-GAAP EPS.
The higher end of our guidance range contemplates greater growth from the businesses as well as additional capital deployment, either through share repurchases, acquisitions or in combination.
Finally, I want to address the aspirational goals for fiscal '17 year-end that we outlined at our December 2013 Investor Day because it's important to us that we stay accountable to you, our shareholders.
At that time, we outlined 5 goals we hope to accomplish as we exited fiscal '17, and which we said will require both organic and inorganic moves. I'd like to update you on our progress toward each of these goals.
First, we targeted achieving a Pharma segment profit rate of at least 2.5%. As you know, we've grown with the addition of an important new mail order customer that helps to increase our earnings, but is dilutive to margin rates. So while this goal will be difficult to achieve, we will always pursue opportunities that are both capital efficient and overall accretive to earnings.
Second, for the Medical segment, we targeted a segment profit rate of at least 5.75%. While this may take somewhat longer to achieve, the Medical team is still committed to this target. 
Third, we stated that 45% of the segment gross profit would come from Cardinal Health brand, and we are very much on track to achieve this. 
Fourth, we set out to increase income from Cardinal Health at Home by more than 50%. We've already made significant progress toward achieving this goal. 
And fifth and finally, we said we want to deliver more than 70% of the Medical segment gross profit from a combination of Cardinal Health Brand, services and ultimate site solutions, and we are also very much on track to deliver this.
I know I just provided a lot of information for you around our assumptions. So please feel free to ask any clarifying questions. 
Allow me to briefly close by saying fiscal '16 was truly a remarkable year for Cardinal Health and our well-positioned portfolio. I'd like to recognize our team for all the work that they've done and continue to do to deliver meaningful measurable results. I am confident about our plan for fiscal '17 and look forward to the year ahead. 
I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A."

Let me do this, just in case there's other questions, I'll give you a little bit more color on the $0.55, but I'll give you also a little color on the other pieces too, just to be helpful. First of all, if you hopefully got it in color, the first 3 components: Net customer activity; generics program; and existing or remaining businesses, those numbers all represent midpoints of a guidance range -- of a range that we established for each one of these. And so just think about that there is a range for each of these. The capital deployment is essentially the bottom of the range because we've already achieved the $0.10 through the share repurchases that we've done. As far as the net customer activity, the things that are included in there would be, for instance, as you mentioned, the loss of Safeway, all of the repricings that we experienced, that we expect to experience this year in Pharma, which we expect to be at normal levels, is also well with normal medical repricings. And then impact of any other wins or losses that we would be having in customers. The generics program bucket includes the headwind we talked about with generic drug manufacturing pricing assumption. And then the tailwinds of both generic and launches and Red Oak Sourcing, which, again, while tailwinds will be less than what we experienced in '16 versus '15. And then also our assumptions around generic penetration are in there. And the final bucket, existing or remaining businesses, that would be everything else, such as Specialty China growth, Harvard, the negative impact of Pima that we talked about, et cetera. All those other things are in that bucket. So hopefully, that gave you a little bit of color."

I think the movement towards value-based care is pretty clear. I think the horse is out of the barn in that regard. Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're at early stages in it's sense. So there are certain episodes of care we're aligning on what the outcome we're looking for is, where the appropriate priority measure can be quite straightforward. There are other episodes of care where it's extremely difficult in the time horizon in terms of measuring outcomes is more difficult. So I think we have to recognize that we're in a period of mixed system where we'll be living for some period of time with traditional fee-for-service models as well as outcome or value-based models. Not every provider or every payer is completely ready to move forward on all those programs. We feel like we're well positioned to serve in any of those kinds of markets. We're extremely efficient in driving our lines of businesses, given that fee-for-service model. But we now have some tools that are enabling, particularly very large complex systems that are beginning to wrestle with these issues. We have tools that can really help them whether or not it's reducing costs through standardization in the consumables, outcome of physician preference item strategy which links the device and the services around it where they're going to be paid a set fee for an episode or the work that we're doing in post-acute and discharge management, which is really critical as you think about the amount of costs in the system post-discharge. So I think we're going to leave in a world that has both models in the short term, but we really are positioned, I think, to create value for our customers in either model. And actually, just -- they have -- our legacy lines of business in our Medical segment during the back half of the year were actually very strong. And I think, that's again a testament to the fact that we can compete effectively in either one of these financing models."

Really the difference between the $0.20 accretion we had last year and the $0.15 that we're now updating it to is mostly FX. And obviously, that's something that we can have some impact in the way we price the stuff, but it's obviously hard to control. So the biggest piece of that change really truly is FX. Why I wanted to emphasize the SG&A just a little bit was to let you know that we're incredibly committed to making sure that we do no harm to the current sales business in that as we get through our TSA agreements with J&J, that as we build up to and support it internally and then exit off of those of other agreements, we've decided to be, I've guessed to use the word conservative in the sense of managing our expenses so that we don't cause any disruption to the supply chain and do anything that would make lives for our sales guys tougher. So we feel good about this. We feel like we have really good plans to deliver. And that's also why I mentioned before that we would have some variability between quarters because in some cases, while we're ramping our expenses, we're still on the TSA.

We have more patients being discharged, in some cases more quickly. As you know, the incentives are changing a bit. We are competing very, very effectively. We are generating more flow of Cardinal brand, which is actually still in its relatively early phases of work. So I would say, as we are able to drive more of our own Cardinal brand through that channel, it actually makes us more effective. And that's a little bit of that flywheel that we've seen in other parts of the business where as we can create more product flow-through, it's more efficient for the customers which creates more volume, which allows us do that much more effectively. And so I think that's sort of the key to that business model. And we feel very good about our ability to source, drive Cardinal Health products and expand our presence in that channel."

They ended up staying very -- much higher price than we anticipated, which created a lot of extra margin on those items in Q1. Those items have subsequently deflated and so they're not creating us much margins. So that's one of the big headwinds in Q1. You also have the Safeway piece in Q1 of this year where it was a customer that was very late in its contract life that we had fully synergized in terms of Red Oak Sourcing and had penetrated essentially about 100% of the generics there. So you have those 2 big things that are there. And then as you really look forward, the team is just doing a lot of things, as I've mentioned around, focusing on penetrating current customers which is going to continue to grow us, continuing to invest in data and analytics, some of the good work we're doing on Harvard specialty, nuclear is really improving as a business. And so I think, we're going to have much better comps as we move forward over the next couple of quarters, so we would expect our second half to be much better than our first half on Pharma.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining our fourth quarter and end of the year call.
Health care is at an inflection point. The demands of an aging publishing, the challenges in public health and continued policy debates around cost, quality and access have significant implications for economies around the globe and families close to home. They require adaptive and meaningful action from our industry. The simple truth is we're experiencing the most dynamic and rapid change in the history of health care. At Cardinal Health, we are acutely aware of the need to adapt, innovate and lead.
Our teams worked hard this past year, integrating new product teams, building and acquiring additional capabilities and finding more efficient and effective ways to deliver real value, while never losing sight of the ultimate goal: serving patients and their families.
This was also a period in which I participated in the health care system in a very personal way. I lost both of my parents in these last 15 months. I had the opportunity to witness the technical skills, the dedication and the compassion of caregivers, from physicians to hospice workers, as well as the extraordinary power of science. I also had the opportunity to see how complex our system remains, how disconnected the elements of care can be and how difficult it can be for a person to retain their dignity when they need it most. Health care is, at its core, personal. This is what inspires all of us at Cardinal Health to do our work every day. Every priority we set, every strategic move that we make, we know that at the center of all of this is that patient, our mother or father, our sister or brother, our son or daughter, our friend. As I highlight our Q4 and full year performance to put the year in context, I will keep those patients at the forefront of our conversation.
Also, as I've done in past years at year-end, I'll spend a few minutes providing some commentary on the big picture for our business and our future. And then I'll turn it over to Mike who will go into further detail in the financials, our assumptions for the year ahead and our long-term aspirations.
We delivered a solid fourth quarter, closing out an outstanding fiscal 2016, thanks to the incredible hard work of our integrated teams, from Medical to Pharma to corporate.
First, revenue for the quarter was up 14% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 5% versus the prior year in non-GAAP operating earnings of $643 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 14% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.14.
For the year, we delivered strong impressive results in fiscal 2016 across the enterprise. Full year revenues were up 19% versus the prior year to a record $121.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up 17% versus the prior year to $2.9 billion, also a record. And non-GAAP earnings per share was up 20% to $5.24.
I cannot say enough about the dedication, teamwork and commitment that our more than 37,000 people demonstrated this year. This record achievement is their milestone. These results were indeed a true team effort rooted in our culture of collaboration. Both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments achieved meaningful measurable growth, while strengthening our overall competitive and strategic position. That's a result of their disciplined and determined execution, delivering the highest level of service to our customers, driving operating efficiencies, managing our rock-solid balance sheet and integrating the operations of important acquisitions.
First, let's look at the strong year our Pharmaceutical segment had. Full year revenue was up 20% versus fiscal 2015 to $109 billion, and we reported an increase of 19% versus the prior year in segment profit of $2.5 billion.
Jon Giacomin and his team spent this past year deepening their relationships with existing customers, while welcoming new ones. They successfully completed the integration of the Harvard Drug team, building on our first rate generics offering. As for existing customers, we grew our retail independent footprint over the course of the fiscal year, increasing the number of customers we serve. Two weeks ago, we hosted a record 9,300 attendees at our annual Retail Business Conference in Chicago where independent pharmacists shared their unique insights about how they serve their communities as well as the pressures they face.
As a result of this regular engagement, the Cardinal Health team has its finger on the pulse, driving meaningful relationships with our customers and working directly to help them be more efficient to drive the outcomes their patients deserve. This is how we operate, boots on the ground, understanding our customers' needs.
Throughout our Pharma business, you can see that our world-class supply tools provide patient-driven service offerings and help reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve quality for providers and the patients they serve. As an example, the Cardinal Health Pharmacy network, which includes thousands of locally owned pharmacies as members, provides comprehensive services to monitor and elevate performance, improve adherence, and manage compliance and credentialing. Our pharmacy is consistently ranked among the highest in customer satisfaction, a testament to the fact our offerings are helping our customers achieve their quality star ratings.
And of course, our first-rate generics program, strengthened by Red Oak Sourcing, our partnership with CVS Health, continues to be a source of value for our customers, their patients and our shareholders.
For those who might question whether the entrepreneurial spirit is thriving in America, listening to these business leaders share their experiences about running a small business, while working to make their communities stronger, serves as a powerful rebuttal to that narrative.
Specialty Solutions also delivered an outstanding fiscal 2016. Building on its proven track record of growth, the business not only met, but exceeded the $8 billion revenue target we shared with you for fiscal 2016.
Our Specialty Solutions group successfully completed the integration of Metro Medical, which expands our ability to serve customers in some important therapeutic areas such as rheumatology, nephrology and oncology now and well into the future.
We're continuing to add new biopharma tools and services to our portfolio, which positions us for strong steady growth today and tomorrow.
Our work in specialty links directly to the outcomes of major scientific breakthroughs coming from the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.
Our nuclear business has regained its footing. We have moved beyond radio diagnostics and into radiopharmaceuticals, exploring the potential for new lifesaving treatments for cancer patients.
The way that we are working with Bayer on the Xofigo project, their treatment for prostate cancer, integrating manufacturing to dose compounding is just one example of the cutting-edge work that we're doing in the nuclear segment.
To conclude in the Pharma segment, while the generics environment presents some near-term challenges for our pharmaceutical distribution business on a comparative basis, we feel extremely good about the way the entire segment has competed in 2016 and positive about our competitive positioning going forward.
Fiscal 2016 was a real tipping point for our Medical segment, producing exceptional results. Full year revenue from the Medical segment was up 9% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion, and we reported an increase of 6% versus FY '15 in segment profit of $457 million. These results are a true testament to how we are working seamlessly and successfully with our provider and manufacturer partners as they seek to serve patients more efficiently with less waste to aid in delivering safer, higher quality care.
Our OptiFreight and 3PL services in our inventory management tools are delivering real and measurable results to our partners. And their considerable expansion of our Cardinal Health line of consumables drives both standardization and value. In just the last 2 years, we've added over 2,600 products to help providers with greater standardization and to source more cost-effectively.
While health care systems continue to wrestle with the evolving payment model, moving from a fee-for-service model to one that is more value-based, Cardinal Health is providing products and services to help our customers manage through these important changes. Our physician preference items strategy allows us to integrate products and services that help our partners deliver care in a cost-effective and high-quality manner for their patients.
Don Casey and his team did a tremendous job closing the quarter's acquisition on time and managing the integration into Cardinal Health with discipline and a focus on the patient.
Our global cross-functional teams have been performing at a high level, and we hit our integration and performance benchmarks.
To stay on the theme of evolving payment models, we can draw a straight line between these trends and our work in discharge management and post-acute. Our solution offered through naviHealth, RightCare and Curaspan position us to help providers and payers manage the complex processes of discharge. With these tools, we can help direct patients to the optimal side of care, build the linkages to post-acute setting, and through our at Home business, supply medical products to patients in their homes, improving their health-care experience. These are important solutions as the population ages and the health system adapts.
While we are proud of the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016, we know that our health-care system continues to undergo rapid transformation, and we know that changes are necessary in this new environment. First, care needs to be more coordinated, more efficient and centered around the patient. Second, our higher priority must be placed on delivering the right care at the right time, using the right evidence-based protocols and standards and in the right setting. Third, a greater focus must be placed on patient outcomes, not activity. Lastly, but certainly not insignificantly, we are seeing daily the potential for science and technology to change the health-care experience.
To highlight this significant pace of change, just last week, CMS released another proposed mandatory bundled payment model for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft and surgical hip femur fracture treatment episodes in their Medicare population. Similar to the now finalized rule around comprehensive joint replacement, acute care hospitals would bear financial risk per an episode of care from an inpatient admission to 90-day-plus discharge.
Our work in physician preference items, where we can focus on an episode of care across the continuum of care, from device to inventory management to discharge management to patient follow-up, all health providers compete in an environment in which they will increasingly be compensated around that episode of care. The capabilities present at naviHealth, RightCare and Curaspan all strengthen our ability to deliver real and measurable value at a time when providers are being asked to bear more risk.
While the initiatives coming out of CMS can create some challenges for providers, we see the goal of rewarding hospitals that work together with physicians and other providers to avoid complications, to prevent hospital readmission and speed recovery as an important direction for the future of health care. We have participated directly in bundles program, and we'll continue to work very closely with providers and payers, as well as CMS, to do our part to best serve patients.
As we position Cardinal Health for the future, we're always looking for new ways to better serve providers and patients, while driving value for our shareholders. We enter fiscal 2017 well prepared and positioned to weather some short-term challenges, particularly around the generic pharmaceutical environment. At Cardinal Health, we are committed to exploring avenues by which we can turn the system's challenges today into breakthroughs and opportunities tomorrow. We are both realistic and optimistic about our industry and its future.
With this as a backdrop, we are providing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for FY '17 of $5.48 to $5.73, which equates to a growth rate of 5% to 9%.
Health care is ultimately about people. Every technical solution we consider, every innovation in which we invest and every team that we welcome into the Cardinal Health family are all focused on the same faces, those of the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters and friends that we serve as patients. We all have a part to play to the next generation of health care. And I believe that as long as we're focused on those patients, their families and our communities, we'll make the right decisions, the right investment and the right moves to be successful now and well into the future.
I'd like to thank our customers for their trust, our manufacturer partners for their shared goal of great patient care, our shareholders for their support and all of our employees for their deep commitment.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss more of our financials and our outlook for the future."

George said our team delivered another strong year of earnings growth and cash flow in fiscal '16. And this just highlights the great work of our pharmaceutical, medical and corporate teams to deliver these record results for our customers and shareholders. Our proven track record of success, combined with our aspirational goals, position us to deliver meaningful, measurable value for our shareholders now and well into the future. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment, including our dependable dividend payout ratio of 30% to 35%. We also continued to aspire to a non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate over any 3-year period of 10% to 15%.
So with that additional context, I'd like to go into more detail on our fourth quarter results, then our full year highlights and, finally, a preview of our expectations for fiscal 2017, including some of our underlying assumptions. I have a lot to cover, but I'll leave plenty of time to answer all of your questions.
Please note that, with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website will be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.
Let me start by discussing the strong year-over-year financial performance our team delivered this quarter and year. You can follow along on Slides 3 through 12 in our earnings presentation.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 16% to $1.02, while non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $1.14. These results contributed to full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of nearly 20% to $4.32 and $5.24, respectively.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 14% to $31.4 billion, while full year revenue grew 19% to a record $121.5 billion. GAAP gross margin dollars grew more than 14% in the fourth quarter, and gross margin rate increased by 1 basis point, which includes a $51 million LIFO benefit that we recognized in the quarter.
Fiscal '16 GAAP gross margin dollars increased 15%, while gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points, primarily from the impact of mix as we onboarded a new mail-order customer in our Pharmaceutical segment.
Non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased 11% in the fourth quarter and 15% versus the prior full year. Non-GAAP gross margin rate declined in the fourth quarter and full year by 15 and 19 basis points, respectively, again, due primarily to the new customer I just mentioned.
SG&A expenses increased in the quarter and year, as we anticipated, largely as a result of our strategic acquisition, many of which George spoke about in his comments.
Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 11% and 5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter, and grew 14% and 17%, respectively, for the full fiscal year.
As anticipated, net interest and other expense increased versus the prior year's fourth quarter and year, primarily due to the debt issued in Q4 of fiscal '15.
The GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.8%. As expected, our non-GAAP ETR was lower at 37.6%. As many of you may remember, in Q4 FY '15, we had an unusually high tax rate because of increased reserves related to certain federal and state tax matters. For FY '16, full year GAAP tax rate was 37.1% and non-GAAP ETR was 36%.
Our fourth quarter and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 327 million and 330 million, respectively.
During the fourth quarter, we pulled forward $350 million worth of share repurchases. This brought our fiscal 2016 share repurchases to about $650 million, which, combined with our differentiated dividend payouts, totals $1.2 billion in cash returned to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased another $250 million of shares in July, which leaves us with $793 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
Moving on to consolidated cash flows. We generated approximately $640 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. This brought the fiscal '16 cash from operations to a record $3 billion, a result of strong contributions from both segments, we also deployed $465 million in capital expenditures, primarily in order to refresh our existing infrastructure and support new acquisitions.
Overall, we ended June 30 with a strong balance sheet, with cash and liquid investments of approximately $2.6 billion, of which $475 million were held internationally.
Outstanding working capital management by our teams resulted in this strong year-end cash position, and average net working capital days improved by more than a day.
Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. You can refer to Slides 6 and 10.
Pharma segment revenue in the fourth quarter grew 14% to $28.2 billion, driven by growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers and, to a lesser extent, performance from our Specialty business.
For the year, we drove growth in existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, acquisitions and Specialty by 20% to a record $109 billion. In fact, as George mentioned, the specialty team far exceeded the revenue goal we set in fiscal '16 of $8 billion.
Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $542 million, primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions, offset by the loss of Safeway. In addition, positive contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, which includes our generics program, were offset by a reduced contribution from a specific branded manufacturer agreement.
For the year, segment profit increased 19% to $2.5 billion due to growth from existing and net new Pharma distribution customers, which includes our generics program, as well as contributions from our strategic acquisitions. This was partially offset by the typical customer repricings and, to a lesser extent, reduced contribution from the specific branded manufacturer agreement mentioned earlier.
Speaking of acquisitions, we've not only met but exceeded the goals that we set for our acquisitions of the Harvard Drug group and Metro Medical, which is a testament to the hard work of these dedicated teams. We've now lapped both acquisitions.
Segment profit rate declined by 24 basis points for the quarter and 2 basis points for the year. This was largely due to changes in product and customer mix. Performance under our generics program, which includes Red Oak Sourcing, helped to positively offset some of the full year decline.
All in all, despite a challenging environment in Q4 with the expiration of the Safeway contract and a tougher product pricing environment, we demonstrated that we have the team and talent to still deliver outstanding performance for the year.
Let's move to Slides 7 and 11 that cover the Medical segment, which had an excellent fourth quarter.
Revenue for the quarter grew more than 12% to $3.2 billion, primarily due to acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, Cardinal Health brand products. For the year, revenue grew 9% to a record $12.4 billion, driven by contributions from acquisitions and sales growth from existing businesses. 
Fourth quarter segment profit grew more than 19% to $122 million due to acquisitions and growth in Cardinal Health brand products. Full year segment profit increased 6% to $457 million due to contributions from Cardinal Health brand products as well as the net contributions from acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by changes in the Canadian market, which affected the first half of fiscal '16 and which we've mentioned on prior calls.
Medical segment profit rate expanded by 22 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by Cardinal Health brand products, including Cordis, but declined by 12 basis points for the year, again related to the first half pressures in Canada.
Knowing you'll have some questions on Cordis, I'd like to provide more details on our progress.
Our integration team has worked hard this year and all day 1 countries are stood up in providing solutions that drive efficiency, standardization and improved patient outcomes. In fact, the Cordis team has already demonstrated measurable growth in certain geographic regions, such as Europe, which hasn't seen that type of growth in a number of years.
We continue to work on closing and standing up day 2 countries. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected variability in the margin rate between quarters as we are still working through a few intricate mechanics related to the transitioned service and manufacturing agreements that we have with J&J. This variability is caused by such factors as the timing of exits, the ramping up and down of certain expenses and the impact of foreign exchange. You can see that variability sequentially in the fourth quarter segment profit rate versus last quarter, where I had indicated that the Q3 segment profit rate was somewhat elevated.
As we expected, we should be fully stood up in exiting our TSA agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple years longer.
Let me share a quick update on Cardinal Health China. 
Our business in China generated over $3.5 billion in revenue for the year, resulting in solid top and bottom line growth. And as many of you know, our Chinese operations serve both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, each showing significant multi-year growth.
We have 16 large-scale distribution centers and operate 29 specialized retail pharmacies in 20 of the major cities across China. The team there continues to execute well through a combination of organic and inorganic moves. And we continue to gain share in our ranking among the top 10 health-care distributors in China.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you review the Q4 fiscal '16 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on Slide 8, you'll see 3 key reconciling items that are excluded from non-GAAP EPS. 
First, amortization and other acquisition-related costs accounts for $0.32 per share. Second, net litigation recoveries, which includes proceeds of approximately $68 million in pretax and antitrust settlements, accounts for $0.13. And third, as we closed fiscal '16, we reviewed and adjusted our LIFO reserves based on the actual June 30 inventory balances. This resulted in a favorable $0.10 adjustment to GAAP EPS.
So with a very strong year behind us, let me now turn to our fiscal '17 outlook and relevant underlying assumptions. From an overall perspective, there are 2 items to note about our non-GAAP guidance range. First, all of my forward-looking comments will be focused on non-GAAP, as we do not provide GAAP future guidance due to the difficulty in predicting items that we don't include in our non-GAAP EPS. And second, our guidance doesn't include the impact of the new accounting treatment for the tax effect of shareholder-based compensation. We are currently assessing whether or not we want to adopt this earlier than the required Q1 fiscal 2018 adoption date. If we do early adopt, we will keep you informed and provide you with the impact and updated guidance range.
So now let me walk you through our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year.
Starting on Slide 14. We expect high single-digit percentage growth in our consolidated company revenues. And as George stated, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to grow roughly 5% to 9% for a range of $5.48 to $5.73.
On Slide 15, we've outlined 5 corporate assumptions. First, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35% to 37%. As I've mentioned on prior calls, we only provide full year guidance on tax rates as they have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discrete items.
Second, for fiscal '17, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 324 million to 326 million. As I mentioned earlier, we already completed $250 million of share repurchases in July, which is included in this range.
Third, we expect net interest and other expense of $190 million to $205 million. 
Fourth, we continue to view reinvestment in the business as a priority to support acquisitions and growing demand. As a result, we expect capital investments to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million.
And finally, we currently assume amortization of approximately $376 million or $0.74, which includes all acquisitions closed as of June 30. Again, this is excluded from non-GAAP.
Now moving to the segment assumptions, starting with Pharma, which you'll see on Slide 16.
Beginning with revenues, we expect a high single-digit percentage increase versus the prior year. This is based on current pricing trends, contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, offset by the loss of Safeway, which impacts most of fiscal '17. We expect Pharma segment profit for the full year to be essentially flat versus fiscal '16.
While we don't normally provide quarterly guidance, Q1 is unusual. We expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range as we navigate challenging year-over-year comps. Clearly, the trends we saw this past quarter also are factored into our guidance. Of course, this will affect our company consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter. As a result, we expect consolidated non-GAAP EPS to decline by high-single to low-double digits year-on-year. However, we do expect Pharma segment growth to improve and performance to be back half weighted versus the prior year.
Let me provide some additional context on Pharma.
As I mentioned just now, related to revenues, we also expect the loss of Safeway to impact Pharma segment profit for the first 3 quarters of fiscal '17. As it relates to generic manufacturer drug price increases, we expect less contribution in fiscal '17 than we've experienced in fiscal '16. We are modeling generic manufacturer price inflation in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. Also, I want to point out that in last year's Q1 fiscal '16, we had several key generic items that we had previously disclosed as being unusual and significant drivers in that quarter. These items have now experienced meaningful deflation, which creates some tough comparisons to Q1. We assume brand manufacturer price inflation to be approximately 10% for the full fiscal year.
FY '17 expenses associated with modernizing our Pharma information systems to support our significant growing demand as well as acquisitions will be more than what we've had incurred in FY '16. As I said earlier, we have the team and talent in place to ensure success of this multi-year project. We expect incremental year-over-year earnings contribution from both Red Oak Sourcing and new item launches as well as measurable growth within our existing customers and new customer wins. However, that year-on-year benefit will be significantly less in fiscal '17.
Red Oak Sourcing has been and continues to be an effective and productive partnership. As we've mentioned in the past, the achievement of certain milestones would trigger the second of 2 predetermined payments beginning in fiscal '17.
Because of the excellent performance, Red Oak achieved these milestones and we'll be even making our second and final $10 million increase in our quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment will be $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.
There are 2 other business assumptions that we have embedded in our guidance for Pharma. First, we expect continued contributions from our acquisitions. For Harvard Drug, we are reaffirming our original assumption of greater than $0.20 EPS contribution to fiscal '17. And second, we expect double-digit growth in our China business and in Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions. We expect that Specialty revenue and profit growth will continue in the double digits again this fiscal year.
So again, to be clear, because of the exceptionally strong Q1 last year, smaller tailwinds from Red Oak Sourcing and launches, current pricing trends and the Safeway loss, which impacts the majority of fiscal '17, we now expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range in Q1 and essentially flat for the year.
Let's now talk about expectations and assumptions around our Medical segment for fiscal '17, which you can find on Slide 17.
We expect revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus the prior year. We also expect double-digit segment profit growth and margin rate expansion. 
Medical segment profit growth stems mainly from 3 key assumptions. First, we continue to expect great performance from Cordis, with that acquisition adding more than $0.15 to fiscal '17 versus the prior year, net of transaction-related interest expense of $0.07 to $0.08. This is a lower accretion figure than we originally provided, largely due to currency impacts as well as some increased SG&A investments compared to our original business case. 
Our commitment to serving this global customer base without disruption is our highest priority. And therefore, some of the synergies originally associated with this complex acquisition will take longer to achieve than we originally modeled. Second, we expect above-market revenue growth and, therefore, solid contributions from Cardinal Health at Home. And third, we are forecasting double-digit profit growth from Cardinal Health brands.
In Q1, we began onboarding Kaiser with a dedicated customer service team. This new contract is already embedded in our assumptions as is the assumption that our Cardinal Health brand penetration will gradually increase over the course of this fiscal year.
On Slide 18, we've provided an EPS bridge from our fiscal '16 finish to our fiscal '17 guidance midpoint of $5.61. Each category that you see on Slide 18 is a mix of headwinds and tailwinds, and the number associated with each category reflects the midpoint of a risk-adjusted non-GAAP EPS contribution range.
We tried to size each of these 4 categories for you so that you better understand the components of our growth for this fiscal year. This is not something that we plan to do on a go-forward basis. However, given current market dynamics, we thought it might be helpful.
As you see on Slide 19, we expect core growth of about 3% to 6%, with capital deployment adding 2% to 3%, for a total fiscal '17 estimated growth of 5% to 9% in non-GAAP EPS.
The higher end of our guidance range contemplates greater growth from the businesses as well as additional capital deployment, either through share repurchases, acquisitions or in combination.
Finally, I want to address the aspirational goals for fiscal '17 year-end that we outlined at our December 2013 Investor Day, because it's important to us that we stay accountable to you, our shareholders.
At that time, we outlined 5 goals we hope to accomplish as we exited fiscal '17, and which we said will require both organic and inorganic moves. I'd like to update you on our progress toward each of these goals.
First, we targeted achieving a Pharma segment profit rate of at least 2.5%. As you know, we've grown with the addition of an important new mail-order customer that helps to increase our earnings, but is dilutive to margin rates. So while this goal will be difficult to achieve, we will always pursue opportunities that are both capital efficient and overall accretive to earnings.
Second, for the Medical segment, we targeted a segment profit rate of at least 5.75%. While this may take somewhat longer to achieve, the Medical team is still committed to this target. 
Third, we stated that 45% of the segment gross profit would come from Cardinal Health brand, and we are very much on track to achieve this. 
Fourth, we set out to increase income from Cardinal Health at Home by more than 50%. We've already made significant progress toward achieving this goal. 
And fifth and finally, we said we want to deliver more than 70% of the Medical segment gross profit from a combination of Cardinal Health Brand, services and alternate site solutions, and we are also very much on track to deliver this.
I know I just provided a lot of information for you around our assumptions. So please feel free to ask any clarifying questions. 
Allow me to briefly close by saying fiscal '16 was truly a remarkable year for Cardinal Health and our well-positioned portfolio. I'd like to recognize our team for all the work that they've done and continue to do to deliver meaningful, measurable results. I am confident about our plan for fiscal '17 and look forward to the year ahead. 
I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A."

Let me do this, just in case there's other questions, I'll give you a little bit more color on the $0.55, but I'll give you also a little color on the other pieces too, just to be helpful. First of all, if you hopefully got it in color, the first 3 components, net customer activity; generics program; and existing or remaining businesses, those numbers all represent midpoints of a guidance range -- of a range that we established for each one of these. And so just think about that there is a range for each of these. The capital deployment is essentially the bottom of the range because we've already achieved the $0.10 through the share repurchases that we've done. As far as the net customer activity, the things that are included in there would be, for instance, as you mentioned, the loss of Safeway, all of the repricings that we experienced, that we expect to experience this year in Pharma, which we expect to be at normal levels, is also well with normal medical repricings. And then impact of any other wins or losses that we would be having in customers. The generics program bucket includes the headwind we talked about with generic drug manufacturing pricing assumptions. And then the tailwinds of both generic and launches and Red Oak Sourcing, which, again, while tailwinds will be less than what we experienced in '16 versus '15. And then also our assumptions around generic penetration are in there.

I think the movement towards value-based care is pretty clear. I think the horse is out of the barn in that regard. Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're at early stages in this sense. So there are certain episodes of care we're aligning on what the outcome we're looking for is, where the appropriate priority measure can be quite straightforward. There are other episodes of care where it's extremely difficult in the time horizon in terms of measuring outcomes is more difficult. So I think we have to recognize that we're in a period of mixed systems, where we'll be living for some period of time with traditional fee-for-service models as well as outcome or value-based models. Not every provider or every payer is completely ready to move forward on all those programs. We feel like we're well positioned to serve in any of those kinds of markets. We're extremely efficient in driving our lines of businesses, given that fee-for-service model. But we now have some tools that are enabling, particularly very large complex systems that are beginning to wrestle with these issues. We have tools that can really help them whether or not it's reducing costs through standardization; the consumables; outcome -- a physician preference item strategy, which links the device and the services around it where they're going to be paid a set fee for an episode; or the work that we're doing in post-acute and discharge management, which is really critical as you think about the amount of costs in the system post-discharge. So I think we're going to live in a world that has both models in the short term, but we really are positioned, I think, to create value for our customers in either model. And actually, just -- since they have this, our legacy lines of business in our Medical segment during the back half of the year were actually very strong. And I think, that's again a testament to the fact that we can compete effectively in either one of these financing models."

Really the difference between the $0.20 accretion we had last year and the $0.15 that we're now updating it to is mostly FX. And obviously, that's something that we can have some impact in the way we price the stuff, but it's obviously hard to control. So the biggest piece of that change really truly is FX. Why I wanted to emphasize the SG&A just a little bit was to let you know that we're incredibly committed to making sure that we do no harm to the current sales business in that as we get through our TSA agreements with J&J, that as we build up to and support it internally and then X it off of those of other agreements, we've decided to be, I would just use the word conservative in the sense of managing our expenses so that we don't cause any disruption to the supply chain and do anything that would make lives for our sales guys tougher. So we feel good about this. We feel like we have really good plans to deliver. And that's also why I mentioned before that we would have some variability between quarters because in some cases, as we're ramping our expenses, we're still on the TSA.

There were -- if you remember back then, I mentioned there was a subset of a few specific generic items that we had anticipated would deflate on July 1 of last year, and they didn't. They ended up staying very -- much higher priced than we anticipated, which created a lot of extra margin on those items in Q1. Those items have subsequently deflated and so they're not creating us much margin. So that's one of the big headwinds in Q1. You also have the Safeway piece in Q1 of this year, where it was a customer that was very late in its contract life that we had fully synergized in terms of Red Oak Sourcing and had penetrated essentially about 100% of the generics there. So you have those 2 big things that are there. And then as you really look forward, the team is just doing a lot of things, as I've mentioned, around focusing on penetrating current customers which is going to continue to grow us, continuing to invest in data and analytics, some of the good work we're doing on Harvard specialty, nuclear is really improving as a business.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining our fourth quarter and end of the year call.
Health care is at an inflection point. The demands of an aging population, the challenges in public health and continued policy debates around cost, quality and access have significant implications for economies around the globe and families close to home. They require adaptive and meaningful action from our industry. The simple truth is we're experiencing the most dynamic and rapid change in the history of health care. At Cardinal Health, we are acutely aware of the need to adapt, innovate and lead.
Our teams worked hard this past year, integrating new product teams, building and acquiring additional capabilities and finding more efficient and effective ways to deliver real value, while never losing sight of the ultimate goal: serving patients and their families.
This was also a period in which I participated in the health care system in a very personal way. I lost both of my parents in these last 15 months. I had the opportunity to witness the technical skills, the dedication and the compassion of caregivers, from physicians to hospice workers, as well as the extraordinary power of science. I also had the opportunity to see how complex our system remains, how disconnected the elements of care can be and how difficult it can be for a person to retain their dignity when they need it most. Health care is, at its core, personal. This is what inspires all of us at Cardinal Health to do our work every day. Every priority we set, every strategic move that we make, we know that at the center of all of this is that patient, our mother or father, our sister or brother, our son or daughter, our friend. As I highlight our Q4 and full year performance to put the year in context, I will keep those patients at the forefront of our conversation.
Also, as I've done in past years at year-end, I'll spend a few minutes providing some commentary on the big picture for our business and our future. And then I'll turn it over to Mike who will go into further detail in the financials, our assumptions for the year ahead and our long-term aspirations.
We delivered a solid fourth quarter, closing out an outstanding fiscal 2016, thanks to the incredible hard work of our integrated teams, from Medical to Pharma to corporate.
First, revenue for the quarter was up 14% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 5% versus the prior year in non-GAAP operating earnings of $643 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 14% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.14.
For the year, we delivered strong impressive results in fiscal 2016 across the enterprise. Full year revenues were up 19% versus the prior year to a record $121.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up 17% versus the prior year to $2.9 billion, also a record. And non-GAAP earnings per share was up 20% to $5.24.
I cannot say enough about the dedication, teamwork and commitment that our more than 37,000 people demonstrated this year. This record achievement is their milestone. These results were indeed a true team effort rooted in our culture of collaboration. Both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments achieved meaningful measurable growth, while strengthening our overall competitive and strategic position. That's a result of their disciplined and determined execution, delivering the highest level of service to our customers, driving operating efficiencies, managing our rock-solid balance sheet and integrating the operations of important acquisitions.
First, let's look at the strong year our Pharmaceutical segment had. Full year revenue was up 20% versus fiscal 2015 to $109 billion, and we reported an increase of 19% versus the prior year in segment profit of $2.5 billion.
Jon Giacomin and his team spent this past year deepening their relationships with existing customers, while welcoming new ones. They successfully completed the integration of the Harvard Drug team, building on our first rate generics offering. As for existing customers, we grew our retail independent footprint over the course of the fiscal year, increasing the number of customers we serve. Two weeks ago, we hosted a record 9,300 attendees at our annual Retail Business Conference in Chicago where independent pharmacists shared their unique insights about how they serve their communities as well as the pressures they face.
As a result of this regular engagement, the Cardinal Health team has its finger on the pulse, driving meaningful relationships with our customers and working directly to help them be more efficient to drive the outcomes their patients deserve. This is how we operate, boots on the ground, understanding our customers' needs.
Throughout our Pharma business, you can see that our world-class supply tools provide patient-driven service offerings and help reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve quality for providers and the patients they serve. As an example, the Cardinal Health Pharmacy network, which includes thousands of locally owned pharmacies as members, provides comprehensive services to monitor and elevate performance, improve adherence, and manage compliance and credentialing. Our pharmacy is consistently ranked among the highest in customer satisfaction, a testament to the fact our offerings are helping our customers achieve their quality star ratings.
And of course, our first-rate generics program, strengthened by Red Oak Sourcing, our partnership with CVS Health, continues to be a source of value for our customers, their patients and our shareholders.
For those who might question whether the entrepreneurial spirit is thriving in America, listening to these business leaders share their experiences about running a small business, while working to make their communities stronger, serves as a powerful rebuttal to that narrative.
Specialty Solutions also delivered an outstanding fiscal 2016. Building on its proven track record of growth, the business not only met, but exceeded the $8 billion revenue target we shared with you for fiscal 2016.
Our Specialty Solutions group successfully completed the integration of Metro Medical, which expands our ability to serve customers in some important therapeutic areas such as rheumatology, nephrology and oncology now and well into the future.
We're continuing to add new biopharma tools and services to our portfolio, which positions us for strong steady growth today and tomorrow.
Our work in specialty links directly to the outcomes of major scientific breakthroughs coming from the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.
Our nuclear business has regained its footing. We have moved beyond radio diagnostics and into radiopharmaceuticals, exploring the potential for new lifesaving treatments for cancer patients.
The way that we are working with Bayer on the Xofigo project, their treatment for prostate cancer, integrating manufacturing to dose compounding is just one example of the cutting-edge work that we're doing in the nuclear segment.
To conclude in the Pharma segment, while the generics environment presents some near-term challenges for our pharmaceutical distribution business on a comparative basis, we feel extremely good about the way the entire segment has competed in 2016 and positive about our competitive positioning going forward.
Fiscal 2016 was a real tipping point for our Medical segment, producing exceptional results. Full year revenue from the Medical segment was up 9% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion, and we reported an increase of 6% versus FY '15 in segment profit of $457 million. These results are a true testament to how we are working seamlessly and successfully with our provider and manufacturer partners as they seek to serve patients more efficiently with less waste to aid in delivering safer, higher quality care.
Our OptiFreight and 3PL services in our inventory management tools are delivering real and measurable results to our partners. And their considerable expansion of our Cardinal Health line of consumables drives both standardization and value. In just the last 2 years, we've added over 2,600 products to help providers with greater standardization and to source more cost-effectively.
While health care systems continue to wrestle with the evolving payment model, moving from a fee-for-service model to one that is more value-based, Cardinal Health is providing products and services to help our customers manage through these important changes. Our physician preference items strategy allows us to integrate products and services that help our partners deliver care in a cost-effective and high-quality manner for their patients.
Don Casey and his team did a tremendous job closing the quarter's acquisition on time and managing the integration into Cardinal Health with discipline and a focus on the patient.
Our global cross-functional teams have been performing at a high level, and we hit our integration and performance benchmarks.
To stay on the theme of evolving payment models, we can draw a straight line between these trends and our work in discharge management and post-acute. Our solution offered through naviHealth, RightCare and Curaspan position us to help providers and payers manage the complex processes of discharge. With these tools, we can help direct patients to the optimal side of care, build the linkages to post-acute setting, and through our at Home business, supply medical products to patients in their homes, improving their health-care experience. These are important solutions as the population ages and the health system adapts.
While we are proud of the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016, we know that our health-care system continues to undergo rapid transformation, and we know that changes are necessary in this new environment. First, care needs to be more coordinated, more efficient and centered around the patient. Second, our higher priority must be placed on delivering the right care at the right time, using the right evidence-based protocols and standards and in the right setting. Third, a greater focus must be placed on patient outcomes, not activity. Lastly, but certainly not insignificantly, we are seeing daily the potential for science and technology to change the health-care experience.
To highlight this significant pace of change, just last week, CMS released another proposed mandatory bundled payment model for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft and surgical hip femur fracture treatment episodes in their Medicare population. Similar to the now finalized rule around comprehensive joint replacement, acute care hospitals would bear financial risk per an episode of care from an inpatient admission to 90-day-plus discharge.
Our work in physician preference items, where we can focus on an episode of care across the continuum of care, from device to inventory management to discharge management to patient follow-up, all health providers compete in an environment in which they will increasingly be compensated around that episode of care. The capabilities present at naviHealth, RightCare and Curaspan all strengthen our ability to deliver real and measurable value at a time when providers are being asked to bear more risk.
While the initiatives coming out of CMS can create some challenges for providers, we see the goal of rewarding hospitals that work together with physicians and other providers to avoid complications, to prevent hospital readmission and speed recovery as an important direction for the future of health care. We have participated directly in bundles program, and we'll continue to work very closely with providers and payers, as well as CMS, to do our part to best serve patients.
As we position Cardinal Health for the future, we're always looking for new ways to better serve providers and patients, while driving value for our shareholders. We enter fiscal 2017 well prepared and positioned to weather some short-term challenges, particularly around the generic pharmaceutical environment. At Cardinal Health, we are committed to exploring avenues by which we can turn the system's challenges today into breakthroughs and opportunities tomorrow. We are both realistic and optimistic about our industry and its future.
With this as a backdrop, we are providing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for FY '17 of $5.48 to $5.73, which equates to a growth rate of 5% to 9%.
Health care is ultimately about people. Every technical solution we consider, every innovation in which we invest and every team that we welcome into the Cardinal Health family are all focused on the same faces, those of the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters and friends that we serve as patients. We all have a part to play to the next generation of health care. And I believe that as long as we're focused on those patients, their families and our communities, we'll make the right decisions, the right investment and the right moves to be successful now and well into the future.
I'd like to thank our customers for their trust, our manufacturer partners for their shared goal of great patient care, our shareholders for their support and all of our employees for their deep commitment.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss more of our financials and our outlook for the future."

George said our team delivered another strong year of earnings growth and cash flow in fiscal '16. And this just highlights the great work of our pharmaceutical, medical and corporate teams to deliver these record results for our customers and shareholders. Our proven track record of success, combined with our aspirational goals, position us to deliver meaningful, measurable value for our shareholders now and well into the future. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment, including our dependable dividend payout ratio of 30% to 35%. We also continued to aspire to a non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate over any 3-year period of 10% to 15%.
So with that additional context, I'd like to go into more detail on our fourth quarter results, then our full year highlights and, finally, a preview of our expectations for fiscal 2017, including some of our underlying assumptions. I have a lot to cover, but I'll leave plenty of time to answer all of your questions.
Please note that, with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website will be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.
Let me start by discussing the strong year-over-year financial performance our team delivered this quarter and year. You can follow along on Slides 3 through 12 in our earnings presentation.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 16% to $1.02, while non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $1.14. These results contributed to full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of nearly 20% to $4.32 and $5.24, respectively.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 14% to $31.4 billion, while full year revenue grew 19% to a record $121.5 billion. GAAP gross margin dollars grew more than 14% in the fourth quarter, and gross margin rate increased by 1 basis point, which includes a $51 million LIFO benefit that we recognized in the quarter.
Fiscal '16 GAAP gross margin dollars increased 15%, while gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points, primarily from the impact of mix as we onboarded a new mail-order customer in our Pharmaceutical segment.
Non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased 11% in the fourth quarter and 15% versus the prior full year. Non-GAAP gross margin rate declined in the fourth quarter and full year by 15 and 19 basis points, respectively, again, due primarily to the new customer I just mentioned.
SG&A expenses increased in the quarter and year, as we anticipated, largely as a result of our strategic acquisition, many of which George spoke about in his comments.
Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 11% and 5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter, and grew 14% and 17%, respectively, for the full fiscal year.
As anticipated, net interest and other expense increased versus the prior year's fourth quarter and year, primarily due to the debt issued in Q4 of fiscal '15.
The GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.8%. As expected, our non-GAAP ETR was lower at 37.6%. As many of you may remember, in Q4 FY '15, we had an unusually high tax rate because of increased reserves related to certain federal and state tax matters. For FY '16, full year GAAP tax rate was 37.1% and non-GAAP ETR was 36%.
Our fourth quarter and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 327 million and 330 million, respectively.
During the fourth quarter, we pulled forward $350 million worth of share repurchases. This brought our fiscal 2016 share repurchases to about $650 million, which, combined with our differentiated dividend payouts, totals $1.2 billion in cash returned to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased another $250 million of shares in July, which leaves us with $793 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
Moving on to consolidated cash flows. We generated approximately $640 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. This brought the fiscal '16 cash from operations to a record $3 billion, a result of strong contributions from both segments, we also deployed $465 million in capital expenditures, primarily in order to refresh our existing infrastructure and support new acquisitions.
Overall, we ended June 30 with a strong balance sheet, with cash and liquid investments of approximately $2.6 billion, of which $475 million were held internationally.
Outstanding working capital management by our teams resulted in this strong year-end cash position, and average net working capital days improved by more than a day.
Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. You can refer to Slides 6 and 10.
Pharma segment revenue in the fourth quarter grew 14% to $28.2 billion, driven by growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers and, to a lesser extent, performance from our Specialty business.
For the year, we drove growth in existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, acquisitions and Specialty by 20% to a record $109 billion. In fact, as George mentioned, the specialty team far exceeded the revenue goal we set in fiscal '16 of $8 billion.
Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $542 million, primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions, offset by the loss of Safeway. In addition, positive contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, which includes our generics program, were offset by a reduced contribution from a specific branded manufacturer agreement.
For the year, segment profit increased 19% to $2.5 billion due to growth from existing and net new Pharma distribution customers, which includes our generics program, as well as contributions from our strategic acquisitions. This was partially offset by the typical customer repricings and, to a lesser extent, reduced contribution from the specific branded manufacturer agreement mentioned earlier.
Speaking of acquisitions, we've not only met but exceeded the goals that we set for our acquisitions of the Harvard Drug group and Metro Medical, which is a testament to the hard work of these dedicated teams. We've now lapped both acquisitions.
Segment profit rate declined by 24 basis points for the quarter and 2 basis points for the year. This was largely due to changes in product and customer mix. Performance under our generics program, which includes Red Oak Sourcing, helped to positively offset some of the full year decline.
All in all, despite a challenging environment in Q4 with the expiration of the Safeway contract and a tougher product pricing environment, we demonstrated that we have the team and talent to still deliver outstanding performance for the year.
Let's move to Slides 7 and 11 that cover the Medical segment, which had an excellent fourth quarter.
Revenue for the quarter grew more than 12% to $3.2 billion, primarily due to acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, Cardinal Health brand products. For the year, revenue grew 9% to a record $12.4 billion, driven by contributions from acquisitions and sales growth from existing businesses. 
Fourth quarter segment profit grew more than 19% to $122 million due to acquisitions and growth in Cardinal Health brand products. Full year segment profit increased 6% to $457 million due to contributions from Cardinal Health brand products as well as the net contributions from acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by changes in the Canadian market, which affected the first half of fiscal '16 and which we've mentioned on prior calls.
Medical segment profit rate expanded by 22 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by Cardinal Health brand products, including Cordis, but declined by 12 basis points for the year, again related to the first half pressures in Canada.
Knowing you'll have some questions on Cordis, I'd like to provide more details on our progress.
Our integration team has worked hard this year and all day 1 countries are stood up in providing solutions that drive efficiency, standardization and improved patient outcomes. In fact, the Cordis team has already demonstrated measurable growth in certain geographic regions, such as Europe, which hasn't seen that type of growth in a number of years.
We continue to work on closing and standing up day 2 countries. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected variability in the margin rate between quarters as we are still working through a few intricate mechanics related to the transitioned service and manufacturing agreements that we have with J&J. This variability is caused by such factors as the timing of exits, the ramping up and down of certain expenses and the impact of foreign exchange. You can see that variability sequentially in the fourth quarter segment profit rate versus last quarter, where I had indicated that the Q3 segment profit rate was somewhat elevated.
As we expected, we should be fully stood up in exiting our TSA agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple years longer.
Let me share a quick update on Cardinal Health China. 
Our business in China generated over $3.5 billion in revenue for the year, resulting in solid top and bottom line growth. And as many of you know, our Chinese operations serve both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, each showing significant multi-year growth.
We have 16 large-scale distribution centers and operate 29 specialized retail pharmacies in 20 of the major cities across China. The team there continues to execute well through a combination of organic and inorganic moves. And we continue to gain share in our ranking among the top 10 health-care distributors in China.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you review the Q4 fiscal '16 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on Slide 8, you'll see 3 key reconciling items that are excluded from non-GAAP EPS. 
First, amortization and other acquisition-related costs accounts for $0.32 per share. Second, net litigation recoveries, which includes proceeds of approximately $68 million in pretax and antitrust settlements, accounts for $0.13. And third, as we closed fiscal '16, we reviewed and adjusted our LIFO reserves based on the actual June 30 inventory balances. This resulted in a favorable $0.10 adjustment to GAAP EPS.
So with a very strong year behind us, let me now turn to our fiscal '17 outlook and relevant underlying assumptions. From an overall perspective, there are 2 items to note about our non-GAAP guidance range. First, all of my forward-looking comments will be focused on non-GAAP, as we do not provide GAAP future guidance due to the difficulty in predicting items that we don't include in our non-GAAP EPS. And second, our guidance doesn't include the impact of the new accounting treatment for the tax effect of shareholder-based compensation. We are currently assessing whether or not we want to adopt this earlier than the required Q1 fiscal 2018 adoption date. If we do early adopt, we will keep you informed and provide you with the impact and updated guidance range.
So now let me walk you through our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year.
Starting on Slide 14. We expect high single-digit percentage growth in our consolidated company revenues. And as George stated, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to grow roughly 5% to 9% for a range of $5.48 to $5.73.
On Slide 15, we've outlined 5 corporate assumptions. First, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35% to 37%. As I've mentioned on prior calls, we only provide full year guidance on tax rates as they have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discrete items.
Second, for fiscal '17, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 324 million to 326 million. As I mentioned earlier, we already completed $250 million of share repurchases in July, which is included in this range.
Third, we expect net interest and other expense of $190 million to $205 million. 
Fourth, we continue to view reinvestment in the business as a priority to support acquisitions and growing demand. As a result, we expect capital investments to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million.
And finally, we currently assume amortization of approximately $376 million or $0.74, which includes all acquisitions closed as of June 30. Again, this is excluded from non-GAAP.
Now moving to the segment assumptions, starting with Pharma, which you'll see on Slide 16.
Beginning with revenues, we expect a high single-digit percentage increase versus the prior year. This is based on current pricing trends, contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, offset by the loss of Safeway, which impacts most of fiscal '17. We expect Pharma segment profit for the full year to be essentially flat versus fiscal '16.
While we don't normally provide quarterly guidance, Q1 is unusual. We expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range as we navigate challenging year-over-year comps. Clearly, the trends we saw this past quarter also are factored into our guidance. Of course, this will affect our company consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter. As a result, we expect consolidated non-GAAP EPS to decline by high-single to low-double digits year-on-year. However, we do expect Pharma segment growth to improve and performance to be back half weighted versus the prior year.
Let me provide some additional context on Pharma.
As I mentioned just now, related to revenues, we also expect the loss of Safeway to impact Pharma segment profit for the first 3 quarters of fiscal '17. As it relates to generic manufacturer drug price increases, we expect less contribution in fiscal '17 than we've experienced in fiscal '16. We are modeling generic manufacturer price inflation in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. Also, I want to point out that in last year's Q1 fiscal '16, we had several key generic items that we had previously disclosed as being unusual and significant drivers in that quarter. These items have now experienced meaningful deflation, which creates some tough comparisons to Q1. We assume brand manufacturer price inflation to be approximately 10% for the full fiscal year.
FY '17 expenses associated with modernizing our Pharma information systems to support our significant growing demand as well as acquisitions will be more than what we've had incurred in FY '16. As I said earlier, we have the team and talent in place to ensure success of this multi-year project. We expect incremental year-over-year earnings contribution from both Red Oak Sourcing and new item launches as well as measurable growth within our existing customers and new customer wins. However, that year-on-year benefit will be significantly less in fiscal '17.
Red Oak Sourcing has been and continues to be an effective and productive partnership. As we've mentioned in the past, the achievement of certain milestones would trigger the second of 2 predetermined payments beginning in fiscal '17.
Because of the excellent performance, Red Oak achieved these milestones and we'll be even making our second and final $10 million increase in our quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment will be $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.
There are 2 other business assumptions that we have embedded in our guidance for Pharma. First, we expect continued contributions from our acquisitions. For Harvard Drug, we are reaffirming our original assumption of greater than $0.20 EPS contribution to fiscal '17. And second, we expect double-digit growth in our China business and in Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions. We expect that Specialty revenue and profit growth will continue in the double digits again this fiscal year.
So again, to be clear, because of the exceptionally strong Q1 last year, smaller tailwinds from Red Oak Sourcing and launches, current pricing trends and the Safeway loss, which impacts the majority of fiscal '17, we now expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range in Q1 and essentially flat for the year.
Let's now talk about expectations and assumptions around our Medical segment for fiscal '17, which you can find on Slide 17.
We expect revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus the prior year. We also expect double-digit segment profit growth and margin rate expansion. 
Medical segment profit growth stems mainly from 3 key assumptions. First, we continue to expect great performance from Cordis, with that acquisition adding more than $0.15 to fiscal '17 versus the prior year, net of transaction-related interest expense of $0.07 to $0.08. This is a lower accretion figure than we originally provided, largely due to currency impacts as well as some increased SG&A investments compared to our original business case. 
Our commitment to serving this global customer base without disruption is our highest priority. And therefore, some of the synergies originally associated with this complex acquisition will take longer to achieve than we originally modeled. Second, we expect above-market revenue growth and, therefore, solid contributions from Cardinal Health at Home. And third, we are forecasting double-digit profit growth from Cardinal Health brands.
In Q1, we began onboarding Kaiser with a dedicated customer service team. This new contract is already embedded in our assumptions as is the assumption that our Cardinal Health brand penetration will gradually increase over the course of this fiscal year.
On Slide 18, we've provided an EPS bridge from our fiscal '16 finish to our fiscal '17 guidance midpoint of $5.61. Each category that you see on Slide 18 is a mix of headwinds and tailwinds, and the number associated with each category reflects the midpoint of a risk-adjusted non-GAAP EPS contribution range.
We tried to size each of these 4 categories for you so that you better understand the components of our growth for this fiscal year. This is not something that we plan to do on a go-forward basis. However, given current market dynamics, we thought it might be helpful.
As you see on Slide 19, we expect core growth of about 3% to 6%, with capital deployment adding 2% to 3%, for a total fiscal '17 estimated growth of 5% to 9% in non-GAAP EPS.
The higher end of our guidance range contemplates greater growth from the businesses as well as additional capital deployment, either through share repurchases, acquisitions or in combination.
Finally, I want to address the aspirational goals for fiscal '17 year-end that we outlined at our December 2013 Investor Day, because it's important to us that we stay accountable to you, our shareholders.
At that time, we outlined 5 goals we hope to accomplish as we exited fiscal '17, and which we said will require both organic and inorganic moves. I'd like to update you on our progress toward each of these goals.
First, we targeted achieving a Pharma segment profit rate of at least 2.5%. As you know, we've grown with the addition of an important new mail-order customer that helps to increase our earnings, but is dilutive to margin rates. So while this goal will be difficult to achieve, we will always pursue opportunities that are both capital efficient and overall accretive to earnings.
Second, for the Medical segment, we targeted a segment profit rate of at least 5.75%. While this may take somewhat longer to achieve, the Medical team is still committed to this target. 
Third, we stated that 45% of the segment gross profit would come from Cardinal Health brand, and we are very much on track to achieve this. 
Fourth, we set out to increase income from Cardinal Health at Home by more than 50%. We've already made significant progress toward achieving this goal. 
And fifth and finally, we said we want to deliver more than 70% of the Medical segment gross profit from a combination of Cardinal Health Brand, services and alternate site solutions, and we are also very much on track to deliver this.
I know I just provided a lot of information for you around our assumptions. So please feel free to ask any clarifying questions. 
Allow me to briefly close by saying fiscal '16 was truly a remarkable year for Cardinal Health and our well-positioned portfolio. I'd like to recognize our team for all the work that they've done and continue to do to deliver meaningful, measurable results. I am confident about our plan for fiscal '17 and look forward to the year ahead. 
I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A."

Let me do this, just in case there's other questions, I'll give you a little bit more color on the $0.55, but I'll give you also a little color on the other pieces too, just to be helpful. First of all, if you hopefully got it in color, the first 3 components, net customer activity; generics program; and existing or remaining businesses, those numbers all represent midpoints of a guidance range -- of a range that we established for each one of these. And so just think about that there is a range for each of these. The capital deployment is essentially the bottom of the range because we've already achieved the $0.10 through the share repurchases that we've done. As far as the net customer activity, the things that are included in there would be, for instance, as you mentioned, the loss of Safeway, all of the repricings that we experienced, that we expect to experience this year in Pharma, which we expect to be at normal levels, is also well with normal medical repricings. And then impact of any other wins or losses that we would be having in customers. The generics program bucket includes the headwind we talked about with generic drug manufacturing pricing assumptions. And then the tailwinds of both generic and launches and Red Oak Sourcing, which, again, while tailwinds will be less than what we experienced in '16 versus '15. And then also our assumptions around generic penetration are in there. In the final bucket, existing or remaining businesses, that would be everything else, such as Specialty China growth, Harvard, the negative impact of Pima that we talked about, et cetera. All those other things are in that bucket. So hopefully, that gave you a little bit of color."

Are hospitals really looking to buy maybe a physician preference items within that will be used for a case, tie them to discharge planning? Is that -- my understanding is that's not really how they buy it today. How are those discussions going? And how quickly do you think we'll get there that people think of it that way?"

Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're",360,"Yes. So let me just sort of respond to it as broadly first, Charles. I think the movement towards value-based care is pretty clear. I think the horse is out of the barn in that regard. Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're at early stages in this sense. So there are certain episodes of care we're aligning on what the outcome we're looking for is, where the appropriate priority measure can be quite straightforward. There are other episodes of care where it's extremely difficult in the time horizon in terms of measuring outcomes is more difficult. So I think we have to recognize that we're in a period of mixed systems, where we'll be living for some period of time with traditional fee-for-service models as well as outcome or value-based models. Not every provider or every payer is completely ready to move forward on all those programs. We feel like we're well positioned to serve in any of those kinds of markets. We're extremely efficient in driving our lines of businesses, given that fee-for-service model. But we now have some tools that are enabling, particularly very large complex systems that are beginning to wrestle with these issues. We have tools that can really help them whether or not it's reducing costs through standardization; the consumables; outcome -- a physician preference item strategy, which links the device and the services around it where they're going to be paid a set fee for an episode; or the work that we're doing in post-acute and discharge management, which is really critical as you think about the amount of costs in the system post-discharge. So I think we're going to live in a world that has both models in the short term, but we really are positioned, I think, to create value for our customers in either model. And actually, just -- since they have this, our legacy lines of business in our Medical segment during the back half of the year were actually very strong. And I think, that's again a testament to the fact that we can compete effectively in either one of these financing models."

So whether you look at '16 through '18 or '17 through '19 or going forward, there is nothing at this time that, as we project out what we think we can do, not only with the strong position and performance of our businesses, but also with our significant and disciplined approach to capital, that we think we can still continue to deliver the 10% or the 15% non-GAAP EPS growth. And then on the dividend payout, we intend to continue to differentiate that dividend and keep our payout in that 30% to 35% range, which is again something we feel with our strong cash flow and continued earnings growth, we're going to be able to continue to do."

I will tell you, though, that remember that we mentioned a few other things related to the Pharmaceutical segment in the assumptions. So from a headwind standpoint, Safeway, as you clearly mentioned, is a headwind. Also, we have our normal repricings. Then we have the headwind from the increased expense we're going to incur this year. We specifically relate it to our pharmaceutical IT investments because we've had such significant growth in our Pharmaceutical business, including acquisitions that, that will be an important area for us. And then the generic manufacturer deflation that we've talked about, the impact on our business on that. And then, specifically, the manufacturer branded agreements that we talked a little bit. But I do want to make sure you know that PD is not shrinking. We feel really good about the strength of all of our businesses in PD, both China, Specialty and the core PD businesses. And then the tailwinds that we talked about, as I mentioned, just those -- just remember one other thing I mentioned that's important, we expect Red Oak and generic launches to continue to be tailwinds for us, but just less in '17 versus '16 than they were '16 versus '15 just because of the nature of the generic launches, there's fewer of them out there, and because we synergized Red Oak so quickly, and we had a lot of impact from it in '16. And again, it will be positive in '17, but less than it was in the previous year."

And as you've heard me say in the past, on a 15% that is contingent, we do that in a thoughtful way, working with manufacturers that we believe can still deliver a consistent type of return for us.

There were -- if you remember back then, I mentioned there was a subset of a few specific generic items that we had anticipated would deflate on July 1 of last year, and they didn't. They ended up staying very -- much higher priced than we anticipated, which created a lot of extra margin on those items in Q1. Those items have subsequently deflated and so they're not creating us much margin. So that's one of the big headwinds in Q1. You also have the Safeway piece in Q1 of this year, where it was a customer that was very late in its contract life that we had fully synergized in terms of Red Oak Sourcing and had penetrated essentially about 100% of the generics there. So you have those 2 big things that are there. And then as you really look forward, the team is just doing a lot of things, as I've mentioned, around focusing on penetrating current customers which is going to continue to grow us, continuing to invest in data and analytics, some of the good work we're doing on Harvard specialty, nuclear is really improving as a business. And so I think we're going to have much better comps as we move forward over the next couple of quarters, so we would expect our second half to be much better than our first half on Pharma. But I don't think there is anything in there. Like we don't have to pull a rabbit out of the hat or anything to get there. I think John and his team have a really great set of plans to execute and get us to where we need to be."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining our fourth quarter and end of the year call.
Health care is at an inflection point. The demands of an aging population, the challenges in public health and continued policy debates around cost, quality and access have significant implications for economies around the globe and families close to home. They require adaptive and meaningful action from our industry. The simple truth is we're experiencing the most dynamic and rapid change in the history of health care. At Cardinal Health, we are acutely aware of the need to adapt, innovate and lead.
Our teams worked hard this past year, integrating new product teams, building and acquiring additional capabilities and finding more efficient and effective ways to deliver real value, while never losing sight of the ultimate goal: serving patients and their families.
This was also a period in which I participated in the health care system in a very personal way. I lost both of my parents in these last 15 months. I had the opportunity to witness the technical skills, the dedication and the compassion of caregivers, from physicians to hospice workers, as well as the extraordinary power of science. I also had the opportunity to see how complex our system remains, how disconnected the elements of care can be and how difficult it can be for a person to retain their dignity when they need it most. Health care is, at its core, personal. This is what inspires all of us at Cardinal Health to do our work every day. Every priority we set, every strategic move that we make, we know that at the center of all of this is that patient, our mother or father, our sister or brother, our son or daughter, our friend. As I highlight our Q4 and full year performance to put the year in context, I will keep those patients at the forefront of our conversation.
Also, as I've done in past years at year-end, I'll spend a few minutes providing some commentary on the big picture for our business and our future. And then I'll turn it over to Mike who will go into further detail in the financials, our assumptions for the year ahead and our long-term aspirations.
We delivered a solid fourth quarter, closing out an outstanding fiscal 2016, thanks to the incredible hard work of our integrated teams, from Medical to Pharma to corporate.
First, revenue for the quarter was up 14% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 5% versus the prior year in non-GAAP operating earnings of $643 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 14% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.14.
For the year, we delivered strong impressive results in fiscal 2016 across the enterprise. Full year revenues were up 19% versus the prior year to a record $121.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up 17% versus the prior year to $2.9 billion, also a record. And non-GAAP earnings per share was up 20% to $5.24.
I cannot say enough about the dedication, teamwork and commitment that our more than 37,000 people demonstrated this year. This record achievement is their milestone. These results were indeed a true team effort rooted in our culture of collaboration. Both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments achieved meaningful measurable growth, while strengthening our overall competitive and strategic position. That's a result of their disciplined and determined execution, delivering the highest level of service to our customers, driving operating efficiencies, managing our rock-solid balance sheet and integrating the operations of important acquisitions.
First, let's look at the strong year our Pharmaceutical segment had. Full year revenue was up 20% versus fiscal 2015 to $109 billion, and we reported an increase of 19% versus the prior year in segment profit of $2.5 billion.
Jon Giacomin and his team spent this past year deepening their relationships with existing customers, while welcoming new ones. They successfully completed the integration of the Harvard Drug team, building on our first rate generics offering. As for existing customers, we grew our retail independent footprint over the course of the fiscal year, increasing the number of customers we serve. 2 weeks ago, we hosted a record 9,300 attendees at our annual Retail Business Conference in Chicago where independent pharmacists shared their unique insights about how they serve their communities as well as the pressures they face.
As a result of this regular engagement, the Cardinal Health team has its finger on the pulse, driving meaningful relationships with our customers and working directly to help them be more efficient to drive the outcomes their patients deserve. This is how we operate, boots on the ground, understanding our customers' needs.
Throughout our Pharma business, you can see that our world-class supply tools provide patient-driven service offerings and help reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve quality for providers and the patients they serve. As an example, the Cardinal Health Pharmacy network, which includes thousands of locally owned pharmacies as members, provides comprehensive services to monitor and elevate performance, improve adherence, and manage compliance and credentialing. Our pharmacy is consistently ranked among the highest in customer satisfaction, a testament to the fact our offerings are helping our customers achieve their quality star ratings.
And of course, our first-rate generics program, strengthened by Red Oak Sourcing, our partnership with CVS Health, continues to be a source of value for our customers, their patients and our shareholders.
For those who might question whether the entrepreneurial spirit is thriving in America, listening to these business leaders share their experiences about running a small business, while working to make their communities stronger, serves as a powerful rebuttal to that narrative.
Specialty Solutions also delivered an outstanding fiscal 2016. Building on its proven track record of growth, the business not only met, but exceeded the $8 billion revenue target we shared with you for fiscal 2016.
Our Specialty Solutions group successfully completed the integration of Metro Medical, which expands our ability to serve customers in some important therapeutic areas such as rheumatology, nephrology and oncology now and well into the future.
We're continuing to add new biopharma tools and services to our portfolio, which positions us for strong steady growth today and tomorrow.
Our work in specialty links directly to the outcomes of major scientific breakthroughs coming from the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.
Our nuclear business has regained its footing. We have moved beyond radio diagnostics and into radiopharmaceuticals, exploring the potential for new lifesaving treatments for cancer patients.
The way that we are working with Bayer on the Xofigo project, their treatment for prostate cancer, integrating manufacturing to dose compounding is just one example of the cutting-edge work that we're doing in the nuclear segment.
To conclude in the Pharma segment, while the generics environment presents some near-term challenges for our pharmaceutical distribution business on a comparative basis, we feel extremely good about the way the entire segment has competed in 2016 and positive about our competitive positioning going forward.
Fiscal 2016 was a real tipping point for our Medical segment, producing exceptional results. Full year revenue from the Medical segment was up 9% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion, and we reported an increase of 6% versus FY '15 in segment profit of $457 million. These results are a true testament to how we are working seamlessly and successfully with our provider and manufacturer partners as they seek to serve patients more efficiently with less waste to aid in delivering safer, higher quality care.
Our OptiFreight and 3PL services in our inventory management tools are delivering real and measurable results to our partners. And their considerable expansion of our Cardinal Health line of consumables drives both standardization and value. In just the last 2 years, we've added over 2,600 products to help providers with greater standardization and to source more cost-effectively.
While health care systems continue to wrestle with the evolving payment model, moving from a fee-for-service model to one that is more value-based, Cardinal Health is providing products and services to help our customers manage through these important changes. Our physician preference items strategy allows us to integrate products and services that help our partners deliver care in a cost-effective and high-quality manner for their patients.
Don Casey and his team did a tremendous job closing the quarter's acquisition on time and managing the integration into Cardinal Health with discipline and a focus on the patient.
Our global cross-functional teams have been performing at a high level, and we hit our integration and performance benchmarks.
To stay on the theme of evolving payment models, we can draw a straight line between these trends and our work in discharge management and post-acute. Our solution offered through naviHealth, RightCare and Curaspan position us to help providers and payers manage the complex processes of discharge. With these tools, we can help direct patients to the optimal side of care, build the linkages to post-acute setting, and through our at Home business, supply medical products to patients in their homes, improving their health-care experience. These are important solutions as the population ages and the health system adapts.
While we are proud of the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016, we know that our health-care system continues to undergo rapid transformation, and we know that changes are necessary in this new environment. First, care needs to be more coordinated, more efficient and centered around the patient. Second, our higher priority must be placed on delivering the right care at the right time, using the right evidence-based protocols and standards and in the right setting. Third, a greater focus must be placed on patient outcomes, not activity. Lastly, but certainly not insignificantly, we are seeing daily the potential for science and technology to change the health-care experience.
To highlight this significant pace of change, just last week, CMS released another proposed mandatory bundled payment model for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft and surgical hip femur fracture treatment episodes in their Medicare population. Similar to the now finalized rule around comprehensive joint replacement, acute care hospitals would bear financial risk per an episode of care from an inpatient admission to 90-day-plus discharge.
Our work in physician preference items, where we can focus on an episode of care across the continuum of care, from device to inventory management to discharge management to patient follow-up, all health providers compete in an environment in which they will increasingly be compensated around that episode of care. The capabilities present at naviHealth, RightCare and Curaspan all strengthen our ability to deliver real and measurable value at a time when providers are being asked to bear more risk.
While the initiatives coming out of CMS can create some challenges for providers, we see the goal of rewarding hospitals that work together with physicians and other providers to avoid complications, to prevent hospital readmission and speed recovery as an important direction for the future of health care. We have participated directly in bundles program, and we'll continue to work very closely with providers and payers, as well as CMS, to do our part to best serve patients.
As we position Cardinal Health for the future, we're always looking for new ways to better serve providers and patients, while driving value for our shareholders. We enter fiscal 2017 well prepared and positioned to weather some short-term challenges, particularly around the generic pharmaceutical environment. At Cardinal Health, we are committed to exploring avenues by which we can turn the system's challenges today into breakthroughs and opportunities tomorrow. We are both realistic and optimistic about our industry and its future.
With this as a backdrop, we are providing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for FY '17 of $5.48 to $5.73, which equates to a growth rate of 5% to 9%.
Health care is ultimately about people. Every technical solution we consider, every innovation in which we invest and every team that we welcome into the Cardinal Health family are all focused on the same faces, those of the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters and friends that we serve as patients. We all have a part to play to the next generation of health care. And I believe that as long as we're focused on those patients, their families and our communities, we'll make the right decisions, the right investment and the right moves to be successful now and well into the future.
I'd like to thank our customers for their trust, our manufacturer partners for their shared goal of great patient care, our shareholders for their support and all of our employees for their deep commitment.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss more of our financials and our outlook for the future."

George said our team delivered another strong year of earnings growth and cash flow in fiscal '16. And this just highlights the great work of our pharmaceutical, medical and corporate teams to deliver these record results for our customers and shareholders. Our proven track record of success, combined with our aspirational goals, position us to deliver meaningful, measurable value for our shareholders now and well into the future. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment, including our dependable dividend payout ratio of 30% to 35%. We also continued to aspire to a non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate over any 3-year period of 10% to 15%.
So with that additional context, I'd like to go into more detail on our fourth quarter results, then our full year highlights and, finally, a preview of our expectations for fiscal 2017, including some of our underlying assumptions. I have a lot to cover, but I'll leave plenty of time to answer all of your questions.
Please note that, with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website will be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.
Let me start by discussing the strong year-over-year financial performance our team delivered this quarter and year. You can follow along on Slides 3 through 12 in our earnings presentation.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 16% to $1.02, while non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $1.14. These results contributed to full year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of nearly 20% to $4.32 and $5.24, respectively.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 14% to $31.4 billion, while full year revenue grew 19% to a record $121.5 billion. GAAP gross margin dollars grew more than 14% in the fourth quarter, and gross margin rate increased by 1 basis point, which includes a $51 million LIFO benefit that we recognized in the quarter.
Fiscal '16 GAAP gross margin dollars increased 15%, while gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points, primarily from the impact of mix as we onboarded a new mail-order customer in our Pharmaceutical segment.
Non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased 11% in the fourth quarter and 15% versus the prior full year. Non-GAAP gross margin rate declined in the fourth quarter and full year by 15 and 19 basis points, respectively, again, due primarily to the new customer I just mentioned.
SG&A expenses increased in the quarter and year, as we anticipated, largely as a result of our strategic acquisition, many of which George spoke about in his comments.
Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 11% and 5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter, and grew 14% and 17%, respectively, for the full fiscal year.
As anticipated, net interest and other expense increased versus the prior year's fourth quarter and year, primarily due to the debt issued in Q4 of fiscal '15.
The GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.8%. As expected, our non-GAAP ETR was lower at 37.6%. As many of you may remember, in Q4 FY '15, we had an unusually high tax rate because of increased reserves related to certain federal and state tax matters. For FY '16, full year GAAP tax rate was 37.1% and non-GAAP ETR was 36%.
Our fourth quarter and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 327 million and 330 million, respectively.
During the fourth quarter, we pulled forward $350 million worth of share repurchases. This brought our fiscal 2016 share repurchases to about $650 million, which, combined with our differentiated dividend payouts, totals $1.2 billion in cash returned to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased another $250 million of shares in July, which leaves us with $793 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
Moving on to consolidated cash flows. We generated approximately $640 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. This brought the fiscal '16 cash from operations to a record $3 billion, a result of strong contributions from both segments, we also deployed $465 million in capital expenditures, primarily in order to refresh our existing infrastructure and support new acquisitions.
Overall, we ended June 30 with a strong balance sheet, with cash and liquid investments of approximately $2.6 billion, of which $475 million were held internationally.
Outstanding working capital management by our teams resulted in this strong year-end cash position, and average net working capital days improved by more than a day.
Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. You can refer to Slides 6 and 10.
Pharma segment revenue in the fourth quarter grew 14% to $28.2 billion, driven by growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers and, to a lesser extent, performance from our Specialty business.
For the year, we drove growth in existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, acquisitions and Specialty by 20% to a record $109 billion. In fact, as George mentioned, the specialty team far exceeded the revenue goal we set in fiscal '16 of $8 billion.
Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $542 million, primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions, offset by the loss of Safeway. In addition, positive contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, which includes our generics program, were offset by a reduced contribution from a specific branded manufacturer agreement.
For the year, segment profit increased 19% to $2.5 billion due to growth from existing and net new Pharma distribution customers, which includes our generics program, as well as contributions from our strategic acquisitions. This was partially offset by the typical customer repricings and, to a lesser extent, reduced contribution from the specific branded manufacturer agreement mentioned earlier.
Speaking of acquisitions, we've not only met but exceeded the goals that we set for our acquisitions of the Harvard Drug group and Metro Medical, which is a testament to the hard work of these dedicated teams. We've now lapped both acquisitions.
Segment profit rate declined by 24 basis points for the quarter and 2 basis points for the year. This was largely due to changes in product and customer mix. Performance under our generics program, which includes Red Oak Sourcing, helped to positively offset some of the full year decline.
All in all, despite a challenging environment in Q4 with the expiration of the Safeway contract and a tougher product pricing environment, we demonstrated that we have the team and talent to still deliver outstanding performance for the year.
Let's move to Slides 7 and 11 that cover the Medical segment, which had an excellent fourth quarter.
Revenue for the quarter grew more than 12% to $3.2 billion, primarily due to acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, Cardinal Health brand products. For the year, revenue grew 9% to a record $12.4 billion, driven by contributions from acquisitions and sales growth from existing businesses. 
Fourth quarter segment profit grew more than 19% to $122 million due to acquisitions and growth in Cardinal Health brand products. Full year segment profit increased 6% to $457 million due to contributions from Cardinal Health brand products as well as the net contributions from acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by changes in the Canadian market, which affected the first half of fiscal '16 and which we've mentioned on prior calls.
Medical segment profit rate expanded by 22 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by Cardinal Health brand products, including Cordis, but declined by 12 basis points for the year, again related to the first half pressures in Canada.
Knowing you'll have some questions on Cordis, I'd like to provide more details on our progress.
Our integration team has worked hard this year and all day 1 countries are stood up in providing solutions that drive efficiency, standardization and improved patient outcomes. In fact, the Cordis team has already demonstrated measurable growth in certain geographic regions, such as Europe, which hasn't seen that type of growth in a number of years.
We continue to work on closing and standing up day 2 countries. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected variability in the margin rate between quarters as we are still working through a few intricate mechanics related to the transitioned service and manufacturing agreements that we have with J&J. This variability is caused by such factors as the timing of exits, the ramping up and down of certain expenses and the impact of foreign exchange. You can see that variability sequentially in the fourth quarter segment profit rate versus last quarter, where I had indicated that the Q3 segment profit rate was somewhat elevated.
As we expected, we should be fully stood up in exiting our TSA agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple years longer.
Let me share a quick update on Cardinal Health China. 
Our business in China generated over $3.5 billion in revenue for the year, resulting in solid top and bottom line growth. And as many of you know, our Chinese operations serve both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, each showing significant multi-year growth.
We have 16 large-scale distribution centers and operate 29 specialized retail pharmacies in 20 of the major cities across China. The team there continues to execute well through a combination of organic and inorganic moves. And we continue to gain share in our ranking among the top 10 health-care distributors in China.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you review the Q4 fiscal '16 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on Slide 8, you'll see 3 key reconciling items that are excluded from non-GAAP EPS. 
First, amortization and other acquisition-related costs accounts for $0.32 per share. Second, net litigation recoveries, which includes proceeds of approximately $68 million in pretax and antitrust settlements, accounts for $0.13. And third, as we closed fiscal '16, we reviewed and adjusted our LIFO reserves based on the actual June 30 inventory balances. This resulted in a favorable $0.10 adjustment to GAAP EPS.
So with a very strong year behind us, let me now turn to our fiscal '17 outlook and relevant underlying assumptions. From an overall perspective, there are 2 items to note about our non-GAAP guidance range. First, all of my forward-looking comments will be focused on non-GAAP, as we do not provide GAAP future guidance due to the difficulty in predicting items that we don't include in our non-GAAP EPS. And second, our guidance doesn't include the impact of the new accounting treatment for the tax effect of shareholder-based compensation. We are currently assessing whether or not we want to adopt this earlier than the required Q1 fiscal 2018 adoption date. If we do early adopt, we will keep you informed and provide you with the impact and updated guidance range.
So now let me walk you through our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year.
Starting on Slide 14. We expect high single-digit percentage growth in our consolidated company revenues. And as George stated, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to grow roughly 5% to 9% for a range of $5.48 to $5.73.
On Slide 15, we've outlined 5 corporate assumptions. First, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35% to 37%. As I've mentioned on prior calls, we only provide full year guidance on tax rates as they have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discrete items.
Second, for fiscal '17, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 324 million to 326 million. As I mentioned earlier, we already completed $250 million of share repurchases in July, which is included in this range.
Third, we expect net interest and other expense of $190 million to $205 million. 
Fourth, we continue to view reinvestment in the business as a priority to support acquisitions and growing demand. As a result, we expect capital investments to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million.
And finally, we currently assume amortization of approximately $376 million or $0.74, which includes all acquisitions closed as of June 30. Again, this is excluded from non-GAAP.
Now moving to the segment assumptions, starting with Pharma, which you'll see on Slide 16.
Beginning with revenues, we expect a high single-digit percentage increase versus the prior year. This is based on current pricing trends, contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, offset by the loss of Safeway, which impacts most of fiscal '17. We expect Pharma segment profit for the full year to be essentially flat versus fiscal '16.
While we don't normally provide quarterly guidance, Q1 is unusual. We expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range as we navigate challenging year-over-year comps. Clearly, the trends we saw this past quarter also are factored into our guidance. Of course, this will affect our company consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter. As a result, we expect consolidated non-GAAP EPS to decline by high-single to low-double digits year-on-year. However, we do expect Pharma segment growth to improve and performance to be back half weighted versus the prior year.
Let me provide some additional context on Pharma.
As I mentioned just now, related to revenues, we also expect the loss of Safeway to impact Pharma segment profit for the first 3 quarters of fiscal '17. As it relates to generic manufacturer drug price increases, we expect less contribution in fiscal '17 than we've experienced in fiscal '16. We are modeling generic manufacturer price inflation in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. Also, I want to point out that in last year's Q1 fiscal '16, we had several key generic items that we had previously disclosed as being unusual and significant drivers in that quarter. These items have now experienced meaningful deflation, which creates some tough comparisons to Q1. We assume brand manufacturer price inflation to be approximately 10% for the full fiscal year.
FY '17 expenses associated with modernizing our Pharma information systems to support our significant growing demand as well as acquisitions will be more than what we've had incurred in FY '16. As I said earlier, we have the team and talent in place to ensure success of this multi-year project. We expect incremental year-over-year earnings contribution from both Red Oak Sourcing and new item launches as well as measurable growth within our existing customers and new customer wins. However, that year-on-year benefit will be significantly less in fiscal '17.
Red Oak Sourcing has been and continues to be an effective and productive partnership. As we've mentioned in the past, the achievement of certain milestones would trigger the second of 2 predetermined payments beginning in fiscal '17.
Because of the excellent performance, Red Oak achieved these milestones and we'll be even making our second and final $10 million increase in our quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment will be $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.
There are 2 other business assumptions that we have embedded in our guidance for Pharma. First, we expect continued contributions from our acquisitions. For Harvard Drug, we are reaffirming our original assumption of greater than $0.20 EPS contribution to fiscal '17. And second, we expect double-digit growth in our China business and in Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions. We expect that Specialty revenue and profit growth will continue in the double digits again this fiscal year.
So again, to be clear, because of the exceptionally strong Q1 last year, smaller tailwinds from Red Oak Sourcing and launches, current pricing trends and the Safeway loss, which impacts the majority of fiscal '17, we now expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range in Q1 and essentially flat for the year.
Let's now talk about expectations and assumptions around our Medical segment for fiscal '17, which you can find on Slide 17.
We expect revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus the prior year. We also expect double-digit segment profit growth and margin rate expansion. 
Medical segment profit growth stems mainly from 3 key assumptions. First, we continue to expect great performance from Cordis, with that acquisition adding more than $0.15 to fiscal '17 versus the prior year, net of transaction-related interest expense of $0.07 to $0.08. This is a lower accretion figure than we originally provided, largely due to currency impacts as well as some increased SG&A investments compared to our original business case. 
Our commitment to serving this global customer base without disruption is our highest priority. And therefore, some of the synergies originally associated with this complex acquisition will take longer to achieve than we originally modeled. Second, we expect above-market revenue growth and, therefore, solid contributions from Cardinal Health at Home. And third, we are forecasting double-digit profit growth from Cardinal Health brands.
In Q1, we began onboarding Kaiser with a dedicated customer service team. This new contract is already embedded in our assumptions as is the assumption that our Cardinal Health brand penetration will gradually increase over the course of this fiscal year.
On Slide 18, we've provided an EPS bridge from our fiscal '16 finish to our fiscal '17 guidance midpoint of $5.61. Each category that you see on Slide 18 is a mix of headwinds and tailwinds, and the number associated with each category reflects the midpoint of a risk-adjusted non-GAAP EPS contribution range.
We tried to size each of these 4 categories for you so that you better understand the components of our growth for this fiscal year. This is not something that we plan to do on a go-forward basis. However, given current market dynamics, we thought it might be helpful.
As you see on Slide 19, we expect core growth of about 3% to 6%, with capital deployment adding 2% to 3%, for a total fiscal '17 estimated growth of 5% to 9% in non-GAAP EPS.
The higher end of our guidance range contemplates greater growth from the businesses as well as additional capital deployment, either through share repurchases, acquisitions or in combination.
Finally, I want to address the aspirational goals for fiscal '17 year-end that we outlined at our December 2013 Investor Day, because it's important to us that we stay accountable to you, our shareholders.
At that time, we outlined 5 goals we hope to accomplish as we exited fiscal '17, and which we said will require both organic and inorganic moves. I'd like to update you on our progress toward each of these goals.
First, we targeted achieving a Pharma segment profit rate of at least 2.5%. As you know, we've grown with the addition of an important new mail-order customer that helps to increase our earnings, but is dilutive to margin rates. So while this goal will be difficult to achieve, we will always pursue opportunities that are both capital efficient and overall accretive to earnings.
Second, for the Medical segment, we targeted a segment profit rate of at least 5.75%. While this may take somewhat longer to achieve, the Medical team is still committed to this target. 
Third, we stated that 45% of the segment gross profit would come from Cardinal Health brand, and we are very much on track to achieve this. 
Fourth, we set out to increase income from Cardinal Health at Home by more than 50%. We've already made significant progress toward achieving this goal. 
And fifth and finally, we said we want to deliver more than 70% of the Medical segment gross profit from a combination of Cardinal Health Brand, services and alternate site solutions, and we are also very much on track to deliver this.
I know I just provided a lot of information for you around our assumptions. So please feel free to ask any clarifying questions. 
Allow me to briefly close by saying fiscal '16 was truly a remarkable year for Cardinal Health and our well-positioned portfolio. I'd like to recognize our team for all the work that they've done and continue to do to deliver meaningful, measurable results. I am confident about our plan for fiscal '17 and look forward to the year ahead. 
I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A."

Let me do this, just in case there's other questions, I'll give you a little bit more color on the $0.55, but I'll give you also a little color on the other pieces too, just to be helpful. First of all, if you hopefully got it in color, the first 3 components, net customer activity; generics program; and existing or remaining businesses, those numbers all represent midpoints of a guidance range -- of a range that we established for each one of these. And so just think about that there is a range for each of these. The capital deployment is essentially the bottom of the range because we've already achieved the $0.10 through the share repurchases that we've done. As far as the net customer activity, the things that are included in there would be, for instance, as you mentioned, the loss of Safeway, all of the repricings that we experienced, that we expect to experience this year in Pharma, which we expect to be at normal levels, is also well with normal medical repricings. And then impact of any other wins or losses that we would be having in customers. The generics program bucket includes the headwind we talked about with generic drug manufacturing pricing assumptions. And then the tailwinds of both generic and launches and Red Oak Sourcing, which, again, while tailwinds will be less than what we experienced in '16 versus '15. And then also our assumptions around generic penetration are in there. In the final bucket, existing or remaining businesses, that would be everything else, such as Specialty China growth, Harvard, the negative impact of Pima that we talked about, et cetera. All those other things are in that bucket. So hopefully, that gave you a little bit of color."

So let me just sort of respond to it as broadly first, Charles. I think the movement towards value-based care is pretty clear. I think the horse is out of the barn in that regard. Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're",360,"Yes. So let me just sort of respond to it as broadly first, Charles. I think the movement towards value-based care is pretty clear. I think the horse is out of the barn in that regard. Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're at early stages in this sense. So there are certain episodes of care we're aligning on what the outcome we're looking for is, where the appropriate priority measure can be quite straightforward. There are other episodes of care where it's extremely difficult in the time horizon in terms of measuring outcomes is more difficult. So I think we have to recognize that we're in a period of mixed systems, where we'll be living for some period of time with traditional fee-for-service models as well as outcome or value-based models. Not every provider or every payer is completely ready to move forward on all those programs. We feel like we're well positioned to serve in any of those kinds of markets. We're extremely efficient in driving our lines of businesses, given that fee-for-service model. But we now have some tools that are enabling, particularly very large complex systems that are beginning to wrestle with these issues. We have tools that can really help them whether or not it's reducing costs through standardization; the consumables; outcome -- a physician preference item strategy, which links the device and the services around it where they're going to be paid a set fee for an episode; or the work that we're doing in post-acute and discharge management, which is really critical as you think about the amount of costs in the system post-discharge. So I think we're going to live in a world that has both models in the short term, but we really are positioned, I think, to create value for our customers in either model. And actually, just -- since they have this, our legacy lines of business in our Medical segment during the back half of the year were actually very strong. And I think, that's again a testament to the fact that we can compete effectively in either one of these financing models."

We've got all of the key employees, management team, sales folks in place. Things are going incredibly well. So just a couple of quick things to know. Really the difference between the $0.20 accretion we had last year and the $0.15 that we're now updating it to is mostly FX. And obviously, that's something that we can have some impact in the way we price the stuff, but it's obviously hard to control. So the biggest piece of that change really truly is FX. Why I wanted to emphasize the SG&A just a little bit was to let you know that we're incredibly committed to making sure that we do no harm to the current sales business in that as we get through our TSA agreements with J&J, that as we build up to and support it internally and then ex it off of those of other agreements, we've decided to be, I would just use the word conservative in the sense of managing our expenses so that we don't cause any disruption to the supply chain and do anything that would make lives for our sales guys tougher. So we feel good about this. We feel like we have really good plans to deliver. And that's also why I mentioned before that we would have some variability between quarters because in some cases, as we're ramping our expenses, we're still on the TSA. So we kind of have slightly doubled expenses in certain periods as we then walk off the TSAs as we move country to country."

First of all, remember, a big reason for that Q1 decline is really how incredibly strong Q1 of '16 was. There were -- if you remember back then, I mentioned there was a subset of a few specific generic items that we had anticipated would deflate on July 1 of last year, and they didn't. They ended up staying very -- much higher priced than we anticipated, which created a lot of extra margin on those items in Q1. Those items have subsequently deflated and so they're not creating us much margin. So that's one of the big headwinds in Q1. You also have the Safeway piece in Q1 of this year, where it was a customer that was very late in its contract life that we had fully synergized in terms of Red Oak Sourcing and had penetrated essentially about 100% of the generics there. So you have those 2 big things that are there. And then as you really look forward, the team is just doing a lot of things, as I've mentioned, around focusing on penetrating current customers which is going to continue to grow us, continuing to invest in data and analytics, some of the good work we're doing on Harvard specialty, nuclear is really improving as a business. And so I think we're going to have much better comps as we move forward over the next couple of quarters, so we would expect our second half to be much better than our first half on Pharma. But I don't think there is anything in there. Like we don't have to pull a rabbit out of the hat or anything to get there. I think John and his team have a really great set of plans to execute and get us to where we need to be."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Allow me to start by being direct. Our first quarter of fiscal 2017 certainly had its share of challenges, but it came in much as we suggested to you that it would, with healthy and growing revenues up 14% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating earnings down 9% versus the first quarter of last year. I'll focus my commentary on the broad outlook for our business and our future, and Mike will walk you through our financials for the quarter with more detail and specificity.
Let me frame the start to our fiscal year with 2 lenses: one, the operating performance of our integrated business lines; and the other, the environment in which we compete. 
Our teams continue to demonstrate their commitment to strong operating performance. Our service levels are extremely high. We are experiencing very high rates of customer retention. And our enterprise-wide customer reach is expanding, including the on-boarding of some very strategically important customers in the Med segment.
We also continue to launch new products and service offerings, increasing our value to our customers as they navigate significant change in the industry. And as is embedded in our DNA, we are taking a disciplined and determined approach to managing our working capital. But make no mistake, this is a very challenging near-term environment. This is particularly true for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business.
The public discourse around drug pricing has, at least for the moment, had a significant impact on the way pharmaceutical companies are pricing their products on both the branded and generic side. Combining this with limited generic product launches and significant reimbursement pressure on our customers, the competitive intensity has increased. As a result, price erosion during the period has been more pronounced than it has been in quite some time for our industry.
Our commitment has been and will continue to be to providing world-class service, tools, technology and solutions to help our customers thrive in a challenging environment and better serve their patients. This is central to our value proposition. At the same time that our retail pharmacy customers are experiencing unique dynamics, we are also working closely with our large integrated system customers to help them adapt to a changing environment, one where pressures to be efficient or relentless with the configuration of their own businesses and portfolios are more complex, and where the need to operate across their own internal boundaries is a high priority. As a result, the historically silo-ed[ph] or departmentally driven operating model is evolving to one that places a premium on operating coordination across the system and strategic alignment with other health care players who can enable their strategies. This is who we are. Our focus is on finding more efficient and effective ways to create real value for our customers across our lines of business. 
Today, our customers look to us for our integrated solutions to help them reduce cost, increase efficiency and improve quality. All of this requires deep, multidisciplinary health care expertise and real strategic partnership, which we deliver every day for those we serve. These are the characteristics at the moment. Some very encouraging, others creating short-term headwind. Of course, I'd like some of that to be different, but this is the environment in which we must compete now. We will play for the long game, with a strategic eye in the future, mobilizing the best talent and building the right lines of business to help our customers compete in this changing world.
With this as backdrop, and modeling in and adjusted for the current pricing environment, we are slightly lowering our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.60 from our prior range of $5.48 to $5.73. Let me be clear. We remain committed to navigating today's challenges, embracing tomorrow's opportunities for our customers and shareholders.
Within our Pharmaceutical segment, revenue was up 14% versus the prior year to $28.8 billion, and segment profit declined 19% versus the prior year to $534 million. This was primarily driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing, reduced levels of branded inflation and the loss of Safeway, which we previously discussed.
However, the work that we have done over the past few years has strategically positioned us to more effectively support our customers. The range of our retail service offerings has never been stronger, and the Red Oak Sourcing venture with CVS Health continues to be an effective, productive and profitable partnership. We see this as a long-term driver of value for us and our customers. 
Our Specialty Solutions group continues to perform well, driven by both our provider facing and biopharma offerings, once again showing strong double-digit growth. We are confident that our growing portfolio of service -- services is well aligned with and valuable to the strategies of our biopharmaceutical partners. I want to thank Jon Giacomin and his Pharma segment team for their commitment to navigating this challenging dynamics and remaining focused on our customers with the clear eye towards managing efficiency.
Our Medical segment had a strong first quarter across multiple dimensions. First, revenues for the Medical segment were up 12% versus the prior year to $3.3 billion. Second, segment profit was up 26% versus the prior year to $127 million. And third, our Medical segment customer base has been expanding, a testament to the value we created across our lines of business and the strong partnerships we developed with our customers. Every day, we serve customers focusing more on the total care of the patient, and they recognize the growing shift to value-based reimbursement models. Discussions with our customers reinforce that they are looking to us as a broad-based integrated solutions provider and a source of expertise across the continuum of care.
Our Cardinal Health brand of products continue to be a driver of growth for this segment as we increase our account penetration, and growth in our strategic accounts is outpacing the market. During the quarter, we onboarded a large complex customer in our Medical segment. We learned a lot from this rapid deployment, and we are very grateful both to our employees and to our new partner for working together to move us towards the finish line.
October 2 marked the year since we closed the Cordis acquisition. Don Casey and his team have done a tremendous job leading the integration, thoughtfully, phasing in new systems and processes and building out an important platform. The integration of Cordis has proved to be an excellent example of how we can bring together best practices across borders. We have seen over this past year that taking the time to do things right is essential to best serve our customers. 
We have also seen growth in some important markets including Europe, where we believe that taking an integrated cohesive approach to our customers will position us for a measurable growth over the long term.
Cordis is also providing us with additional partnership opportunities to build out our products, tools and services. As an example, we have signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Biosensors to bring their coronary interventional products to our customers in Europe and Japan as another offering in the bag to deliver even greater value.
While we are operating today in a tough and unique environment, we believe that we are well prepared to lead and quick to adapt by working with our customers holistically, driving our own efficiencies and delivering integrated effective solutions we developed strong partnerships with our customers. We remain committed to focusing our product lines and capabilities around the patient to position ourselves to capitalize on the changes in our industry. And to the collective drive and dedication of our 37,000 people, we'll continue to deliver meaningful results and measurable growth for our customers, patients and shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for a detailed review of the financials. Mike?"
172207,403160527,1067198,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today to discuss the first quarter. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial performance and then walk through our full year fiscal 2017 expectations. Please note that with al",1889,"Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today to discuss the first quarter. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial performance and then walk through our full year fiscal 2017 expectations. Please note that with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website should be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.
Our first quarter fiscal 2017 results were about as we expected with GAAP diluted EPS at $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS at $1.24, a 17% and 10% decrease, respectively. In our August call, I mentioned this would be due to some challenging trends and some tough year-over-year comps, particularly on some key generic items in our Pharmaceutical segment as well as discrete tax items, partially offset by strong performance in the Medical segment, and that's largely what we saw. I'll discuss both segments in greater detail later, but let me start with consolidated company results.
Revenues increased 14% year-over-year, totaling $32 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 1% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, primarily driven by strategic acquisitions. If you exclude acquisitions, SG&A was favorable for the quarter. Both consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined versus the prior year by 14% and 9%, respectively.
Moving below the operating line. Net interest and other expense was approximately $41 million in the quarter, a decrease versus the prior year. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 36.4%, which is 3.5 percentage points higher on a comparative basis, primarily due to several favorable discrete items that occurred in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35% and 37%.
Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 322 million, about 9 million shares fewer than the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to the benefit from our opportunistic share repurchases over the last 12 months, which includes $250 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. We have just under $800 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
In addition, we generated approximately $104 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. And due to efficient and effective working capital management by our teams, we ended September 30 with a strong balance sheet. Our cash balance, including short-term investments, was $2.2 billion, of which $622 million were held internationally.
Now let's move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 14% to $28.8 billion. This increase was from growth in net new and existing Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, driven mainly by the win of a previously announced large mail order customer and the impact of branded inflation. While a smaller driver, the strong performance of our specialty business also drove the revenue increase.
Despite the revenue growth, segment profit for the quarter decreased 19% to $534 million. This decrease was a result of generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, reduced levels of branded inflation as well as the previously announced loss of a large Pharmaceutical Distribution customer. This was partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing. These same factors, as well as changes in our product and customer mix, mainly the on-boarding of a previously discussed large mail order customer, reduced our segment profit rate by 76 basis points to 1.86%. As a reminder, next quarter, we will fully lap the on-boarding of this large mail order customer.
Getting back to Red Oak. As we've mentioned in the past, if it achieved certain milestones, it would trigger the second of 2 predetermined payments beginning in FY '17. Because of excellent performance, Red Oak met these milestones, so we've made our second and final $10 million increase to the quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment is $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.
Let's now go to Medical segment performance, which had a strong first quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 12% to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by contributions from our strategic acquisitions and growth from net new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased 26% to $127 million during the quarter due to contributions from acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products. Segment profit margin rate increased 42 basis points in the quarter to 3.87%, driven by acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products, partially offset by the change in customer mix. This change primarily comes from the accelerated on-boarding of a new large medical distribution customer. The recent wins in the Medical segment on the distribution side are exciting and very important. They add to our profitability, but are dilutive to our Medical segment margin rates.
Specific to Cordis, it continues to meet our performance expectations and make real and measurable progress. As we mentioned last quarter, our integration team is on track to have our operations fully stood up and exit the TSA agreements by the end of this fiscal year, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple of years. Until we exit these TSAs, they can create some variability in our segment profit rate, although this quarter, it was about on track. 
Overall, our team has done an outstanding job driving strong, healthy growth in the Medical segment.
Before moving to our fiscal year '17 outlook, you can turn to Slide #7 where you'll see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter. The $0.28 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.
Next, I'd like to discuss our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings guidance range and assumptions. But before doing that, let me comment on Q2. While we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, we want to keep you informed when there are meaningful shifts. So as it relates to the second quarter, the generic pricing environment and, to a lesser extent, the brand inflation rates lead us to now expect the second quarter fiscal 2017 Pharma segment profit decline to be relatively in line with the first quarter on a percentage basis.
Now you can follow along, starting on Slide 9 of the presentation. As George mentioned earlier, based on Q1 actuals, second quarter expectations and trends we noted, we are slightly lowering our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range we provided in August to $5.40 to $5.60 from $5.48 to $5.73. Let me give you some color around these adjustments by walking through our corporate and segment assumptions.
Turning to Slide 10. All but 2 of our fiscal year 2017 corporate assumptions remain unchanged. First, we have updated our weighted average shares outstanding assumption to 320 million to 322 million shares, which is lower than the initial range provided of 324 million to 326 million shares. This new range reflects potential additional repurchases. Second, our assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization increased to approximately 385 million or about $0.79 per share that does not affect our non-GAAP earnings.
On Slide 11, there are 3 updates to our full year Pharmaceutical segment assumptions that I would like to take a minute to highlight. First, we previously expected Pharma segment profit for FY '17 to be essentially flat. We now expect full year segment profit to be down mid- to high single digits versus the prior year due to the generic pharmaceutical pricing environment and, while much less of an impact, lower-than-anticipated brand pharmaceutical inflation. To clarify, when we refer to generic drug pricing, we are referring to a combination of all factors affecting generic selling price, such as manufacturer inflation and deflation and customer pricing. We now expect this to be in the mid- to high single-digit deflation for the full fiscal year. Lastly, we have adjusted our brand manufacturer inflation assumptions to a range of 7% to 9% from approximately 10%. Overall, we still expect Pharma segment profit to be back half weighted.
Now turning to the Medical segment. All of our fiscal year 2017 Medical segment assumptions remain on target and unchanged. We are still on track to achieve mid-single digit percentage growth in revenue and double-digit growth in segment profit.
Now turning back to overall company guidance. Since we are slightly lowering our overall fiscal 2017 earnings guidance range to 3% to 7% growth from 5% to 9% growth versus the prior year, we've updated some of our original assumptions to achieve that growth on Slide 13. The line titled Business Growth is now assumed to be flat to 3% and capital deployment is now assumed to contribute 3% to 4% for the year. 
From a corporate standpoint, we are focused on expense management and other actions to achieve these results. Keep in mind that the benefits related to these important items are held at the corporate level and not reflected at the segment level. And while we aren't providing the EPS bridge slide we presented on our August Q4 call, you can infer that based on my comments about the generic pricing environment being more challenging, it would result in a decrease to that line item, while increasing our capital deployment assumptions would result in an increase to that line item. Yet customer activity remains about the same, but our existing or remaining businesses bucket would increase as it includes the corporate actions I just referenced.
Additionally, we told you on our fourth quarter call that we were assessing the timing of the adoption of new accounting treatment for the tax effect of share-based compensation. Our 2017 guidance does not include this as we believe it is simpler to adopt the new treatment in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 according to the required schedule. So as you can see, we've now aligned our guidance range given the current pricing environment I just described.
To close, let me highlight a few key points before I turn to your questions. First, while we are experiencing a tough near-term environment, we continued to aspire the long -- to the long-term goals we communicated before. 
In our Pharmaceutical segment, we do see generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, branded inflation as challenges. However, we continue to see strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, continued focus on operational excellence and positive feedback from our robust customer base. In addition, Harvard Drug, Specialty and nuclear are all delivering value for our customers and our business.
On the Medical side, we've also won some important new Medical distribution customers, which should help us gain scale in sourcing and leverage our cost structure to create greater efficiencies.
In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our Cardinal Health brand products and services and above-market revenue growth in Cardinal Health at home. Finally, Cordis continues to perform well, and we are confident in both the fundamental and growth initiatives in that business. 
Overall, it was a challenging quarter, but I want to acknowledge our team for their strong execution and focus in a tough environment. I believe this excellent execution and focus, combined with our broad portfolio and balanced capital deployment, will allow us to drive long-term sustainable growth.
And with that, operator, let's begin our Q&A."

And here is my perspective. There are -- as I mentioned, there were a number of factors coming together to make this a bit of a unique moment, so we're not going to overreact to that moment. Our position, our plans for growth really aren't different than -- today than they were 6 months ago. Our value proposition is very clear. We're an extraordinary attentive partner to our customers. We have a unique ability to follow the patient across the continuum of care. The service offerings are intensive.

Overall, it looks like the range is coming down by $0.11 at the midpoint. You talked a lot about generic inflation getting a little bit worse than previously thought and then modestly less branded inflation. But if I look at the guidance for the Pharma segment specifically, it seems like that take down in what you're assuming around profit margins there or overall profits there, mid- to high single digits, would actually indicate something more in the $0.25 to $0.40 headwind. So just trying to square those 2 things relative to the overall amount coming down compared to what you're suggesting is going on with the Pharma segment for the rest of the year."

Let me hit a few different things. I think, first of all, just to be clear, when we talked -- when I was talking about generic pharmaceutical pricing, I wasn't really talking about the headwind, tailwind you used to hear over the last couple of years of inflation and deflation on generic products because that's about where we model it to be this year. We're not really seeing that. We expected it to be a net deflation environment, and that's what we're seeing, so that's not really the driver. What we're talking about is more the downstream pricing component of our generic pricing. That's where we're seeing an uptick in competitiveness or a little more erosion than we had expected to be, and that's really is the main driver of us taking down our Pharmaceutical Distribution numbers. And as I mentioned a couple of times, to a lesser extent, brand inflation, so we had said about 10% before on brand inflation. We're now modeling in the 7% to 9%. That impact -- I guess, I will put it this way. If that were the only thing going on this year, then it wouldn't -- we probably wouldn't be adjusting guidance. It's more of the combination of the generic pricing and then that on top of that. But I think that's the first thing I want to say. The second thing, I can understand why you have -- maybe have a little trouble with your numbers. I can't quote exactly or comment on exactly what the number should be. But remember, I did make a comment in here that we have some significant initiatives around expenses and other initiatives that will be captured in our corporate numbers. And so those aren't going to show up in the segment numbers because we don't push those down at the end of the year. So probably, the piece that you're missing as you try to reconcile having Pharma down, capital deployment up midpoint down, the last bucket that you're missing is that the corporate numbers, we're going to have savings there that will be in the overall corporate bucket."

As you can imagine, when you're in a challenging environment like that, everyone, whether you're in P, M or corporate, it's focused on expense control and making sure we're very diligent on those types of things. And so we have that benefit. As I mentioned, Medical is continuing to do very well. We expect them to have a very good year. And they are going -- moving along as planned. So I do think our broad portfolio of having Medical being able to drive some initiatives at a corporate level, which are going to show up at the end of the year, as well as some of the other parts of Pharma, are what we'll be able to use. And using our balance sheet, too, from a capital deployment standpoint through M&A and stock repo is how we're going to continue to manage the rest of the year."

Second of all, I think you hit on something, which is customer repricings. And we didn't have very few -- we have basically a very few major repricings this year. And obviously, over the next couple of years, we don't have a ton of those. We're in pretty good shape, particularly with some of our larger customers. And I think that may be a different thing as where we're seeing some of our competitors may or may not have more large repricings with some of their customers, which can impact each one of us in different timing within the years. And so I think it really gets back to mix of customers, timing of repricings.

But on the flip side, because we do have so many contacts into the independent and the regional chain space with our telemarketing business, it gives us a lot of competitive intel on what market price is and we stay very focused to trying to make sure that we're pricing at that market price and not trying to do anything outside of that because we believe we have a great service offering that we don't need to price below market in order to win and compete effectively."

Obviously, I've been doing this as is Mike for quite some time. We've lived through multiple cycles for me and multiple parts in the industry. You see these periods. I mentioned that this is a bit of a unique moment. You've got all of the public discourse around healthier side in Pharma cont [ph]. It's loud and it's emotional. And at the same time, health care is going through some changes. So I don't think it's shocking that there are some near-term disturbance. Experience -- my experience tells me that, over time, you see some shifting out and just essentially settling of the dust. Sometimes, when aggressive moves don't result in a much change or a value creation, then things just sort of stabilize. And so we've lived through different cycles in the past, and that's what I would expect here. For us, again, the important thing is for us is to be creating new value sources for our customers and our manufacturer partners. And we work -- you've heard the positioning that we've had over these last 7 or 8 years. It's really been about broad value creation, and we'll continue to focus on that as our priority. And I think, ultimately, the reason that our business has been improving in recent years is, essentially, they build and create value. And so we'll continue to focus on those dynamics. But we have seen occasionally these kinds of cycles, for me over, unfortunately, many decades in different parts of the industry. So that's my general point of view."

Again, I would tell you that when it comes to the deployment of capital, we would love to find great M&A targets. That's probably where we would lean over stock repo. But we're going to stay disciplined. If we can't find the right target at the right price and it has the right culture that fits into our business, then we're not going to move forward. And if that means there is some excess cash on the balance sheet, then we will take a look at deploying that in the stock repo. So I think our pipeline is still decent right now. As you can imagine, we look at dozens of items before we ever purchase one. And so it's always hard to tell exactly when something might come out of that. But we continue to be very active in the M&A front, but won't trap cash on the balance sheet either if we can't find the right opportunities."

We did have $0.08 last year that we called out a favorability largely from benefits related to certain competitive dynamics on a few key generic items that we thought we're going to deflate last year that didn't and they stayed up. And since then, they have deflated. And then, as you mentioned, $0.03 on accelerated integration of some acquisitions. So those were favorable items last year as well as from an overall basis. Remember, we had a favorable tax component last year, too. And then in last year, we did see in the first quarter branded inflation was a little higher than we had anticipated. So that's right. Those were the positive things. You also summarized accurately the generic piece. When you really break it down into 2 components, one is the manufacturing actions, which is them either raising or lowering price. We're seeing, for instance, less inventory inflation on generics. But it's really no different than we had originally anticipated. As you mentioned -- as we've mentioned in the past, FY '14 was a good year, '15 was a solid year, and then it started coming down in '16, and we kept calling down and we said we expected that to be down. And that's how we essentially budgeted and looked at it for this year. So again, we're not seeing anything real different when it comes to what the manufacturing actions are related to inflation and deflation.

I don't think there is a discrete moment of change. We're obviously in a middle of a lot of things. So the election cycle, clearly, is creating on an enormous amount of discussion and noise, which I do think has an effect on the way people behave. I do think generic cycles come in lumps, and we see that they tend to have some cyclicality. We'll see some growth coming from biosimilars, which will affect the market each -- probably each product differently. And I think, again, most times in competitive moments, you have companies just adjusting to what's working and what's not. And so that's my experience over a lot of years.

And number two, I just want to understand because the way I've historically thought about this is, is that 15% that's on a contingent basis was probably more profitable than a fee-for-service contract.

And I think what's happening is our ability to serve across that continuum of care to create value in different ways or systems the are much much more complex than they once were is important. And one of the shifts I want to describe is a little bit more of an elevation of those conversations, away from the purely departmentally driven ones into a conversation that's more broadly at the system level. I think that's playing to our strength. Now again, we have to be very strong in each of the departments. We have to be content experts, and we are still that. But I do think that the reason that we've been growing, I think, is largely that we're positioning well to adapt. And we anticipated these changes in the way that these big health systems were going to look, and I think that's been beneficial to us."

As far as what's going on back half weighted, some of it has just to do with comps and things that are going to happen in the Cordis, like branded inflation tends to always be stronger in our Q3. And we have a lot of other initiatives that we're working on that we believe will deliver value in the second half. Remember, we have the step-up in Cordis that impacted our Q2 and Q3 last year that doesn't impact our Q2 and Q3 this year. Plus, we'll have a full year of growing and getting after that business, as well as on-boarding some other customers.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Allow me to start by being direct. Our first quarter of fiscal 2017 certainly had its share of challenges, but it came in much as we suggested to you that it would, with healthy and growing revenues up 14% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating earnings down 9% versus the first quarter of last year. I'll focus my commentary on the broad outlook for our business and our future, and Mike will walk you through our financials for the quarter with more detail and specificity.
Let me frame the start to our fiscal year with 2 lenses: one, the operating performance of our integrated business lines; and the other, the environment in which we compete. 
Our teams continue to demonstrate their commitment to strong operating performance. Our service levels are extremely high. We are experiencing very high rates of customer retention. And our enterprise-wide customer reach is expanding, including the on-boarding of some very strategically important customers in the Med segment.
We also continue to launch new products and service offerings, increasing our value to our customers as they navigate significant change in the industry. And as is embedded in our DNA, we are taking a disciplined and determined approach to managing our working capital. But make no mistake, this is a very challenging near-term environment. This is particularly true for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business.
The public discourse around drug pricing has, at least for the moment, had a significant impact on the way pharmaceutical companies are pricing their products on both the branded and generic side. Combining this with limited generic product launches and significant reimbursement pressure on our customers, the competitive intensity has increased. As a result, price erosion during the period has been more pronounced than it has been in quite some time for our industry.
Our commitment has been and will continue to be to providing world-class service, tools, technology and solutions to help our customers thrive in a challenging environment and better serve their patients. This is central to our value proposition. At the same time that our retail pharmacy customers are experiencing unique dynamics, we are also working closely with our large integrated system customers to help them adapt to a changing environment, one where pressure is to be efficient or relentless, where the configuration of their own businesses and portfolios are more complex and where the need to operate across their own internal boundaries is a high priority. As a result, the historically siloed or departmentally driven operating model is evolving to one that places a premium on operating coordination across the system and strategic alignment with other health care players who can enable their strategies. This is who we are. Our focus is on finding more efficient and effective ways to create real value for our customers across our lines of business. 
Today, our customers look to us for our integrated solutions to help them reduce cost, increase efficiency and improve quality. All of this requires deep, multidisciplinary health care expertise and real strategic partnership, which we deliver every day for those we serve. These are the characteristics at the moment. Some very encouraging, others creating short-term headwind. Of course, I'd like some of that to be different, but this is the environment in which we must compete now. We will play for the long game, with a strategic eye in the future, mobilizing the best talent and building the right lines of business to help our customers compete in this changing world.
With this as backdrop, and modeling in and adjusted for the current pricing environment, we are slightly lowering our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.60 from our prior range of $5.48 to $5.73. Let me be clear. We remain committed to navigating today's challenges, embracing tomorrow's opportunities for our customers and shareholders.
Within our Pharmaceutical segment, revenue was up 14% versus the prior year to $28.8 billion, and segment profit declined 19% versus the prior year to $534 million. This was primarily driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing, reduced levels of branded inflation and the loss of Safeway, which we previously discussed.
However, the work that we have done over the past few years has strategically positioned us to more effectively support our customers. The range of our retail service offerings has never been stronger, and the Red Oak Sourcing venture with CVS Health continues to be an effective, productive and profitable partnership. We see this as a long-term driver of value for us and our customers. 
Our Specialty Solutions group continues to perform well, driven by both our provider facing and biopharma offerings, once again showing strong double-digit growth. We are confident that our growing portfolio of service -- services is well aligned with and valuable to the strategies of our biopharmaceutical partners. I want to thank Jon Giacomin and his Pharma segment team for their commitment to navigating this challenging dynamics and remaining focused on our customers with the clear eye towards managing efficiency.
Our Medical segment had a strong first quarter across multiple dimensions. First, revenues for the Medical segment were up 12% versus the prior year to $3.3 billion. Second, segment profit was up 26% versus the prior year to $127 million. And third, our Medical segment customer base has been expanding, a testament to the value we created across our lines of business and the strong partnerships we developed with our customers. Every day, we serve customers focusing more on the total care of the patient, and they recognize the growing shift to value-based reimbursement models. Discussions with our customers reinforce that they are looking to us as a broad-based integrated solutions provider and a source of expertise across the continuum of care.
Our Cardinal Health brand of products continue to be a driver of growth for this segment as we increase our account penetration, and growth in our strategic accounts is outpacing the market. During the quarter, we on-boarded a large complex customer in our Medical segment. We learned a lot from this rapid deployment, and we are very grateful both to our employees and to our new partner for working together to move us towards the finish line.
October 2 marked the year since we closed the Cordis acquisition. Don Casey and his team have done a tremendous job leading the integration, thoughtfully, phasing in new systems and processes and building out an important platform. The integration of Cordis has proved to be an excellent example of how we can bring together best practices across borders. We have seen over this past year that taking the time to do things right is essential to best serve our customers. 
We have also seen growth in some important markets including Europe, where we believe that taking an integrated cohesive approach to our customers will position us for a measurable growth over the long term.
Cordis is also providing us with additional partnership opportunities to build out our products, tools and services. As an example, we have signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Biosensors to bring their coronary interventional products to our customers in Europe and Japan as another offering in the bag to deliver even greater value.
While we are operating today in a tough and unique environment, we believe that we are well prepared to lead and quick to adapt by working with our customers holistically, driving our own efficiencies and delivering integrated effective solutions we developed strong partnerships with our customers. We remain committed to focusing our product lines and capabilities around the patient to position ourselves to capitalize on the changes in our industry. And to the collective drive and dedication of our 37,000 people, we'll continue to deliver meaningful results and measurable growth for our customers, patients and shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for a detailed review of the financials. Mike?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial performance and then walk through our full year fiscal 2017 expectations. Please note that with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website should be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.
Our first quarter fiscal 2017 results were about as we expected with GAAP diluted EPS at $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS at $1.24, a 17% and 10% decrease, respectively. In our August call, I mentioned this would be due to some challenging trends and some tough year-over-year comps, particularly on some key generic items in our Pharmaceutical segment as well as discrete tax items, partially offset by strong performance in the Medical segment, and that's largely what we saw. I'll discuss both segments in greater detail later, but let me start with consolidated company results.
Revenues increased 14% year-over-year, totaling $32 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 1% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, primarily driven by strategic acquisitions. If you exclude acquisitions, SG&A was favorable for the quarter. Both consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined versus the prior year by 14% and 9%, respectively.
Moving below the operating line. Net interest and other expense was approximately $41 million in the quarter, a decrease versus the prior year. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 36.4%, which is 3.5 percentage points higher on a comparative basis, primarily due to several favorable discrete items that occurred in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35% and 37%.
Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 322 million, about 9 million shares fewer than the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to the benefit from our opportunistic share repurchases over the last 12 months, which includes $250 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. We have just under $800 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
In addition, we generated approximately $104 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. And due to efficient and effective working capital management by our teams, we ended September 30 with a strong balance sheet. Our cash balance, including short-term investments, was $2.2 billion, of which $622 million were held internationally.
Now let's move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 14% to $28.8 billion. This increase was from growth in net new and existing Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, driven mainly by the win of a previously announced large mail order customer and the impact of branded inflation. While a smaller driver, the strong performance of our specialty business also drove the revenue increase.
Despite the revenue growth, segment profit for the quarter decreased 19% to $534 million. This decrease was a result of generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, reduced levels of branded inflation as well as the previously announced loss of a large Pharmaceutical Distribution customer. This was partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing. These same factors, as well as changes in our product and customer mix, mainly the on-boarding of a previously discussed large mail order customer, reduced our segment profit rate by 76 basis points to 1.86%. As a reminder, next quarter, we will fully lap the on-boarding of this large mail order customer.
Getting back to Red Oak. As we've mentioned in the past, if it achieved certain milestones, it would trigger the second of 2 predetermined payments beginning in FY '17. Because of excellent performance, Red Oak met these milestones, so we've made our second and final $10 million increase to the quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment is $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.
Let's now go to Medical segment performance, which had a strong first quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 12% to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by contributions from our strategic acquisitions and growth from net new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased 26% to $127 million during the quarter due to contributions from acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products. Segment profit margin rate increased 42 basis points in the quarter to 3.87%, driven by acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products, partially offset by the change in customer mix. This change primarily comes from the accelerated on-boarding of a new large medical distribution customer. The recent wins in the Medical segment on the distribution side are exciting and very important. They add to our profitability, but are dilutive to our Medical segment margin rates.
Specific to Cordis, it continues to meet our performance expectations and make real and measurable progress. As we mentioned last quarter, our integration team is on track to have our operations fully stood up and exit the TSA agreements by the end of this fiscal year, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple of years. Until we exit these TSAs, they can create some variability in our segment profit rate, although this quarter, it was about on track. 
Overall, our team has done an outstanding job driving strong, healthy growth in the Medical segment.
Before moving to our fiscal year '17 outlook, you can turn to Slide #7 where you'll see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter. The $0.28 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.
Next, I'd like to discuss our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings guidance range and assumptions. But before doing that, let me comment on Q2. While we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, we want to keep you informed when there are meaningful shifts. So as it relates to the second quarter, the generic pricing environment and, to a lesser extent, the brand inflation rates lead us to now expect the second quarter fiscal 2017 Pharma segment profit decline to be relatively in line with the first quarter on a percentage basis.
Now you can follow along, starting on Slide 9 of the presentation. As George mentioned earlier, based on Q1 actuals, second quarter expectations and trends we noted, we are slightly lowering our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range we provided in August to $5.40 to $5.60 from $5.48 to $5.73. Let me give you some color around these adjustments by walking through our corporate and segment assumptions.
Turning to Slide 10. All but 2 of our fiscal year 2017 corporate assumptions remain unchanged. First, we have updated our weighted average shares outstanding assumption to 320 million to 322 million shares, which is lower than the initial range provided of 324 million to 326 million shares. This new range reflects potential additional repurchases. Second, our assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization increased to approximately 385 million or about $0.79 per share that does not affect our non-GAAP earnings.
On Slide 11, there are 3 updates to our full year Pharmaceutical segment assumptions that I would like to take a minute to highlight. First, we previously expected Pharma segment profit for FY '17 to be essentially flat. We now expect full year segment profit to be down mid- to high single digits versus the prior year due to the generic pharmaceutical pricing environment and, while much less of an impact, lower-than-anticipated brand pharmaceutical inflation. To clarify, when we refer to generic drug pricing, we are referring to a combination of all factors affecting generic selling price, such as manufacturer inflation and deflation and customer pricing. We now expect this to be in the mid- to high single-digit deflation for the full fiscal year. Lastly, we have adjusted our brand manufacturer inflation assumptions to a range of 7% to 9% from approximately 10%. Overall, we still expect Pharma segment profit to be back half weighted.
Now turning to the Medical segment. All of our fiscal year 2017 Medical segment assumptions remain on target and unchanged. We are still on track to achieve mid-single digit percentage growth in revenue and double-digit growth in segment profit.
Now turning back to overall company guidance. Since we are slightly lowering our overall fiscal 2017 earnings guidance range to 3% to 7% growth from 5% to 9% growth versus the prior year, we've updated some of our original assumptions to achieve that growth on Slide 13. The line titled Business Growth is now assumed to be flat to 3% and capital deployment is now assumed to contribute 3% to 4% for the year. 
From a corporate standpoint, we are focused on expense management and other actions to achieve these results. Keep in mind that the benefits related to these important items are held at the corporate level and not reflected at the segment level. And while we aren't providing the EPS bridge slide we presented on our August Q4 call, you can infer that based on my comments about the generic pricing environment being more challenging, it would result in a decrease to that line item, while increasing our capital deployment assumptions would result in an increase to that line item. Yet customer activity remains about the same, but our existing or remaining businesses bucket would increase as it includes the corporate actions I just referenced.
Additionally, we told you on our fourth quarter call that we were assessing the timing of the adoption of new accounting treatment for the tax effect of share-based compensation. Our 2017 guidance does not include this as we believe it is simpler to adopt the new treatment in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 according to the required schedule. So as you can see, we've now aligned our guidance range given the current pricing environment I just described.
To close, let me highlight a few key points before I turn to your questions. First, while we are experiencing a tough near-term environment, we continued to aspire the long -- to the long-term goals we communicated before. 
In our Pharmaceutical segment, we do see generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, branded inflation as challenges. However, we continue to see strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, continued focus on operational excellence and positive feedback from our robust customer base. In addition, Harvard Drug, Specialty and nuclear are all delivering value for our customers and our business.
On the Medical side, we've also won some important new Medical distribution customers, which should help us gain scale in sourcing and leverage our cost structure to create greater efficiencies.
In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our Cardinal Health brand products and services and above-market revenue growth in Cardinal Health at home. Finally, Cordis continues to perform well, and we are confident in both the fundamental and growth initiatives in that business. 
Overall, it was a challenging quarter, but I want to acknowledge our team for their strong execution and focus in a tough environment. I believe this excellent execution and focus, combined with our broad portfolio and balanced capital deployment, will allow us to drive long-term sustainable growth.
And with that, operator, let's begin our Q&A."

And here is my perspective. There are -- as I mentioned, there were a number of factors coming together to make this a bit of a unique moment, so we're not going to overreact to that moment. Our position, our plans for growth really aren't different than -- today than they were 6 months ago. Our value proposition is very clear. We're an extraordinary attentive partner to our customers. We have a unique ability to follow the patient across the continuum of care. The service offerings are extensive. That is what's the heart of our positioning, so that, I think, is important to stay upfront. But no, I think we're describing some similar characteristics to what you described."

Overall, it looks like the range is coming down by $0.11 at the midpoint. You talked a lot about generic inflation getting a little bit worse than previously thought and then modestly less branded inflation. But if I look at the guidance for the Pharma segment specifically, it seems like that take down in what you're assuming around profit margins there or overall profits there, mid- to high single digits, would actually indicate something more in the $0.25 to $0.40 headwind. So just trying to square those 2 things relative to the overall amount coming down compared to what you're suggesting is going on with the Pharma segment for the rest of the year."

Let me hit a few different things. I think, first of all, just to be clear, when we talked -- when I was talking about generic pharmaceutical pricing, I wasn't really talking about the headwind, tailwind you used to hear over the last couple of years of inflation and deflation on generic products because that's about where we model it to be this year. We're not really seeing that. We expected it to be a net deflation environment, and that's what we're seeing, so that's not really the driver. What we're talking about is more the downstream pricing component of our generic pricing. That's where we're seeing an uptick in competitiveness or a little more erosion than we had expected to be, and that's really is the main driver of us taking down our Pharmaceutical Distribution numbers. And as I mentioned a couple of times, to a lesser extent, brand inflation, so we had said about 10% before on brand inflation. We're now modeling in the 7% to 9%. That impact -- I guess, I will put it this way. If that were the only thing going on this year, then it wouldn't -- we probably wouldn't be adjusting guidance. It's more of the combination of the generic pricing and then that on top of that. But I think that's the first thing I want to say. The second thing, I can understand why you have -- maybe have a little trouble with your numbers. I can't quote exactly or comment on exactly what the number should be. But remember, I did make a comment in here that we have some significant initiatives around expenses and other initiatives that will be captured in our corporate numbers. And so those aren't going to show up in the segment numbers because we don't push those down at the end of the year. So probably, the piece that you're missing as you try to reconcile having Pharma down, capital deployment up midpoint down, the last bucket that you're missing is that the corporate numbers, we're going to have savings there that will be in the overall corporate bucket."

As you can imagine, when you're in a challenging environment like that, everyone, whether you're in P, M or corporate, it's focused on expense control and making sure we're very diligent on those types of things. And so we have that benefit. As I mentioned, Medical is continuing to do very well. We expect them to have a very good year. And they are going -- moving along as planned. So I do think our broad portfolio of having Medical being able to drive some initiatives at a corporate level, which are going to show up at the end of the year, as well as some of the other parts of Pharma, are what we'll be able to use. And using our balance sheet, too, from a capital deployment standpoint through M&A and stock repo is how we're going to continue to manage the rest of the year."

Second of all, I think you hit on something, which is customer repricings. And we didn't have very few -- we have basically a very few major repricings this year. And obviously, over the next couple of years, we don't have a ton of those. We're in pretty good shape, particularly with some of our larger customers. And I think that may be a different thing as where we're seeing some of our competitors may or may not have more large repricings with some of their customers, which can impact each one of us in different timing within the years.

Obviously, I've been doing this as is Mike for quite some time. We've lived through multiple cycles for me and multiple parts in the industry. You see these periods. I mentioned that this is a bit of a unique moment. You've got all of the public discourse around health care cost and Pharma cost. It's loud and it's emotional. And at the same time, health care is going through some changes. So I don't think it's shocking that there are some near-term disturbance. Experience -- my experience tells me that, over time, you see some shifting out and just essentially settling of the dust. Sometimes, when aggressive moves don't result in a much change or a value creation, then things just sort of stabilize. And so we've lived through different cycles in the past, and that's what I would expect here. For us, again, the important thing is for us is to be creating new value sources for our customers and our manufacturer partners. And we work -- you've heard the positioning that we've had over these last 7 or 8 years. It's really been about broad value creation, and we'll continue to focus on that as our priority. And I think, ultimately, the reason that our business has been improving in recent years is, essentially, they build and create value. And so we'll continue to focus on those dynamics. But we have seen occasionally these kinds of cycles, for me over, unfortunately, many decades in different parts of the industry. So that's my general point of view."

But we're going to stay disciplined. If we can't find the right target at the right price and it has the right culture that fits into our business, then we're not going to move forward. And if that means there is some excess cash on the balance sheet, then we will take a look at deploying that in the stock repo. So I think our pipeline is still decent right now. As you can imagine, we look at dozens of items before we ever purchase one. And so it's always hard to tell exactly when something might come out of that. But we continue to be very active in the M&A front, but won't trap cash on the balance sheet either if we can't find the right opportunities."

I did mention that in my remarks that part of the reason for our Q1 is the comps, and that's why we called out Q1 being down was. And you were right on with that. We did have $0.08 last year that we called out a favorability largely from benefits related to certain competitive dynamics on a few key generic items that we thought we're going to deflate last year that didn't and they stayed up. And since then, they have deflated. And then, as you mentioned, $0.03 on accelerated integration of some acquisitions. So those were favorable items last year as well as from an overall basis. Remember, we had a favorable tax component last year, too. And then in last year, we did see in the first quarter branded inflation was a little higher than we had anticipated. So that's right. Those were the positive things. You also summarized accurately the generic piece. When you really break it down into 2 components, one is the manufacturing actions, which is them either raising or lowering price. We're seeing, for instance, less inventory inflation on generics. But it's really no different than we had originally anticipated. As you mentioned -- as we've mentioned in the past, FY '14 was a good year, '15 was a solid year, and then it started coming down in '16, and we kept calling down and we said we expected that to be down. And that's how we essentially budgeted and looked at it for this year. So again, we're not seeing anything real different when it comes to what the manufacturing actions are related to inflation and deflation.

And we really feel like we create a huge amount of value for those independents to the service offerings and product lines, especially as the world has unfolded as it is. So start by that. I don't think there is a discrete moment of change. We're obviously in a middle of a lot of things. So the election cycle, clearly, is creating on an enormous amount of discussion and noise, which I do think has an effect on the way people behave. I do think generic cycles come in lumps, and we see that they tend to have some cyclicality. We'll see some growth coming from biosimilars, which will affect the market each -- probably each product differently. And I think, again, most times in competitive moments, you have companies just adjusting to what's working and what's not. And so that's my experience over a lot of years.

But I don't think that's a big component of it. As far as what we've seen so far, I would tell you that what we've seen so far has been pretty light when it comes to manufacturer inflation. But that all being said, really, January, as you know, our Q3 or the first quarter of a calendar year is always a big quarter for the branded manufacturer price increases. And the 7% to 9% is really an average for the entire year. So while it's a little lighter than we would have expected now, that's what we're building in to why we're lowering is that we would expect it hopefully, after election and looking all those other components, we'll see a little bit more normalcy, probably not as high, obviously, as what it used to be, but we think we'll get back into that 7% to 9% range.

When we have customers, we're very diligent about the way we write our contracts. So if we have a customer contract that says that they've got to buy x percent of the generics from us, then we monitor that and we make sure that they do.

So you're making Don happy, question on Medical. So let me just give you a perspective. Our go-to-market model over recent years has really been focused broadly on a couple of really important changes. A lot of our customers are getting much more complex. They're bigger systems. So what historically might have been a single hospital is now a academic medical center, plus some community hospitals, plus a few surgery centers and oncology clinics and now some doctors' offices. That requires a different partner. I think our ability -- and we've seen this. We built our business around that expectation. And I think what's happening is our ability to serve across that continuum of care to create value in different ways or systems that are much more complex than they once were is important. And one of the shifts I want to describe is a little bit more of an elevation of those conversations, away from the purely departmentally driven ones into a conversation that's more broadly at the system level. I think that's playing to our strength. Now again, we have to be very strong in each of the departments. We have to be content experts, and we are still that. But I do think that the reason that we've been growing, I think, is largely that we're positioning well to adapt. And we anticipated these changes in the way that these big health systems were going to look. And I think that's been beneficial to us."

We can be more meaningful to them. And I think it would be -- I don't think we should also ignore the fact that we've given a lot of energy to the Cordis business. So we've put some great people in charge in there. It's a business that we're paying a lot of attention to. Don himself has a lot of experience in this area, as is David Wilson, who's running it. And so I think there's a lot to be said for when you have people that are excited, know you're investing in the business, really are committed to that, and we've hired some great people that, I think, that's driving some of the things we're seeing in Cordis, too."

As far as what's going on back half weighted, some of it has just to do with comps and things that are going to happen in the Cordis, like branded inflation tends to always be stronger in our Q3. And we have a lot of other initiatives that we're working on that, we believe, will deliver value in the second half. Remember, we have the step-up in Cordis that impacted our Q2 and Q3 last year that doesn't impact our Q2 and Q3 this year. Plus, we'll have a full year of growing and getting after that business as well as on-boarding some other new customers.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Allow me to start by being direct. Our first quarter of fiscal 2017 certainly had its share of challenges, but it came in much as we suggested to you that it would, with healthy and growing revenues up 14% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating earnings down 9% versus the first quarter of last year. I'll focus my commentary on the broad outlook for our business and our future, and Mike will walk you through our financials for the quarter with more detail and specificity.
Let me frame the start to our fiscal year with 2 lenses: one, the operating performance of our integrated business lines; and the other, the environment in which we compete. 
Our teams continue to demonstrate their commitment to strong operating performance. Our service levels are extremely high. We are experiencing very high rates of customer retention. And our enterprise-wide customer reach is expanding, including the onboarding of some very strategically important customers in the Med segment.
We also continue to launch new products and service offerings, increasing our value to our customers as they navigate significant change in the industry. And as is embedded in our DNA, we are taking a disciplined and determined approach to managing our working capital. But make no mistake, this is a very challenging near-term environment. This is particularly true for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business.
The public discourse around drug pricing has, at least for the moment, had a significant impact on the way pharmaceutical companies are pricing their products on both the branded and generic side. Combining this with limited generic product launches and significant reimbursement pressure on our customers, the competitive intensity has increased. As a result, price erosion during the period has been more pronounced than it has been in quite some time for our industry.
Our commitment has been and will continue to be to providing world-class service, tools, technology and solutions to help our customers thrive in a challenging environment and better serve their patients. This is central to our value proposition. At the same time that our retail pharmacy customers are experiencing unique dynamics, we are also working closely with our large integrated system customers to help them adapt to a changing environment, one where pressures to be efficient are relentless, where the configuration of their own businesses and portfolios are more complex and where the need to operate across their own internal boundaries is a high priority. As a result, the historically siloed or departmentally driven operating model is evolving to one that places a premium on operating coordination across the system and strategic alignment with other health care players who can enable their strategies. This is who we are. Our focus is on finding more efficient and effective ways to create real value for our customers across our lines of business. 
Today, our customers look to us for our integrated solutions to help them reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve quality. All of this requires deep, multidisciplinary health care expertise and real strategic partnership, which we deliver every day for those we serve. These are the characteristics of the moment. Some very encouraging, others creating short-term headwind. Of course, I'd like some of that to be different, but this is the environment in which we must compete now. We will play for the long game, with a strategic eye on the future, mobilizing the best talent and building the right lines of business to help our customers compete in this changing world.
With this as backdrop, and modeling in an adjustment for the current pricing environment, we are slightly lowering our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.60 from our prior range of $5.48 to $5.73. Let me be clear. We remain committed to navigating today's challenges, embracing tomorrow's opportunities for our customers and shareholders.
Within our Pharmaceutical segment, revenue was up 14% versus the prior year to $28.8 billion, and segment profit declined 19% versus the prior year to $534 million. This was primarily driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing, reduced levels of branded inflation and the loss of Safeway, which we previously discussed.
However, the work that we have done over the past few years has strategically positioned us to more effectively support our customers. The range of our retail service offerings has never been stronger, and the Red Oak Sourcing venture with CVS Health continues to be an effective, productive and profitable partnership. We see this as a long-term driver of value for us and our customers. 
Our Specialty Solutions group continues to perform well, driven by both our provider-facing and biopharma offerings, once again showing strong double-digit growth. We are confident that our growing portfolio of service -- services is well aligned with and valuable to the strategies of our biopharmaceutical partners. I want to thank Jon Giacomin and his Pharma segment team for their commitment to navigating these challenging dynamics and remaining focused on our customers with a clear eye towards managing efficiency.
Our Medical segment had a strong first quarter across multiple dimensions. First, revenues for the Medical segment were up 12% versus the prior year to $3.3 billion. Second, segment profit was up 26% versus the prior year to $127 million. And third, our Medical segment customer base has been expanding, a testament to the value we've created across our lines of business and the strong partnerships we've developed with our customers. Every day, we serve customers focusing more on the total care of the patient, and they recognize the growing shift to value-based reimbursement models. Discussions with our customers reinforce that they are looking to us as a broad-based integrated solutions provider and a source of expertise across the continuum of care.
Our Cardinal Health branded products continue to be a driver of growth for the segment as we increase our account penetration, and growth in our strategic accounts is outpacing the market. During the quarter, we onboarded a large complex customer in our Medical segment. We learned a lot from this rapid deployment and we are very grateful both to our employees and to our new partner for working together to move us towards the finish line.
October 2 marked 1 year since we closed the Cordis acquisition. Don Casey and his team have done a tremendous job leading the integration, thoughtfully phasing in new systems and processes and building out an important platform. The integration of Cordis has proved to be an excellent example of how we can bring together best practices across borders. We have seen, over this past year, that taking the time to do things right is essential to best serve our customers. 
We have also seen growth in some important markets including Europe, where we believe that taking an integrated cohesive approach to our customers will position us for measurable growth over the long term.
Cordis is also providing us with additional partnership opportunities to build out our products, tools and services. As an example, we have signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Biosensors to bring their coronary interventional products to our customers in Europe and Japan as another offering in the bag to deliver even greater value.
While we are operating today in a tough and unique environment, we believe that we are well prepared to lead and quick to adapt. By working with our customers holistically, driving our own efficiencies and delivering integrated effective solutions we've developed strong partnerships with our customers. We remain committed to focusing our product lines and capabilities around the patient to position ourselves to capitalize on the changes in our industry. And to the collective drive and dedication of our 37,000 people, we'll continue to deliver meaningful results and measurable growth for our customers, patients and shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for a detailed review of the financials. Mike?"

In our August call, I mentioned this would be due to some challenging trends and some tough year-over-year comps, particularly on some key generic items in our Pharmaceutical segment as well as discrete tax items, partially offset by strong performance in the Medical segment, and that's largely what we saw. I'll discuss both segments in greater detail later, but let me start with consolidated company results.
Revenues increased 14% year-over-year, totaling $32 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 1% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, primarily driven by strategic acquisitions. If you exclude acquisitions, SG&A was favorable for the quarter. Both consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined versus the prior year by 14% and 9%, respectively.
Moving below the operating line. Net interest and other expense was approximately $41 million in the quarter, a decrease versus the prior year. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 36.4%, which is 3.5 percentage points higher on a comparative basis, primarily due to several favorable discrete items that occurred in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35% and 37%.
Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 322 million, about 9 million shares fewer than the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to the benefit from our opportunistic share repurchases over the last 12 months, which includes $250 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. We have just under $800 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
In addition, we generated approximately $104 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. And due to efficient and effective working capital management by our teams, we ended September 30 with a strong balance sheet. Our cash balance, including short-term investments, was $2.2 billion, of which $622 million were held internationally.
Now let's move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 14% to $28.8 billion. This increase was from growth in net new and existing Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, driven mainly by the win of a previously announced large mail order customer and the impact of branded inflation. While a smaller driver, the strong performance of our specialty business also drove the revenue increase.
Despite the revenue growth, segment profit for the quarter decreased 19% to $534 million. This decrease was a result of generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, reduced levels of branded inflation as well as the previously announced loss of a large Pharmaceutical Distribution customer. This was partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing. These same factors, as well as changes in our product and customer mix, mainly the onboarding of a previously discussed large mail order customer, reduced our segment profit rate by 76 basis points to 1.86%. As a reminder, next quarter, we will fully lap the onboarding of this large mail order customer.
Getting back to Red Oak. As we've mentioned in the past, if it achieves certain milestones, it would trigger the second of 2 predetermined payments beginning in FY '17. Because of excellent performance, Red Oak met these milestones, so we've made our second and final $10 million increase to the quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment is $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.
Let's now go to Medical segment performance, which had a strong first quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 12% to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by contributions from our strategic acquisitions and growth from net new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased 26% to $127 million during the quarter due to contributions from acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products. Segment profit margin rate increased 42 basis points in the quarter to 3.87%, driven by acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products, partially offset by the change in customer mix. This change primarily comes from the accelerated onboarding of a new large medical distribution customer. The recent wins in the Medical segment on the distribution side are exciting and very important. They add to our profitability, but are dilutive to our Medical segment margin rates.
Specific to Cordis, it continues to meet our performance expectations and make real and measurable progress. As we mentioned last quarter, our integration team is on track to have our operations fully stood up and exit the TSA agreements by the end of this fiscal year, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple of years. Until we exit these TSAs, they can create some variability in our segment profit rate, although this quarter, it was about on track. 
Overall, our team has done an outstanding job driving strong, healthy growth in the Medical segment.
Before moving to our fiscal year '17 outlook, you can turn to Slide #7 where you'll see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter. The $0.28 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.
Next, I'd like to discuss our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings guidance range and assumptions. But before doing that, let me comment on Q2. While we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, we want to keep you informed when there are meaningful shifts. So as it relates to the second quarter, the generic pricing environment and, to a lesser extent, the brand inflation rates lead us to now expect the second quarter fiscal 2017 Pharma segment profit decline to be relatively in line with the first quarter on a percentage basis.
Now you can follow along, starting on Slide 9 of the presentation. As George mentioned earlier, based on Q1 actuals, second quarter expectations and trends we noted, we are slightly lowering our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range we provided in August to $5.40 to $5.60 from $5.48 to $5.73. Let me give you some color around this adjustment by walking through our corporate and segment assumptions.
Turning to Slide 10. All but 2 of our fiscal year 2017 corporate assumptions remain unchanged. First, we have updated our weighted average shares outstanding assumption to 320 million to 322 million shares, which is lower than the initial range provided of 324 million to 326 million shares. This new range reflects potential additional repurchases. Second, our assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization increased to approximately 385 million or about $0.79 per share that does not affect our non-GAAP earnings.
On Slide 11, there are 3 updates to our full year Pharmaceutical segment assumptions that I would like to take a minute to highlight. First, we've previously expected Pharma segment profit for FY '17 to be essentially flat. We now expect full year segment profit to be down mid- to high single digits versus the prior year due to the generic pharmaceutical pricing environment and, while much less of an impact, lower-than-anticipated brand pharmaceutical inflation. To clarify, when we refer to generic drug pricing, we are referring to a combination of all factors affecting generic selling price, such as manufacturer inflation and deflation and customer pricing. We now expect this to be in the mid- to high single-digit deflation for the full fiscal year. Lastly, we have adjusted our brand manufacturer inflation assumptions to a range of 7% to 9% from approximately 10%. Overall, we still expect Pharma segment profit to be back half weighted.
Now turning to the Medical segment. All of our fiscal year 2017 Medical segment assumptions remain on target and unchanged. We are still on track to achieve mid-single digit percentage growth in revenue and double-digit growth in segment profit.
Now turning back to overall company guidance. Since we are slightly lowering our overall fiscal 2017 earnings guidance range to 3% to 7% growth from 5% to 9% growth versus the prior year, we've updated some of our original assumptions to achieve that growth on Slide 13. The line titled Business Growth is now assumed to be flat to 3% and capital deployment is now assumed to contribute 3% to 4% for the year. 
From a corporate standpoint, we are focused on expense management and other actions to achieve these results. Keep in mind that the benefits related to these important items are held at the corporate level and not reflected at the segment level. And while we aren't providing the EPS bridge slide we presented on our August Q4 call, you can infer that based on my comments about the generic pricing environment being more challenging, it would result in a decrease to that line item, while increasing our capital deployment assumptions would result in an increase to that line item. Net customer activity remains about the same, but our existing or remaining businesses bucket would increase as it includes the corporate actions I just referenced.
Additionally, we told you on our fourth quarter call that we were assessing the timing of the adoption of new accounting treatment for the tax effect of share-based compensation. Our 2017 guidance does not include this as we believe it is simpler to adopt the new treatment in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 according to the required schedule. So as you can see, we've now aligned our guidance range given the current pricing environment I just described.
To close, let me highlight a few key points before I turn to your questions. First, while we are experiencing a tough near-term environment, we continue to aspire the long -- to the long-term goals we communicated before. 
In our Pharmaceutical segment, we do see generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, branded inflation as challenges. However, we continue to see strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, continued focus on operational excellence and positive feedback from our robust customer base. In addition, Harvard Drug, Specialty and nuclear are all delivering value for our customers and our business.
On the Medical side, we've also won some important new Medical distribution customers, which should help us gain scale in sourcing and leverage our cost structure to create greater efficiencies.
In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our Cardinal Health brand products and services and above-market revenue growth in Cardinal Health at Home. Finally, Cordis continues to perform well, and we are confident in both the fundamental and growth initiatives in that business. 
Overall, it was a challenging quarter, but I want to acknowledge our team for their strong execution and focus in a tough environment. I believe this excellent execution and focus, combined with our broad portfolio and balanced capital deployment, will allow us to drive long-term sustainable growth.
And with that, operator, let's begin our Q&A."

Our position, our plans for growth really aren't different than -- today than they were 6 months ago. Our value proposition is very clear. We're an extraordinary, attentive partner to our customers. We have a unique ability to follow the patient across the continuum of care. The service offerings are extensive. That's really at the heart of our positioning, so that's, I think, important to state upfront. But no, I think we're describing some similar characteristics to what you describe."

Overall, it looks like the range is coming down by $0.11 at the midpoint. You talked a lot about generic inflation [ph] getting a little bit worse than previously thought and then modestly less branded inflation. But if I look at the guidance for the Pharma segment specifically, it seems like that take down in what you're assuming around profit margins there -- or overall profits there, mid- to high single digits, would actually indicate something more in the $0.25 to $0.40 headwind. So just trying to square those 2 things relative to the overall amount coming down compared to what you're suggesting is going on with the Pharma segment for the rest of the year."

Let me hit a few different things. I think, first of all, just to be clear, when we talked -- when I was talking about generic pharmaceutical pricing, I wasn't really talking about the headwind, tailwind you used to hear over the last couple of years of inflation and deflation on generic products because that's about where we model it to be this year. We're not really seeing that. We expected it to be a net deflation environment, and that's what we're seeing, so that's not really the driver. What we're talking about is more the downstream pricing component of our generic pricing. That's where we're seeing an uptick in competitiveness or a little more erosion than we had expected to be, and that really is the main driver of us taking down our Pharmaceutical Distribution numbers. And as I mentioned a couple of times, to a lesser extent, brand inflation. So we had said about 10% before on brand inflation, we're now modeling in the 7% to 9%. That impact -- I guess, I would put it this way. If that were the only thing going on this year, then it wouldn't -- we probably wouldn't be adjusting guidance. It's more the combination of the generic pricing and then that on top of that. But I think that's the first thing I wanted to say. The second thing, I can understand why you're maybe having a little trouble with your numbers. I can't quote exactly or comment on exactly what the numbers should be. But remember, I did make a comment in here that we have some significant initiatives around expenses and other initiatives that will be captured in our corporate numbers. And so those aren't going to show up in the segment numbers because we don't push those down at the end of the year. So probably the piece that you're missing as you try to reconcile having Pharma down, capital deployment up midpoint down, the last bucket that you're missing is that the corporate numbers, we're going to have savings there that will be in the overall corporate bucket."

One of the things that I think is really helpful for Cardinal in general is our broad portfolio.

As you can imagine, when you're in a challenging environment like that, everyone, whether you're in P, M or corporate, is focused on expense control and making sure we're very diligent on those types of things. And so we have that benefit. As I mentioned, Medical is continuing to do very well. We expect them to have a very good year. And they are going -- moving along as planned. And so I do think our broad portfolio of having Medical, being able to drive some initiatives at a corporate level, which are going to show up at the end of the year, as well as some of the other parts of Pharma, are what we'll be able to use. And using our balance sheet, too, from a capital deployment standpoint through M&A and stock repo is how we're going to continue to manage the rest of the year."

First of all, I hate to ever comment on our competitors' numbers. We always want to be careful of those. But remember, mix matters. And what I mean by mix is how much of their mix may be brand and generic versus our mix. If you look at the other components of our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment with our growth in Specialty, nuclear and other things, so it's hard to comment on all the various moving parts of any of our competitors on what's in those segments. Second of all, I think you hit on something, which is customer repricings. And we didn't have very few -- we had -- basically, had very few major repricings this year. And honestly, over the next couple of years, we don't have a ton of those. We're in pretty good shape, particularly with some of our larger customers. And I think that may be a different thing as where we're seeing some of our competitors may or may not have more large repricings with some of their customers, which can affect each one of us in different timing within the years. And so I think it really gets back to mix of customers, timing of repricings. And those types of things can drive differences between each one of us as well as maybe the expectations that we originally set at the beginning of the year and how we looked at things."

Obviously, I've been doing this, as has Mike, for quite some time. We've lived through multiple cycles, for me, in multiple parts in the industry. You see these periods. I mentioned that this is a bit of a unique moment. You've got all of the public discourse around health care costs and Pharma costs. It's loud and it's emotional. And at the same time, health care is going through some changes. So I don't think it's shocking that there is some near-term disturbance. Experience -- my experience tells me that, over time, you see some shifting out and just, essentially, settling of the dust. Sometimes, when aggressive moves don't result in much change or value creation, then things just sort of stabilize. And so we've lived through different cycles in the past, and that's what I would expect here. For us, again, the important thing is for us is to be creating new value sources for our customers and our manufacturer partners. And we work -- you've heard the positioning that we've had over these last 7 or 8 years. It's really been about broad value creation, and we'll continue to focus on that as our priority. And I think, ultimately, the reason that our business has been improving in recent years is, essentially, the ability to create value. And so we'll continue to focus on those dynamics. But we have seen occasionally these kinds of cycles, for me over, unfortunately, many decades in different parts of the industry. So that's my general point of view."

Again, I would tell you that when it comes to the deployment of capital, we would love to find great M&A targets. That's probably where we would lean over stock repo. But we're going to stay disciplined. If we can't find the right target at the right price and it has the right culture that fits into our business, then we're not going to move forward. And if that means there is some excess cash on the balance sheet, then we will take a look at deploying that in the stock repo. So I think our pipeline is still decent right now. As you can imagine, we look at dozens of items before we ever purchase one. And so it's always hard to tell exactly when something might come out of that. But we continue to be very active on the M&A front, but won't trap cash on the balance sheet either if we can't find the right opportunities."

I did mention that in my remarks that part of the reason for our Q1 is the comps, and that's why we called out Q1 being down was. And you were right on with that we did have $0.08 last year that we called out a favorability largely from benefits related to certain competitive dynamics on a few key generic items that we thought were going to deflate last year that didn't and they stayed up. And since then, they have deflated. And then, as you mentioned, $0.03 on accelerated integration of some acquisitions. So those were favorable items last year as well as from an overall basis. Remember, we had a favorable tax component last year, too. And then in last year, we did see in the first quarter branded inflation was a little higher than we had anticipated. So that's right. Those were the positive things. You also summarized accurately the generic piece. When you really break it down into 2 components, one is the manufacturing actions, which is them either raising or lowering price. We're seeing, for instance, less inventory inflation on generics. But it's really no different than we had originally anticipated. As you mentioned -- as we've mentioned in the past, FY '14 was a good year, '15 was a solid year, and then it started coming down in '16, and we kept calling that and we said we expected that to be down. And that's how we essentially budgeted and looked at it for this year. So again, we're not seeing anything real different when it comes to what the manufacturing actions are related to inflation and deflation.

I don't think there is a discrete moment of change. We're obviously in the middle of a lot of things. So the election cycle, clearly, is creating on an enormous amount of discussion and noise, which I do think has an effect on the way people behave. I do think generic cycles come in lumps, and we see that they tend to have some cyclicality. We'll see some growth coming from biosimilars, which will affect the market each -- probably each product differently. And I think, again, most times in competitive moments, you have companies just adjusting to what's working and what's not. And so that's my experience over a lot of years.

We've heard from a number of manufacturers that they are lowering their expectation into what their price inflation will be in calendar '17, so I want to understand that, number one. And number two, I just want to understand -- because the way I've historically thought about this is, is that, that 15% that's on a contingent basis was probably more profitable than a fee-for-service contract.

But that all being said, really, January, as you know, our Q3 or the first quarter of a calendar year is always a big quarter for the branded manufacturer price increases. And the 7% to 9% is really an average for the entire year. So while it's a little lighter than we would have expected now, that's what we're building in to why we're lowering is that we would expect it to, hopefully, after election and looking at all those other components, we'll see a little bit more normalcy, probably not as high, obviously, as what it used to be, but we think we'll get back into that 7% to 9% range.

When we have customers, we're very diligent about the way we write our contracts. So if we have a customer contract that says that they've got to buy x percent of their generics from us, then we monitor that and we make sure that they do.

So you're making Don happy, a question on Medical. So let me just give you a perspective. Our go-to-market model over recent years has really been focused broadly on a couple of really important changes. A lot of our customers are getting much more complex. They're bigger systems. So what historically might have been a single hospital is now an academic medical center, plus some community hospitals, plus a few surgery centers and oncology clinics and now some doctors' offices. That requires a different partner. I think our ability -- and we've seen this. We built our business around that expectation. And I think what's happening is our ability to serve across that continuum of care to create value in different ways for systems that are much more complex than they once were is important. And one of the shifts I want to describe is a little bit more of an elevation of those conversations, away from the purely departmentally driven ones into a conversation that's more broadly at the system level. I think that's playing to our strength. Now again, we have to be very strong in each of the departments. We have to be content experts, and we are still that. But I do think that the reason that we've been growing, I think, is largely that we're positioning well to adapt. And we anticipated these changes in the way that these big health systems were going to look. And I think that's been beneficial to us."

So we've put some great people in charge in there. It's a business that we're paying a lot of attention to. Don, himself, has a lot of experience in this area, as does David Wilson, who's running it.

As far as what's going on back-half weighted, some of it has just to do with comps and things that are going to happen in the quarters, like branded inflation tends to always be stronger in our Q3. And we have a lot of other initiatives that we're working on that we believe will deliver value in the second half. Remember, we have the step-up in Cordis that impacted our Q2 and Q3 last year that doesn't impact our Q2 and Q3 this year.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Allow me to start by being direct. Our first quarter of fiscal 2017 certainly had its share of challenges, but it came in much as we suggested to you that it would, with healthy and growing revenues up 14% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating earnings down 9% versus the first quarter of last year. I'll focus my commentary on the broad outlook for our business and our future, and Mike will walk you through our financials for the quarter with more detail and specificity.
Let me frame the start to our fiscal year with 2 lenses: one, the operating performance of our integrated business lines; and the other, the environment in which we compete. 
Our teams continue to demonstrate their commitment to strong operating performance. Our service levels are extremely high. We are experiencing very high rates of customer retention. And our enterprise-wide customer reach is expanding, including the onboarding of some very strategically important customers in the Med segment.
We also continue to launch new products and service offerings, increasing our value to our customers as they navigate significant change in the industry. And as is embedded in our DNA, we are taking a disciplined and determined approach to managing our working capital. But make no mistake, this is a very challenging near-term environment. This is particularly true for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business.
The public discourse around drug pricing has, at least for the moment, had a significant impact on the way pharmaceutical companies are pricing their products on both the branded and generic side. Combining this with limited generic product launches and significant reimbursement pressure on our customers, the competitive intensity has increased. As a result, price erosion during the period has been more pronounced than it has been in quite some time for our industry.
Our commitment has been and will continue to be to providing world-class service, tools, technology and solutions to help our customers thrive in a challenging environment and better serve their patients. This is central to our value proposition. At the same time that our retail pharmacy customers are experiencing unique dynamics, we are also working closely with our large integrated system customers to help them adapt to a changing environment, one where pressures to be efficient are relentless, where the configuration of their own businesses and portfolios are more complex and where the need to operate across their own internal boundaries is a high priority. As a result, the historically siloed or departmentally driven operating model is evolving to one that places a premium on operating coordination across the system and strategic alignment with other health care players who can enable their strategies. This is who we are. Our focus is on finding more efficient and effective ways to create real value for our customers across our lines of business. 
Today, our customers look to us for our integrated solutions to help them reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve quality. All of this requires deep, multidisciplinary health care expertise and real strategic partnership, which we deliver every day for those we serve. These are the characteristics of the moment. Some very encouraging, others creating short-term headwind. Of course, I'd like some of that to be different, but this is the environment in which we must compete now. We will play for the long game, with a strategic eye on the future, mobilizing the best talent and building the right lines of business to help our customers compete in this changing world.
With this as backdrop, and modeling in an adjustment for the current pricing environment, we are slightly lowering our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.60 from our prior range of $5.48 to $5.73. Let me be clear. We remain committed to navigating today's challenges, embracing tomorrow's opportunities for our customers and shareholders.
Within our Pharmaceutical segment, revenue was up 14% versus the prior year to $28.8 billion, and segment profit declined 19% versus the prior year to $534 million. This was primarily driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing, reduced levels of branded inflation and the loss of Safeway, which we previously discussed.
However, the work that we have done over the past few years has strategically positioned us to more effectively support our customers. The range of our retail service offerings has never been stronger, and the Red Oak Sourcing venture with CVS Health continues to be an effective, productive and profitable partnership. We see this as a long-term driver of value for us and our customers. 
Our Specialty Solutions group continues to perform well, driven by both our provider-facing and biopharma offerings, once again showing strong double-digit growth. We are confident that our growing portfolio of service -- services is well aligned with and valuable to the strategies of our biopharmaceutical partners. I want to thank Jon Giacomin and his Pharma segment team for their commitment to navigating these challenging dynamics and remaining focused on our customers with a clear eye towards managing efficiency.
Our Medical segment had a strong first quarter across multiple dimensions. First, revenues for the Medical segment were up 12% versus the prior year to $3.3 billion. Second, segment profit was up 26% versus the prior year to $127 million. And third, our Medical segment customer base has been expanding, a testament to the value we've created across our lines of business and the strong partnerships we've developed with our customers. Every day, we serve customers focusing more on the total care of the patient, and they recognize the growing shift to value-based reimbursement models. Discussions with our customers reinforce that they are looking to us as a broad-based integrated solutions provider and a source of expertise across the continuum of care.
Our Cardinal Health branded products continue to be a driver of growth for the segment as we increase our account penetration, and growth in our strategic accounts is outpacing the market. During the quarter, we onboarded a large complex customer in our Medical segment. We learned a lot from this rapid deployment and we are very grateful both to our employees and to our new partner for working together to move us towards the finish line.
October 2 marked 1 year since we closed the Cordis acquisition. Don Casey and his team have done a tremendous job leading the integration, thoughtfully phasing in new systems and processes and building out an important platform. The integration of Cordis has proved to be an excellent example of how we can bring together best practices across borders. We have seen, over this past year, that taking the time to do things right is essential to best serve our customers. 
We have also seen growth in some important markets including Europe, where we believe that taking an integrated cohesive approach to our customers will position us for measurable growth over the long term.
Cordis is also providing us with additional partnership opportunities to build out our products, tools and services. As an example, we have signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Biosensors to bring their coronary interventional products to our customers in Europe and Japan as another offering in the bag to deliver even greater value.
While we are operating today in a tough and unique environment, we believe that we are well prepared to lead and quick to adapt.

I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial performance and then walk through our full year fiscal 2017 expectations. Please note that, with a",1889,"Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today to discuss the first quarter. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial performance and then walk through our full year fiscal 2017 expectations. Please note that, with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website should be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.
Our first quarter fiscal 2017 results were about as we expected with GAAP diluted EPS at $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS at $1.24, a 17% and 10% decrease, respectively. In our August call, I mentioned this would be due to some challenging trends and some tough year-over-year comps, particularly on some key generic items in our Pharmaceutical segment as well as discrete tax items, partially offset by strong performance in the Medical segment, and that's largely what we saw. I'll discuss both segments in greater detail later, but let me start with consolidated company results.
Revenues increased 14% year-over-year, totaling $32 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 1% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, primarily driven by strategic acquisitions. If you exclude acquisitions, SG&A was favorable for the quarter. Both consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined versus the prior year by 14% and 9%, respectively.
Moving below the operating line. Net interest and other expense was approximately $41 million in the quarter, a decrease versus the prior year. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 36.4%, which is 3.5 percentage points higher on a comparative basis, primarily due to several favorable discrete items that occurred in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35% and 37%.
Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 322 million, about 9 million shares fewer than the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to the benefit from our opportunistic share repurchases over the last 12 months, which includes $250 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. We have just under $800 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.
In addition, we generated approximately $104 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. And due to efficient and effective working capital management by our teams, we ended September 30 with a strong balance sheet. Our cash balance, including short-term investments, was $2.2 billion, of which $622 million were held internationally.
Now let's move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 14% to $28.8 billion. This increase was from growth in net new and existing Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, driven mainly by the win of a previously announced large mail order customer and the impact of branded inflation. While a smaller driver, the strong performance of our specialty business also drove the revenue increase.
Despite the revenue growth, segment profit for the quarter decreased 19% to $534 million. This decrease was a result of generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, reduced levels of branded inflation as well as the previously announced loss of a large Pharmaceutical Distribution customer. This was partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing. These same factors, as well as changes in our product and customer mix, mainly the onboarding of a previously discussed large mail order customer, reduced our segment profit rate by 76 basis points to 1.86%. As a reminder, next quarter, we will fully lap the onboarding of this large mail order customer.
Getting back to Red Oak. As we've mentioned in the past, if it achieves certain milestones, it would trigger the second of 2 predetermined payments beginning in FY '17. Because of excellent performance, Red Oak met these milestones, so we've made our second and final $10 million increase to the quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment is $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.
Let's now go to Medical segment performance, which had a strong first quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 12% to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by contributions from our strategic acquisitions and growth from net new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased 26% to $127 million during the quarter due to contributions from acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products. Segment profit margin rate increased 42 basis points in the quarter to 3.87%, driven by acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products, partially offset by the change in customer mix. This change primarily comes from the accelerated onboarding of a new large medical distribution customer. The recent wins in the Medical segment on the distribution side are exciting and very important. They add to our profitability, but are dilutive to our Medical segment margin rates.
Specific to Cordis, it continues to meet our performance expectations and make real and measurable progress. As we mentioned last quarter, our integration team is on track to have our operations fully stood up and exit the TSA agreements by the end of this fiscal year, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple of years. Until we exit these TSAs, they can create some variability in our segment profit rate, although this quarter, it was about on track. 
Overall, our team has done an outstanding job driving strong, healthy growth in the Medical segment.
Before moving to our fiscal year '17 outlook, you can turn to Slide #7 where you'll see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter. The $0.28 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.
Next, I'd like to discuss our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings guidance range and assumptions. But before doing that, let me comment on Q2. While we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, we want to keep you informed when there are meaningful shifts. So as it relates to the second quarter, the generic pricing environment and, to a lesser extent, the brand inflation rates lead us to now expect the second quarter fiscal 2017 Pharma segment profit decline to be relatively in line with the first quarter on a percentage basis.
Now you can follow along, starting on Slide 9 of the presentation. As George mentioned earlier, based on Q1 actuals, second quarter expectations and trends we noted, we are slightly lowering our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range we provided in August to $5.40 to $5.60 from $5.48 to $5.73. Let me give you some color around this adjustment by walking through our corporate and segment assumptions.
Turning to Slide 10. All but 2 of our fiscal year 2017 corporate assumptions remain unchanged. First, we have updated our weighted average shares outstanding assumption to 320 million to 322 million shares, which is lower than the initial range provided of 324 million to 326 million shares. This new range reflects potential additional repurchases. Second, our assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization increased to approximately 385 million or about $0.79 per share that does not affect our non-GAAP earnings.
On Slide 11, there are 3 updates to our full year Pharmaceutical segment assumptions that I would like to take a minute to highlight. First, we've previously expected Pharma segment profit for FY '17 to be essentially flat. We now expect full year segment profit to be down mid- to high single digits versus the prior year due to the generic pharmaceutical pricing environment and, while much less of an impact, lower-than-anticipated brand pharmaceutical inflation. To clarify, when we refer to generic drug pricing, we are referring to a combination of all factors affecting generic selling price, such as manufacturer inflation and deflation and customer pricing. We now expect this to be in the mid- to high single-digit deflation for the full fiscal year. Lastly, we have adjusted our brand manufacturer inflation assumptions to a range of 7% to 9% from approximately 10%. Overall, we still expect Pharma segment profit to be back half weighted.
Now turning to the Medical segment. All of our fiscal year 2017 Medical segment assumptions remain on target and unchanged. We are still on track to achieve mid-single digit percentage growth in revenue and double-digit growth in segment profit.
Now turning back to overall company guidance. Since we are slightly lowering our overall fiscal 2017 earnings guidance range to 3% to 7% growth from 5% to 9% growth versus the prior year, we've updated some of our original assumptions to achieve that growth on Slide 13. The line titled Business Growth is now assumed to be flat to 3% and capital deployment is now assumed to contribute 3% to 4% for the year. 
From a corporate standpoint, we are focused on expense management and other actions to achieve these results. Keep in mind that the benefits related to these important items are held at the corporate level and not reflected at the segment level. And while we aren't providing the EPS bridge slide we presented on our August Q4 call, you can infer that based on my comments about the generic pricing environment being more challenging, it would result in a decrease to that line item, while increasing our capital deployment assumptions would result in an increase to that line item. Net customer activity remains about the same, but our existing or remaining businesses bucket would increase as it includes the corporate actions I just referenced.
Additionally, we told you on our fourth quarter call that we were assessing the timing of the adoption of new accounting treatment for the tax effect of share-based compensation. Our 2017 guidance does not include this as we believe it is simpler to adopt the new treatment in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 according to the required schedule. So as you can see, we've now aligned our guidance range given the current pricing environment I just described.
To close, let me highlight a few key points before I turn to your questions. First, while we are experiencing a tough near-term environment, we continue to aspire the long -- to the long-term goals we communicated before. 
In our Pharmaceutical segment, we do see generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, branded inflation as challenges. However, we continue to see strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, continued focus on operational excellence and positive feedback from our robust customer base. In addition, Harvard Drug, Specialty and nuclear are all delivering value for our customers and our business.
On the Medical side, we've also won some important new Medical distribution customers, which should help us gain scale in sourcing and leverage our cost structure to create greater efficiencies.
In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our Cardinal Health brand products and services and above-market revenue growth in Cardinal Health at Home. Finally, Cordis continues to perform well, and we are confident in both the fundamental and growth initiatives in that business. 
Overall, it was a challenging quarter, but I want to acknowledge our team for their strong execution and focus in a tough environment. I believe this excellent execution and focus, combined with our broad portfolio and balanced capital deployment, will allow us to drive long-term sustainable growth.
And with that, operator, let's begin our Q&A."

And here is my perspective. There are, as I mentioned, sort of a number of factors coming together to make this a bit of a unique moment. So we're not going to overreact to that moment. Our position, our plans for growth really aren't different than -- today than they were 6 months ago. Our value proposition is very clear. We're an extraordinary, attentive partner to our customers. We have a unique ability to follow the patient across the continuum of care. The service offerings are extensive. That's really at the heart of our positioning, so that's, I think, important to state upfront. But no, I think we're describing some similar characteristics to what you describe."

Overall, it looks like the range is coming down by $0.11 at the midpoint. You talked a lot about generic inflation [ph] getting a little bit worse than previously thought and then modestly less branded inflation. But if I look at the guidance for the Pharma segment specifically, it seems like that take down in what you're assuming around profit margins there -- or overall profits there, mid- to high single digits, would actually indicate something more in the $0.25 to $0.40 headwind. So just trying to square those 2 things relative to the overall amount coming down compared to what you're suggesting is going on with the Pharma segment for the rest of the year."

Let me hit a few different things. I think, first of all, just to be clear, when we talked -- when I was talking about generic pharmaceutical pricing, I wasn't really talking about the headwind, tailwind you used to hear over the last couple of years of inflation and deflation on generic products because that's about where we model it to be this year. We're not really seeing that. We expected it to be a net deflation environment, and that's what we're seeing, so that's not really the driver. What we're talking about is more the downstream pricing component of our generic pricing. That's where we're seeing an uptick in competitiveness or a little more erosion than we had expected to be, and that really is the main driver of us taking down our Pharmaceutical Distribution numbers. And as I mentioned a couple of times, to a lesser extent, brand inflation. So we had said about 10% before on brand inflation, we're now modeling in the 7% to 9%. That impact -- I guess, I would put it this way. If that were the only thing going on this year, then it wouldn't -- we probably wouldn't be adjusting guidance. It's more the combination of the generic pricing and then that on top of that. But I think that's the first thing I wanted to say. The second thing, I can understand why you're maybe having a little trouble with your numbers. I can't quote exactly or comment on exactly what the numbers should be. But remember, I did make a comment in here that we have some significant initiatives around expenses and other initiatives that will be captured in our corporate numbers. And so those aren't going to show up in the segment numbers because we don't push those down at the end of the year. So probably the piece that you're missing as you try to reconcile having Pharma down, capital deployment up midpoint down, the last bucket that you're missing is that the corporate numbers, we're going to have savings there that will be in the overall corporate bucket."

It feels like there's a pretty big difference in the magnitude of pressure that we see in your guidance as compared to one of your peers. And Mike, I know you've been willing to go into some of the mechanics on items like brand inflation in the past. If we think about the mechanics of independent contracting, could you tell us a little bit about how much of the book is truly small and mid-sized customers versus larger buying groups of independents? And do you see significant differences in those? And maybe the last part of that would be, do you have any major contracts that may be coming up or how much -- how important are those."

Let me try a couple of things and feel free to follow up with another question if you -- if I miss it. But a couple of different things. First of all, I hate to ever comment on our competitors' numbers. We always want to be careful of those. But remember, mix matters. And what I mean by mix is how much of their mix may be brand and generic versus our mix. If you look at the other components of our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment with our growth in Specialty, nuclear and other things, so it's hard to comment on all the various moving parts of any of our competitors on what's in those segments. Second of all, I think you hit on something, which is customer repricings. And we didn't have very few -- we had -- basically, had very few major repricings this year. And honestly, over the next couple of years, we don't have a ton of those. We're in pretty good shape, particularly with some of our larger customers. And I think that may be a different thing as where we're seeing some of our competitors may or may not have more large repricings with some of their customers, which can affect each one of us in different timing within the years. And so I think it really gets back to mix of customers, timing of repricings. And those types of things can drive differences between each one of us as well as maybe the expectations that we originally set at the beginning of the year and how we looked at things."

Obviously, I've been doing this, as has Mike, for quite some time. We've lived through multiple cycles, for me, in multiple parts in the industry. You see these periods. I mentioned that this is a bit of a unique moment. You've got all of the public discourse around health care costs and Pharma costs. It's loud and it's emotional. And at the same time, health care is going through some changes. So I don't think it's shocking that there is some near-term disturbance. Experience -- my experience tells me that, over time, you see some shifting out and just, essentially, settling of the dust. Sometimes, when aggressive moves don't result in much change or value creation, then things just sort of stabilize. And so we've lived through different cycles in the past, and that's what I would expect here. For us, again, the important thing is for us is to be creating new value sources for our customers and our manufacturer partners. And we work -- you've heard the positioning that we've had over these last 7 or 8 years. It's really been about broad value creation, and we'll continue to focus on that as our priority. And I think, ultimately, the reason that our business has been improving in recent years is, essentially, the ability to create value. And so we'll continue to focus on those dynamics. But we have seen occasionally these kinds of cycles, for me over, unfortunately, many decades in different parts of the industry. So that's my general point of view."

Again, I would tell you that when it comes to the deployment of capital, we would love to find great M&A targets. That's probably where we would lean over stock repo. But we're going to stay disciplined. If we can't find the right target at the right price and it has the right culture that fits into our business, then we're not going to move forward. And if that means there is some excess cash on the balance sheet, then we will take a look at deploying that in the stock repo. So I think our pipeline is still decent right now. As you can imagine, we look at dozens of items before we ever purchase one. And so it's always hard to tell exactly when something might come out of that. But we continue to be very active on the M&A front, but won't trap cash on the balance sheet either if we can't find the right opportunities."

I did mention that in my remarks that part of the reason for our Q1 is the comps, and that's why we called out Q1 being down was. And you were right on with that we did have $0.08 last year that we called out a favorability largely from benefits related to certain competitive dynamics on a few key generic items that we thought were going to deflate last year that didn't and they stayed up. And since then, they have deflated. And then, as you mentioned, $0.03 on accelerated integration of some acquisitions. So those were favorable items last year as well as from an overall basis. Remember, we had a favorable tax component last year, too. And then in last year, we did see in the first quarter branded inflation was a little higher than we had anticipated. So that's right. Those were the positive things. You also summarized accurately the generic piece. When you really break it down into 2 components, one is the manufacturing actions, which is them either raising or lowering price. We're seeing, for instance, less inventory inflation on generics. But it's really no different than we had originally anticipated. As you mentioned -- as we've mentioned in the past, FY '14 was a good year, '15 was a solid year, and then it started coming down in '16, and we kept calling that and we said we expected that to be down. And that's how we essentially budgeted and looked at it for this year.

I don't think there is a discrete moment of change. We're obviously in the middle of a lot of things. So the election cycle, clearly, is creating on an enormous amount of discussion and noise, which I do think has an effect on the way people behave. I do think generic cycles come in lumps, and we see that they tend to have some cyclicality. We'll see some growth coming from biosimilars, which will affect the market each -- probably each product differently. And I think, again, most times in competitive moments, you have companies just adjusting to what's working and what's not. And so that's my experience over a lot of years.

We've heard from a number of manufacturers that they are lowering their expectation into what their price inflation will be in calendar '17, so I want to understand that, number one. And number two, I just want to understand -- because the way I've historically thought about this is, is that, that 15% that's on a contingent basis was probably more profitable than a fee-for-service contract.

But that all being said, really, January, as you know, our Q3 or the first quarter of a calendar year is always a big quarter for the branded manufacturer price increases. And the 7% to 9% is really an average for the entire year. So while it's a little lighter than we would have expected now, that's what we're building in to why we're lowering is that we would expect it to, hopefully, after election and looking at all those other components, we'll see a little bit more normalcy, probably not as high, obviously, as what it used to be, but we think we'll get back into that 7% to 9% range.

So you're making Don happy, a question on Medical. So let me just give you a perspective. Our go-to-market model over recent years has really been focused broadly on a couple of really important changes. A lot of our customers are getting much more complex. They're bigger systems. So what historically might have been a single hospital is now an academic medical center, plus some community hospitals, plus a few surgery centers and oncology clinics and now some doctors' offices. That requires a different partner. I think our ability -- and we've seen this. We built our business around that expectation. And I think what's happening is our ability to serve across that continuum of care to create value in different ways for systems that are much more complex than they once were is important. And one of the shifts I want to describe is a little bit more of an elevation of those conversations, away from the purely departmentally driven ones into a conversation that's more broadly at the system level. I think that's playing to our strength. Now again, we have to be very strong in each of the departments. We have to be content experts, and we are still that. But I do think that the reason that we've been growing, I think, is largely that we're positioning well to adapt. And we anticipated these changes in the way that these big health systems were going to look. And I think that's been beneficial to us."

We can be more meaningful to them. And I think it would be -- I don't think we should also ignore the fact that we've given a lot of energy to the Cordis business. So we've put some great people in charge in there. It's a business that we're paying a lot of attention to. Don, himself, has a lot of experience in this area, as does David Wilson, who's running it. And so I think there's a lot to be said for when you have people that are excited, know you're investing in the business, really are committed to that, and we've hired some great people that, I think, that's driving some of the things we're seeing in Cordis, too."

As far as what's going on back-half weighted, some of it has just to do with comps and things that are going to happen in the quarters, like branded inflation tends to always be stronger in our Q3. And we have a lot of other initiatives that we're working on that we believe will deliver value in the second half. Remember, we have the step-up in Cordis that impacted our Q2 and Q3 last year that doesn't impact our Q2 and Q3 this year. Plus, we'll have a full year of growing and getting after that business as well as onboarding some other new customers.
