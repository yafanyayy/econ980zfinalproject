We delivered strong results in our fiscal 2016, with sales growing 8% and earnings per share climbing 18% in constant currency before charges. This performance contributed to stellar first half results, as co",2499,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in our fiscal 2016, with sales growing 8% and earnings per share climbing 18% in constant currency before charges. This performance contributed to stellar first half results, as cost of currency sales also rose 8% and EPS was 70% higher before charges. Our company is helping to drive the momentum in global prestige beauty, which is resilient and growing despite significant economic volatility. We are strengthening our leadership by growing approximately twice as fast the industry. Our success in this volatile environment has been driven by our broadly diversified business, powered by our multiple engines of growth, coupled with investment activity and strong execution. This was achieved, thanks to our talented and experienced leaders and global workforce. We are not over-reliant of any 1 category, channel or country, which help cushion us somewhat from regional slowdowns or political strife. 
We reacted quickly to unexpected events and volatility during the quarter and reallocated our investment spending, capitalizing on the best opportunities as condition changed. To cite some examples, we reduced the investment in Hong Kong, which continued to decline and increased support in Canada, the U.K. in other fast-growth markets. As the makeup category surged globally, we invested more in M-A-C to raising momentum and in popular launches for our Estée Lauder and Clinique brands to leverage their accelerating makeup growth. 
In travel retail, we accelerated our brand expansion into Europe, which enjoyed stronger traffic tourists. Seeing a growing demand in our direct-to-consumer business, we accelerated development of the commerce sites and freestanding stores in several markets. Our strategy is to invest dynamically in our strengths, which added fuel to our momentum and helped us driving terrific results. Thanks to the strategic resource allocation, we had constant currency gain across the broad -- the board of our regions and categories by intentionally accelerating investment in selected winning areas. We generated stronger results in our makeup and luxury brands, direct-to-consumer channels and the Europe, Middle East & Africa region, where we gained significant share. Even with formidable competition, we believe we are expanding our leading position in skin care and makeup combined in Western Europe and in emerging markets in that region.
Our strong overall results were especially encouraging in light of some difficult macro issues, including a depressed retail climate in Hong Kong and softer market growth in China as well as worsening currency headwinds, especially in certain emerging markets. Although we expect economic and geopolitical volatility to continue throughout the balance of the fiscal year, we believe we can successfully navigate the instabilities because of our strong positions in the categories, channels and regions with the strongest sustainable growth. 
We anticipated many of the major trends driving global prestige beauty today. We are able to leverage the increasing growth the industry is experiencing in direct-to-consumer channels, such as online and retail stores as well as travel retail and specialty stores category into a growing numbers of beauty consumers. We were a pioneer in online beauty, recognizing early on that the channel would be increasing important for marketing, communication and shopping convenience. Today, we are among the largest and most established player in online prestige beauty and have enjoyed extraordinary growth. This fiscal year, we expect our online sales from our brand sites and retailer sites to top $1 billion for the first time, representing a doubling of the business in just 3 years. 
Our digital success comes from having a diverse entrepreneurial team, more than half of whom are millenials, and they quickly adapt to business to changing landscapes. Our websites offer a desirable luxury experience and have become major contributors to brand growth.
The holiday quarter was a pivotal time for e-commerce as more consumer opted for the convenience of shopping online. Online sales accelerated for various product categories, and beauty was no exception. Our E&M-commerce business captured the increased volume and generated nearly 30% growth in the quarter. On Cyber Monday, sales of our North America brand sites were more than 50% higher than last year. On Single Days in China, sales of our 5 flagship sites on Tmall more than doubled, led by Estée Lauder and Clinique. Many global metrics of our brand sites improved, included a number of orders which rose 27%. 
In mobile, they came in even larger portion of our sales, accounting for 36% of all online transactions. During the quarter, we added 69 brand retailers and third-party sites worldwide. Linking our brand sites to our freestanding store is key to enabling an omnichannel experience, which is an important evolving trend in retailing. 
We have launched numerous pilot programs and are building omnichannel capability to begin to seamlessly connect consumer across our brand sites and our freestanding stores globally. We are exploring many different approaches and learning what's successful. For example, we launched online booking for a makeup services in the U.K. and the U.S. and are finding that over half of the appointments in M-A-C new makeup studio in Manhattan has been made online. In the U.K., several of our brands offer cross-channel gift cards that can be redeemed online and in our freestanding stores. And in October, Bobbi Brown had an interactive beauty class that generated more than 1.1 million social media impressions. 
Today, we have approximately 1,500 freestanding stores worldwide that are managed directly by our company or our partners. As we expand our number of highly productivity stores, we are testing new concepts. Origins discover retail design, which illustrate the journey from plant to product, is being rolled out globally. M-A-C First Makeup Studio is a service-based store that we believe will provide an additional revenue stream. M-A-C freestanding stores are a key growth engine and account for approximately 1/3 of its global sales today.
Leveraging a growing demand for prestige beauty in Brazil, 2 of our luxury brands are entering the country with standalone stores. La Mer recently opened in a luxury shopping mall in São Paulo where it offers treatment, and Jo Malone will soon follow. One of the 30 stores it plans to add globally this year. Our M-A-C and Clinique brands have been standing and freestanding store in Brazil now for several years. We also anticipated the specialty-multi will be a fast growing beauty channel. In the quarter, our strongest sales growth in North America was in this channel, which saw a robust retail sales through all our brands. Many of our brands are increasing their penetration with the upper- retailers. 
As I mentioned on our last call, one of our exciting initiative comes from the Estée Lauder brand, which relaunched its Estée Edit group of products in 320 North America Sephora stores and on sephora.com in mid-March. Inspired by today young consumers, the Estée Edit line delivers instant visible benefits centered from the team beauty is an attitude. Aimed directly at millenials and promoted on social media, the Estée Edit is part of a strategic effort to modernize the Estée Lauder brand for long-term growth and see the next generation of consumer while continuing to appeal to its core consumers. 
Additionally, in Sephora, Bobbi Brown to doors U.S. this spring, and GLAMGLOW reinforced its popularity with the launch of lip treatment products, which become best sellers there. 
In international markets, La Mer launched in the Mecca specialty chain in Australia, and in Europe Bubble and bumble and Smashbox had good growth in boots. Douglas accounts for 1/3 of our business in Germany, and our retail sales there grew double digits in the quarter. 
Our brands continue to perform well also in higher-end department stores globally. However, in mid-tier North America department store, some of our brands are experience softness, although they showed solid increase online. 
Travel retail is another long-term growth engine of our business that improved in the channel as well. Importantly, in the quarter, our net sales, retail sales and traffic growth all grew mid-single digits. We change in travel pattern shifting where consumer buy, we redeployed some of our investment activities through the corridors with the most touristic traffic. Korea returned to growth after concerns about MERS is -- and Europe was robust as the weak euro attracted tourists. 
Hong Kong remained soft also in travel retail channel as the market in the corridor -- also in the corridors frequented by Russians and Brazilians. Overall, in travel retail, we had double-digit retail growth in-house of our top 30 markets. Mirroring our broader company strategy, we continue to diversify our travel retail business by expanding our brands in more location and opening more doors. The preorder business, where travelers order products online and pick them up in the airport, had a strong increase. Healthy passenger traffic growth is projected across all regions this fiscal year.
Touching on some of the key geographies. The Korean market continued to rebound, and our business is posting solid growth and gaining share, driven largely by our makeup brands, which are effectively leveraging important Korean trends and demonstrating our ability to successfully compete with local brands. 
In China, nearly all our brands grew double digits, while prestige beauty growth slowed, our business there grew a solid 9%, exceeding growth in prestige. Our results reflect our strategy to diversify our business by expanding our portfolio, channels, cities and products. Our makeup and fragrance business has been growing rapidly in what has traditionally been a skin care-oriented market, demonstrating our strategy to align our multiple engine of growth with local market dynamics.
The economic environment and beauty market growth in emerging markets overall has slowed. While we are not immune for -- to soft local economic conditions, our business in emerging markets other than China continue to be very robust, rising 27% in the quarter, approximately 3x the growth of prestige beauty in those countries. 
We are committed to these markets and plan to invest more in this time of softness to leverage our momentum, increase our market share, resulting in a much stronger position when these economies will improve again. 
Around the world, makeup proved again to be a strong growth engines, a trend that we had anticipated and prepared for, which is evident in our results. For the quarter, our makeup business grew 13% in constant currency. Our 3 makeup brands are clearly benefiting. M-A-C and Smashbox especially up strong double digits. But so are our multi-category brands. Estée Lauder and Clinique makeup sales grew in every region. Foundation has been very strong across our brands, and we had 4 of the top 5 foundations in the U.S. in 2015. Among Estée Lauder's best products was Double Wear Stay In Place liquid foundation, a strong's seller decades after its launch. This core product was the best-selling foundation in the U.S. according to NPD. For the quarter and also the 2015 calendar year, with sales up more than 20%. Clinique launched Beyond Perfecting foundation plus concealer in Asia, which established the new makeup pillar for the brand and drove strong foundation growth in the region. This success in foundation is one of the key factors driving the improvement in Estée Lauder and Clinique. We have chosen to reemphasize makeup in these brands to help ignite their businesses. Estée Lauder progress is modernizing modernizing the brand and emphasizing local relevant product drove its higher sales, particularly in certain Asian and European markets. While skin care is its largest business, especially in Asia, the brand's substantial makeup portfolio is attracting younger consumers. It is creating a vibrant digital strategy with newsworthy updates and enhanced storytelling to communicate with consumer 24/7. Clinique greater emphasis on makeup, especially some color products, is creating a stronger emotional connection with millenials, which is helping to stabilize its performance and drive growth. It is announcing consultant training, distorting key products and testing new store formats that's colorful, high energy, modular and engages consumers. The first pilot of the new freestanding store model opened in Hong Kong 2 months ago, and sales are up sharply in what is reasonably a relatively depressed market. 
Our strategy of having multiple engines of growth extends to our innovation program, which develops desirable technologies and concept across our product category and brands. Our innovation isn't just about creating big blockbusters, and our success isn't based solely on the newest product for each brand. Instead, an important impact of our launches is to pull consumers into stores, traffic and drive sales. Some shoppers do come to buy the latest lip shade, but many others gravitate on our staples, which accounts for the vast majority of our sales. 
Let me give you example of some recent and upcoming products by category. In skin care, Estée Lauder New Advance Night Repair power foil mask is a global launch with a focus in Asia, where masks are extremely popular. This offers key technology and extends this important franchise. Estée Lauder New Dimension serum was successful in many markets in Europe and Asia, offsetting lower-than-expected results in North America. La Mer introduced the Renewal Oil, a luxury entry in the popular oil subcategory, and it has exceeded expectation in many markets. Clinique built a franchise around its M-A-C serum by extending it with moisturizer and treatment oils. In the makeup category, foundation have been strong sellers. Several of our brands, including Estée Lauder and Bobbi Brown, are introducing Cushion Compass, which is a growing segment and has been popular with consumers. The strong growth in our high-end fragrances brands is another important element of our strategy that is working very well. The combination of Tom Ford, Jo Malone and recent acquisitions are generating sustainable profitable growth, and we continue to expand distribution and rollout exciting new scents. We had had a variety of fragrance launches across prestige points, and many of them as well as attractive sets were popular gifts for the holidays. With an eye towards spring, Jo Malone, Garden collection will offer 5 different colognes.
Looking at the balance of our fiscal year, we are confident in our sound strategy and are choosing to increase investment in the strongest areas of our business. These investments will include more advertising, building freestanding stores and e-commerce sites, R&D and travel retail expansion. We are further fueling our growth momentum by investing in our winners and continues to build mobile market share. There are, of course, many macro factors beyond our control as lower markets to overcome. We believe, however, that our diversification, multiple engines of growth, strong innovation, financial agility and superb execution, we will generate excellent growth. We also continue working to find ways to better leverage this growth in the longer term. 
With this confidence, we are raising the lower end of our sales guidance and now expect to deliver 7% to 8% growth in constant currency as well as continuing to forecast double-digit EPS growth for fiscal 2016, delivering another year of strong results while continue to build sustainable profitable growth engines.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey."

I will first review our fiscal 2016 second quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. My commentary does exclude the impact of restructuring and other c",1842,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I will first review our fiscal 2016 second quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. My commentary does exclude the impact of restructuring and other charges. Net sales for the second quarter were upwards $3.12 billion, up 8% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 70 basis points of this sales growth. Once again, the strongest geographic performance this quarter came from the Europe, Middle East & Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 13% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in virtually every market. A continuation of strong local demand for our products, increased tourist traffic in certain cities and our selective brand distribution expansion contributed to double-digit increases in all major Western markets. Sales growth in France was slower than last quarter as the attacks in mid-November understandably curtailed both shopping and tourism in Paris. 
All emerging markets in the region saw double-digit gains, led by Russia, Turkey and the Middle East. Our net sales in the global travel retail channel rose 5%, as double-digit gains in many countries and a strong return to growth in Korea were partially offset by continued declines in both Hong Kong and Brazil. Overall, passenger traffic growth is strong, and our growth at retail and net reflected this strength in the quarter.
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. China rose 9% with e-commerce sales growing nearly 80%, thanks in part to the success of Singles Day on November 11, when our sales more than doubled versus prior year. Our online sales for the quarter rose to nearly 13% of our total China business. We delivered solid growth in our core markets of Korea and Japan, while some of the smaller emerging markets in the region rose double digits. 
Australia also delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth. These strong results were partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong, where sales decreased by high single digits on top of a meaningful decline last year. A sharp continuation of the decline in tourist flows from China that began last year, combined with both the Chinese yuan devaluing this fiscal year and Chinese tourists continuing to travel more to other destinations in Europe and Asia, is creating further weakness and local sales in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, the region sales would have grown more than 8%.
Net sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency. Strong double-digit growth continued across Latin America, led by Brazil and Mexico. North American sales grew low single digits, which reflected double-digit growth in Canada and low single-digit growth in the U.S. Sales were strongest in the U.S. and specialty-multi, online and high-end department store channels, while tourist-driven doors in all channels have been adversely affected by the strong dollar. 
Our sales in mid-tier department stores continued to be soft in brick-and-mortar, while the related retailer online business was up sharply. Our holiday sales were broadly in line with our expectations, although the environment this year was more promotional than the prior year. 
In constant currency, net sales in every product category grew this quarter with double-digit growth in makeup, fragrance and hair care. Makeup sales rose 13% in constant currency. M-A-C, Tom Ford and Smashbox all rose strong double digits due to the success of key recent product launches, further distribution expansion and solid like-door growth. Tom Ford lips and voice collection, which originally launched last holiday season, continued to be particularly strong this year. Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Estée Lauder Rose mid- to high single digits in makeup, primarily due to strengthening their product offerings and their support behind the fast-growing lip and foundation categories. Fragrance category sales rose 12% in constant currency during the important holiday gifting season. Double-digit gains from Jo Malone and Tom Ford and incremental sales from our newer brands, Le Labo and Frederic Malle, drove the majority of growth. Within other Designer Fragrances, Michael Kors Gold collection and Tory Burch also contributed to growth, and Estée Lauder's Modern Muse Larouche were launched this fall grew the overall Modern Muse franchise. Hair care sales increased 14% in constant currency, with growth from both Aveda and Bumble and bumble. Aveda launched Tonic and Sham Pure dry shampoo, which also benefited from continued growth in existing products, such as The Curly. The brand expanded its presence in travel retail and delivered strong salon growth in Western Europe, and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in the specialty-multi channel. Skin care sales rose 2% in constant currency. Skin care continues to be the dominant beauty category in China and Hong Kong, where there has been more challenging macro trends that have contributed to the category's slower global growth. La Mer rose double digits. Origins and Just Our generated solid growth, and GLAMGLOW represented incremental sales growth in skin care. Estée Lauder achieved modest growth due to recent launches, and Clinique declined slightly in the quarter. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was comparable to the prior year at 81.2% of sales. Favorabilities in our supply chain were offset by the category mix with the slower growth in skin care and some higher promotional expenses over the holidays. 
Operating expenses as a percent of sales were in line with the prior year quarter at 60.4%. Increases were primarily due to higher store operating costs, which reflected over 130 new freestanding retail store openings over the past year, offset by improvements in selling, shipping and other expenses.
As a result, operating income of $647.9 million was 2% above the prior year, and operating margin was unchanged at 20.8%. Our constant currency operating margin improved 60 basis points, primarily due to expense leverage. Net earnings were $458.6 million or 5% above the prior year quarter, reflecting a 230 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate, which was partially driven by a discrete tax credit in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.22 was 8% above the prior year, including the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger-than-expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of better sales performance across most of our brands and continued strong expense management as we navigated the volatile macro environment. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.01 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.11 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 18%.
We recorded $18.5 million in charges before tax or $0.03 per share for the transition of our global technology infrastructure to a new platform that we announced to you last quarter. As we mentioned previously, for the full fiscal year, we expect to record charges for this transition of between $40 million and $50 million before tax or approximately $0.07 to $0.09 per share. 
Continued progress in our working capital initiatives, along with favorable currency translation, contributed to a 7-day improvement in inventory days to sell through the end of December. These improvements were partially offset by the inventory build necessary to meet our future sales growth objectives and the additional inventory from our new brands.
For the 6 months ended December 31, we generated $962 million in cash flows from operating activities, 3% less than the comparable period last year. The prior year cash flow benefited from the SMI sales shift. Excluding the impact of the shift from last year, operating cash flow this year rose 17%. We invested $223 million in capital expenditures, primarily to support new retail stores, counters, systems and office space.
We utilized $628 million in cash to repurchase approximately 7.6 million shares of our stock, 1.2 million more than the same period last year. We also distributed $201 million in dividends to stockholders.
So that concludes our results for the second quarter and the half year. Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year and the third quarter. For the full year, the sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact comparisons to the prior year. I will now discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift. Our forecasted growth rates both before and after the shift impact are available in today's earnings release for your reference. Also excluded again for the full year is the impact of restructuring and other charges.
So reflecting our strong first half performance, we have raised the low end of our guidance range and now expect full year sales growth of between 7% and 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency has become an even greater headwind, and we now estimate that translation could negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 5 percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of January of $1.08 for the euro, $1.43 for the pound and $1.18 [ph] for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.07 and $3.12, including $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions. The increased currency headwinds are now projected to affect EPS by about $0.29, which is $0.05 more than we projected when we last gave guidance. 
Our strong first half performance gave us comfort to increase our investments in the second half of the fiscal year to support new innovation, additional freestanding store acceleration, omnichannel pilots, travel retail and the Estée Edit, which should allow us to continue to fuel profitable growth. And while we remain on track to deliver $200 million of cost savings this year, we will also continue to look for ways to further improve our leverage in the future. We continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12% in constant currency. 
In the third quarter, our sales are expected to rise 6% to 7% in constant currency, including 70 basis points from acquisitions as we anniversary our strongest sales growth quarter from last year. The impact of foreign currency is anticipated to reduce growth by approximately 4 percentage points. Our third quarter diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.53 and $0.58, including approximately $0.03 per share of adverse currency translation and approximately $0.02 dilution from acquisitions. This estimate reflects our highest quarter of planned advertising and promotional spending as a percent of sales in the third quarter and is deployed behind key activities such as the global launch of Estée Lauder's new advanced Night Repair power foil mask, the U.S. introduction of the Estée Edit collection and Sephora as well as a variety of activities in the makeup category across multiple brands. 
We delivered strong sales and earnings growth and showed solid progress in our strategic initiatives in the first half of the fiscal year while managing through a volatile global macro environment. We are encouraged by our results thus far, and the scope of activities we have planned throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, which should support our continued growth momentum for this fiscal year and beyond. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

First, Fabrizio, can you maybe talk about some of the structural steps you've taken to enable that flexibility? Because I think there's some debate out there as to how much of what we're seeing is skill and a function of institutionalized discipline versus simply you benefiting from a spate of good luck that might eventually run out. That would be my first question. And then second, Tracey, can you talk about how the theme of agility relates to your ability to protect margins and profit? Because I'm struck by the fact that here we are, you just beat the top end of your Q2 guidance by $0.14. And none of that is being passed through to your full year guidance to insulate the P&L from incremental FX pressure. And maybe that's prudent on your part to think that it is. But at the same time, I thought with the top line strength, all the pricing levers you have some of your productivity efforts that there'd be more ability to be nimble and agile on that front as well and avoid that guy don't. So I just love your thoughts there, too."

Now on agility, as we discussed, so first of all, we monitor the changes around the world. So the first institutional model is a continuous monitoring of the changes.

So the first institutional model is a continuous monitoring of the changes. Example, traveling corridor and tourists flow, markets grows in different levels. We have now new level of analytics and follow up on how the business evolves. So understanding. The second institution is then we tailor launches -- product launches assortment based on what we learn regularly. Third is when markets overdeliver their financial trends, they get more opportunity to spend. And when they market than to underdeliver, they tend to cover at least part of what they cover for that profit pressure that they are under. So these automatic mechanisms are anyway generating flows or resources automatically to the winning part of our business. Third, the way people collaborate is completely different today. We collaborate, we make decisions together. And so the ability to flow in an agile way, both resources and money and make fast decision on locations is taken at the top of the company in a collaborative way. Those are institutional way, which are here to stay and actually, the way we work across every quarter. So assume that we -- once we decide to plan, we constantly work to improve it quarter by quarter, month by month, and the company does this in a structural way. Second point, before Tracey answer the second part of your question. I would like to say that the -- in reality, what we are doing is focusing even more on growth even in the second semester. We have so many winning opportunity. And our location methodologies are working, and our ability to build the top line in a sustainable way for the long term is definitely the most important priority for sustainable double-digit EPS growth in the long term. So our point of view is that moving the lower end of our top line sales strength from the 6% to 8% -- we have a 6% to 8%. So moving from closer to the 6% to closer to the 8% in a sustainable way has much more value for our shareholders in the long term than just covering currencies in the short term. So our approach is to focus on long-term top line growth acceleration. And in a moment, where the environment out there is volatile and we have proven that in volatile environment, we have a competitive advantage we have been able to operate. We want to leverage that momentum and get this competitive advantage through. That's what we're doing that's why we have decided not to cover currency. We trim investment in the short term that we didn't feel was the long-term priority."

So it's important for us to invest not only for this fiscal year, but obviously, to continue the growth momentum beyond this fiscal year."

So it's not only a distribution game, it's also a marketing game. These channels require different marketing and selling techniques than the traditional department store core business that we have around the world. And so overtime, I believe our organization is becoming better and better in partnering with specialty retailers around the world and learning how to grow our business in this channel better and better. The third thing is so you can expect that the percentage of our business in which we grow, but this is very different by country around the world, depending on the penetration of this channel. So I will not give, frankly, detail on percentages also because they will be very much the results of mix by geographies rather than on specific advancement in a given brand or in a given country.

So on Estée Edit, so first of all, Estée Edit is exclusive to Sephora and will be launched in Sephora brick-and-mortar and sephora.com. And it's been developed also in 3 collaboration with the Sephora teams. The Estée edit is focused on makeup, but includes also some I will collect instant skin care benefit products plus some core SKUs of Estée Lauder business. This brand will be supported by a very strong social media and very strong digital activities really focused on the millennials and in cooperation also with magazines that support the magazine and social media activities. So will be a strong launch. In terms of impact for the long term, obviously will depend from the success. We have a very strong belief that this will be a strong success. And in case of success, we assume it will be expanded to more Sephora doors over time obviously. But we will need first to test and see the success level that we get. Now in terms of the quarter, remember, this is launched in March 15, mid-March, so the impact on third quarter is relatively limited. But we hope that the impact on fiscal year '17, '18 will be obviously be much stronger when success will happen. The other important aspect of Estée Edit is that it's not only it's going to be hopefully a success in sales, but it's also very important way to attract millennials to the Estée Lauder brand and is one of the steps to modernize the Estée Lauder brand as a whole in our opinion. On Lauder and Clinique, the Lauder and Clinique combined grew about 1% in the quarter 2, so which is a turnaround. This was in quarter 2 specifically was driven by Estée Lauder growth as Tracey explained in her remarks. But the important point is that both Lauder and Clinique are growing again on the makeup business, which is in the case of the Clinique, a very deeper scent in the case of Lauder is more representative of global business because of the big Asia penetration of skin care, but still in many countries is the bigger part of the business of these 2 brands. So that's the important reality. We said that he would have started turning around to grow these 2 brands for starting from makeup and then following to skin care. On skin care it's frankly difficult to imagine that skin care will also start growing again within this fiscal year with Hong Kong in the situation in which it is and with China market growth in skin care being so soft. As I said before, China market growth is mainly driven by makeup, and the skin care is not growing very aggressively. So -- but as soon as the Asia skin care dynamic will find back a normalized growth, we will complete the turnaround also on the skin care front of these 2 brands. That's our assumption for the fiscal year."

So first of all, we are applying to travel retail the same multiple engines of growth, diversification and investment agility philosophy that we are applying to the entire company. So as you said, travel retail has been having some outstanding momentum for years based on the Asian travelers acceleration. And in this moment, the Asian dynamic, particularly the Hong Kong-Macau one, which is the worrying one and it's been soft -- very soft in quarter 2 than we predict the to stay in the past. But in reality, it's not the traffic which is declining. It's where consumer are going and how much they're shopping. So we are reacting to that. We are increasing brand distribution. Yes, we are increasing penetration of airports where the traffic is going now, meaning more Europe and more other areas of Asia, for example. We are adjusting assortments to the new corridor, to the new traveling corridor. So give you an example. The moment Brazilians don't travel anymore as much as they used to. And when they travel, they shop less, we adjust assortments. And in these places like Miami, now there are more different kind of travelers to which we adjust. And there are other brands that today are not there that are better suited different group of travelers. That's previous brand that we had before that more suited to Brazilian as an example. This is happening all over the world. So this adjustment in assortment, this increasing number of brands, this penetration on more airports and most importantly, it's a dynamic adjustment to the corridor traveling -- to the corridor travelers. So that's the first theme, which is about traffic management. The second theme is about conversion. And what is changing is that all these currency changes in travel retail, the currency changes are changing the dynamic of the duty-free aspect, the discounts of the consumer found around the world versus their home market. And that's why for example, makeup is growing much better in travel retail, makeup is much more purchased because of the conversion marketing from traveler to buyer rather than for big discounts also they get discounts per piece in absolute term much smaller. So we are learning to increase subcategories in travel retail where we were not as penetrated as we were in skin care like some makeup. We are learning that our high-end fragrances, like Jo Malone, are extremely successful in travel retail. So we are expanding the high-end, sophisticated artist known fragrances, including our new acquisition will be part of that. That is a very big opportunity. Also, because as you know, fragrance is a very big market in travel retail. And we are learning more marketing techniques to convert traveler into purchaser, based for example, M-A-C the makeup artist. Jo Malone is adding gifts methodologies in travel retail. So making sure that are more reasons to buy in travel retail than just lower prices than in the home markets. So that's the entire strategy. It's a pretty sophisticated strategy and as everything we are doing is about the long-term sustained growth of this very important and profitable channel."

But they're much more reduced than they used to be in the past. So the second part is where are the strengths, the weakness of China. Our strategy in China, like the one I explained for travel retail, is about diversification. So China is softer in this moment in the biggest skin care segment in the biggest cities, Shanghai, Beijing is while China growth is a very strong in Tier 2, Tier 3 cities. It's very strong online. It's very strong in smaller brands, which are entering in the areas in makeup and fragrances are fast-growing categories for this population you're so again, it's about diversification. If you have multiple engines of growth and you can operate in new cities, you can operate online. You can operate in new growing segment like some makeup and some fragrance -- high-end fragrance segments. There is enormous amount of growth opportunity in China. And that is the diversification multiple growth of that year doing also there and which are driving our results.

We delivered strong results in our fiscal 2016, with sales growing 8% and earnings per share climbing 18% in constant currency before charges. This performance contributed to stellar first half results. Cost",2504,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in our fiscal 2016, with sales growing 8% and earnings per share climbing 18% in constant currency before charges. This performance contributed to stellar first half results. Cost of currency sales also rose 8% and EPS was 70% higher before charges. Our company is helping to drive the momentum in global prestige beauty, which is resilient and growing despite significant economic volatility. We are strengthening our leadership by growing approximately twice as fast the industry. Our success in this volatile environment has been driven by our broadly diversified business, powered by our multiple engines of growth, coupled with investment agility and strong execution. This was achieved, thanks to our talented and experienced leaders and global workforce. We are not over-reliant of any one category, channel or country, which help cushion us somewhat from regional slowdowns or political strife.
We reacted quickly to unexpected events and volatility during the quarter and reallocated our investment spending, capitalizing on the best opportunities as condition changed. To cite some examples, we reduced the investment in Hong Kong, which continue to decline, and increased support in Canada, the U.K., in other fast-growth markets. As the makeup category surged globally, we invested more in M-A-C's raising momentum and in popular launches for our Estée Lauder and Clinique brands to leverage their accelerating makeup growth.
In travel retail, we accelerated our brand expansion into Europe, which enjoyed stronger traffic tourists.
Seeing a growing demand in our direct-to-consumer business, we accelerated development of the commerce sites and freestanding stores in several markets. Our strategy is to invest dynamically in our strengths, which added fuel to our momentum and helped us driving terrific results. Thanks to the strategic resource allocation, we had constant currency gain across the board of our regions and categories. By intentionally accelerating investment in selected winning areas, we generated stronger results in our makeup and luxury brands, direct-to-consumer channels and the Europe, Middle East & Africa region, where we gained significant share. Even with formidable competition, we believe we are expanding our leading position in skin care and makeup combined in Western Europe and in emerging markets in that region.
Our strong overall results were especially encouraging in light of some difficult macro issues, including a depressed retail climate in Hong Kong and softer market growth in China as well as worsening currency headwinds, especially in certain emerging markets. Although we expect economic and geopolitical volatility to continue throughout the balance of the fiscal year, we believe we can successfully navigate the instabilities because of our strong positions in the categories, channels and regions with the strongest sustainable growth.
We anticipated many of the major trends driving global prestige beauty today. We are able to leverage the increasing growth the industry is experiencing in direct-to-consumer channels, such as online and retail stores as well as travel retail and specialty stores category, into a growing numbers of beauty consumers. We were a pioneer in online beauty, recognizing early on that the channel would be increasing important for marketing, communication and shopping convenience. Today, we are among the largest and most established player in online prestige beauty and have enjoyed extraordinary growth. This fiscal year, we expect our online sales from our brand sites and retailer sites to top $1 billion for the first time, representing a doubling of the business in just 3 years.
Our digital success comes from having a diverse entrepreneurial team, more than half of whom are millennials, and they quickly adapt to business, to changing landscapes. Our websites offer a desirable luxury experience and have become major contributors to brand growth.
The holiday quarter was a pivotal time for e-commerce as more consumer opted for the convenience of shopping online. Online sales accelerated for various product categories, and beauty was no exception. Our e- and m-commerce business captured the increased volume and generated nearly 30% growth in the quarter. On Cyber Monday, sales of our North America brand sites were more than 50% higher than last year.  Singles' Day in China, sales of our 5 flagship sites on Tmall more than doubled, led by Estée Lauder and Clinique. Many global metrics of our brand sites improved, including a number of orders which rose 27%. And mobile became an even larger portion of our sales, accounting for 36% of all online transactions. 
During the quarter, we added 69 brand retailers and third-party sites worldwide. Linking our brand sites to our freestanding store is key to enabling an omnichannel experience, which is an important evolving trend in retailing.
We have launched numerous pilot programs and are building omnichannel capability to begin to seamlessly connect consumer across our brand sites and our freestanding stores globally. We are exploring many different approaches and learning what's successful. For example, we launched online booking for makeup services in the U.K. and the U.S. and are finding that over half of the appointments in M-A-C new makeup studio in Manhattan have been made online. In the U.K., several of our brands offer cross-channel gift cards that can be redeemed online and in our freestanding stores. And in October, Bobbi Brown had an interactive beauty class that generated more than 1.1 million social media impressions.
Today, we have approximately 1,500 freestanding stores worldwide that are managed directly by our company or our partners. As we expand our number of highly productivity stores, we are testing new concepts. Origins discover retail design, which illustrate the journey from plant to product, is being rolled out globally. M-A-C first makeup studio is a service-based store that we believe will provide an additional revenue stream. M-A-C freestanding stores are a key growth engine and account for approximately 1/3 of its global sales today.
Leveraging a growing demand for prestige beauty in Brazil, 2 of our luxury brands are entering the country with stand-alone stores. La Mer recently opened in a luxury shopping mall in São Paulo where it offers spa treatment, and Jo Malone will soon follow, one of the 30 stores it plans to add globally this fiscal year. Our M-A-C and Clinique brands have been a standing and freestanding store in Brazil now for several years.
We also anticipated that specialty-multi will be a fast-growing beauty channel. In the quarter, our strongest sales growth in North America was in this channel, which saw robust retail sales through all our brands. Many of our brands are increasing their penetration with the appropriate retailers. 
As I mentioned on our last call, one of our exciting initiative comes from the Estée Lauder brand, which we launched its Estée Edit group of products in 320 North America Sephora stores and on sephora.com in mid-March. Inspired by today's young consumers, the Estée Edit line delivers instant visible benefits centered on the theme ""beauty is an attitude."" Aimed directly at millennials and promoted on social media, the Estée Edit is part of a strategic effort to modernize the Estée Lauder brand for long-term growth and see the next generation of consumer while continuing to appeal to its core consumers.
Additionally, in Sephora, Bobbi Brown plans to add more doors in the U.S. this spring, and GLAMGLOW reinforced its popularity with the launch of lip treatment products, which become best sellers there. 
In international markets, La Mer launched in the Mecca specialty chain in Australia. And in Europe, Bumble and bumble and Smashbox had good growth in Boots. Douglas accounts for 1/3 of our business in Germany, and our retail sales there grew double digits in the quarter.
Our brands continued to perform well also in higher-end department stores globally. However, in mid-tier North America department store, some of our brands experienced softness, although they showed solid increase online. 
Travel retail is another long-term growth engine of our business that improved in the channel as well. Importantly, in the quarter, our net sales, retail sales and traffic growth all grew mid-single digits. With changing travel pattern shifting where and what consumer buy, we redeployed some of our investment activities to the corridors with the most touristic traffic. Korea returned to growth after concerns about MERS eased and Europe was robust as the weak euro attracted tourists. Hong Kong remained soft also in travel retail channel, as the market in the corridor -- also in the corridors frequented by Russians and Brazilians. 
Overall, in travel retail, we had double-digit retail growth in-house of our top 30 markets. 
Mirroring our broader company strategy, we continue to diversify our travel retail business by expanding our brands in more location and opening more doors. The preorder business, where travelers order products online and pick them up in the airport, had a strong increase. Healthy passenger traffic growth is projected across all regions this fiscal year.
Touching on some of the key geographies. The Korean market continued to rebound. And our business is posting solid growth and gaining share, driven largely by our makeup brands, which are effectively leveraging important Korean trends and demonstrating our ability to successfully compete with local brands.
In China, nearly all our brands grew double digits. While prestige beauty growth slowed, our business there grew a solid 9%, exceeding growth in prestige. Our results reflect our strategy to diversify our business by expanding our portfolio, channels, cities and products. Our makeup and fragrance business has been growing rapidly in what has traditionally been a skin care-oriented market, demonstrating our strategy to align our multiple engine of growth with local market dynamics.
The economic environment and beauty market growth in emerging markets overall has slowed. While we are not immune for -- to soft local economic conditions, our business in emerging markets other than China continued to be very robust, rising 27% in the quarter, approximately 3x the growth of prestige beauty in those countries.
We are committed to these markets and plan to invest more in this time of softness to leverage our momentum, increase our market share, resulting in a much stronger position when these economies will improve again.
Around the world, makeup proved again to be a strong growth engine, a trend that we had anticipated and prepared for, which is evident in our results. For the quarter, our makeup business grew 13% in constant currency. Our 3 makeup brands are clearly benefiting, M-A-C and Smashbox especially up strong double digits. But so are our multi-category brands. Estée Lauder and Clinique makeup sales grew in every region. Foundation has been very strong across our brands, and we had 4 of the top 5 foundations in the U.S. in 2015. Among Estée Lauder's best products was Double Wear Stay-In-Place liquid foundation, a strong seller decades after its launch. This core product was the best-selling foundation in the U.S. according to NPD for the quarter and also the 2015 calendar year, with sales up more than 20%.
Clinique launched Beyond Perfecting foundation plus concealer in Asia, which established the new makeup pillar for the brand and drove strong foundation growth in the region. This success in foundation is one of the key factors driving the improvement in Estée Lauder and Clinique. We have chosen to reemphasize makeup in these brands to help ignite their businesses. Estée Lauder progress is modernizing -- in modernizing the brand and emphasizing local relevant product drove its higher sales, particularly in certain Asian and European markets. While skin care is its largest business, especially in Asia, the brand's substantial makeup portfolio is attracting younger consumers. It is creating a vibrant digital strategy with newsworthy updates and enhanced storytelling to communicate with consumer 24/7.
Clinique's greater emphasis on makeup, especially some color products, is creating a stronger emotional connection with millennials, which is helping to stabilize its performance and drive growth. It is enhancing consultant training, distorting key products and testing new store formats that's colorful, high energy, modular and engages consumers. The first pilot of the new freestanding store model opened in Hong Kong 2 months ago, and sales are up sharply in what is reasonably a relatively depressed market.
Our strategy of having multiple engines of growth extends to our innovation program, which develops desirable technologies and concept across our product category and brands. Our innovation isn't just about creating big blockbusters, and our success isn't based solely on the newest product for each brand. Instead, an important impact of our launches is to pull consumers into stores, build traffic and drive sales. Some shoppers do come to buy the latest lip shade. But many others gravitate on our staples, which accounts for the vast majority of our sales.
Let me give you example of some recent and upcoming products by category. In skin care, Estée Lauder New Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask is a global launch with a focus on Asia, where masks are extremely popular. This offers key ANR technology and extends this important franchise. Estée Lauder New Dimension serum was successful in many markets in Europe and Asia, offsetting lower-than-expected results in North America. La Mer introduced the Renewal Oil, a luxury entry in the popular facial oil subcategory, and it has exceeded expectation in many markets. Clinique built a franchise around its Smart serum by extending it with moisturizer and treatment oils.
In the makeup category, since foundation have been strong sellers, several of our brands, including Estée Lauder and Bobbi Brown, are introducing cushion compacts, which is a growing segment and has been popular with consumers.
The strong growth in our high-end fragrances brands is another important element of our strategy that is working very well. The combination of Tom Ford, Jo Malone and recent acquisitions are generating sustainable profitable growth, and we continue to expand distribution and roll out exciting new scents. We have had a variety of fragrance launches across prestige points, and many of them as well as attractive sets were popular gifts for the holidays. With an eye towards spring, Jo Malone Herb Garden collection will offer 5 different colognes.
Looking at the balance of our fiscal year, we are confident in our sound strategy and are choosing to increase investment in the strongest areas of our business. These investments will include more advertising, building freestanding stores and e-commerce sites, R&D and travel retail expansion. We are further fueling our growth momentum by investing in our winners and continue to build mobile market share.
There are, of course, many macro factors beyond our control and lower markets to overcome. We believe, however, that our diversification, multiple engines of growth, strong innovation, financial agility and superb execution, we will generate excellent growth. We also continue working to find ways to better leverage this growth in the longer term.
With this confidence, we are raising the lower end of our sales guidance and now expect to deliver 7% to 8% growth in constant currency as well as continuing to forecast double-digit EPS growth for fiscal 2016, delivering another year of strong results while continue to build sustainable profitable growth engines.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey."
207221,287562750,928085,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I will first review our fiscal 2016 second quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. My commentary does exclude the impact of restructuring and other c",1846,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I will first review our fiscal 2016 second quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. My commentary does exclude the impact of restructuring and other charges. Net sales for the second quarter were up -- were $3.12 billion, up 8% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 70 basis points of this sales growth. Once again, the strongest geographic performance this quarter came from the Europe, Middle East & Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 13% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in virtually every market. A continuation of strong local demand for our products, increased tourist traffic in certain cities and our selective brand distribution expansion contributed to double-digit increases in all major Western markets. Sales growth in France was slower than last quarter as the attacks in mid-November understandably curtailed both shopping and tourism in Paris. 
All emerging markets in the region saw double-digit gains, led by Russia, Turkey and the Middle East. Our net sales in the global travel retail channel rose 5%, as double-digit gains in many countries and a strong return to growth in Korea were partially offset by continued declines in both Hong Kong and Brazil. Overall, passenger traffic growth is strong, and our growth at retail and net reflected this strength in the quarter.
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. China rose 9% with e-commerce sales growing nearly 80%, thanks in part to the success of Singles' Day on November 11, when our sales more than doubled versus prior year. Our online sales for the quarter rose to nearly 13% of our total China business. We delivered solid growth in our core markets of Korea and Japan, while some of the smaller emerging markets in the region rose double digits.
Australia also delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth. These strong results were partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong, where sales decreased by high single digits on top of a meaningful decline last year. A sharp continuation of the decline in tourist flows from China that began last year, combined with both the Chinese yuan devaluing this fiscal year and Chinese tourists continuing to travel more to other destinations in Europe and Asia, is creating further weakness in local sales in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, the region sales would have grown more than 8%.
Net sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency. Strong double-digit growth continued across Latin America, led by Brazil and Mexico. North American sales grew low single digits, which reflected double-digit growth in Canada and low single-digit growth in the U.S. Sales were strongest in the U.S. in specialty-multi, online and high-end department store channels, while tourist-driven doors in all channels have been adversely affected by the strong dollar.
Our sales in mid-tier department stores continued to be soft in brick-and-mortar, while the related retailer online business was up sharply. Our holiday sales were broadly in line with our expectations, although the environment this year was more promotional than the prior year.
In constant currency, net sales in every product category grew this quarter with double-digit growth in makeup, fragrance and hair care. Makeup sales rose 13% in constant currency. M-A-C, Tom Ford and Smashbox all rose strong double digits due to the success of key recent product launches, further distribution expansion and solid like-door growth. Tom Ford Lips & Boys collection, which originally launched last holiday season, continued to be particularly strong this year. Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Estée Lauder rose mid to high single digits in makeup, primarily due to strengthening their product offerings and their support behind the fast-growing lip and foundation categories.
Fragrance category sales rose 12% in constant currency during the important holiday gifting season. Double-digit gains from Jo Malone and Tom Ford and incremental sales from our newer brands, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, drove the majority of growth. Within other Designer Fragrances, Michael Kors Gold collection and Tory Burch also contributed to growth, and Estée Lauder's Modern Muse Le Rouge launched this fall grew the overall Modern Muse franchise.
Hair care sales increased 14% in constant currency, with growth from both Aveda and Bumble and bumble. Aveda launched thickening tonic and Shampure dry shampoo, which also benefited from continued growth in existing products, such as Be Curly. The brand expanded its presence in travel retail and delivered strong salon growth in Western Europe, and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in the specialty-multi channel.
Skin care sales rose 2% in constant currency. Skin care continues to be the dominant beauty category in China and Hong Kong, where there has been more challenging macro trends that have contributed to the category's slower global growth. La Mer rose double digits. Origins and Just [ph] Darphin generated solid growth, and GLAMGLOW represented incremental sales growth in skin care. Estée Lauder achieved modest growth due to recent launches and Clinique declined slightly in the quarter.
Our gross margin for the quarter was comparable to the prior year at 81.2% of sales. Favorabilities in our supply chain were offset by the combination of category mix with the slower growth in skin care and some higher promotional expenses over the holidays.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales were in line with the prior year quarter at 60.4%. Increases were primarily due to higher store operating costs, which reflected over 130 new freestanding retail store openings over the past year, offset by improvements in selling, shipping and other expenses.
As a result, operating income of $647.9 million was 2% above the prior year and operating margin was unchanged at 20.8%. Our constant currency operating margin improved 60 basis points, primarily due to expense leverage. Net earnings were $458.6 million or 5% above the prior year quarter, reflecting a 230 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate, which was partially driven by a discrete tax credit in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.22 was 8% above the prior year, including the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger-than-expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of better sales performance across most of our brands and continued strong expense management as we navigated the volatile macro environment. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.01 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.11 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 18%.
We recorded $18.5 million in charges before tax or $0.03 per share for the transition of our global technology infrastructure to a new platform that we announced to you last quarter. As we mentioned previously, for the full fiscal year, we expect to record charges for this transition of between $40 million and $50 million before tax or approximately $0.07 to $0.09 per share.
Continued progress in our working capital initiatives, along with favorable currency translation, contributed to a 7-day improvement in inventory days to sell through the end of December. These improvements were partially offset by the inventory build necessary to meet our future sales growth objectives and the additional inventory from our new brands.
For the 6 months ended December 31, we generated $962 million in cash flows from operating activities, 3% less than the comparable period last year. The prior year cash flow benefited from the SMI sales shift. Excluding the impact of the shift from last year, operating cash flow this year rose 17%. We invested $223 million in capital expenditures, primarily to support new retail stores, counters, systems and office space.
We utilized $628 million in cash to repurchase approximately 7.6 million shares of our stock, 1.2 million more than the same period last year. We also distributed $201 million in dividends to stockholders.
So that concludes our results for the second quarter and the half year. Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year and the third quarter. For the full year, the sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact comparisons to the prior year. I will now discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift. Our forecasted growth rates both before and after the shift impact are available in today's earnings release for your reference. Also excluded, again, for the full year is the impact of restructuring and other charges.
So reflecting our strong first half performance, we have raised the low end of our guidance range and now expect full year sales growth of between 7% and 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency has become an even greater headwind, and we now estimate that translation could negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 5 percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of January of $1.08 for the euro, $1.43 for the pound and 1 18 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.07 and $3.12, including $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions. The increased currency headwinds are now projected to affect EPS by about $0.29, which is $0.05 more than we projected when we last gave guidance.
Our strong first half performance gave us comfort to increase our investments in the second half of the fiscal year to support new innovation, additional freestanding store acceleration, omnichannel pilots, travel retail and the Estée Edit, which should allow us to continue to fuel profitable growth. And while we remain on track to deliver $200 million of cost savings this year, we will also continue to look for ways to further improve our leverage in the future. We continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12% in constant currency.
In the third quarter, our sales are expected to rise 6% to 7% in constant currency, including 70 basis points from acquisitions as we anniversary our strongest sales growth quarter from last year. The impact of foreign currency is anticipated to reduce growth by approximately 4 percentage points. Our third quarter diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.53 and $0.58, including approximately $0.03 per share of adverse currency translation and approximately $0.02 dilution from acquisitions. This estimate reflects our highest quarter of planned advertising and promotional spending as a percent of sales in the third quarter and is deployed behind key activities such as the global launch of Estée Lauder's New Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask, the U.S. introduction of the Estée Edit collection in Sephora as well as a variety of activities in the makeup category across multiple brands.
We delivered strong sales and earnings growth and showed solid progress in our strategic initiatives in the first half of the fiscal year, while managing through a volatile global macro environment. We are encouraged by our results thus far and the scope of activities we have planned throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, which should support our continued growth momentum for this fiscal year and beyond.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

And you began by calling it out again today. So really 2 questions, if I could, related to it. First, Fabrizio, can you maybe talk about some of the structural steps you've taken to enable that flexibility? Because I think there's some debate out there as to how much of what we're seeing is innate skill and a function of institutionalized discipline versus simply you benefiting from a spate of good luck that might eventually run out. That would be my first question. And then second, Tracey, can you talk about how the theme of agility relates to your ability to protect margins and profit? Because I'm struck by the fact that here we are, you just beat the top end of your Q2 guidance by $0.14. And none of that is being passed through to your full year guidance to insulate the P&L from incremental FX pressure. And maybe that's prudent on your part. I'm inclined to think that it is. But at the same time, I have thought that with the top line strength, all the pricing levers you have, some of your productivity efforts, that there'd be more ability to be nimble and agile on that front as well and avoid the guide down. So I'd just love your thoughts there, too."

So the first institutional model is a continuous monitoring of the changes. Example, traveling corridor and tourists flow, market growth in different levels. We have now new level of analytics and follow-up on how the business evolves. So understanding. The second institution is then we tailor launches -- product launches assortment and think based on what we learn regularly. Third is when markets over-deliver their financial trends, they get more opportunity to spend. And when the market tend to under-deliver, they tend to cover at least part of what they cover for the profit pressure that they are under. So these automatic mechanisms are, anyway, generating flows or resources automatically to the winning part of our business. Third, the way people collaborate is completely different today. We collaborate, we make decisions together. And so the ability to flow in an agile way, both resources and money and make fast decision on our locations, is taken at the top of the company in a collaborative way. Those are institutional way, which are here to stay. And actually, they are the way we work across every quarter. So assume that we -- once we decide the plan, we constantly work to improve it quarter by quarter, month by month, and the company does this in a structural way. Second point -- before Tracey answer the second part of your question, I would like to say that the -- in reality, what we are doing is focusing even more on growth even in the second semester. We have so many winning opportunity. And our location methodologies are working, and our ability to build the top line in a sustainable way for the long term is definitely the most important priority for sustainable double-digit EPS growth in the long term. So our point of view is that moving the lower end of our top line sales trend from the 6% to 8% -- we have a 6% to 8%, so moving from closer to the 6% to closer to the 8% in a sustainable way has much more value for our shareholders in the long term than just covering currencies in the short term. So our approach is to focus on long-term top line growth acceleration. And in a moment where the environment out there is volatile, we have proven that in volatile environment, we have a competitive advantage in being able to operate.

The third thing is -- so you can expect that the percentage of our business in the channel will grow, but this is very different by country around the world, depending on the penetration of this channel.

So on Estée Edit, so first of all, Estée Edit is exclusive to Sephora and will be launched in Sephora brick-and-mortar and sephora.com and is being developed also in 3 collaboration with the Sephora teams. The Estée Edit is focused on makeup, but includes also some, I will call it, instant skin care benefit products, plus some core SKUs of Estée Lauder business. This brand will be supported by a very strong social media and very strong digital activities really focused on the millennials and in cooperation also with magazines that support the magazine and social media activities. So it will be a strong launch. In terms of the impact for the long term, obviously, will depend from the success. We have a very strong belief that this will be a strong success. And in case of success, we assume it will be expanded to more Sephora doors over time, obviously. But we will need first to test and see the success level that we'd get. Now in terms of the quarter, remember, this is launched in March 15, mid-March, so the impact on third quarter is relatively limited. But we hope that the impact on fiscal year '17, '18 will be -- obviously be much stronger when success will happen. The other important aspect of Estée Edit is that it's not only it's going to be hopefully a success in sales, but it's also very important way to attract millennials to the Estée Lauder brand and is one of the steps to modernize the Estée Lauder brand as a whole in our opinion. On Lauder and Clinique, the Lauder and Clinique combined grew about 1% in the quarter 2, so which is a turnaround. This was -- in quarter 2 specifically was driven by Estée Lauder growth, as Tracey explained in her remarks. But the important point is that both Lauder and Clinique are growing again on the makeup business, which is in the case of the Clinique, a very big percent. In the case of Lauder, a smaller percent of total business because of the big Asia penetration of skin care, but still in many countries is the bigger part of the business of these 2 brands. So that's the important reality. We said that we would have started turning around to grow these 2 brands for -- starting from makeup and then following to skin care. On skin care, it's frankly difficult to imagine that skin care will also start growing again within this fiscal year, with Hong Kong in the situation in which it is and with China market growth in skin care being so soft. As I said before, China market growth is mainly driven by makeup in this one [ph]. And the skin care is not growing very aggressively. So -- but as soon as the Asia skin care dynamic will find back a normalized growth, we will complete the turnaround also on the skin care front of these 2 brands. That's our assumption for the fiscal year."

So first of all is we are applying to travel retail the same multiple engines of growth diversification and investment agility philosophy that we are applying to the entire company. So as you said, travel retail has been having some outstanding momentum for years based on the Asian travelers acceleration. And in this moment, the Asian dynamic, particularly the Hong Kong, Macau one, which is the worrying one and had been soft -- very soft in quarter 2, and we predict the softness to stay in the past. But in reality, it's not the traffic which is declining. It's where consumer are going and how much they're shopping. So we are reacting to that. We are increasing brand distribution. Yes, we are increasing penetration of airports where the traffic is going now, meaning more Europe and more other areas of Asia, for example. We are adjusting assortments to the new corridor -- to the new traveling corridor. So I'll give you an example. The moment Brazilians don't travel anymore as much as they used to and when they travel, they shop less, we adjust assortments. And in these places like Miami, now there are more different kind of travelers to which we adjust. And maybe there are other brands that today are not there that are better suited with different group of travelers. That's with the previous brand that we had before that we have maybe more suited to Brazilian as an example. This is happening all over the world. So it's adjustment in assortment. It's increase on number of brands. It's the penetration on more airports. And, most importantly, it's a dynamic adjustment to the corridor traveling -- to the corridor travelers. So that's the first thing, which is about traffic management. The second thing is about conversion. And what is changing is that all these currency changes in travel retail, the currency changes are changing the dynamic of the duty-free aspect, the discounts the consumer found around the world versus their home market. And that's why, for example, makeup is growing much better in travel retail. Makeup is much more purchased because of the conversion marketing from traveler to buyer rather than for big discounts, also they get discounts for these in absolute term much smaller. So we are learning to increase some categories in travel retail where we were not as penetrated as we were in skin care, like some makeup. We are learning that our high-end fragrances, like Jo Malone, are extremely successful in travel retail. So we are expanding the high-end, sophisticated, artisanal fragrances, including our new acquisition will be part of that. That is a very big opportunity also because, as you know, fragrance is a very big market in travel retail. And we are learning more marketing techniques to convert traveler into purchaser, based, for example, of M-A-C is adding a makeup artist. Jo Malone is adding gifts methodologies in travel retail. So making sure there are more reasons to buy in travel retail than just lower prices than in the home markets. So that's the entire strategy. It's a pretty sophisticated strategy and as everything we are doing is about the long-term sustained growth of this very important and profitable channel."

And I cannot tell you an average because it doesn't -- but they are 10%, 15% in some cases or 30%, 35% in other cases by SKU, depending on many different dynamics. But they're much more reduced than they used to be in the past. So the second part is where are the strengths, the weakness of China. Our strategy in China, like the one I explained for travel retail, is about diversification. So China is softer in this moment in the biggest skin care segment. It's soft in the biggest cities, Shanghai, Beijing is -- while China growth is very strong in Tier 2, Tier 3 cities. It's very strong online. It's very strong in smaller brands, which are entering in areas in makeup and fragrances, which are fast-growing categories for this population. So again, it's about diversification. If you have multiple engines of growth and you can operate in new cities, you can operate online, you can operate in new growing segment like some makeup and some fragrance -- high-end fragrance segments, there is enormous amount of growth opportunity in China. And that is the diversification, multiple engine of growth work that we are doing also there and which are driving our results. Just to give you a number, our online business grew 80% in total in China during quarter 2, 80%, 8-0. So it's very strong acceleration. And that's what is the focus of our activity of creating the right engines of growth also in China for the long term."

We delivered strong results in our fiscal 2016, with sales growing 8% and earnings per share climbing 18% in constant currency before charges. This performance contributed to stellar first half results. Cost",2507,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in our fiscal 2016, with sales growing 8% and earnings per share climbing 18% in constant currency before charges. This performance contributed to stellar first half results. Cost of currency sales also rose 8% and EPS was 70% higher before charges. Our company is helping to drive the momentum in global prestige beauty, which is resilient and growing despite significant economic volatility. We are strengthening our leadership by growing approximately twice as fast the industry. Our success in this volatile environment has been driven by our broadly diversified business, powered by our multiple engines of growth, coupled with investment agility and strong execution. This was achieved, thanks to our talented and experienced leaders and global workforce. We are not over-reliant of any one category, channel or country, which help cushion us somewhat from regional slowdowns or political strife.
We reacted quickly to unexpected events and volatility during the quarter and reallocated our investment spending, capitalizing on the best opportunities as condition changed. To cite some examples, we reduced the investment in Hong Kong, which continued to decline, and increased support in Canada, the U.K., in other fast-growth markets. As the makeup category surged globally, we invested more in M•A•C's raising [ph] momentum and in popular launches for our Estée Lauder and Clinique brands to leverage their accelerating makeup growth.
In travel retail, we accelerated our brand expansion into Europe, which enjoyed stronger traffic tourists.
Seeing a growing demand in our direct-to-consumer business, we accelerated development of the commerce sites and freestanding stores in several markets. Our strategy is to invest dynamically in our strengths, which added fuel to our momentum and helped us driving terrific results. Thanks to the strategic resource allocation, we had constant currency gain across the board of our regions and categories. By intentionally accelerating investment in selected winning areas, we generated stronger results in our makeup and luxury brands, direct-to-consumer channels and the Europe, Middle East & Africa region, where we gained significant share. Even with formidable competition, we believe we are expanding our leading position in skin care and makeup combined in Western Europe and in emerging markets in that region.
Our strong overall results were especially encouraging in light of some difficult macro issues, including a depressed retail climate in Hong Kong and softer market growth in China as well as worsening currency headwinds, especially in certain emerging markets. Although we expect economic and geopolitical volatility to continue throughout the balance of the fiscal year, we believe we can successfully navigate the instabilities because of our strong positions in the categories, channels and regions with the strongest sustainable growth.
We anticipated many of the major trends driving global prestige beauty today. We are able to leverage the increasing growth the industry is experiencing in direct-to-consumer channels, such as online and retail stores as well as travel retail and specialty stores category, into a growing numbers of beauty consumers. We were a pioneer in online beauty, recognizing early on that the channel would be increasing important for marketing, communication and shopping convenience. Today, we are among the largest and most established player in online prestige beauty and have enjoyed extraordinary growth. This fiscal year, we expect our online sales from our brand sites and retailer sites to top $1 billion for the first time, representing a doubling of the business in just 3 years.
Our digital success comes from having a diverse entrepreneurial team, more than half of whom are millennials, and they quickly adapt to business, to changing landscapes. Our websites offer a desirable luxury experience and have become major contributors to brand growth.
The holiday quarter was a pivotal time for e-commerce as more consumer opted for the convenience of shopping online. Online sales accelerated for various product categories, and beauty was no exception. Our e- and m-commerce business captured the increased volume and generated nearly 30% growth in the quarter. On Cyber Monday, sales of our North America brand sites were more than 50% higher than last year. On Singles' Day in China, sales of our 5 flagship sites on Tmall more than doubled, led by Estée Lauder and Clinique. Many global metrics of our brand sites improved, including the number of orders which rose 27%. And mobile became an even larger portion of our sales, accounting for 36% of all online transactions. 
During the quarter, we added 69 brand retailers and third-party sites worldwide. Linking our brand sites to our freestanding store is key to enabling an omnichannel experience, which is an important evolving trend in retailing.
We have launched numerous pilot programs and are building omnichannel capability to begin to seamlessly connect consumer across our brand sites and our freestanding stores globally. We are exploring many different approaches and learning what's successful. For example, we launched online booking for makeup services in the U.K. and the U.S. and are finding that over half of the appointments in M•A•C new makeup studio in Manhattan have been made online. In the U.K., several of our brands offer cross-channel gift cards that can be redeemed online and in our freestanding stores. And in October, Bobbi Brown aired an interactive beauty class that generated more than 1.1 million social media impressions.
Today, we have approximately 1,500 freestanding stores worldwide that are managed directly by our company or our partners. As we expand our number of highly productivity stores, we are testing new concepts. Origin discover retail design, which illustrate the journey from plant to product, is being rolled out globally. M•A•C first makeup studio is a service-based store that we believe will provide an additional revenue stream. M•A•C freestanding stores are a key growth engine and account for approximately 1/3 of its global sales today.
Leveraging a growing demand for prestige beauty in Brazil, 2 of our luxury brands are entering the country with stand-alone stores. La Mer recently opened in a luxury shopping mall in São Paulo where it offers spa treatment, and Jo Malone will soon follow, one of the 30 stores it plans to add globally this fiscal year. Our M•A•C and Clinique brands have been expanding in freestanding store in Brazil now for several years.
We also anticipated that specialty-multi will be a fast-growing beauty channel. In the quarter, our strongest sales growth in North America was in this channel, which saw robust retail sales through all our brands. Many of our brands are increasing their penetration with the appropriate retailers. 
As I mentioned on our last call, one of our exciting initiative comes from the Estée Lauder brand, which we launched its Estée Edit group of products in 320 North America Sephora stores and on sephora.com in mid-March. Inspired by today's young consumers, the Estée Edit line delivers instant visible benefits centered on the theme ""beauty is an attitude."" Aimed directly at millennials and promoted on social media, the Estée Edit is part of a strategic effort to modernize the Estée Lauder brand for long-term growth and see the next generation of consumer while continuing to appeal to its core consumers.
Additionally, in Sephora, Bobbi Brown plans to add more doors in the U.S. this spring, and GLAMGLOW reinforced its popularity with the launch of lip treatment products, which become best sellers there. 
In international markets, La Mer launched in the Mecca specialty chain in Australia. And in Europe, Bumble and bumble and Smashbox had good growth in Boots. Douglas accounts for 1/3 of our business in Germany, and our retail sales there grew double digits in the quarter.
Our brands continued to perform well also in higher-end department stores globally. However, in mid-tier North America department store, some of our brands experienced softness, although they showed solid increase online. 
Travel retail is another long-term growth engine of our business that improved in the channel as well. Importantly, in the quarter, our net sales, retail sales and traffic growth all grew mid-single digits. With changing travel pattern shifting where and what consumer buy, we redeployed some of our investment activities to the corridors with the most touristic traffic. Korea returned to growth after concerns about MERS eased and Europe was robust as the weak euro attracted tourists. Hong Kong remained soft also in travel retail channel, as did market in the corridor -- also in the corridors frequented by Russians and Brazilians. 
Overall, in travel retail, we had double-digit retail growth in-house of our top 30 markets. 
Mirroring our broader company strategy, we continue to diversify our travel retail business by expanding our brands in more location and opening more doors. The preorder business, where travelers order products online and pick them up in the airport, had a strong increase. Healthy passenger traffic growth is projected across all regions this fiscal year.
Touching on some of the key geographies. The Korean market continued to rebound. And our business is posting solid growth and gaining share, driven largely by our makeup brands, which are effectively leveraging important Korean trends and demonstrating our ability to successfully compete with local brands.
In China, nearly all our brands grew double digits. While prestige beauty growth slowed, our business there grew a solid 9%, exceeding growth in prestige. Our results reflect our strategy to diversify our business by expanding our portfolio, channels, cities and products. Our makeup and fragrance business has been growing rapidly in what has traditionally been a skin care-oriented market, demonstrating our strategy to align our multiple engine of growth with local market dynamics.
The economic environment and beauty market growth in emerging markets overall has slowed [ph]. While we are not immune for -- to soft local economic conditions, our business in emerging markets other than China continued to be very robust, rising 27% in the quarter, approximately 3x the growth of prestige beauty in those countries.
We are committed to these markets and plan to invest more in this time of softness to leverage our momentum, increase our market share, resulting in a much stronger position when these economies will improve again.
Around the world, makeup proved again to be a strong growth engine, a trend that we had anticipated and prepared for, which is evident in our results. For the quarter, our makeup business grew 13% in constant currency. Our 3 makeup brands are clearly benefiting, M•A•C and Smashbox especially up strong double digits. But so are our multi-category brands. Estée Lauder and Clinique makeup sales grew in every region. Foundation has been very strong across our brands, and we had 4 of the top 5 foundations in the U.S. in 2015. Among Estée Lauder's best products was Double Wear Stay-In-Place liquid foundation, a strong seller decades after its launch. This core product was the best-selling foundation in the U.S. according to NPD for the quarter and also the 2015 calendar year, with sales up more than 20%.
Clinique launched Beyond Perfecting foundation plus concealer in Asia, which established the new makeup pillar for the brand and drove strong foundation growth in the region. This success in foundation is one of the key factors driving the improvement in Estée Lauder and Clinique. We have chosen to reemphasize makeup in these brands to help ignite their businesses. Estée Lauder progress is modernizing -- in modernizing the brand and emphasizing local relevant product drove its higher sales, particularly in certain Asian and European markets. While skin care is its largest business, especially in Asia, the brand's substantial makeup portfolio is attracting younger consumers. It is creating a vibrant digital strategy with newsworthy updates and enhanced storytelling to communicate with consumer 24/7.
Clinique's greater emphasis on makeup, especially some color products, is creating a stronger emotional connection with millennials, which is helping to stabilize its performance and drive growth. It is enhancing consultant training, distorting key products and testing new store formats that's colorful, high energy, modular and engages consumers. The first pilot of the new freestanding store model opened in Hong Kong 2 months ago, and sales are up sharply in what is recently [ph] a relatively depressed market.
Our strategy of having multiple engines of growth extends to our innovation program, which develops desirable technologies and concept across our product category and brands. Our innovation isn't just about creating big blockbusters, and our success isn't based solely on the newest product for each brand. Instead, an important impact of our launches is to pull consumers into stores, build traffic and drive sales. Some shoppers do come to buy the latest lip shade. But many others gravitate on our staples, which accounts for the vast majority of our sales.
Let me give you example of some recent and upcoming products by category. In skin care, Estée Lauder New Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask is a global launch with a focus on Asia, where masks are extremely popular. This offers key ANR technology and extends this important franchise. Estée Lauder New Dimension serum was successful in many markets in Europe and Asia, offsetting lower-than-expected results in North America. La Mer introduced the Renewal Oil, a luxury entry in the popular facial oil subcategory, and it has exceeded expectation in many markets. Clinique built a franchise around its Smart serum by extending it with moisturizer and treatment oils.
In the makeup category, since foundation have been strong sellers, several of our brands, including Estée Lauder and Bobbi Brown, are introducing cushion compacts, which is a growing segment and has been popular with consumers.
The strong growth in our high-end fragrances brands is another important element of our strategy that is working very well. The combination of Tom Ford, Jo Malone and recent acquisitions are generating sustainable profitable growth, and we continue to expand distribution and roll out exciting new scents. We have had a variety of fragrance launches across prestige points, and many of them as well as attractive sets were popular gifts for the holidays. With an eye towards spring, Jo Malone Herb Garden collection will offer 5 different colognes.
Looking at the balance of our fiscal year, we are confident in our sound strategy and are choosing to increase investment in the strongest areas of our business. These investments will include more advertising, building freestanding stores and e-commerce sites, R&D and travel retail expansion. We are further fueling our growth momentum by investing in our winners and continue to build mobile market share.
There are, of course, many macro factors beyond our control and lower markets to overcome. We believe, however, that our diversification, multiple engines of growth, strong innovation, financial agility and superb execution, we will generate excellent growth. We also continue working to find ways to better leverage this growth in the longer term.
With this confidence, we are raising the lower end of our sales guidance and now expect to deliver 7% to 8% growth in constant currency as well as continuing to forecast double-digit EPS growth for fiscal 2016, delivering another year of strong results while continue to build sustainable profitable growth engines.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey."
207221,287562750,928225,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone.

I will first review our fiscal 2016 second quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. My commentary does exclude the impact of restructuring and other charges. Net sales for the second quarter were up -- were $3.12 billion, up 8% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 70 basis points of this sales growth. Once again, the strongest geographic performance this quarter came from the Europe, Middle East & Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 13% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in virtually every market. A continuation of strong local demand for our products, increased tourist traffic in certain cities and our selective brand distribution expansion contributed to double-digit increases in all major Western markets. Sales growth in France was slower than last quarter as the attacks in mid-November understandably curtailed both shopping and tourism in Paris. 
All emerging markets in the region saw double-digit gains, led by Russia, Turkey and the Middle East. Our net sales in the global travel retail channel rose 5%, as double-digit gains in many countries and a strong return to growth in Korea were partially offset by continued declines in both Hong Kong and Brazil. Overall, passenger traffic growth is strong, and our growth at retail and net reflected this strength in the quarter.
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. China rose 9% with e-commerce sales growing nearly 80%, thanks in part to the success of Singles' Day on November 11, when our sales more than doubled versus prior year. Our online sales for the quarter rose to nearly 13% of our total China business. We delivered solid growth in our core markets of Korea and Japan, while some of the smaller emerging markets in the region rose double digits.
Australia also delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth. These strong results were partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong, where sales decreased by high single digits on top of a meaningful decline last year. A sharp continuation of the decline in tourist flows from China that began last year, combined with both the Chinese yuan devaluing this fiscal year and Chinese tourists continuing to travel more to other destinations in Europe and Asia, is creating further weakness in local sales in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, the region sales would have grown more than 8%.
Net sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency. Strong double-digit growth continued across Latin America, led by Brazil and Mexico. North American sales grew low single digits, which reflected double-digit growth in Canada and low single-digit growth in the U.S. Sales were strongest in the U.S. in specialty-multi, online and high-end department store channels, while tourist-driven doors in all channels have been adversely affected by the strong dollar.
Our sales in mid-tier department stores continued to be soft in brick-and-mortar, while the related retailer online business was up sharply. Our holiday sales were broadly in line with our expectations, although the environment this year was more promotional than the prior year.
In constant currency, net sales in every product category grew this quarter with double-digit growth in makeup, fragrance and hair care. Makeup sales rose 13% in constant currency. M•A•C, Tom Ford and Smashbox all rose strong double digits due to the success of key recent product launches, further distribution expansion and solid like-door growth. Tom Ford Lips & Boys collection, which originally launched last holiday season, continued to be particularly strong this year. Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Estée Lauder rose mid- to high single digits in makeup, primarily due to strengthening their product offerings and their support behind the fast-growing lip and foundation categories.
Fragrance category sales rose 12% in constant currency during the important holiday gifting season. Double-digit gains from Jo Malone and Tom Ford and incremental sales from our newer brands, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, drove the majority of growth. Within other Designer Fragrances, Michael Kors Gold collection and Tory Burch also contributed to growth, and Estée Lauder's Modern Muse Le Rouge launched this fall grew the overall Modern Muse franchise.
Hair care sales increased 14% in constant currency, with growth from both Aveda and Bumble and bumble. Aveda launched thickening tonic and Shampure dry shampoo, which also benefited from continued growth in existing products, such as Be Curly. The brand expanded its presence in travel retail and delivered strong salon growth in Western Europe, and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in the specialty-multi channel.
Skin care sales rose 2% in constant currency. Skin care continues to be the dominant beauty category in China and Hong Kong, where there has been more challenging macro trends that have contributed to the category's slower global growth. La Mer rose double digits. Origins and Just [ph] Darphin generated solid growth, and GLAMGLOW represented incremental sales growth in skin care. Estée Lauder achieved modest growth due to recent launches and Clinique declined slightly in the quarter.
Our gross margin for the quarter was comparable to the prior year at 81.2% of sales. Favorabilities in our supply chain were offset by the combination of category mix with the slower growth in skin care and some higher promotional expenses over the holidays.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales were in line with the prior year quarter at 60.4%. Increases were primarily due to higher store operating costs, which reflected over 130 new freestanding retail store openings over the past year, offset by improvements in selling, shipping and other expenses.
As a result, operating income of $647.9 million was 2% above the prior year and operating margin was unchanged at 20.8%. Our constant currency operating margin improved 60 basis points, primarily due to expense leverage. Net earnings were $458.6 million or 5% above the prior year quarter, reflecting a 230 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate, which was partially driven by a discrete tax credit in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.22 was 8% above the prior year, including the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger-than-expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of better sales performance across most of our brands and continued strong expense management as we navigated the volatile macro environment. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.01 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.11 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 18%.
We recorded $18.5 million in charges before tax or $0.03 per share for the transition of our global technology infrastructure to a new platform that we announced to you last quarter. As we mentioned previously, for the full fiscal year, we expect to record charges for this transition of between $40 million and $50 million before tax or approximately $0.07 to $0.09 per share.
Continued progress in our working capital initiatives, along with favorable currency translation, contributed to a 7-day improvement in inventory days to sell through the end of December. These improvements were partially offset by the inventory build necessary to meet our future sales growth objectives and the additional inventory from our new brands.
For the 6 months ended December 31, we generated $962 million in cash flows from operating activities, 3% less than the comparable period last year. The prior year cash flow benefited from the SMI sales shift. Excluding the impact of the shift from last year, operating cash flow this year rose 17%. We invested $223 million in capital expenditures, primarily to support new retail stores, counters, systems and office space.
We utilized $628 million in cash to repurchase approximately 7.6 million shares of our stock, 1.2 million more than the same period last year. We also distributed $201 million in dividends to stockholders.
So that concludes our results for the second quarter and the half year. Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year and the third quarter. 
For the full year, the sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact comparisons to the prior year. I will now discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift. Our forecasted growth rates both before and after the shift impact are available in today's earnings release for your reference. Also excluded, again, for the full year is the impact of restructuring and other charges.
So reflecting our strong first half performance, we have raised the low end of our guidance range and now expect full year sales growth of between 7% and 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency has become an even greater headwind, and we now estimate that translation could negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 5 percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of January of $1.08 for the euro, $1.43 for the pound and 1 18 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.07 and $3.12, including $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions. The increased currency headwinds are now projected to affect EPS by about $0.29, which is $0.05 more than we projected when we last gave guidance.
Our strong first half performance gave us comfort to increase our investments in the second half of the fiscal year to support new innovation, additional freestanding store acceleration, omnichannel pilots, travel retail and the Estée Edit, which should allow us to continue to fuel profitable growth. And while we remain on track to deliver $200 million of cost savings this year, we will also continue to look for ways to further improve our leverage in the future. We continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12% in constant currency.
In the third quarter, our sales are expected to rise 6% to 7% in constant currency, including 70 basis points from acquisitions as we anniversary our strongest sales growth quarter from last year. The impact of foreign currency is anticipated to reduce growth by approximately 4 percentage points. Our third quarter diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.53 and $0.58, including approximately $0.03 per share of adverse currency translation and approximately $0.02 dilution from acquisitions. This estimate reflects our highest quarter of planned advertising and promotional spending as a percent of sales in the third quarter and is deployed behind key activities such as the global launch of Estée Lauder's New Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask, the U.S. introduction of the Estée Edit collection in Sephora as well as a variety of activities in the makeup category across multiple brands.
We delivered strong sales and earnings growth and showed solid progress in our strategic initiatives in the first half of the fiscal year, while managing through a volatile global macro environment. We are encouraged by our results thus far and the scope of activities we have planned throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, which should support our continued growth momentum for this fiscal year and beyond.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

First, Fabrizio, can you maybe talk about some of the structural steps you've taken to enable that flexibility?

That would be my first question. And then second, Tracey, can you talk about how the theme of agility relates to your ability to protect margins and profit? Because I'm struck by the fact that here we are, you just beat the top end of your Q2 guidance by $0.14. And none of that is being passed through to your full year guidance to insulate the P&L from incremental FX pressure. And maybe that's prudent on your part. I'm inclined to think that it is. But at the same time, I have thought that with the top line strength, all the pricing levers you have, some of your productivity efforts, that there'd be more ability to be nimble and agile on that front as well and avoid the guide down. So I'd just love your thoughts there, too."

So these automatic mechanisms are, anyway, generating flows or resources automatically to the winning part of our business. Third, the way people collaborate is completely different today. We collaborate, we make decisions together. And so the ability to flow in an agile way, both resources and money and make fast decision on our locations, is taken at the top of the company in a collaborative way. Those are institutional way, which are here to stay. And actually, they are the way we work across every quarter. So assume that we -- once we decide the plan, we constantly work to improve it quarter-by-quarter, month-by-month, and the company does this in a structural way. Second point -- before Tracey answer the second part of your question, I would like to say that the -- in reality, what we are doing is focusing even more on growth even in the second semester. We have so many winning opportunity. And our location methodologies are working, and our ability to build the top line in a sustainable way for the long term is definitely the most important priority for sustainable double-digit EPS growth in the long term. So our point of view is that moving the lower end of our top line sales trend from the 6% to 8% -- we have a 6% to 8%, so moving from closer to the 6% to closer to the 8% in a sustainable way has much more value for our shareholders in the long term than just covering currencies in the short term. So our approach is to focus on long-term top line growth acceleration. And in a moment where the environment out there is volatile, we have proven that in volatile environment, we have a competitive advantage in being able to operate. We want to leverage that momentum and then get this competitive advantage through. That's what we're doing. That's why we have decided not to cover currency. We trim investment in the short term that we didn't feel was the long-term priority."

We have good programs in Estée Lauder and Clinique that we think will deliver good results in the second half of the year and beyond. So it's important for us to invest not only for this fiscal year but, obviously, to continue the growth momentum beyond this fiscal year."

So it's not only a distribution game, it's also a marketing game. These channels require different marketing and selling techniques than the traditional department store core business that we have around the world. And so over time, I believe our organization is becoming better and better in partnering with specialty retailers around the world and learning how to grow our business in this channel better and better. The third thing is -- so you can expect that the percentage of our business in the channel will grow, but this is very different by country around the world, depending on the penetration of this channel.

So on Estée Edit, so first of all, Estée Edit is exclusive to Sephora and will be launched in Sephora brick-and-mortar and sephora.com and is being developed also in 3 collaboration with the Sephora teams. The Estée Edit is focused on makeup, but includes also some, I will call it, instant skin care benefit products, plus some core SKUs of Estée Lauder business. This brand will be supported by a very strong social media and very strong digital activities really focused on the millennials and in cooperation also with magazines that support the magazine and social media activities. So it will be a strong launch. In terms of the impact for the long term, obviously, will depend from the success. We have a very strong belief that this will be a strong success. And in case of success, we assume it will be expanded to more Sephora doors over time, obviously. But we will need first to test and see the success level that we get. Now in terms of the quarter, remember, this is launched in March 15, mid-March, so the impact on third quarter is relatively limited. But we hope that the impact on fiscal year '17, '18 will be -- obviously be much stronger when success will happen. The other important aspect of Estée Edit is that it's not only it's going to be hopefully a success in sales, but it's also very important way to attract millennials to the Estée Lauder brand and is one of the steps to modernize the Estée Lauder brand as a whole in our opinion. On Lauder and Clinique, the Lauder and Clinique combined grew about 1% in the quarter 2, so which is a turnaround. This was -- in quarter 2 specifically was driven by Estée Lauder growth, as Tracey explained in her remarks. But the important point is that both Lauder and Clinique are growing again on the makeup business, which is in the case of the Clinique, a very big percent. In the case of Lauder, a smaller percent of total business because of the big Asia penetration of skin care, but still in many countries is the bigger part of the business of these 2 brands. So that's the important reality. We said that we would have started turning around to grow these 2 brands for -- starting from makeup and then following to skin care. On skin care, it's frankly difficult to imagine that skin care will also start growing again within this fiscal year, with Hong Kong in the situation in which it is and with China market growth in skin care being so soft. As I said before, China market growth is mainly driven by makeup in this one [ph]. And the skin care is not growing very aggressively. So -- but as soon as the Asia skin care dynamic will find back a normalized growth, we will complete the turnaround also on the skin care front of these 2 brands. That's our assumption for the fiscal year."

So first of all is we are applying to travel retail the same multiple engines of growth diversification and investment agility philosophy that we are applying to the entire company. So as you said, travel retail has been having some outstanding momentum for years based on the Asian travelers acceleration. And in this moment, the Asian dynamic, particularly the Hong Kong, Macau one, which is the worrying one and had been soft -- very soft in quarter 2, and we predict the softness to stay in the past [ph]. But in reality, it's not the traffic which is declining. It's where consumer are going and how much they're shopping. So we are reacting to that. We are increasing brand distribution. Yes, we are increasing penetration of airports where the traffic is going now, meaning more Europe and more other areas of Asia, for example. We are adjusting assortments to the new corridor -- to the new traveling corridor. So I'll give you an example. At the moment [ph], Brazilians don't travel anymore as much as they used to and when they travel, they shop less, we adjust assortments. And in these places like Miami, now there are more different kind of travelers to which we adjust. And maybe there are other brands that today are not there that are better suited with different group of travelers. That's with the previous brand that we had before that we have maybe more suited to Brazilian as an example. This is happening all over the world. So it's adjustment in assortment. It's increase on number of brands. It's the penetration on more airports. And, most importantly, it's a dynamic adjustment to the corridor traveling -- to the corridor travelers. So that's the first thing, which is about traffic management. The second thing is about conversion. And what is changing is that all these currency changes in travel retail, the currency changes are changing the dynamic of the duty-free aspect, the discounts the consumer found around the world versus their home market. And that's why, for example, makeup is growing much better in travel retail. Makeup is much more purchased because of the conversion marketing from traveler to buyer rather than for big discounts, also they get discounts for these in absolute term much smaller. So we are learning to increase some categories in travel retail where we were not as penetrated as we were in skin care, like some makeup. We are learning that our high-end fragrances, like Jo Malone, are extremely successful in travel retail. So we are expanding the high-end, sophisticated, artisanal fragrances, including our new acquisition will be part of that. That is a very big opportunity also because, as you know, fragrance is a very big market in travel retail. And we are learning more marketing techniques to convert traveler into purchaser, based, for example, of M•A•C is adding a makeup artist. Jo Malone is adding gifts methodologies in travel retail. So making sure there are more reasons to buy in travel retail than just lower prices than in the home markets. So that's the entire strategy. It's a pretty sophisticated strategy and as everything we are doing is about the long-term sustained growth of this very important and profitable channel."

It used to be that prices were, I mean, I think at least 50% above, say, the United States. And I just wondered with some of the price changes that have gone into place how much the price premium is in China today on average. And if you could just maybe walk around differentiating between Tier 1 cities, other cities -- and obviously, your online is doing very well. But where are the real pockets of weakness in China? And what are the opportunities to change that even in the face of a soft consumer?"

In China, we have decreased the pricing, as you probably know, sometime ago. And after the price decrease, the currency in China continues to devaluate. So in reality, the price differentials are much diminished on our brands.",296,"So first of all, on pricing. In China, we have decreased the pricing, as you probably know, sometime ago. And after the price decrease, the currency in China continues to devaluate. So in reality, the price differentials are much diminished on our brands. And I cannot tell you an average because it doesn't -- but they are 10%, 15% in some cases or 30%, 35% in other cases by SKU, depending on many different dynamics. But they're much more reduced than they used to be in the past. So the second part is where are the strengths, the weakness of China. Our strategy in China, like the one I explained for travel retail, is about diversification. So China is softer in this moment in the biggest skin care segment. It's softer in the biggest cities, Shanghai, Beijing is -- while China growth is very strong in Tier 2, Tier 3 cities. It's very strong online. It's very strong in smaller brands, which are entering in areas in makeup and fragrances, which are fast-growing categories for this population. So again, it's about diversification. If you have multiple engines of growth and you can operate in new cities, you can operate online, you can operate in new growing segments like some makeup and some fragrance -- high-end fragrance segments, there is enormous amount of growth opportunity in China. And that is the diversification, multiple engine of growth work that we are doing also there and which are driving our results. Just to give you a number, our online business grew 80% in total in China during quarter 2, 80%, 8-0. So it's very strong acceleration. And that's what is the focus of our activity of creating the right engines of growth also in China for the long term."

In the third quarter, we delivered solid performance withgains particularly from our makeup category and international business. In constant currencies, sales grew 6% and earnings per share rose 5% before charges to $0.76. 
Based on our results to date, we're on track to achieve our sales and earnings guidance for the full fiscal year, excluding charges 
We continue to benefit from a highly diversified business with multiple engines of growth and the flexibility to move investment quickly to support areas that provide the best returns. We continued to fuel makeup a vibrant weapon category where we have achieved constant currency double-digit gains every quarter this fiscal year 
Social media is helping to drive makeup sales with how to do videos, tips from consumers that influences and beautiful visuals of makeup transformations. Our company has thousands of talented makeup artists who are a competitive advantage for our brands and help drive consumption through personal licensing stores as well as online where they can demonstrate the artistry to the broader audience 
M-A-C Instagram, for example, features photos submitted by its global artists illustrating their creativity and talent stride to products and trends. This kind of social media interaction creates an ongoing dialogue between the brand and its consumers and help drive sales 
We are the largest company in global prestige makeup and all our makeup brands grew this quarter. Each of our 3 diverse makeup focused brands has a distinct character and channel profile; for example, our third -- one-third of M-A-C sales came from its freestanding stores. A majority of Bobbi Brown salesl came from the global stores and Smashbox has a strong presence in specialty multi retailers and there is further opportunity for growth across all prestige channels 
In addition to its popular fragrance collections, our Tom Ford brand has a fast-growing and much desired makeup business. Sales of Tom Ford luxury makeup products rose more than 50% 
Sale order in Clinique also achieved global growth in cap portfolios. Estée Lauder delivered good momentum in the European region as its double foundation continued to be a strong seller. In North America, the brand launch the Estee Edit exclusivity in several stores and on sephora.com. The millionaire of targeted line generated the recent media attention and there is a full cadence of strong promotional activities planned throughout the fourth quarter 
At Clinique, the brand extended its successful collection with new formulas and attracted young consumers with a digital campaign that included interactive music videos with a raising pop star. 
Growth in fragrance continue to come from our luxury sense. Jo Malone and Tom Ford had terrific results. Both brands generated double-digit growth in every region. The success of these brand supports our strategy to position our fragrance portfolio toward a profitable in area where we are gaining share 
Our luxury fragrance brands, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, contributed higher sales, has been the collection of fragrances 
Recently, we acquired a sophisticated -based brand that we believe further strengthen our leadership in fast-growing luxury fragrances 
Turning to our geographies. Our international business was staller and virtually every market grew. During the quarter, I visited several countries to grow consumer sentiment and visit stores. One trip was in the U.K., which had a robust sales in the quarter, far exceeding prestige beauty growth  While that I spent time in Birmingham and so how our brand successfully tailored that product to the city's diverse multicultural population.
Consumers in the U.K. have a great passion for beauty and our brands have responded in ways that appeal to a wide range of demographics which has helped reinforce our leadership position in this market. The European region remained robust with growth in nearly every country and particularly, France and Italy, where all brands contributed to a double-digit increase 
the tragic attacks in Paris, Turkey and Brussels understandably dampened some tourist activities in the quarter. But I'm proud of that tremendous trends and resilience our organization in this country showed during this very difficult times. 
Although, fewer tourists contributed to a falloff in retail sales in French Airports following the Paris attack, our total net sales for sales for the quarter were strong, enjoying the results of our diversification strategy by region, category, brand and type of airport 
And retail sales in China were solid and broad-based. They rose double digits in house of the top 30 trial retail markets in the world. 
Currency fluctuations continue to affect travel patterns. In our travel business, we continue to see stronger growth in some markets where the currency was weakening, including Japan, Australia, or Canada due to a greater number of inbound tourists. Weak currencies in Brazil and Russia led to a decline in travel by those population and affected the sales in the travel corridors that they, frequent. However, local market sales in these 2 countries grew double-digits, as more consumer purchase products close to their homes. 
Adjusted return from Korea a few days ago, it was amazed by the energy and excitement there, that beauty produces, since the fear of nerves is abutted, tourists are returning, especially the Chinese. Our business in Korea has turned around very nicely from a year ago, up double digits this quarter, and I was very pleased to see that we're gaining share 
Demand for makeup is exhilarating strongly and our brands are successfully competing head to head with Korean brands. 4 of our brands introduced cushion comforts, which are extremely popular with Korean consumers. Bobbi Brown's Cushion Comfort did so well it became 15% off its Korea business and contributed to the brand's foundation sales doubling in the country 
During my visit, I met our partners at an impressive brand that is seeing strong demand and insights into consumer desires and opportunities for growth 
As I visited stores in I couldn't help, but notice the sales of luxury fragrances are booming, including our own Jo Malone brand. I'm excited about the opportunity this trend holds for the newer fragrance brands in our portfolio. We recently launched GLAMGLOW in Korea and avid consumers are actively using social media to the brand and. Korea is a center of innovation for beauty and there are many new trends and ideas that our brands can leverage and bring to consumers in other areas of the world.
Looking now with our emerging markets. Our China business was healthy, as most brands grew solidly and retail sales gained momentum. The online channel had the fastest growth and accounted for nearly 10% of sales. Sales in fragrance continue to accelerate creating greater diversification in our Chinese business. As an example, more than doubled with strong momentum in both department stores and freestanding stores 
Our other emerging markets continue to generate excellent growth, rising 20% among the best performance were South Africa or Brazil. M-A-C continues to be a trailblazer in Africa has introduced prestige beauty products and personalized services. It has entered many countries in New Zealand, most recently Zambia 
To fuel of company's growth -- global momentum, we continued invested in fast-growing channels. We opened new freestanding stores and launched several E&M commerce sites for our brands, mostly with retailers. GLAMGLOW, for example, began selling its products on Nostrum with website. We also increased our presence in specialty. In the U.S. Clinique continued expanding in all stuff. Estée Lauder launched its Estée Edit product line in Sephora and several several brands added more locations in Bluemercury. opened a new specialty concept in Shanghai and several of our brands are present 
Our creativity and innovation were center to accomplishments in the quarter. Estée Lauder advanced powerful mask was well received, particularly, in Asia and boosted the brands important Advanced Night Repair franchise. Clinique eye cream, which brightens and primes the eye area for makeup did bought it in -- exclusively in Sephora in the United States and was the #1 eye cream there in February and March 
Beyond products, our brand continue to forge creative collaborations. M-A-C is designing a makeup collection inspired by the singer Celena. Estée Lauder is teaming up with foster designer, Victoria Beckham, for a full cosmetic collection. 
This collaboration brings great to our brand, especially on social media, and we them to grow new consumers.
Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey to give more details on the quarter."

As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. 
Net sales for the third quarter were to $2.66 billion, up 6% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 10 basis points of the sales growth 
As Fabrizio mentioned, our international business remained quite strong as nearly all of our international markets grew this quarter, led by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 11% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in most developed and emerging markets. The region continues to benefit in part from the weak euro, making in a more attractive tourist destination as well as from the benefits of strong execution of its strategic initiatives 
The U.K., Nordic and Italy were the largest contributors to grow among the developed markets in the region and the Middle East, Russia, South Africa and Central Europe led double-digit gains in emerging markets in the region. Our online business was particularly strong across all EMEA markets this quarter 
Our net sales in the global travel retail channel rose 9%, reflecting strong retail trends in most countries in Europe and Asia, which were partially offset by continued net sales decline in Hong Kong, Brazil and The United States. Overall, passenger traffic growth in travel retail across all regions remained solid, despite shifts in consumption patterns between countries due to currencies 
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Every market in that region grew, except in Hong Kong, which was down double digits. Korea was the largest contributor to net sales growth rising 14% in the quarter followed closely by Japan, Australia and Taiwan. China rose 5% led by 70% growth in E&M sales. Online sales across all APAC markets grow sharply this quarter. 
Our net sales in Hong Kong declined more than we had anticipated as tourists from the Chinese mainland continue to decrease. 
Excluding Hong Kong, the region sales would've grow nearly 9% 
Net sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency. Brazil, Mexico and Canada all saw strong double-digit growth. As currencies in these countries continued to weaken against the dollar, local market consumption remained strong. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits. Continued strength in our online business, specialty multi and high-end department store channels was largely offset by sharp declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued softness in traffic in the brick-and-mortar business of midtier department stores 
Once again, makeup sales led product category growth rising 11% in constant currency. Double-digit growth from M-A-C, Smashbox and Tom Ford led the increase, while particularly strength -- while particular strength in the and foundation categories drove makeup growth at Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Estée Lauder this quarter.
Sales of fragrance rose 7% in constant currency. Double-digit gains from our luxury portfolio, Jo Malone, Tom Ford and Le Labo contributed to the majority of the growth. The Michael Kors Gold collection and Tory Burch stood out among the designer fragrances, the strength of the high-end of the fragrance category was partially offset by lower fragrances sales from Estée Lauder and the remaining designer fragrances 
Haircare sales increased 3% in constant currency. The data benefited from the initial shipments of its new and body for men product as well as higher sales of more recent launches and existing products. The brands of the new doors in travel retail and added and freestanding stores in Europe. Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in all channels.
Skin care sales were flat in constant currency reflecting the continued weakness in Hong Kong and the ongoing shift and increased consumer spending from skin care to makeup. Additionally, Estée Lauder skincare business declined slightly in the quarter due to tough comparisons with prior year launches in the U.S. and in Asia. There were many bright spots in our portfolio for skin care. La Mer Origins group skin care in double digits, as did skin care lines of our M.A.C and Bobbi Brown makrup brands 
Our gross margin increased 50 basis points to 81% of sales, the improvement came primarily from supply chain savings and lower promotional expenses partially offset by channel and category mix. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, increased 110 basis points to 66% compared to the prior year quarter 
Selling and store operations cost to support our retail store growth as well as the general and initiative costs primarily from employee-related costs, consulting fees and our prior acquisitions drove most of the increases. These were partially offset by our value creation from our strategic modernization initiative and a deferral of some advertising and promotional expenses to the fourth quarter to support higher expected sales growth in the quarter 
As a result, operating income decreased less than 1% to $399.2 million and operating margin fell 60 basis points to 15% due entirely to foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 3% 
Net earnings also decreased approximately 1% below the prior year quarter to $274.9 million. Diluted EPS of $0.73 was 2% above the prior-year reflecting the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger-than-expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of continued expense management and a delay in some advertising and promotional spending for Estée Lauder and Clinique to the fourth quarter 
Earnings per share for the quarter include $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 5% 
Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year. The sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact full year comparisons to the prior year. I will discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift, as always. Our forecasted growth rates, both before and after the shift, impact are available in today's earnings release. Also excluded is impact of restructuring and other charges.
For the full year, we expected sales to continue -- to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact of full year sales growth by approximately 5 percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of April of 1.14 for the euro, 1.44 for the pound and 1.09 for the yen for the the remainder of the fiscal year 
Diluted EPS is now expected to range between $3.09 and $3.14, or $0.02 more than our last guidance that you, reflecting a slight moderation in the currency impact. Adverse currency translation is now projected to affect the EPS by about $0.27. Excluding the currency impact, we continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Our EPS range includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions 
Our strong performance today gives us a confidence to invest more in the fourth quarter to support additional advertising and promotion, primarily, for Estée Lauder and Clinique. While we continue to pursue value creation from our SMI program, which is now expected to deliver $175 million of cost savings this year, we also look for ways to further improve our cost leverage in the future 
Fabrizio will now discuss the initiative we announced a our press release today."

The multifaceted initiatives that we called leading beauty forwards is designed to provide additional fuel for long-term growth and profitability. Each will build on our strong foundation and leverage capabilities we have developed in important areas driving our business including digital, retail and creative. 
Leading beauty forward will support the continuing success of our strategy in an increasingly fast-paced complex and competitive prestige beauty environment. It is designed to sustain our momentum by reducing costs and freeing up more resources to invest in brands capability and most profitable opportunities, while better leveraging our growth. 
As we look towards the future, we believe the best way to capture the growth opportunity of tomorrow is being proactive today. These initiative is carefully measured next step in our long-term strategy that will allow us to continue to lead in the prestige beauty industry. We expect leading beauty forward to sustain our sales operating margin and earning per share growth beyond the goals we have set throughout fiscal year 2018. Clearly, how we do business today and how we must be prepared to do business in the future is very different from what it was just 7 years ago when we launched our current strategy. The fast-moving landscape requires a mindset and a way of operating that increases speed and flexibility is created, streamlined, cost efficient are designed to serve global consumers in new ways 
To that end, as part of leading beauty forward, we plan to redesign select areas of our go to market organizations in the regions, affiliates and brands to increase agility and strengthen that capabilities. As more of our consumer engagement moves to digital platforms, the markets will need the tools and authority to respond quickly to opportunities and bring our expertise in local relevance closer to consumer 
Stronger skills and innovation digital, social media and creative capabilities will allow them to differentiate our unique brands even farther by tailoring products and services to specific consumer segments and channels. We also will redesign select corporate functions to increase their efficiencies by making them leaner, scalable and less costly, while continue to deliver excellent services to our brand and businesses. We are evaluating the creation of a global and regional shared services among certain functions to simplify processes and focus on more strategic activities. We also plan to continue to optimize some of our supply chain operations to create a more efficient structure. These actions are expected to reduce our operating expenses, freeing up resources to invest in our brands, channel, consumer facing activities and potential acquisitions 
An important goal of leading beauty forward is to support and grow our brands. To accomplish this, we'll invest in activities that will resonate the consumers including the innovation to develop new product and services, unique point of sales assets, effective social media dialogues and compelling advertising. We will also support our newly acquired brands to expand their presence and products and continue to build our small and medium-size brands, so they become leaders in the industry 
As employees focus more fully on being creative and strategic, we will enhance our learning and developing programs. So they have the best skills to lead in critical areas. The redesign will regrettably include reducing position in some areas. We also expect to add talent in the departments we plan to strengthen and to retain all other employees. In total, we estimate at this time, a global net reduction of approximately 900 to 1,200 positions, which is about 2.5% of our current workforce 
As the company continues to grow and invest in new positions in the future, the improved process from these initiatives are expected also to better leverage future productivity. We're launching leading beauty forward from a position of exceptional strength. Since we began our new strategy cycle, our sales have increased by more than 50% and our growth rate has outpaced that of global prestige beauty. Key to this performance is the much more diversified and balanced business we have created, with growth engines across our brands, categories, channels and geographies. 
Within size from our 10-year we anticipated many of the trends influencing the industry's rise. We also modernize our processes and technology infrastructure. Our strategy modernization initiative has been deployed through most of our organization creating greater visibility to information that let us manage our business in a more cost-efficient manner. We developed a wider spectrum of capabilities, strengthening our talents in areas such as R&D, supply chain, information technology, retail, digital and consumer insight. 
Leading beauty forward is designed to build on these achievements to further increase our efficiency and effectiveness. Global prestige beauty is striding, growing industry with new channels, emerging geographies at the influence of younger consumer. With the convenience of the Internet, the passion of specialty multi retailers dedicated to beauty, particularly, in the U.S. how consumers is changing rapidly in competition has intensified. Lower barrier to entry resulted in more than 250 new niche brands launching around the word last year and the sheer number of beauty products buying for consumer's attention is vastly increasing 
The design of our new structure should generate greater productivity to better cost leverage of our sales growth. Importantly, leading beauty forward will create ongoing savings and reinvestment to help continue our momentum in this fast growing and more competitive market, which should mean greater sustainability and less risk in meeting our future growth platform 
As the global leader in prestige beauty, we are posed to take advantage of opportunities that lie ahead by taking charge in leading change. Leading beauty forward further positions our company to continue winning in this rapidly changing arena where the ability to anticipate developments adn react swiftly and nimbly is more essential than ever. We expect to sustain our strong growth and lead not only our company but whole of the prestige beauty forward to a greater heights. Tracey?"

So as Fabrizio just discussed, leading beauty forward is a multiyear initiative designed to help us fuel growth momentum and create more efficient assistant to sustain our margin progression beyond fiscal 2018. 
During the course of this initiative, over the last few years, we expect to take charges of approximately $600 million to $700 million. We expect to begin realizing initial benefits from the program in fiscal 2018, but we'll continue to maintain our flexibility to invest in opportunities and mitigate risks 
At this time, we do not expect this to affect the long range guidance we provided last summer other than the related restructuring charges. Once fully implemented, we expect to generate annualized benefits -- net benefits of $200 million to $300 million currently anticipated to be fully realized after fiscal 2019. We expect to reinvest a portion of those savings behind the capabilities we need that Fabrizio just discussed to continue to succeed in the rapidly changing global prestige beauty environment 
We'll, as we usually do, update our 3-year strategic outlook and share our goals in August. The update will include the impact of these initiatives, any adjustment to our strategy since last year, and the addition of recently acquired brand and changes in currency rate assumptions. 
We're pleased with our results so far this year and we believe leading beauty forward will play an important role in supporting our continued sustained growth momentum for the long-term

I see our pipeline best was 5 years ago, I would say, it's almost doubled in terms of the power of extra business. We have a very clear internal process where we look for sufficiency of our innovation pipeline versus our next 3 years, 5 years goals. And I can tell you, we consider our innovation pipeline more than sufficient. Now the characteristic of the pipeline has changed in some way also. First of all, today the pipeline is much richer in makeup because as you heard that the makeup category is, in this moment, fast-growing in the world and also very fast-changing. So there's some outstanding innovation pipeline in makeup and the makeup pipelines tends to be down by many smaller products versus few of a big products, which is more typical of the skin care pipeline, so that's a change. And we have adjusted to the change. Our skin care pipeline is strong, but again, within skin care, the pipeline is more focused of what we call instant benefit skin care versus the long-term antiaging and that's changed. And third, and probably very, very important, our pipeline in the fragrance business has changed and its done by much more high-end luxury artisanal fragrances, which will allow us, in my opinion, to continue to gain market share in the high-end profitable fragrance business. And finally, in hair care, our pipeline, particularly in the styling and more profitable part of hair care, is stronger than ever. So in that, I feel positive about the sufficiency of the pipeline and also I feel positive by the the fit of our pipeline to the future of the markets as identified by our compass."

The first one is that the Asian consumer, the Asian women are becoming more avid users of makeup. And so this is an enormous amount of growth potentially that was developed -- it is developing now and will continue to develop in the next years. The second big trend is that the millionaires are on an average using more makeup than the previous generation, so there is an increase of conceptual per Individual in all markets, including developed markets and this is a long time trend, also because what is it driving the more user to makeup is what historically has been our strength and our business model, which is education and customization. And now the education is available also via online, exactly our e-commerce activities and via social media, which is booming the amount of how to different trends, et cetera. So the combination of this more amount of trends information and how-to information with the millennial generation point of view is pushing makeup up. I think, this will continue for a long period. In terms of our activity in e-commerce, we continue to do very well. I think, we gained substantial competitive advantage, but not only in the execution in market also in the capabilities. We have a very strong e-commerce team that is developing amazing work which are divided into technology people that can develop sites and develop activity in a very fast pace around the world from our centralized offices in New York in a very -- with investment in now will payout in the long-term that we have done in the previous years.

So can you help with some -- provide a little bit more insight on how you go about making decisions on A&P spend, because that line just continue to move around a fair bit quarter-to-quarter? And then also, in terms of the Chinese tourism, do think you're making up the shortfall in Hong Kong from lack of Chinese tourists in other areas?"

We continue to believe that we will deliver the fiscal year in the 7% to 8% range, which means if you look at the numbers that, we assume actually in acceleration of the sales trend in the fourth quarter. So the sales in the quarter depend a lot by initiatives, launches and what happens in specific markets. And the way we take A&P decisions is -- really we base the decision of -- if we believe there is enough rate of return on that investment in that moment. For example, in quarter 3, the things that we saw going less strong that we expect that was Hong Kong. And so when we had markets that decreased the growth significantly, we do decrease our spending there and we keep the spending for better moments where that is better market traction. So what you're seeing in this quarter, very specifically, reduced spending in Hong Kong from our side. The second area where we saw a less traction was U.S. mid-year department store brick-and-mortar where we clearly saw less traction together with all the tourist doors in the U.S. that particularly, influenced by the absence of Brazilians and Russians that was a very dramatic change. So when we see these dramatic changes, we obviously adjust our investment. The second reason was, in this case, very specific is some product launch initiative, so Clinique that we decided to move in supporting them in the fourth quarter, which is the other reason why we're moving the investment from one quarter to another. Personally, I see these as a strength. We have the agility to move our key investment by quarter depending on the market situation and the broader launches situation and these make us more efficient and more effective, and we stay consistent on our year goal, that we will commit to do our best to deliver, does not change by quarter, actually we see agility and flexibility as strengths.
On the Chinese consumers, now that we are definitely doing much better with Chinese consumer in other areas where they are going, for example, in Europe as we are seeing there is a growth of our European business, which is partially driven by tourists and the tourists are also Chinese, we are seeing Korea coming back and Japan being pretty strong. So yes, we recover some of the sales, however, not all of that. We have a very high market share in Hong Kong, very very high market share. And our market share, for example in Japan is half of the market share we have in Hong Kong. So in that situation, we obviously cannot recover the Hong Kong losses completely in other areas and that's what you're seeing in this moment as a phenomenon, but this is a temporary phenomenon and as soon as Hong Kong will stabilize in other markets where we are now building market share, like Korea, will achieve the levels we believe are achievable, the things will accelerate again."

M-A-C is growing strong double-digits in every single market of the world and these -- the temporary flattening of the retail trend in the U.S. is being more than offset by a blooming international business. The flattening of the U.S. is -- the temporary flattening of the U.S. trend is to -- driven by 2 aspects: One, as I said, is the fact that the lower traffic in midtier department store is one of the driver and the other is tourists. I mean, M-A-C business is driven by tourists of the world that this is the U.S. in a significant way because the brand is very, very popular around the word. So the important decrease of tourists, particularly Brazilians and Russians, as I said, is temporary, limited the retail of M-A-C, also because these tourists were very strong in the base period that we're comparing this to. Overall, in total, M-A-C 
continues to be absolutely one of the strong drivers of our success around the world and we have programs to ensure that this will continue. In terms of the success of the small size brands in the U.S. This is a fact that, as I explained in my prepared remarks, that the combination of easy access to consumers and more availability of investment lower interest rates created a lot of new launches of brands and the possibility of social media to bring attention of the consumers has taken down the barriers to entry. So the way we're reacting is, first of all, reinforcing the business in our strong brands. Second, participating to this with our midsize smaller brands, including acquisitions. I mean, Smashbox was one of these brands when we acquired these brands and now in fact its growing double-digit in the context of these. And then finally, is the diversification of our distribution with freestanding store, more specialty, continued success of online and our support to midtier department store to accelerate to reinforcer business model to be able to better attract millionaires and better activate the floor in order to become even more competitive of this development of smaller brands and all the new channels. This is one of the changes that I was describing before that requires adjustment in capabilities and investments in supporting our brand's growth."

But then the combination of our business and cost savings is actually producing the power to continue growing margin. Obviously, if currency and acquisition will stop affecting it negatively, this will be more visible. The other thing is, there is also a mix change in our business. So we have more freestanding stores and we have more makeup versus skin care that also are changing the input of mix in our business, so we need to continue to deliver our growth, we need to become more efficient and effective and manage our overall cost reduction better.

So that is a margin difference in terms of our business performance relative to our previous timeframe. One of the things that the lead beauty forward program does for us, because we are -- and certainly our compass -- our tenure compass has allowed us to continue to understand that there are very significant growth opportunities for us from a total  company standpoint. It allows us the freedom to invest more in those is opportunities irrespective of the margin and deliver our margin goals in -- well into the future. And so it's a very exciting program.

So those are the primary drivers. And as Fabrizio mentioned, also previously the slowdown in Hong Kong and a couple of other market slowdown, North America, we see in the last few years, postholiday traffic has been quite slow, and it has taken longer to start to see traffic flow back into particularly, the department store channel and particularly, the midtier department store channel.

So retail sales 8% in China is good, it's strong. And the profile of our growth, first of all, by brand, is that all brands are growing double-digit, with the exception of our Estée Lauder brand, which is a biggest brand and that's the profile. So we're -- first of all, even before distribution, we're diversifying our brand portfolio that goes with the distribution because different brands having different distribution. And we are diversifying geographically because as I explained our timing was through also this quarter we are opening in new cities and new geographical area of China. We opened one new city, we opened 30 new doors just in the quarter 3. In terms of the channels, online is doing well and will continue to do well. Today, we have now 10% of our business by now in online in China versus 12% in the U.S., so China is catching up with the U.S. at a speed of light. We're opening more freestanding store in this moment is mainly on M-A-C and Jo Malone, but in the future we may decide as we see the opportunity to add also other brands increasing the number of freestanding stores, particularly, in the cities where this is appropriate and there is no alternative distribution solutions. I personally believe that the future of freestanding stores in China will go directly to omnichannel meaning the stores will be connected to online brand.com activities and with the 1 basically omnichannel opportunity that will bring the brands in many more cities with pretty efficient freestanding store models, which are not the traditional big freestanding stores in cities like in the developed markets. And finally, we believe the specialty channel over time will also develop in China, and today, we are much more penetrated and developed in the specialty channel in China that we were in the U.S. at the beginning of the specialty channel development. So diversified by region of China, well diversified by brand or better diversified by brand in our strategy and well diversified by channel is our goal for the development of the China market.
Now in innovation on skin care, as I explained before, yes, we are looking at skin care in a different way reflecting the new consumer trends of reality. As I said, when you take skin care as a whole, there is a bigger and faster growth in what I call skin care for immediate benefit or skin care as a base of makeup and there is less growth in this moment in the intense antiaging skin care part. For the same reason, for makeup, a lot of the growth is driven by millionaires, which is more interested in this part of the skin care. So yes, big part of innovation pipeline is also driven in these skin care benefits, which are more modern  and more millionaire. Take an example, the new dimension of launch of Estée Lauder is not about antiaging, it's about really the shaping of the phase depending how consumer wants. So think of our fastest-growing skin care segment, which are masks. Masks or even we have a brand GLAMGLOW, which is completely focused on masks, and masks is product you use to get immediately after 10 minutes the benefit that you're looking for, be it luminosity, moisturization, or brightening, et cetera. So skin care for immediate benefits, which is closer to makeup in reality in terms of benefit to consumer is a fastest-growing trend, and our pipeline in these areas are the strongest they have ever been."

And I just came from Hong Kong, as I said in my prepared remarks, I was in Asia last week, I visited Hong Kong and Korea. And the other thing making me comfort is the strengths of our team there, which is managing this very difficult timing in a fantastic way, increasing their activities on a local consumers to help our business to stabilize without waiting for tourists, but just increasing our market share with locals, which I think is the right strategy and I have great confidence in our team to be able to stabilize the trend as soon as the market will allow. On your skin care question, I think is that -- I think, I have answered already several times, the skin care, obviously, is remains the most important categories overall and we'll continue to grow.

We had to adjust our innovation, our technology, our activities and planning for the future to the balance between more drastic antiaging benefits and more immediate benefits. We're doing that by our portfolio brands, some of our brands are much stronger in antiaging, like Estée Lauder, some of our other brands like GLAMGLOW are completely focused on immediate results skin care. And come of our brands, like Bobbi Brown, have a strong skin care business, which is actually the skin care is a basal makeup, it is to support to the makeup habits of women. So we have a packing skin care multiple fronts, antiaging, basal makeup, insta benefit. Thanks to our portfolio brands and thanks to our innovation pipeline. I feel very strong about our long-term skin care trends, but it's a fact that makeup, in this moment, is a much foster growing category, and we are again, I see as a strength, that we have the agility to adjust and refocus our investment resources depending on the biggest trend we are seeing."

In the third quarter, we delivered solid performance, with strong gains particularly from our makeup category and international business. In constant currencies, sales grew 6%, and earnings per share rose 5% before charges to $0.76. Based on our results to date, we are on track to achieve our sales and earning guidance for the full fiscal year, excluding charges. 
We continue to benefit from a highly diversified business with multiple engines of growth and the flexibility to move investment quickly to support areas that provide the best returns. 
We continued to fuel makeup, a vibrant category, where we have achieved constant currency double-digit gains every quarter this fiscal year. Social media is helping to drive makeup sales, with how-to-do videos, tips from consumers and influences and beautiful visuals of makeup transformations. Our company has thousands of talented makeup artists who are a competitive advantage for our brands and help drive consumption through personal lessons in-store, as well as online, where they can demonstrate the artistry to a broader audience.
M-A-C Instagram, for example, features photos submitted by its global artists, illustrating their creativity and talents tied to products and trends. This kind of social media interaction creates an ongoing dialogue between the brand and its consumers and help driving sales.
We are the largest company in global prestige makeup, and all our makeup brands grew this quarter. Each of our 3 diverse makeup-focused brands has a distinct character and channel profile. For example, our third -- 1/3 of M-A-C sales came from its freestanding stores. A majority of Bobbi Brown sales came from the global department stores. And Smashbox has a strong presence in specialty multi retailers. And there is further opportunity for growth across all prestige channels. 
In addition to its popular fragrance collections, our Tom Ford brand has a fast-growing and much desired makeup business. Sales of Tom Ford luxury makeup products rose more than 50%. 
Estée Lauder and Clinique also achieved global growth in their makeup portfolios. Estée Lauder delivered good momentum in the European region as its Double Wear foundation continued to be a strong seller. In North America, the brand launched the Estee Edit exclusivity in Sephora stores and on sephora.com. The millennial-targeted line generated terrific media attention, and there is a full cadence of strong promotional activities planned throughout the fourth quarter.
At Clinique, the brand extended its successful Pop Lip Colour collection with new formulas and attracted young consumers with a digital campaign that included interactive music videos with a rising Swedish pop star. 
Growth in fragrance continue to come from our luxury sense. Jo Malone and Tom Ford had terrific results. Both brands generated double-digit growth in every region. The success of these brands supports our strategy to position our fragrance portfolio toward a profitable higher-end tier, an area where we are gaining share. Our artisanal luxury fragrance brands, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, contributed higher sales, as did the Aerin collection of fragrances. Recently, we acquired By Kilian, a sophisticated Paris-based brand that we believe further strengthened our leadership in fast-growing luxury fragrances.
Turning to our geographies. Our international business was stellar, and virtually every market grew. During the quarter, I visit several countries to gauge consumer sentiment and visit stores. One trip was in the U.K., which had robust sales in the quarter, far exceeding prestige beauty growth. While there, I spent time in Birmingham and saw how our brand successfully tailored their product to the city's diverse, multicultural population. Consumers in the U.K. have a great passion for beauty, and our brands have responded in ways that appeal to a wide range of demographics, which has helped reinforce our leadership position in this market. 
The European region remained robust, with growth in nearly every country, and particularly France and Italy, where all brands contributed to a double-digit increase. 
The tragic attacks in Paris, Turkey and Brussels understandably dampened some tourist activities in the quarter, but I'm proud of that tremendous trends and resilience our organization in this country showed during this very difficult times. 
Although fewer tourist contributed to a falloff in retail sales in French airports following the Paris attack, our total net sales in travel retail for the quarter were strong, enjoying the results of our diversification strategy by region, category, brand and type of airport. And retail sales in the channel were solid and broad-based. They rose double digits in half of the top 30 travel retail markets in the world. 
Currency fluctuations continue to affect travel patterns in our travel business. We continue to see stronger growth in some markets where the currency was weakened, including Japan, Australia or Canada, due to a greater number of inbound tourist. Weak currencies in Brazil and Russia led to a decline in travel by those population and affected sales in the travel corridors that they frequent. However, local market sales in these 2 countries grew double-digits, as more consumer purchase products close to their homes. 
I just returned from Korea a few days ago, and was amazed by the energy and excitement there that beauty produces. Since the fear of MERS has abated, tourists are returning, especially the Chinese. Our business in Korea has turned around very nicely from a year ago, up double digits this quarter. And I was very pleased to see that we are gaining share. Demand for makeup is exhilarating strongly, and our brands are successfully competing head-to-head with Korean brands. Four of our brands introduced cushioned compacts, which are extremely popular with Korean consumers. Bobbi Brown's cushion compact did so well, it became 15% of its Korea business, and contributed to the brand's foundation sales doubling in the country. 
During my visit, I met our partners at Dr. Jart+, an impressive brand that is seeing strong demand, and gleaned insights into consumer desires and opportunities for growth. 
As I visited stores in Seoul, I couldn't help but notice the sales of artisanal luxury fragrances are booming, including our own Jo Malone brand. I'm excited about the opportunity this trend holds for the newer fragrance brands in our portfolio. 
We recently launched GLAMGLOW in Korea, and avid consumers are actively using social media to talk a bout the brand and post photos. Korea is a center of innovation for beauty, and there are many new trends and ideas that our brands can leverage and bring to consumers in other areas of the world.
Looking now at our emerging markets. Our China business was healthy, as most brands grew solidly and retail sales gained momentum. The online channel had the fastest growth and accounted for nearly 10% of sales. Sales in makeup and fragrance continue to accelerate, creating greater diversification in our Chinese business. As an example, Jo Malone business more than doubled with strong momentum in both department stores and freestanding stores.
Our other emerging markets continue to generate excellent growth, rising 20%. Among the best performance were South Africa or Brazil. M-A-C continues to be a trailblazer in Sub-Sahara Africa, has introduced prestige beauty products and personalized services. It has entered many countries in this area, most recently Zambia. 
To fuel of company's global momentum, we continued investing in fast-growing channels. We opened new freestanding stores and launched several e- and m-commerce sites for our brands, mostly with retailers. GLAMGLOW, for example, began selling its products on Nordstrom's website. We also increased our presence in specialty multi. In the U.S., Clinique continued expanding in Ulta. Estée Lauder launched its Estée Edit product line in Sephora, and several brands added more locations in Bluemercury. Isetan opened a new specialty multi-store concept in Shanghai, and several of our brands are present. 
Our creativity and innovation were central to accomplishments in the quarter. Estée Lauder Advanced PowerFoil Mask was well received, particularly in Asia, and boosted the brand's important Advanced Night Repair franchise. Clinique Pep-Start Eye Cream, which brightens and primes the eye area for makeup, debuted in -- exclusively in Sephora in the United States and was the #1 eye cream there in February and March. 
Beyond products, our brand continue to forge creative collaborations. M-A-C is designing a makeup collection inspired by the singer Selena. And Estée Lauder is teaming up with foster designer, Victoria Beckham, for a full cosmetic collection. This collaboration brings great bask [ph] to our brand, especially on social media, and we expect them to draw new consumers.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey to give more details on the quarter."

As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. 
Net sales for the third quarter were $2.66 billion, up 6% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 10 basis points of the sales growth. 
As Fabrizio mentioned, our international business remained quite strong, as nearly all of our international markets grew this quarter, led by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 11% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in most developed and emerging markets. The region continues to benefit in part from the weak euro, making it a more attractive tourist destination, as well as from the benefits of strong execution of its strategic initiatives. 
The U.K., Nordic and Italy were the largest contributors to growth among the developed markets in the region. And the Middle East, Russia, South Africa and Central Europe led double-digit gains in emerging markets in the region. Our online business was particularly strong across all EMEA markets this quarter. 
Our net sales in the global travel retail channel rose 9%, reflecting strong retail trends in most countries in Europe and Asia, which were partially offset by continued net sales declines in Hong Kong, Brazil and The United States. Overall, passenger traffic growth in travel retail across all regions remained solid, despite shifts in consumption patterns between countries due to currency. 
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Every market in the region grew, except Hong Kong, which was down double digits. Korea was the largest contributor to net sales growth, rising 14% in the quarter, followed closely by Japan, Australia and Taiwan. China rose 5%, led by 70% growth in e- and m-commerce sales. Online sales across all APAC markets rose sharply this quarter. 
Our net sales in Hong Kong declined more than we had anticipated, as tourists from the Chinese mainland continue to decrease. Excluding Hong Kong, the region sales would have grow nearly 9%. 
Net sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency. Brazil, Mexico and Canada all saw strong double-digit growth. As currencies in these countries continue to weaken against the dollar, local market consumption remained strong. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits. Continued strength in our online business, specialty multi and high-end department store channels was largely offset by sharp declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued softness in traffic in the brick-and-mortar business of midtier department stores. 
Once again, makeup sales led product category growth, rising 11% in constant currency. Double-digit growth from M-A-C, Smashbox and Tom Ford led the increase, while particularly strength -- while particular strength in the lip and foundation categories drove makeup growth at Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Estée Lauder this quarter.
Sales of fragrance products rose 7% in constant currency. Double-digit gains from our luxury portfolio. Jo Malone, Tom Ford and Le Labo contributed the majority of the growth. The Michael Kors Gold collection and Tory Burch stood out among the designer fragrances. This strength at the high end of the fragrance category was partially offset by lower fragrance sales from Estée Lauder and the remaining designer fragrances. 
Haircare sales increased 3% constant currency. Aveda benefited from initial shipments of its new -- and body for men products, as well as higher sales of more recent launches and existing products. The brands opened new doors in travel retail and added salons and freestanding stores in Europe. Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in all channels.
Skin care sales were flat in constant currency, reflecting the continued weakness in Hong Kong and the ongoing shift in increased consumer spending from skin care to makeup. Additionally, Estée Lauder's skin care business declined slightly in the quarter due to tough comparisons with prior year launches in the U.S. and in Asia. There were many bright spots in our portfolio for skin care. La Mer and Origins group skin care in double digits, as did skin care lines of our M-A-C and Bobbi Brown makeup brands. 
Our gross margin increased 50 basis points to 81% of sales, T.he improvement came primarily from supply chain savings and lower promotional expenses, partially offset by channel and category mix. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, increased 110 basis points to 66% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Selling and store operations cost to support our retail store growth, as well as the general and initiative costs, primarily from employee-related cost, consulting fees in our prior acquisitions, drove most of the increases. These were partially offset by our value creation from our strategic modernization initiative and a deferral of some advertising and promotional expenses to the fourth quarter to support higher expected sales growth in that quarter. 
As a result, operating income decreased less than 1% to $399.2 million and operating margin fell 60 basis points to 15%, due entirely to foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 3%. 
Net earnings also decreased approximately 1% below the prior year quarter to $274.9 million. Diluted EPS of $0.73 was 2% above the prior-year, reflecting the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger-than-expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of continued expense management and a delay in some advertising and promotional spending for Estée Lauder and Clinique to the fourth quarter. 
Earnings per share for the quarter include $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 5%. 
Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year. The sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact full year comparisons to the prior year. I will discuss our expectations, adjusting for the impact of the shift, as always. Our forecasted growth rates, both before and after the shift impact, are available in today's earnings release. Also excluded is the impact of restructuring and other charges.
For the full year, we expected sales to continue -- or to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 5 percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of April of $1.14 for the euro, $1.44 for the pound and 109 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Diluted EPS is now expected to range between $3.09 and $3.14, or $0.02 more than our last guidance ranges, reflecting a slight moderation in the currency impact. Adverse currency translation is now projected to affect EPS by about $0.27. Excluding the currency impact, we continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Our EPS range includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions. 
Our strong performance to date gives us the confidence to invest more in the fourth quarter to support additional advertising and promotion, primarily for Estée Lauder and Clinique. While we continue to pursue value creation from our SMI program, which is now expected to deliver $175 million of cost savings this year, we also look for ways to further improve our cost leverage in the future. 
Fabrizio will now discuss the initiative we announced a our press release today."

The multifaceted initiative that we call Leading Beauty Forward is designed to provide additional fuel for long-term growth and profitability. It will build on our strong foundation and leverage capabilities we have developed in important areas driving our business, including digital, retail and creative. 
Leading Beauty Forward will support the continuing success of our strategy in an increasingly fast-paced, complex and competitive prestige beauty environment. It is designed to sustain our momentum by reducing cost and freeing up more resources to invest in brands' capability and most profitable opportunities while better leveraging our growth. 
As we look toward the future, we believe the best way to capture the growth opportunity of tomorrow is being proactive today. This initiative is carefully measured next step in our long-term strategy that will allow us to continue to lead in the prestige beauty industry. We expect Leading Beauty Forward to sustain our sales, operating margin and earning per share growth beyond the goals we have set throughout fiscal year 2018. 
Clearly, how we do business today and how we must be prepared to do business in the future is very different from what it was just 7 years ago, when we launched our current strategy. The fast-moving landscape requires a mindset and a way of operating that increases speed and flexibility, is creative, streamlined, cost efficient and designed to serve global consumers in new ways. 
To that end, as part of Leading Beauty Forward, we plan to redesign select areas of our go-to-market organizations in the regions, affiliates and brands to increase agility and strengthen their capabilities. As more of our consumer engagement moves to digital platforms, the markets will need the tools and authority to respond quickly to opportunities and bring our expertise in local relevance closer to consumer. 
Stronger skills in innovation, digital, social media and creative capabilities will allow them to differentiate our unique brands even farther by tailoring products and services to specific consumer segments and channels. We also will redesign select corporate functions to increase their efficiencies by making them leaner, scalable and less costly, while continue to deliver excellent services to our brand and businesses. 
We are evaluating the creation of a global and regional shared services among certain functions to simplify processes and focus on more strategic activities. We also plan to continue to optimize some of our supply chain operation to create a more efficient structure. These actions are expected to reduce our operating expenses, freeing up resources to invest in our brands, channel, consumer-facing activities and potential acquisitions. 
An important goal of Leading Beauty Forward is to support and grow our brands. To accomplish this, we will invest in activities that will resonate with consumers, including innovation to develop new product and services, unique point-of-sales asset, effective social media dialogues and compelling advertising. We will also support our newly acquired brands to expand their presence and products and continue to build our small and medium-size brands so they become leaders in the industry. 
As employees focus more fully on being creative and strategic, we will enhance our learning and developing programs so they have the best skills to lead in critical areas. The redesign will regrettably include reducing position in some areas. We also expect to add talent in the departments we plan to strengthen and to retain all other employees. In total, we estimate at this time, a global net reduction of approximately 900 to 1,200 positions, which is about 2.5% of our current workforce. As the company continues to grow and invest in new positions in the future, the improved process from these initiative are expected also to better leverage future productivity. 
We are launching Leading Beauty Forward from a position of exceptional strength. Since we began our new strategy cycle, our sales have increased by more than 50%, and our growth rate has outpaced that of global prestige beauty. Key to this performance is the much more diversified and balanced business we have created, with growth engines across our brands, categories, channels and geographies. 
With insights from our 10-year compass, we anticipated many of the trends influencing the industry's rise. We also modernized our processes and technology infrastructure. Our strategic modernization initiative has been deployed through most of our organization, creating greater visibility to information that let us manage our business in a more cost-efficient manner. We developed a wider spectrum of capabilities, strengthened our talents in areas such as R&D, supply chain, information technology, retail, digital and consumer insight. 
Leading Beauty Forward is designed to build on these achievements to further increase our efficiency and effectiveness. Global prestige beauty is thriving, growing industry with new channels, emerging geographies at the influence of younger consumers. With the convenience of the Internet, the expansion of specialty multi-retailers dedicated to beauty, particularly, in the U.S., how consumers shop is changing rapidly, and competition has intensified. Lower barrier to entry resulted in more than 250 new niche brands launching around the word last year, and the sheer number of beauty products vying for consumers' attention is vastly increasing. 
The design of our new structure should generate greater productivity through better cost leverage of our sales growth. Importantly, Leading Beauty Forward will create ongoing savings and reinvestment to help continue our momentum in this fast-growing and more competitive market, which should mean greater sustainability and less risk in meeting our future growth targets.
As the global leader in prestige beauty, we are posed to take advantage of opportunities that lie ahead by taking charge in leading change. Leading Beauty Forward further positions our company to continue winning in this rapidly changing arena, where the ability to anticipate developments and react swiftly and nimbly is more essential than ever. We expect to sustain our strong growth and lead not only our company but whole of the prestige beauty forward to greater heights.

So as Fabrizio just discussed, Leading Beauty Forward is a multiyear initiative designed to help us fuel our growth momentum and create more efficient cost structure to sustain our margin progression beyond fiscal 2018. 
During the course of this initiative, over the last few years, we expect to take charges of approximately $600 million to $700 million. We expect to begin realizing initial benefits from the program in fiscal 2018, but we'll continue to maintain our flexibility to invest in opportunities and mitigate risk. 
At this time, we do not expect this to affect the long-range guidance we provided last summer other than the related restructuring charges. Once fully implemented, we expect to generate annualized benefits -- net benefits of $200 million to $300 million, currently anticipated to be fully realized after fiscal 2019. We expect to reinvest a portion of those savings behind the capabilities we need that Fabrizio just discussed to continue to succeed in the rapidly changing global prestige beauty environment. 
We will, as we usually do, update our 3-year strategic outlook and share our goals in August. The update will include the impact of this initiative, any adjustment to our strategy since last year, the addition of recently acquired brand and changes in currency rate assumptions. 
We are pleased with our results so far this year, and we believe Leading Beauty Forward will play an important role in supporting our continued sustained growth momentum for the long term.

If you were to characterize the pipeline going back 5 years, 3 years and then today. How would you explain it to us?

I think our pipeline versus was 5 years ago, I would say, is almost doubled in terms of the power of extra business. We have a very clear internal process where we look for sufficiency of our innovation pipeline versus our next 3, 5 years goals. And I can tell you, we consider our innovation pipeline more than sufficient. Now the characteristic of the pipeline has changed in some way, also. First of all, today, the pipeline is much richer in makeup because, as you heard, the makeup category is, in this moment, the fast-growing in the world and also very fast-changing. So there is some outstanding innovation pipeline in makeup. And the makeup pipelines tends to be done by many smaller products versus few very big product, which is more typical of the skin care pipeline. So that's a change, and we have adjusted to that change. Our skin care pipeline is strong, but again, within skin care, the pipeline is more focused on what we call instant benefit skin care versus the long-term antiaging, and that's changed. And third, but probably very, very important, our pipeline in the fragrance business is changed, it is done by much more high-end luxury artisanal fragrances, which will allow us, in my opinion, to continue gain market share in the high-end profitable fragrance business. And finally, in hair care, our pipeline, particularly in the styling, more profitable part of hair care, is stronger than ever. So in net, I feel positive about the sufficiency of the pipeline. And also, I feel positive by the fit of our pipeline to the future of the market as identified by our compass."

On makeup, first of all, I believe this is a long-term trend. The makeup category is growing, driven by several aspects. The first one is that the Asian consumer, the Asian women, are becoming more avid users of makeup. And so this is an enormous amount of growth potentially that will developed -- it is developing now and will continue to develop in the next years. The second big trend is that the millennials are, on average, using more makeup than the previous generation, so there is an increase of consumption per individual in all markets, including developed markets. And this is a long-term trend, also because what is driving the more usage of makeup is what historically has been our strength and our business model, which is education and customization. But now the education is available also via online, exactly our e-commerce activities, and via social media, which is booming the amount of how-to videos, different trends, et cetera. So the combination of this more amount of trends information and how-to information with the millennial generation point of view is pushing makeup up. I think, this will continue for a long period. In term of our activity in e-commerce, we continue to do very well. I think we gained substantial competitive advantage, but not only in the execution in market, also in the capabilities. We have a very strong e-commerce team that is developing amazing work, which are divided into technology people that can develop sites and develop activity in a very fast pace around the world from our centralized offices in New York in a very -- with investment that now will pay out for the long-term that we have done in the previous years. And we have great quality of execution in the creative side. So on top of that number of sites, the ability to penetrate the markets, frankly, we have the capability and the quality of execution that, for the time being, set us aside, in my opinion, from the industry.

But the sales growth did decelerate a little bit, probably a little bit more than people had expected. So can you help with some -- provide a little bit more insight on how you go about making decisions on A&P spend? Because that line does continue to move around a fair bit quarter-to-quarter. And then also, in terms of the Chinese tourism, do think you're making up the shortfall in Hong Kong from lack of Chinese tourists in other areas?"

So the sales by quarter depend a lot by initiatives, launches and what happens in specific markets. And the way we take the decisions is -- really, we base the decision of -- if we believe there is enough rate of return on that AP investment in that moment. For example, in quarter 3, the things that we saw going less strong than we expected was Hong Kong. And so when we had markets that decreased their growth significantly, we do decrease our spending there, and we keep the spending for better moments, where there is better market traction. So what you're seeing in the third quarter very specifically is reduced spend in Hong Kong from our side. The second area where we saw less traction was U.S. mid-year department store brick-and-mortar, where we clearly saw less traction, together with all the tourist doors in the U.S. that particularly influenced by the absence of Brazilians and Russians, was a very dramatic change. So when we see these dramatic changes, we obviously adjust our AP investment. The second reason was, in this case very specific, is some product launch initiative on Lauder and Clinique that we decided to move in supporting them in the fourth quarter, which is the other reason why we are moving AP investment from one quarter into another. Personally, I see this as a strength. We have the agility to move our AP investment by quarter, depending on the market situation and the product launch situation. And this make us more efficient and more effective, and we stay consistent on our year goal, that we will commit to do our best to deliver. There is no change, but by quarter, actually, we see agility and flexibility as strengths. On the Chinese consumers, now we are definitely doing much better with Chinese consumer in other areas where they are going. For example in Europe, as we have seen, there is a growth of our European business, which is partially driven by tourist, and the tourist are also Chinese. We have seen Korea coming back and Japan being pretty strong. So yes, we recover some of the sales, however, not all of them. We have a very high market share in Hong Kong, very, very high market share. And our market share, for example, in Japan is half of the market share we have in Hong Kong. So in that situation, we obviously cannot recover the Hong Kong losses completely in other areas, that's what you're seeing in this moment as a phenomenon. But this is a temporary phenomenon. And as soon as Hong Kong will stabilize, and other markets where we are now building market share, like Korea, will achieve the levels we believe are achievable, the things will accelerate again."

M-A-C is growing strong double-digits in every single market of the world, and these -- the temporary flattening of the retail trend in the U.S. is being more than offset by a booming international business. The flattening of the U.S. is -- the temporary flattening of the U.S. trend is to -- driven by 2 aspects. One, as I said, is the fact that the lower traffic in midtier department store is one of the driver. And the other is tourists. I mean, M-A-C business is driven by tourists of the world that visit the U.S. in a significant way because the brand is very, very popular around the word. So the important decrease of tourists, particularly Brazilians and Russians, as I said, have temporary limited the retail of M-A-C, also because these tourists were very strong in the base period that we are comparing this to. But overall in total, M-A-C continues to be absolutely one of the strong drivers of our success around the world, and we have programs to ensure that this will continue. In term of the success of the small-size brands in the U.S. This is a fact that, as I explain in my prepared remark, that the combination of easier access to consumers and more availability of investment, now money at a lower interest rates, have created a lot of new launches of brands. And the possibility of social media to bring these brands to the attention of the consumers has taken down the barriers to entry. So the way we are reacting is, first of all, reinforcing the business in our strong brands. Second, participating to this with our midsize smaller brands, including acquisitions. I mean, Smashbox was one of these brands when we acquired these brands, and now in fact, is growing double-digit in the context of this. And then finally is the diversification of our distribution with freestanding store, more specialty, continued success of online and our support to midtier department store to accelerate, to reinforce the business model to be able to better attract millennials and better activate the floor in order to become even more competitive versus this development of smaller brands and of new channels. This is one of the changes that I was describing before that requires adjustment in capabilities and investments in supporting our brand's growth."

And I realize there's FX as well as the acquisition impact in that. But it really seems to have slowed, particularly since the end of 2010 to 2013 restructuring program. And so I guess, as we look at your new restructuring program, is that a sign maybe that the incremental margins on organic revenue growth is lower than what it was? And I guess, if that's the case, there's been a discussion and you guys have talked about the cost of growth not having gone higher, but the math would seem to indicate that, again, maybe that incremental margin isn't as high as it had been historically.

But first of all, I want to say that this fiscal year, we have 50 points, be half a margin point, just affected by currency and 30 basis points just by acquisitions. So 80 are attacked by currency and acquisitions. So yes, that's a new factor in the margin evolution. But then, the combination of our business and cost savings is actually producing the power to continue growing margin. Obviously, if currency and acquisition will stop affecting it negatively, this will be more visible. The other thing is there is also a mix change in our business. So we have more freestanding stores and we have more makeup versus skin care that also are changing the input of mix in our business. So we need to continue to deliver our growth, we need to become more efficient and effective and manage our overall cost reduction better.

And the period post that corresponded with a slowdown in Asia and Asian consumption, particularly in China and Hong Kong, as Fabrizio spoke about, which certainly slowed our skin care business, particularly with our large brands like Estée Lauder, and to a lesser extent, Clinique. So that is a margin difference in terms of our business performance relative to our previous timeframe. One of the things that the Lead Beauty Forward program does for us, because we are -- and certainly our compass -- our 10-year compass has allowed us to continue to understand, that there are very significant growth opportunities for us from a total  company standpoint. It allows us the freedom to invest more in those is opportunities irrespective of the margin and deliver our margin goals in -- well into the future. So it's a very exciting program. But certainly, it is proactive on our part, looking forward, in terms of where the growth opportunities are and making sure that we can support them with capabilities, we can support them with other investments and still drive the business and the profit expectations."

And as Fabrizio mentioned also previously, the slowdown in Hong Kong and a couple of other market slowdown, North America, we've seen the last few years, postholiday traffic has been quite slow, and it has taken longer to start to see traffic flow back into, particularly, the department store channel and, particularly, the midtier department store channel.

So on China, so as -- we have been growing 5% our net sales this quarter and 8% our retail sales. So retail sales, 8% in China, is good, it's strong. And the profile of our growth, first of all by brand, is that all brands are growing double-digit wi",624,"Yes. So on China, so as -- we have been growing 5% our net sales this quarter and 8% our retail sales. So retail sales, 8% in China, is good, it's strong. And the profile of our growth, first of all by brand, is that all brands are growing double-digit with the exception of our Estée Lauder brand, which is a biggest brand. And that's the profile. So we are -- first of all, even before distribution, we are diversifying our brand portfolio that goes with the distribution because different brands are in different distribution. And we are diversifying geographically, because as I explained earlier time and was true also this quarter, we are opening new cities and new geographical area of China. We opened one new city, we opened 30 new doors just in the quarter 3. In term of the channels, online is doing well and will continue to do well. Today, we have now 10% of our business by now in online in China versus 12% in the U.S., so China is catching up with the U.S. at a speed of light. We are opening more freestanding store. In this moment, it's mainly on M-A-C and Jo Malone, but in the future, we may decide as we see the opportunity to add also other brands, increasing the number of freestanding stores, particularly in the cities where this is appropriate and there is no alternative distribution solution. I personally believe that the future of freestanding store in China will go directly to omnichannel, meaning the stores will be connected to the online brand dot-com activities and will be one basically omnichannel opportunity that will bring the brands in many more cities with pretty efficient freestanding store models, which are now the traditional big freestanding stores in cities like in the developed markets. And finally, we believe the specialty channel, over time, will also develop in China. And today, we are much more penetrated and developed in the specialty channel in China that we were in the U.S. at the beginning of the specialty channel development. So well diversified by region of China, well diversified by brand -- or better diversified by brand in our strategy and well diversified by channel is our goal for the development of the China market. Now in the innovation on skin care, as I explained before, yes, we are looking at skin care in a different way, reflecting the new consumer trends a reality. As I said, when you take skin care as a whole, there is a bigger and faster growth in what I call skin care for immediate benefit or skin care as a base of makeup. And there is less growth in this moment in the intense anti-aging skin care part. For the same reason of makeup, a lot of the growth is driven by millennials, which are more interested in this part of the skin care. So yes, big part of our innovation pipeline is also driven in these skin care benefits, which are more modern and more millennial. Take an example, the New Dimension launch of Estée Lauder is not about anti-aging, it's about really the shaping of the face depending how consumer want. Or think of our fastest-growing skin care segment, which are masks. Masks -- or even, we have a brand, GLAMGLOW, which is completely focused on masks. And masks is product you use to get, immediately after 10 minutes, the benefit that you're looking for, be it luminosity, moisturization, hydrate-ation or brightening, et cetera. So skin care for immediate benefits, which is closer to makeup in reality, in term of benefit for consumer, is the fastest-growing trend. And our pipeline in these areas are the strongest they ever been."

I'm saying it's temporary because Hong Kong is a great market with enormous internal demand of local consumers and is a very attractive market for Chinese in general. So it's been declining substantially in the last period. I believe at a certain moment, it will stabilize. I personally don't have the expectation that it will go back to big growth fast, but I do have the expectation that this trend will stabilize; will stabilize also because the local consumption is actually continue to increase. And so is the mix between local consumption and tourist, particularly Chinese tourist, that at a certain moment, will stabilize. And I just came from Hong Kong. As I said in my prepared remark, I was in Asia last week, I visited Hong Kong and Korea. And the other thing that gave me comfort is the strengths of our team there, which is managed this very difficult timing in a fantastic way, increasing their activities on local consumers to help our business to stabilize without waiting for tourists, but just increasing our market share with locals, which I think is the right strategy. And I have great confidence in our team to be able to stabilize the trend as soon as the market will allow. On your skin care question is -- I think I have answered already several times. The skin care, obviously, is -- remains the most important categories overall and will continue to grow. As I said, the fastest-growing part of skin care is the skin care which is more relating to immediate benefits, which is the skin care, which is of high interest for millennial. We had to adjust our innovation, our technology, our activities and planning for the future to the balance between more drastic anti-aging benefits and more immediate benefits. We are doing that via our portfolio brands, some of our brands are much stronger in anti-aging, like Estée Lauder, some other of our brands, like GLAMGLOW, are completely focused on immediate results skin care. And come of our brands, like Bobbi Brown, have a strong skin care business, which is actually the skin care as a base of makeup and as to support to the makeup habits of women. So we are attacking skin care multiple fronts: Anti-aging, base of makeup, insta-benefit, thanks to our portfolio of brands and thanks to our innovation pipeline. I feel very strong about our long-term skin care trend, but is a fact that makeup, in this moment, is a much foster growing category. And we are, again, I see as a strength, that we have the agility to adjust and refocus our investment resources depending on the biggest trends we see."

So if you comment on that, it's great. And within the AMS [ph] line, no, I know it's not reported quarterly, but on a full year basis. If you could talk about how that mix has maybe shifted over time. If there's some reduction in some buckets, like sampling or merchandising, with less reliance on department stores, but at increase in the kind of core advertising dollars, that would be really helpful."

So is -- summarizing, is a stabilization of the magazine advertising, a decrease of television and an increase of the digital social media. That's the trends we are seeing. Now obviously, this mix is very different by country in the word and by brand. But in general, this is the big trend we are seeing. So more sampling and more digital social media."

In the third quarter, we delivered a solid performance, with strong gains particularly from our makeup category and international business. In constant currencies, sales grew 6%, and earnings per share rose 5% before charges to $0.76. Based on our results to date, we are on track to achieve our sales and earning guidance for the full fiscal year, excluding charges. 
We continue to benefit from a highly diversified business with multiple engines of growth and the flexibility to move investment quickly to support areas that provide the best returns. 
We continued to fuel makeup, a vibrant category, where we have achieved constant currency double-digit gains every quarter this fiscal year. Social media is helping to drive makeup sales, with how-to-do videos, tips from consumers and influences and beautiful visuals of makeup transformations. Our company has thousands of talented makeup artists who are a competitive advantage for our brands and help drive consumption through personal lessons in-store, as well as online, where they can demonstrate the artistry to a broader audience.
M-A-C Instagram, for example, features photos submitted by its global artists, illustrating their creativity and talents tied to products and trends. This kind of social media interaction creates an ongoing dialogue between the brand and its consumers and helped drive sales.
We are the largest company in global prestige makeup, and all our makeup brands grew this quarter. Each of our 3 diverse makeup-focused brands has a distinct character and channel profile. For example, our third -- 1/3 of M-A-C sales came from its freestanding stores. A majority of Bobbi Brown sales came from global department stores. And Smashbox has a strong presence in specialty multi retailers. And there is further opportunity for growth across all prestige channels. 
In addition to its popular fragrance collections, our Tom Ford brand has a fast-growing and much desired makeup business. Sales of Tom Ford luxury makeup products rose more than 50%. 
Estée Lauder and Clinique also achieved global growth in their makeup portfolios. Estée Lauder delivered good momentum in the European region as its Double Wear foundation continued to be a strong seller. In North America, the brand launched the Estee Edit exclusivity in Sephora stores and on sephora.com. The millennial-targeted line generated terrific media attention, and there is a full cadence of strong promotional activities planned throughout the fourth quarter.
At Clinique, the brand extended its successful Pop Lip Colour collection with new formulas and attracted young consumers with a digital campaign that included interactive music videos with a rising Swedish pop star. 
Growth in fragrance continue to come from our luxury scents. Jo Malone and Tom Ford had terrific results. Both brands generated double-digit growth in every region. The success of these brands supports our strategy to position our fragrance portfolio toward a profitable higher-end tier, an area where we are gaining share. Our artisanal luxury fragrance brands, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, contributed higher sales, as did the Aerin collection of fragrances. Recently, we acquired By Kilian, a sophisticated Paris-based brand that we believe further strengthened our leadership in fast-growing luxury fragrances.
Turning to our geographies. Our international business was stellar, and virtually every market grew. During the quarter, I visit several countries to gauge consumer sentiment and visit stores. One trip was in the U.K., which had robust sales in the quarter, far exceeding prestige beauty growth. While there, I spent time in Birmingham and saw how our brand successfully tailored their product to the city's diverse, multicultural population. Consumers in the U.K. have a great passion for beauty, and our brands have responded in ways that appeal to a wide range of demographics, which has helped reinforce our leadership position in this market. 
The European region remained robust, with growth in nearly every country, and particularly France and Italy, where all brands contributed to a double-digit increase. 
The tragic attacks in Paris, Turkey and Brussels understandably dampened some tourist activities in the quarter, but I'm proud of that tremendous trends and resilience our organization in this country showed during these very difficult times. 
Although fewer tourists contributed to a falloff in retail sales in French airports following the Paris attack, our total net sales in travel retail for the quarter were strong, enjoying the results of our diversification strategy by region, category, brand and type of airport. And retail sales in the channel were solid and broad-based. They rose double digits in half of the top 30 travel retail markets in the world. 
Currency fluctuations continue to affect travel patterns in our travel business. We continue to see stronger growth in some markets where the currency was weakened, including Japan, Australia or Canada, due to a greater number of inbound tourist. Weak currencies in Brazil and Russia led to a decline in travel by those population and affected sales in the travel corridors that they frequent. However, local market sales in these 2 countries grew double-digits, as more consumer purchase products close to their homes. 
I just returned from Korea a few days ago, and was amazed by the energy and excitement there that beauty produces. Since the fear of MERS has abated, tourists are returning, especially the Chinese. Our business in Korea has turned around very nicely from a year ago, up double digits this quarter. And I was very pleased to see that we are gaining share. Demand for makeup is accelerating strongly, and our brands are successfully competing head-to-head with Korean brands. Four of our brands introduced cushioned compacts, which are extremely popular with Korean consumers. Bobbi Brown's cushion compact did so well, it became 15% of its Korea business, and contributed to the brand's foundation sales doubling in the country. 
During my visit, I met our partners at Dr. Jart+, an impressive brand that is seeing strong demand, and gleaned insights into consumer desires and opportunities for growth. 
As I visited stores in Seoul, I couldn't help but notice the sales of artisanal luxury fragrances are booming, including our own Jo Malone brand. I'm excited about the opportunity this trend holds for the newer fragrance brands in our portfolio. 
We recently launched GLAMGLOW in Korea, and avid consumers are actively using social media to talk about the brand and post photos. Korea is a center of innovation for beauty, and there are many new trends and ideas that our brands can leverage and bring to consumers in other areas of the world.
Looking now at our emerging markets. Our China business was healthy, as most brands grew solidly and retail sales gained momentum. The online channel had the fastest growth and accounted for nearly 10% of sales. Sales in makeup and fragrance continue to accelerate, creating greater diversification in our Chinese business. As an example, Jo Malone business more than doubled with strong momentum in both department stores and freestanding stores.
Our other emerging markets continue to generate excellent growth, rising 20%. Among the best performance were South Africa or Brazil. M-A-C continues to be a trailblazer in Sub-Sahara Africa, has introduced prestige beauty products and personalized services. It has entered many countries in this area, most recently Zambia. 
To fuel our company's global momentum, we continued investing in fast-growing channels. We opened new freestanding stores and launched several e- and m-commerce sites for our brands, mostly with retailers. GLAMGLOW, for example, began selling its products on Nordstrom's website. We also increased our presence in specialty multi. In the U.S., Clinique continued expanding in Ulta. Estée Lauder launched its Estée Edit product line in Sephora, and several brands added more locations in Bluemercury. Isetan opened a new specialty multi-store concept in Shanghai, and several of our brands are present. 
Our creativity and innovation were central to accomplishments in the quarter. Estée Lauder Advanced PowerFoil Mask was well received, particularly in Asia, and boosted the brand's important Advanced Night Repair franchise. Clinique Pep-Start Eye Cream, which brightens and primes the eye area for makeup, debuted in -- exclusively in Sephora in the United States and was the #1 eye cream there in February and March. 
Beyond products, our brand continue to forge creative collaborations. M-A-C is designing a makeup collection inspired by the singer Selena. And Estée Lauder is teaming up with foster designer, Victoria Beckham, for a full cosmetic collection. This collaboration brings great bask [ph] to our brand, especially on social media, and we expect them to draw new consumers.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey to give more details on the quarter."

Net sales for the third quarter were $2.66 billion, up 6% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 10 basis points of the sales growth. 
As Fabrizio mentioned, our international business remained quite strong, as nearly all of our international markets grew this quarter, led by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 11% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in most developed and emerging markets. The region continues to benefit in part from the weak euro, making it a more attractive tourist destination, as well as from the benefits of strong execution of its strategic initiatives. 
The U.K., Nordic and Italy were the largest contributors to growth among the developed markets in the region. And the Middle East, Russia, South Africa and Central Europe led double-digit gains in emerging markets in the region. Our online business was particularly strong across all EMEA markets this quarter. 
Our net sales in the global travel retail channel rose 9%, reflecting strong retail trends in most countries in Europe and Asia, which were partially offset by continued net sales declines in Hong Kong, Brazil and the United States. Overall, passenger traffic growth in travel retail across all regions remained solid, despite shifts in consumption patterns between countries due to currency. 
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Every market in the region grew, except Hong Kong, which was down double digits. Korea was the largest contributor to net sales growth, rising 14% in the quarter, followed closely by Japan, Australia and Taiwan. China rose 5%, led by 70% growth in e- and m-commerce sales. Online sales across all APAC markets rose sharply this quarter. 
Our net sales in Hong Kong declined more than we had anticipated, as tourists from the Chinese mainland continue to decrease. Excluding Hong Kong, the region's sales would have grow nearly 9%. 
Net sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency. Brazil, Mexico and Canada all saw strong double-digit growth. As currencies in these countries continue to weaken against the dollar, local market consumption remained strong. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits. Continued strength in our online business, specialty multi and high-end department store channels was largely offset by sharp declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued softness in traffic in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores. 
Once again, makeup sales led product category growth, rising 11% in constant currency. Double-digit growth from M-A-C, Smashbox and Tom Ford led the increase, while particularly strength -- while particular strength in the lip and foundation categories drove makeup growth at Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Estée Lauder this quarter.
Sales of fragrance products rose 7% in constant currency. Double-digit gains from our luxury portfolio. Jo Malone, Tom Ford and Le Labo contributed the majority of the growth. The Michael Kors Gold collection and Tory Burch stood out among the designer fragrances. This strength at the high end of the fragrance category was partially offset by lower fragrance sales from Estée Lauder and the remaining designer fragrances. 
Haircare sales increased 3% constant currency. Aveda benefited from initial shipments of its new and body for men products, as well as higher sales of more recent launches and existing products. The brands opened new doors in travel retail and added salons and freestanding stores in Europe. Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in all channels.
Skin care sales were flat in constant currency, reflecting the continued weakness in Hong Kong and the ongoing shift in increased consumer spending from skin care to makeup. Additionally, Estée Lauder's skin care business declined slightly in the quarter due to tough comparisons with prior year launches in the U.S. and in Asia. There were many bright spots in our portfolio for skin care. La Mer and Origins grew skin care double digits, as did skin care lines of our M-A-C and Bobbi Brown makeup brands. 
Our gross margin increased 50 basis points to 81% of sales, The improvement came primarily from supply chain savings and lower promotional expenses, partially offset by channel and category mix. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, increased 110 basis points to 66% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Selling and store operations cost to support our retail store growth, as well as general and administrative costs, primarily from employee-related cost, consulting fees in our prior acquisitions, drove most of the increases. These were partially offset by our value creation from our strategic modernization initiative and a deferral of some advertising and promotional expenses to the fourth quarter to support higher expected sales growth in that quarter. 
As a result, operating income decreased less than 1% to $399.2 million and operating margin fell 60 basis points to 15%, due entirely to foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 3%. 
Net earnings also decreased approximately 1% below the prior year quarter to $274.9 million. Diluted EPS of $0.73 was 2% above the prior-year, reflecting the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger-than-expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of continued expense management and a delay in some advertising and promotional spending for Estée Lauder and Clinique to the fourth quarter. 
Earnings per share for the quarter include $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 5%. 
Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year. The sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact full year comparisons to the prior year. I will discuss our expectations, adjusting for the impact of the shift, as always. Our forecasted growth rates, both before and after the shift impact, are available in today's earnings release. Also excluded is the impact of restructuring and other charges.
For the full year, we expected sales to continue -- or to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 5 percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of April of $1.14 for the euro, $1.44 for the pound and $1.09 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Diluted EPS is now expected to range between $3.09 and $3.14, or $0.02 more than our last guidance range, reflecting a slight moderation in the currency impact. Adverse currency translation is now projected to affect EPS by about $0.27. Excluding the currency impact, we continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Our EPS range includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions. 
Our strong performance to date gives us the confidence to invest more in the fourth quarter to support additional advertising and promotion, primarily for Estée Lauder and Clinique. While we continue to pursue value creation from our SMI program, which is now expected to deliver $175 million of cost savings this year, we also look for ways to further improve our cost leverage in the future. 
Fabrizio will now discuss the initiative we announced in our press release today."

The multifaceted initiative that we call Leading Beauty Forward is designed to provide additional fuel for long-term growth and profitability. It will build on our strong foundation and leverage capabilities we have developed in important areas driving our business, including digital, retail and creative. 
Leading Beauty Forward will support the continuing success of our strategy in an increasingly fast-paced, complex and competitive prestige beauty environment. It is designed to sustain our momentum by reducing cost and freeing up more resources to invest in brands' capability and most profitable opportunities while better leveraging our growth. 
As we look toward the future, we believe the best way to capture the growth opportunity of tomorrow is being proactive today. This initiative is a carefully measured next step in our long-term strategy that will allow us to continue to lead in the prestige beauty industry. We expect Leading Beauty Forward to sustain our sales, operating margin and earning per share growth beyond the goals we have set throughout fiscal year 2018. 
Clearly, how we do business today and how we must be prepared to do business in the future is very different from what it was just 7 years ago, when we launched our current strategy. The fast-moving landscape requires a mindset and a way of operating that increases speed and flexibility, is creative, streamlined, cost efficient and designed to serve global consumers in new ways. 
To that end, as part of Leading Beauty Forward, we plan to redesign select areas of our go-to-market organizations in the regions, affiliates and brands to increase agility and strengthen their capabilities. As more of our consumer engagement moves to digital platforms, the markets will need the tools and authority to respond quickly to opportunities and bring our expertise in local relevance closer to consumer. 
Stronger skills in innovation, digital, social media and creative capabilities will allow them to differentiate our unique brands even farther by tailoring products and services to specific consumer segments and channels. We also will redesign select corporate functions to increase their efficiencies by making them leaner, scalable and less costly, while continue to deliver excellent services to our brand and businesses. 
We are evaluating the creation of a global and regional shared services among certain functions to simplify processes and focus on more strategic activities. We also plan to continue to optimize some of our supply chain operation to create a more efficient structure. These actions are expected to reduce our operating expenses, freeing up resources to invest in our brands, channel, consumer-facing activities and potential acquisitions. 
An important goal of Leading Beauty Forward is to support and grow our brands. To accomplish this, we will invest in activities that will resonate with consumers, including innovation to develop new product and services, unique point-of-sales asset, effective social media dialogues and compelling advertising. We will also support our newly acquired brands to expand their presence and products and continue to build our small and medium-size brands so they become leaders in the industry. 
As employees focus more fully on being creative and strategic, we will enhance our learning and development programs so they have the best skills to lead in critical areas. The redesign will regrettably include reducing position in some areas. We also expect to add talent in the departments we plan to strengthen and to retain all other employees. In total, we estimate at this time, a global net reduction of approximately 900 to 1,200 positions, which is about 2.5% of our current workforce. As the company continues to grow and invest in new positions in the future, the improved process from these initiative are expected also to better leverage future productivity. 
We are launching Leading Beauty Forward from a position of exceptional strength. Since we began our new strategic cycle, our sales have increased by more than 50%, and our growth rate has outpaced that of global prestige beauty. Key to this performance is the much more diversified and balanced business we have created, with growth engines across our brands, categories, channels and geographies. 
With insights from our 10-year compass, we anticipated many of the trends influencing the industry's rise. We also modernized our processes and technology infrastructure. Our strategic modernization initiative has been deployed through most of our organization, creating greater visibility to information that let us manage our business in a more cost-efficient manner. We developed a wider spectrum of capabilities, strengthened our talents in areas such as R&D, supply chain, information technology, retail, digital and consumer insight. 
Leading Beauty Forward is designed to build on these achievements to further increase our efficiency and effectiveness. Global prestige beauty is thriving, growing industry with new channels, emerging geographies at the influence of younger consumers. With the convenience of the Internet, the expansion of specialty multi-retailers dedicated to beauty, particularly, in the U.S., how consumers shop is changing rapidly, and competition has intensified. Lower barrier to entry resulted in more than 250 new niche brands launching around the world last year, and the sheer number of beauty products vying for consumers' attention is vastly increasing. 
The design of our new structure should generate greater productivity through better cost leverage of our sales growth. Importantly, Leading Beauty Forward will create ongoing savings and reinvestment to help continue our momentum in this fast-growing and more competitive market, which should mean greater sustainability and less risk in meeting our future growth targets.
As the global leader in prestige beauty, we are poised to take advantage of opportunities that lie ahead by taking charge in leading change. Leading Beauty Forward further positions our company to continue winning in this rapidly changing arena, where the ability to anticipate developments and react swiftly and nimbly is more essential than ever. We expect to sustain our strong growth and lead not only our company but whole of the prestige beauty forward to greater heights.

So as Fabrizio just discussed, Leading Beauty Forward is a multiyear initiative designed to help us fuel our growth momentum and create a more efficient cost structure to sustain our margin progression beyond fiscal 2018. 
During the course of the initiative, over the next few years, we expect to take charges of approximately $600 million to $700 million. We expect to begin realizing initial benefits from the program in fiscal 2018, but we'll continue to maintain our flexibility to invest in opportunities and mitigate risk. 
At this time, we do not expect this to affect the long-range guidance we provided last summer other than the related restructuring charges. Once fully implemented, we expect to generate annualized benefits -- net benefits of $200 million to $300 million, currently anticipated to be fully realized after fiscal 2019. We expect to reinvest a portion of those savings behind the capabilities we need, that Fabrizio just discussed, to continue to succeed in the rapidly changing global prestige beauty environment. 
We will, as we usually do, update our 3-year strategic outlook and share our goals in August. The update will include the impact of this initiative, any adjustments to our strategy since last year, the addition of recently acquired brands and changes in currency rate assumptions. 
We are pleased with our results so far this year, and we believe Leading Beauty Forward will play an important role in supporting our continued sustained growth momentum for the long term. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

I think our pipeline versus was 5 years ago, I would say, is almost doubled in terms of the power of extra business. We have a very clear internal process where we look for sufficiency of our innovation pipeline versus our next 3, 5 years' goals. And I can tell you, we consider our innovation pipeline more than sufficient. Now the characteristic of the pipeline has changed in some way, also. First of all, today, the pipeline is much richer in makeup because, as you heard, the makeup category is, in this moment, the fast-growing in the world and also very fast-changing. So there is some outstanding innovation pipeline in makeup. And the makeup pipelines tends to be done by many smaller products versus few very big product, which is more typical of the skin care pipeline. So that's a change, and we have adjusted to that change. Our skin care pipeline is strong, but again, within skin care, the pipeline is more focused on what we call instant benefit skin care versus the long-term antiaging, and that's changed. And third, but probably very, very important, our pipeline in the fragrance business is changed, and it is done by much more high-end luxury artisanal fragrances, which will allow us, in my opinion, to continue gain market share in the high-end profitable fragrance business. And finally, in hair care, our pipeline, particularly in the styling, more profitable part of hair care, is stronger than ever. So in net, I feel positive about the sufficiency of the pipeline. And also, I feel positive by the fit of our pipeline to the future of the market as identified by our compass."

On makeup, first of all, I believe this is a long-term trend. The makeup category is growing, driven by several aspects. The first one is that the Asian consumer, the Asian women, are becoming more avid users of makeup. And so this is an enormous amount of growth potentially that will developed -- it is developing now and will continue to develop in the next years. The second big trend is that the millennials are, on average, using more makeup than the previous generation, so there is an increase of consumption per individual in all markets, including developed markets. And this is a long-term trend, also because what is driving the more usage of makeup is what historically has been our strength and our business model, which is education and customization. But now the education is available also via online, exactly our e-commerce activities, and via social media, which is booming the amount of how-to videos, different trends, et cetera. So the combination of this more amount of trends information and how-to information with the millennial generation point of view is pushing makeup up. I think, this will continue for a long period. In term of our activity in e-commerce, we continue to do very well. I think we gained substantial competitive advantage, but not only in the execution in market, also in the capabilities. We have a very strong e-commerce team that is developing amazing work, which are divided into technology people that can develop sites and develop activity in a very fast pace around the world from our centralized offices in New York in a very -- with investment that now will pay out for the long-term that we have done in the previous years.

But the sales growth did decelerate a little bit, probably a little bit more than people had expected. So can you help with some -- provide a little bit more insight on how you go about making decisions on A&P spend? Because that line does continue to move around a fair bit quarter-to-quarter. And then also, in terms of the Chinese tourism, do think you're making up the shortfall in Hong Kong from lack of Chinese tourists in other areas?"

So the sales by quarter depend a lot by initiatives, launches and what happens in specific markets. And the way we take the decisions is -- really, we base the decision of -- if we believe there is enough rate of return on that investment in that moment. For example, in quarter 3, the things that we saw going less strong than we expected was Hong Kong. And so when we had markets that decreased their growth significantly, we do decrease our spending there, and we keep the spending for better moments, where there is better market traction. So what you're seeing in the third quarter very specifically is reduced spend in Hong Kong from our side. The second area where we saw less traction was U.S. mid-tier department store brick-and-mortar, where we clearly saw less traction, together with all the tourist doors in the U.S. that particularly influenced by the absence of Brazilians and Russians, that was a very dramatic change. So when we see these dramatic changes, we obviously adjust our AP investment. The second reason was, in this case very specific, is some product launch initiative on Lauder and Clinique that we decided to move in supporting them in the fourth quarter, which is the other reason why we are moving AP investment from one quarter into another. Personally, I see this as a strength. We have the agility to move our AP investment by quarter, depending on the market situation and the product launch situation. And this make us more efficient and more effective, and we stay consistent on our year goal, that we will commit to do our best to deliver. There is no change, but by quarter, actually, we see agility and flexibility as strengths. On the Chinese consumers, now we are definitely doing much better with Chinese consumer in other areas where they are going. For example in Europe, as we have seen, there is a growth of our European business, which is partially driven by tourist, and the tourist are also Chinese. We have seen Korea coming back and Japan being pretty strong. So yes, we recover some of the sales, however, not all of them. We have a very high market share in Hong Kong, very, very high market share. And our market share, for example, in Japan is half of the market share we have in Hong Kong. So in that situation, we obviously cannot recover the Hong Kong losses completely in other areas, and that's what you're seeing in this moment as a phenomenon. But this is a temporary phenomenon. And as soon as Hong Kong will stabilize, and other markets where we are now building market share, like Korea, will achieve the levels we believe are achievable, the things will accelerate again."

M-A-C is growing strong double-digits in every single market of the world, and these -- the temporary flattening of the retail trend in the U.S. is being more than offset by a booming international business. The flattening of the U.S. is -- the temporary flattening of the U.S. trend is to -- driven by 2 aspects. One, as I said, is the fact that the lower traffic in mid-tier department store is one of the driver. And the other is tourists. I mean, M-A-C business is driven by tourists of the world that visit the U.S. in a significant way because the brand is very, very popular around the word. So the important decrease of tourists, particularly Brazilians and Russians, as I said, have temporary limited the retail of M-A-C, also because these tourists were very strong in the base period that we are comparing this to. But overall in total, M-A-C continues to be absolutely one of the strong drivers of our success around the world, and we have programs to ensure that this will continue. In term of the success of the small-size brands in the U.S. This is a fact that, as I explain in my prepared remark, that the combination of easier access to consumers and more availability of investment, now money at a lower interest rates, have created a lot of new launches of brands. And the possibility of social media to bring these brands to the attention of the consumers has taken down the barriers to entry. So the way we are reacting is, first of all, reinforcing the business in our strong brands. Second, participating to this with our midsize smaller brands, including acquisitions. I mean, Smashbox was one of these brands when we acquired these brands, and now in fact, is growing double-digit in the context of this. And then finally is the diversification of our distribution with freestanding store, more specialty, continued success of online and our support to mid-tier department store to accelerate, to reinforce the business model to be able to better attract millennials and better activate the floor in order to become even more competitive versus this development of smaller brands and of new channels. This is one of the changes that I was describing before that requires adjustment in capabilities and investments in supporting our brand's growth."

And I realize there's FX as well as the acquisition impact in that. But it really seems to have slowed, particularly since the end of 2010 to 2013 restructuring program. And so I guess, as we look at your new restructuring program, is that a sign maybe that the incremental margins on organic revenue growth is lower than what it was? And I guess, if that's the case, there's been a discussion and you guys have talked about the cost of growth not having gone higher, but the math would seem to indicate that, again, maybe that incremental margin isn't as high as it had been historically.

But first of all, I want to say that this fiscal year, we have 50 points, be half a margin point, just affected by currency and 30 basis points just by acquisitions. So 80 are attacked by currency and acquisitions. So yes, that's a new factor in the margin evolution. But then, the combination of our business and cost savings is actually producing the power to continue growing margin. Obviously, if currency and acquisition will stop affecting it negatively, this will be more visible. The other thing is there is also a mix change in our business. So we have more freestanding stores and we have more makeup versus skin care that also are changing the input of mix in our business. So we need to continue to deliver our growth, we need to become more efficient and effective and manage our overall cost reduction better.

And the period post that corresponded with a slowdown in Asia and Asian consumption, particularly in China and Hong Kong, as Fabrizio spoke about, which certainly slowed our skin care business, particularly with our large brands like Estée Lauder, and to a lesser extent, Clinique. So that is a margin difference in terms of our business performance relative to the previous time frame. One of the things that the Lead Beauty Forward program does for us, because we are -- and certainly our compass -- our 10-year compass has allowed us to continue to understand that there are very significant growth opportunities for us from a total  company standpoint. It allows us the freedom to invest more in those is opportunities irrespective of the margin and deliver our margin goals in -- well into the future. So it's a very exciting program.

So on China, so as -- we have been growing 5% our net sales this quarter and 8% our retail sales. So retail sales, 8% in China, is good, it's strong. And the profile of our growth, first of all by brand, is that all brands are growing double-digit wi",626,"Yes. So on China, so as -- we have been growing 5% our net sales this quarter and 8% our retail sales. So retail sales, 8% in China, is good, it's strong. And the profile of our growth, first of all by brand, is that all brands are growing double-digit with the exception of our Estée Lauder brand, which is the biggest brand. And that's the profile. So we are -- first of all, even before distribution, we are diversifying our brand portfolio that goes with the distribution because different brands are in different distribution. And we are diversifying geographically, because as I explained earlier time and was true also this quarter, we are opening new cities and new geographical area of China. We opened one new city, we opened 30 new doors just in the quarter 3. In term of the channels, online is doing well and will continue to do well. Today, we have now 10% of our business by now in online in China versus 12% in the U.S., so China is catching up with the U.S. at a speed of light. We are opening more freestanding store. In this moment, it's mainly on M-A-C and Jo Malone, but in the future, we may decide as we see the opportunity to add also other brands, increasing the number of freestanding stores, particularly in the cities where this is appropriate and there is no alternative distribution solution. I personally believe that the future of freestanding store in China will go directly to omnichannel, meaning the stores will be connected to the online brand dot-com activities and will be one basically omnichannel opportunity that will bring the brands in many more cities with pretty efficient freestanding store models, which are now the traditional big freestanding stores in cities like in the developed markets. And finally, we believe the specialty channel, over time, will also develop in China. And today, we are much more penetrated and developed in the specialty channel in China that we were in the U.S. at the beginning of the specialty channel development. So well diversified by region of China, well diversified by brand -- or better diversified by brand in our strategy and well diversified by channel is our goal for the development of the China market. Now in the innovation on skin care, as I explained before, yes, we are looking at skin care in a different way, reflecting the new consumer trends a reality. As I said, when you take skin care as a whole, there is a bigger and faster growth in what I call skin care for immediate benefit or skin care as a base of makeup. And there is less growth in this moment in the intense anti-aging skin care part. For the same reason of makeup, a lot of the growth is driven by millennials, which are more interested in this part of the skin care. So yes, big part of our innovation pipeline is also driven in these skin care benefits, which are more modern and more millennial. Take an example, the New Dimension launch of Estée Lauder is not about anti-aging, it's about really the shaping of the face depending how consumer want. Or think of our fastest-growing skin care segment, which are masks. Masks -- or even, we have a brand, GLAMGLOW, which is completely focused on masks. And masks is a product that you use to get, immediately after 10 minutes, the benefit that you're looking for, be it luminosity, moisturization, hydrate-ation or brightening, et cetera. So skin care for immediate benefits, which is closer to makeup in reality, in term of benefit for consumer, is the fastest-growing trend. And our pipeline in these areas are the strongest they ever been."

I'm saying it's temporary because Hong Kong is a great market with enormous internal demand of local consumers and is a very attractive market for Chinese in general. So it's been declining substantially in the last period. I believe at a certain moment, it will stabilize. I personally don't have the expectation that it will go back to big growth fast, but I do have the expectation that this trend will stabilize; will stabilize also because the local consumption is actually continue to increase. And so is the mix between local consumption and tourist, particularly Chinese tourist, that at a certain moment, will stabilize. And I just came from Hong Kong. As I said in my prepared remark, I was in Asia last week, I visited Hong Kong and Korea. And the other thing that gave me comfort is the strengths of our team there, which is managed this very difficult timing in a fantastic way, increasing their activities on local consumers to help our business to stabilize without waiting for tourists, but just increasing our market share with locals, which I think is the right strategy. And I have great confidence in our team to be able to stabilize the trend as soon as the market will allow. On your skin care question is -- I think I have answered already several times. The skin care, obviously, is it remains the most important categories overall and will continue to grow. As I said, the fastest-growing part of skin care is the skin care which is more relating to immediate benefits, which is the skin care, which is of high interest for millennial. We had to adjust our innovation, our technology, our activities and planning for the future to the balance between more drastic anti-aging benefits and more immediate benefits. We are doing that via our portfolio brands, some of our brands are much stronger in anti-aging, like Estée Lauder, some other of our brands, like GLAMGLOW, are completely focused on immediate results skin care. And some of our brands, like Bobbi Brown, have a strong skin care business, which is actually the skin care as a base of makeup and as to support to the makeup habits of women. So we are attacking skin care on multiple fronts: Anti-aging, base of makeup, insta-benefit, thanks to our portfolio of brands and thanks to our innovation pipeline. I feel very strong about our long-term skin care trend, but is a fact that makeup, in this moment, is a much faster growing category. And we are, again, I see as a strength, that we have the agility to adjust and refocus our investment resources depending on the biggest trends we see."

And then secondly, if that's the case, that would actually suggest that a lot of the step up in spending budgeted for this year is really affiliated with those doors, more so than necessarily a specific step up in advertising. So if you comment on that, it's great. And within the AMS [ph] line, no, I know it's not reported quarterly, but on a full year basis. If you could talk about how that mix has maybe shifted over time. If there's some reduction in some buckets, like sampling or merchandising, with less reliance on department stores, but at increase in the kind of core advertising dollars, that would be really helpful."

And in terms of us [indiscernible], I would say you need to look at what's happening for us is like our magazine print advertising is more or less stabilizing, but our TV advertise is decreasing and is increasing of equivalent or more the digital social media advertising. So is -- summarizing, is a stabilization of the magazine advertising, a decrease of television and an increase of the digital social media. That's the trends we are seeing. Now obviously, this mix is very different by country in the world and by brand. But in general, this is the big trend we are seeing. So more sampling and more digital social media."

In the third quarter, we delivered a solid performance, with strong gains particularly from our makeup category and international business. In constant currencies, sales grew 6%, and earnings per share rose 5% before charges to $0.76. Based on our results to date, we are on track to achieve our sales and earning guidance for the full fiscal year, excluding charges. 
We continue to benefit from a highly diversified business with multiple engines of growth and the flexibility to move investment quickly to support areas that provide the best returns. 
We continued to fuel makeup, a vibrant category, where we have achieved constant currency double-digit gains every quarter this fiscal year. Social media is helping to drive makeup sales, with how-to-do videos, tips from consumers and influences and beautiful visuals of makeup transformations. Our company has thousands of talented makeup artists who are a competitive advantage for our brands and help drive consumption through personal lessons in-store, as well as online, where they can demonstrate the artistry to a broader audience.
M-A-C Instagram, for example, features photos submitted by its global artists, illustrating their creativity and talents tied to products and trends. This kind of social media interaction creates an ongoing dialogue between the brand and its consumers and helped drive sales.
We are the largest company in global prestige makeup, and all our makeup brands grew this quarter. Each of our 3 diverse makeup-focused brands has a distinct character and channel profile. For example, our third -- 1/3 of M-A-C sales came from its freestanding stores. A majority of Bobbi Brown sales came from global department stores. And Smashbox has a strong presence in specialty multi retailers. And there is further opportunity for growth across all prestige channels. 
In addition to its popular fragrance collections, our Tom Ford brand has a fast-growing and much desired makeup business. Sales of Tom Ford luxury makeup products rose more than 50%. 
Estée Lauder and Clinique also achieved global growth in their makeup portfolios. Estée Lauder delivered good momentum in the European region as its Double Wear foundation continued to be a strong seller. In North America, the brand launched the Estee Edit exclusivity in Sephora stores and on sephora.com. The millennial-targeted line generated terrific media attention, and there is a full cadence of strong promotional activities planned throughout the fourth quarter.
At Clinique, the brand extended its successful Pop Lip Colour collection with new formulas and attracted young consumers with a digital campaign that included interactive music videos with a rising Swedish pop star. 
Growth in fragrance continue to come from our luxury scents. Jo Malone and Tom Ford had terrific results. Both brands generated double-digit growth in every region. The success of these brands supports our strategy to position our fragrance portfolio toward a profitable higher-end tier, an area where we are gaining share. Our artisanal luxury fragrance brands, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, contributed higher sales, as did the Aerin collection of fragrances. Recently, we acquired By Kilian, a sophisticated Paris-based brand that we believe further strengthened our leadership in fast-growing luxury fragrances.
Turning to our geographies. Our international business was stellar, and virtually every market grew. During the quarter, I visit several countries to gauge consumer sentiment and visit stores. One trip was in the U.K., which had robust sales in the quarter, far exceeding prestige beauty growth. While there, I spent time in Birmingham and saw how our brand successfully tailored their product to the city's diverse, multicultural population. Consumers in the U.K. have a great passion for beauty, and our brands have responded in ways that appeal to a wide range of demographics, which has helped reinforce our leadership position in this market. 
The European region remained robust, with growth in nearly every country, and particularly France and Italy, where all brands contributed to a double-digit increase. 
The tragic attacks in Paris, Turkey and Brussels understandably dampened some tourist activities in the quarter, but I'm proud of that tremendous trends and resilience our organization in this country showed during these very difficult times. 
Although fewer tourists contributed to a falloff in retail sales in French airports following the Paris attack, our total net sales in travel retail for the quarter were strong, enjoying the results of our diversification strategy by region, category, brand and type of airport. And retail sales in the channel were solid and broad-based. They rose double digits in half of the top 30 travel retail markets in the world. 
Currency fluctuations continue to affect travel patterns in our travel business. We continue to see stronger growth in some markets where the currency was weakened, including Japan, Australia or Canada, due to a greater number of inbound tourist. Weak currencies in Brazil and Russia led to a decline in travel by those population and affected sales in the travel corridors that they frequent. However, local market sales in these 2 countries grew double-digits, as more consumer purchase products close to their homes. 
I just returned from Korea a few days ago, and was amazed by the energy and excitement there that beauty produces. Since the fear of MERS has abated, tourists are returning, especially the Chinese. Our business in Korea has turned around very nicely from a year ago, up double digits this quarter. And I was very pleased to see that we are gaining share. Demand for makeup is accelerating strongly, and our brands are successfully competing head-to-head with Korean brands. Four of our brands introduced cushioned compacts, which are extremely popular with Korean consumers. Bobbi Brown's cushion compact did so well, it became 15% of its Korea business, and contributed to the brand's foundation sales doubling in the country. 
During my visit, I met our partners at Dr. Jart+, an impressive brand that is seeing strong demand, and gleaned insights into consumer desires and opportunities for growth. 
As I visited stores in Seoul, I couldn't help but notice the sales of artisanal luxury fragrances are booming, including our own Jo Malone brand. I'm excited about the opportunity this trend holds for the newer fragrance brands in our portfolio. 
We recently launched GLAMGLOW in Korea, and avid consumers are actively using social media to talk about the brand and post photos. Korea is a center of innovation for beauty, and there are many new trends and ideas that our brands can leverage and bring to consumers in other areas of the world.
Looking now at our emerging markets. Our China business was healthy, as most brands grew solidly and retail sales gained momentum. The online channel had the fastest growth and accounted for nearly 10% of sales. Sales in makeup and fragrance continue to accelerate, creating greater diversification in our Chinese business. As an example, Jo Malone business more than doubled with strong momentum in both department stores and freestanding stores.
Our other emerging markets continue to generate excellent growth, rising 20%. Among the best performance were South Africa or Brazil. M-A-C continues to be a trailblazer in Sub-Sahara Africa, has introduced prestige beauty products and personalized services. It has entered many countries in this area, most recently Zambia. 
To fuel our company's global momentum, we continued investing in fast-growing channels. We opened new freestanding stores and launched several e- and m-commerce sites for our brands, mostly with retailers. GLAMGLOW, for example, began selling its products on Nordstrom's website. We also increased our presence in specialty multi. In the U.S., Clinique continued expanding in Ulta. Estée Lauder launched its Estée Edit product line in Sephora, and several brands added more locations in Bluemercury. Isetan opened a new specialty multi-store concept in Shanghai, and several of our brands are present. 
Our creativity and innovation were central to accomplishments in the quarter. Estée Lauder Advanced PowerFoil Mask was well received, particularly in Asia, and boosted the brand's important Advanced Night Repair franchise. Clinique Pep-Start Eye Cream, which brightens and primes the eye area for makeup, debuted in -- exclusively in Sephora in the United States and was the #1 eye cream there in February and March. 
Beyond products, our brand continue to forge creative collaborations. M-A-C is designing a makeup collection inspired by the singer Selena. And Estée Lauder is teaming up with foster designer, Victoria Beckham, for a full cosmetic collection. This collaboration brings great bask [ph] to our brand, especially on social media, and we expect them to draw new consumers.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey to give more details on the quarter."

Net sales for the third quarter were $2.66 billion, up 6% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 10 basis points of the sales growth. 
As Fabrizio mentioned, our international business remained quite strong, as nearly all of our international markets grew this quarter, led by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 11% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in most developed and emerging markets. The region continues to benefit in part from the weak euro, making it a more attractive tourist destination, as well as from the benefits of strong execution of its strategic initiatives. 
The U.K., Nordic and Italy were the largest contributors to growth among the developed markets in the region. And the Middle East, Russia, South Africa and Central Europe led double-digit gains in emerging markets in the region. Our online business was particularly strong across all EMEA markets this quarter. 
Our net sales in the global travel retail channel rose 9%, reflecting strong retail trends in most countries in Europe and Asia, which were partially offset by continued net sales declines in Hong Kong, Brazil and the United States. Overall, passenger traffic growth in travel retail across all regions remained solid, despite shifts in consumption patterns between countries due to currency. 
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Every market in the region grew, except Hong Kong, which was down double digits. Korea was the largest contributor to net sales growth, rising 14% in the quarter, followed closely by Japan, Australia and Taiwan. China rose 5%, led by 70% growth in e- and m-commerce sales. Online sales across all APAC markets rose sharply this quarter. 
Our net sales in Hong Kong declined more than we had anticipated, as tourists from the Chinese mainland continue to decrease. Excluding Hong Kong, the region's sales would have grow nearly 9%. 
Net sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency. Brazil, Mexico and Canada all saw strong double-digit growth. As currencies in these countries continue to weaken against the dollar, local market consumption remained strong. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits. Continued strength in our online business, specialty multi and high-end department store channels was largely offset by sharp declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued softness in traffic in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores. 
Once again, makeup sales led product category growth, rising 11% in constant currency. Double-digit growth from M-A-C, Smashbox and Tom Ford led the increase, while particularly strength -- while particular strength in the lip and foundation categories drove makeup growth at Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Estée Lauder this quarter.
Sales of fragrance products rose 7% in constant currency. Double-digit gains from our luxury portfolio. Jo Malone, Tom Ford and Le Labo contributed the majority of the growth. The Michael Kors Gold collection and Tory Burch stood out among the designer fragrances. This strength at the high end of the fragrance category was partially offset by lower fragrance sales from Estée Lauder and the remaining designer fragrances. 
Haircare sales increased 3% constant currency. Aveda benefited from initial shipments of its new and body for men products, as well as higher sales of more recent launches and existing products. The brands opened new doors in travel retail and added salons and freestanding stores in Europe. Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in all channels.
Skin care sales were flat in constant currency, reflecting the continued weakness in Hong Kong and the ongoing shift in increased consumer spending from skin care to makeup. Additionally, Estée Lauder's skin care business declined slightly in the quarter due to tough comparisons with prior year launches in the U.S. and in Asia. There were many bright spots in our portfolio for skin care. La Mer and Origins grew skin care double digits, as did skin care lines of our M-A-C and Bobbi Brown makeup brands. 
Our gross margin increased 50 basis points to 81% of sales, The improvement came primarily from supply chain savings and lower promotional expenses, partially offset by channel and category mix. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, increased 110 basis points to 66% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Selling and store operations cost to support our retail store growth, as well as general and administrative costs, primarily from employee-related cost, consulting fees in our prior acquisitions, drove most of the increases. These were partially offset by our value creation from our strategic modernization initiative and a deferral of some advertising and promotional expenses to the fourth quarter to support higher expected sales growth in that quarter. 
As a result, operating income decreased less than 1% to $399.2 million and operating margin fell 60 basis points to 15%, due entirely to foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 3%. 
Net earnings also decreased approximately 1% below the prior year quarter to $274.9 million. Diluted EPS of $0.73 was 2% above the prior-year, reflecting the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger-than-expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of continued expense management and a delay in some advertising and promotional spending for Estée Lauder and Clinique to the fourth quarter. 
Earnings per share for the quarter include $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 5%. 
Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year. The sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact full year comparisons to the prior year. I will discuss our expectations, adjusting for the impact of the shift, as always. Our forecasted growth rates, both before and after the shift impact, are available in today's earnings release. Also excluded is the impact of restructuring and other charges.
For the full year, we expected sales to continue -- or to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 5 percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of April of $1.14 for the euro, $1.44 for the pound and 109 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Diluted EPS is now expected to range between $3.09 and $3.14, or $0.02 more than our last guidance range, reflecting a slight moderation in the currency impact. Adverse currency translation is now projected to affect EPS by about $0.27. Excluding the currency impact, we continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Our EPS range includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions. 
Our strong performance to date gives us the confidence to invest more in the fourth quarter to support additional advertising and promotion, primarily for Estée Lauder and Clinique. While we continue to pursue value creation from our SMI program, which is now expected to deliver $175 million of cost savings this year, we also look for ways to further improve our cost leverage in the future. 
Fabrizio will now discuss the initiative we announced in our press release today."

The multifaceted initiative that we call Leading Beauty Forward is designed to provide additional fuel for long-term growth and profitability. It will build on our strong foundation and leverage capabilities we have developed in important areas driving our business, including digital, retail and creative. 
Leading Beauty Forward will support the continuing success of our strategy in an increasingly fast-paced, complex and competitive prestige beauty environment. It is designed to sustain our momentum by reducing cost and freeing up more resources to invest in brands' capability and most profitable opportunities while better leveraging our growth. 
As we look toward the future, we believe the best way to capture the growth opportunity of tomorrow is being proactive today. This initiative is a carefully measured next step in our long-term strategy that will allow us to continue to lead in the prestige beauty industry. We expect Leading Beauty Forward to sustain our sales, operating margin and earning per share growth beyond the goals we have set throughout fiscal year 2018. 
Clearly, how we do business today and how we must be prepared to do business in the future is very different from what it was just 7 years ago, when we launched our current strategy. The fast-moving landscape requires a mindset and a way of operating that increases speed and flexibility, is creative, streamlined, cost efficient and designed to serve global consumers in new ways. 
To that end, as part of Leading Beauty Forward, we plan to redesign select areas of our go-to-market organizations in the regions, affiliates and brands to increase agility and strengthen their capabilities. As more of our consumer engagement moves to digital platforms, the markets will need the tools and authority to respond quickly to opportunities and bring our expertise in local relevance closer to consumer. 
Stronger skills in innovation, digital, social media and creative capabilities will allow them to differentiate our unique brands even farther by tailoring products and services to specific consumer segments and channels. We also will redesign select corporate functions to increase their efficiencies by making them leaner, scalable and less costly, while continue to deliver excellent services to our brand and businesses. 
We are evaluating the creation of a global and regional shared services among certain functions to simplify processes and focus on more strategic activities. We also plan to continue to optimize some of our supply chain operation to create a more efficient structure. These actions are expected to reduce our operating expenses, freeing up resources to invest in our brands, channel, consumer-facing activities and potential acquisitions. 
An important goal of Leading Beauty Forward is to support and grow our brands. To accomplish this, we will invest in activities that will resonate with consumers, including innovation to develop new product and services, unique point-of-sales asset, effective social media dialogues and compelling advertising. We will also support our newly acquired brands to expand their presence and products and continue to build our small and medium-size brands so they become leaders in the industry. 
As employees focus more fully on being creative and strategic, we will enhance our learning and development programs so they have the best skills to lead in critical areas. The redesign will regrettably include reducing position in some areas. We also expect to add talent in the departments we plan to strengthen and to retain all other employees. In total, we estimate at this time, a global net reduction of approximately 900 to 1,200 positions, which is about 2.5% of our current workforce. As the company continues to grow and invest in new positions in the future, the improved process from these initiative are expected also to better leverage future productivity. 
We are launching Leading Beauty Forward from a position of exceptional strength. Since we began our new strategic cycle, our sales have increased by more than 50%, and our growth rate has outpaced that of global prestige beauty. Key to this performance is the much more diversified and balanced business we have created, with growth engines across our brands, categories, channels and geographies. 
With insights from our 10-year compass, we anticipated many of the trends influencing the industry's rise. We also modernized our processes and technology infrastructure. Our strategic modernization initiative has been deployed through most of our organization, creating greater visibility to information that let us manage our business in a more cost-efficient manner. We developed a wider spectrum of capabilities, strengthened our talents in areas such as R&D, supply chain, information technology, retail, digital and consumer insight. 
Leading Beauty Forward is designed to build on these achievements to further increase our efficiency and effectiveness. Global prestige beauty is thriving, growing industry with new channels, emerging geographies at the influence of younger consumers. With the convenience of the Internet, the expansion of specialty multi-retailers dedicated to beauty, particularly, in the U.S., how consumers shop is changing rapidly, and competition has intensified. Lower barrier to entry resulted in more than 250 new niche brands launching around the world last year, and the sheer number of beauty products vying for consumers' attention is vastly increasing. 
The design of our new structure should generate greater productivity through better cost leverage of our sales growth. Importantly, Leading Beauty Forward will create ongoing savings and reinvestment to help continue our momentum in this fast-growing and more competitive market, which should mean greater sustainability and less risk in meeting our future growth targets.
As the global leader in prestige beauty, we are poised to take advantage of opportunities that lie ahead by taking charge in leading change. Leading Beauty Forward further positions our company to continue winning in this rapidly changing arena, where the ability to anticipate developments and react swiftly and nimbly is more essential than ever. We expect to sustain our strong growth and lead not only our company but whole of the prestige beauty forward to greater heights.

So as Fabrizio just discussed, Leading Beauty Forward is a multiyear initiative designed to help us fuel our growth momentum and create a more efficient cost structure to sustain our margin progression beyond fiscal 2018. 
During the course of the initiative, over the next few years, we expect to take charges of approximately $600 million to $700 million. We expect to begin realizing initial benefits from the program in fiscal 2018, but we'll continue to maintain our flexibility to invest in opportunities and mitigate risk. 
At this time, we do not expect this to affect the long-range guidance we provided last summer other than the related restructuring charges. Once fully implemented, we expect to generate annualized benefits -- net benefits of $200 million to $300 million, currently anticipated to be fully realized after fiscal 2019. We expect to reinvest a portion of those savings behind the capabilities we need, that Fabrizio just discussed, to continue to succeed in the rapidly changing global prestige beauty environment. 
We will, as we usually do, update our 3-year strategic outlook and share our goals in August. The update will include the impact of this initiative, any adjustments to our strategy since last year, the addition of recently acquired brands and changes in currency rate assumptions. 
We are pleased with our results so far this year, and we believe Leading Beauty Forward will play an important role in supporting our continued sustained growth momentum for the long term. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

I think our pipeline versus was 5 years ago, I would say, is almost doubled in terms of the power of extra business. We have a very clear internal process where we look for sufficiency of our innovation pipeline versus our next 3, 5 years' goals. And I can tell you, we consider our innovation pipeline more than sufficient. Now the characteristic of the pipeline has changed in some way, also. First of all, today, the pipeline is much richer in makeup because, as you heard, the makeup category is, in this moment, the fast-growing in the world and also very fast-changing. So there is some outstanding innovation pipeline in makeup. And the makeup pipelines tends to be done by many smaller products versus few very big product, which is more typical of the skin care pipeline. So that's a change, and we have adjusted to that change. Our skin care pipeline is strong, but again, within skin care, the pipeline is more focused on what we call instant benefit skin care versus the long-term antiaging, and that's changed. And third, but probably very, very important, our pipeline in the fragrance business is changed, and it is done by much more high-end luxury artisanal fragrances, which will allow us, in my opinion, to continue gain market share in the high-end profitable fragrance business. And finally, in hair care, our pipeline, particularly in the styling, more profitable part of hair care, is stronger than ever. So in net, I feel positive about the sufficiency of the pipeline. And also, I feel positive by the fit of our pipeline to the future of the market as identified by our compass."

On makeup, first of all, I believe this is a long-term trend. The makeup category is growing, driven by several aspects. The first one is that the Asian consumer, the Asian women, are becoming more avid users of makeup. And so this is an enormous amount of growth potentially that will developed -- it is developing now and will continue to develop in the next years. The second big trend is that the millennials are, on average, using more makeup than the previous generation, so there is an increase of consumption per individual in all markets, including developed markets. And this is a long-term trend, also because what is driving the more usage of makeup is what historically has been our strength and our business model, which is education and customization. But now the education is available also via online, exactly our e-commerce activities, and via social media, which is booming the amount of how-to videos, different trends, et cetera. So the combination of this more amount of trends information and how-to information with the millennial generation point of view is pushing makeup up. I think, this will continue for a long period. In term of our activity in e-commerce, we continue to do very well. I think we gained substantial competitive advantage, but not only in the execution in market, also in the capabilities. We have a very strong e-commerce team that is developing amazing work, which are divided into technology people that can develop sites and develop activity in a very fast pace around the world from our centralized offices in New York in a very -- with investment that now will pay out for the long-term that we have done in the previous years. And we have great quality of execution in the creative side. So on top of that number of sites, the ability to penetrate the markets, frankly, we have the capability and the quality of execution that, for the time being, set us aside, in my opinion, from the industry.

But the sales growth did decelerate a little bit, probably a little bit more than people had expected. So can you help with some -- provide a little bit more insight on how you go about making decisions on A&P spend? Because that line does continue to move around a fair bit quarter-to-quarter. And then also, in terms of the Chinese tourism, do think you're making up the shortfall in Hong Kong from lack of Chinese tourists in other areas?"

So the sales by quarter depend a lot by initiatives, launches and what happens in specific markets. And the way we take the decisions is -- really, we base the decision of -- if we believe there is enough rate of return on that investment in that moment. For example, in quarter 3, the things that we saw going less strong than we expected was Hong Kong. And so when we had markets that decreased their growth significantly, we do decrease our spending there, and we keep the spending for better moments, where there is better market traction. So what you're seeing in the third quarter very specifically is reduced spend in Hong Kong from our side. The second area where we saw less traction was U.S. mid-tier department store brick-and-mortar, where we clearly saw less traction, together with all the tourist doors in the U.S. that particularly influenced by the absence of Brazilians and Russians, that was a very dramatic change. So when we see these dramatic changes, we obviously adjust our AP investment. The second reason was, in this case very specific, is some product launch initiative on Lauder and Clinique that we decided to move in supporting them in the fourth quarter, which is the other reason why we are moving AP investment from one quarter into another. Personally, I see this as a strength. We have the agility to move our AP investment by quarter, depending on the market situation and the product launch situation. And this make us more efficient and more effective, and we stay consistent on our year goal, that we will commit to do our best to deliver. There is no change, but by quarter, actually, we see agility and flexibility as strengths. On the Chinese consumers, now we are definitely doing much better with Chinese consumer in other areas where they are going. For example in Europe, as we have seen, there is a growth of our European business, which is partially driven by tourist, and the tourist are also Chinese. We have seen Korea coming back and Japan being pretty strong. So yes, we recover some of the sales, however, not all of them. We have a very high market share in Hong Kong, very, very high market share. And our market share, for example, in Japan is half of the market share we have in Hong Kong. So in that situation, we obviously cannot recover the Hong Kong losses completely in other areas, and that's what you're seeing in this moment as a phenomenon. But this is a temporary phenomenon. And as soon as Hong Kong will stabilize, and other markets where we are now building market share, like Korea, will achieve the levels we believe are achievable, the things will accelerate again."

M-A-C is growing strong double-digits in every single market of the world, and these -- the temporary flattening of the retail trend in the U.S. is being more than offset by a booming international business. The flattening of the U.S. is -- the temporary flattening of the U.S. trend is to -- driven by 2 aspects. One, as I said, is the fact that the lower traffic in mid-tier department store is one of the driver. And the other is tourists. I mean, M-A-C business is driven by tourists of the world that visit the U.S. in a significant way because the brand is very, very popular around the word. So the important decrease of tourists, particularly Brazilians and Russians, as I said, have temporary limited the retail of M-A-C, also because these tourists were very strong in the base period that we are comparing this to. But overall in total, M-A-C continues to be absolutely one of the strong drivers of our success around the world, and we have programs to ensure that this will continue. In term of the success of the small-size brands in the U.S. This is a fact that, as I explain in my prepared remark, that the combination of easier access to consumers and more availability of investment, now money at a lower interest rates, have created a lot of new launches of brands. And the possibility of social media to bring these brands to the attention of the consumers has taken down the barriers to entry. So the way we are reacting is, first of all, reinforcing the business in our strong brands. Second, participating to this with our midsize smaller brands, including acquisitions. I mean, Smashbox was one of these brands when we acquired these brands, and now in fact, is growing double-digit in the context of this. And then finally is the diversification of our distribution with freestanding store, more specialty, continued success of online and our support to mid-tier department store to accelerate, to reinforce the business model to be able to better attract millennials and better activate the floor in order to become even more competitive versus this development of smaller brands and of new channels. This is one of the changes that I was describing before that requires adjustment in capabilities and investments in supporting our brand's growth."

But then, the combination of our business and cost savings is actually producing the power to continue growing margin. Obviously, if currency and acquisition will stop affecting it negatively, this will be more visible. The other thing is there is also a mix change in our business. So we have more freestanding stores and we have more makeup versus skin care that also are changing the input of mix in our business.

And the period post that corresponded with a slowdown in Asia and Asian consumption, particularly in China and Hong Kong, as Fabrizio spoke about, which certainly slowed our skin care business, particularly with our large brands like Estée Lauder, and to a lesser extent, Clinique. So that is a margin difference in terms of our business performance relative to the previous time frame. One of the things that the Lead Beauty Forward program does for us, because we are -- and certainly our compass -- our 10-year compass has allowed us to continue to understand that there are very significant growth opportunities for us from a total company standpoint. It allows us the freedom to invest more in those is opportunities irrespective of the margin and deliver our margin goals in -- well into the future. So it's a very exciting program.

I'm just wondering if you are changing the way you look at that innovation, given the challenges to the growth in the category now."

So on China, so as -- we have been growing 5% our net sales this quarter and 8% our retail sales. So retail sales, 8% in China, is good, it's strong. And the profile of our growth, first of all by brand, is that all brands are growing double-digit wi",626,"Yes. So on China, so as -- we have been growing 5% our net sales this quarter and 8% our retail sales. So retail sales, 8% in China, is good, it's strong. And the profile of our growth, first of all by brand, is that all brands are growing double-digit with the exception of our Estée Lauder brand, which is the biggest brand. And that's the profile. So we are -- first of all, even before distribution, we are diversifying our brand portfolio that goes with the distribution because different brands are in different distribution. And we are diversifying geographically, because as I explained earlier time and was true also this quarter, we are opening new cities and new geographical area of China. We opened one new city, we opened 30 new doors just in the quarter 3. In term of the channels, online is doing well and will continue to do well. Today, we have now 10% of our business by now in online in China versus 12% in the U.S., so China is catching up with the U.S. at a speed of light. We are opening more freestanding store. In this moment, it's mainly on M-A-C and Jo Malone, but in the future, we may decide as we see the opportunity to add also other brands, increasing the number of freestanding stores, particularly in the cities where this is appropriate and there is no alternative distribution solution. I personally believe that the future of freestanding store in China will go directly to omnichannel, meaning the stores will be connected to the online brand dot-com activities and will be one basically omnichannel opportunity that will bring the brands in many more cities with pretty efficient freestanding store models, which are now the traditional big freestanding stores in cities like in the developed markets. And finally, we believe the specialty channel, over time, will also develop in China. And today, we are much more penetrated and developed in the specialty channel in China that we were in the U.S. at the beginning of the specialty channel development. So well diversified by region of China, well diversified by brand -- or better diversified by brand in our strategy and well diversified by channel is our goal for the development of the China market. Now in the innovation on skin care, as I explained before, yes, we are looking at skin care in a different way, reflecting the new consumer trends a reality. As I said, when you take skin care as a whole, there is a bigger and faster growth in what I call skin care for immediate benefit or skin care as a base of makeup. And there is less growth in this moment in the intense anti-aging skin care part. For the same reason of makeup, a lot of the growth is driven by millennials, which are more interested in this part of the skin care. So yes, big part of our innovation pipeline is also driven in these skin care benefits, which are more modern and more millennial. Take an example, the New Dimension launch of Estée Lauder is not about anti-aging, it's about really the shaping of the face depending how consumer want. Or think of our fastest-growing skin care segment, which are masks. Masks -- or even, we have a brand, GLAMGLOW, which is completely focused on masks. And masks is a product that you use to get, immediately after 10 minutes, the benefit that you're looking for, be it luminosity, moisturization, hydrate-ation or brightening, et cetera. So skin care for immediate benefits, which is closer to makeup in reality, in term of benefit for consumer, is the fastest-growing trend. And our pipeline in these areas are the strongest they ever been."

I'm saying it's temporary because Hong Kong is a great market with enormous internal demand of local consumers and is a very attractive market for Chinese in general. So it's been declining substantially in the last period. I believe at a certain moment, it will stabilize. I personally don't have the expectation that it will go back to big growth fast, but I do have the expectation that this trend will stabilize; will stabilize also because the local consumption is actually continue to increase. And so is the mix between local consumption and tourist, particularly Chinese tourist, that at a certain moment, will stabilize. And I just came from Hong Kong. As I said in my prepared remark, I was in Asia last week, I visited Hong Kong and Korea. And the other thing that gave me comfort is the strengths of our team there, which is managed this very difficult timing in a fantastic way, increasing their activities on local consumers to help our business to stabilize without waiting for tourists, but just increasing our market share with locals, which I think is the right strategy. And I have great confidence in our team to be able to stabilize the trend as soon as the market will allow. On your skin care question is -- I think I have answered already several times. The skin care, obviously, is it remains the most important categories overall and will continue to grow. As I said, the fastest-growing part of skin care is the skin care which is more relating to immediate benefits, which is the skin care, which is of high interest for millennial. We had to adjust our innovation, our technology, our activities and planning for the future to the balance between more drastic anti-aging benefits and more immediate benefits. We are doing that via our portfolio brands, some of our brands are much stronger in anti-aging, like Estée Lauder, some other of our brands, like GLAMGLOW, are completely focused on immediate results skin care. And some of our brands, like Bobbi Brown, have a strong skin care business, which is actually the skin care as a base of makeup and as to support to the makeup habits of women. So we are attacking skin care on multiple fronts: Anti-aging, base of makeup, insta-benefit, thanks to our portfolio of brands and thanks to our innovation pipeline. I feel very strong about our long-term skin care trend, but is a fact that makeup, in this moment, is a much faster growing category. And we are, again, I see as a strength, that we have the agility to adjust and refocus our investment resources depending on the biggest trends we see."

So if you comment on that, it's great. And within the AMS [ph] line, no, I know it's not reported quarterly, but on a full year basis. If you could talk about how that mix has maybe shifted over time. If there's some reduction in some buckets, like sampling or merchandising, with less reliance on department stores, but at increase in the kind of core advertising dollars, that would be really helpful."

And in terms of us [indiscernible], I would say you need to look at what's happening for us is like our magazine print advertising is more or less stabilizing, but our TV advertise is decreasing and is increasing of equivalent or more the digital social media advertising. So is -- summarizing, is a stabilization of the magazine advertising, a decrease of television and an increase of the digital social media. That's the trends we are seeing. Now obviously, this mix is very different by country in the world and by brand. But in general, this is the big trend we are seeing. So more sampling and more digital social media."

Our company had a very successful year in fiscal 2016. We delivered excellent financial results with adjusted constant currency and sales growth exceeding 7%, faster than global prestige beauty growth; and adjusted earnings per share rose 13%. 
We also made progress on our strategic objectives by further diversifying our business, strengthening our multiple engines of growth and advancing our creativity and innovation. These new products represent the nearly 1/4 of our sales, an all-time high. Additionally, we designed a launch, Leading Beauty Forward, a multiyear initiative to increase our efficiency, speed to market and agility. 
Our strong performance confirmed our resiliency during a volatile fiscal period that began with MERS [ph] in Korea and ended with Brexit in the U.K. In between, we experienced sharp currency fluctuations, disruptive job political events, including increased terrorism and slowing economies in some of our key markets.
In global prestige beauty, we also faced competition in changing consumer behavior. Nonetheless, we successfully navigate these new challenges by also strengthening the company's fundamentals, making us confident we can sustain our strong and profitable growth and achieve our long-term goals.
Our best growth came from our makeup categories, especially M-A-C; our luxury brands, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and the online and specialty multi channels. Our ability to grow so strongly in such a dynamic landscape is a testament to our more balanced and better diversified business and strategic ability to identify and anticipate changing consumers and industry trends. That is what defines and distinguish our company.
Another of our key attributes is our increasing agility. During the year, we saw a variety of markets impacted by unexpected economic political and social events. During those times, we made sure our resources were aligned with other areas having better growth potential. 
Another key strength is our multiple engines of growth throughout our more than 25 brands that span categories, channels and countries. This allowed us to achieve double-digit growth in some brands, channels or market, while balancing slower growth in other areas.
For example, continued political unrest in Hong Kong caused a sharp drop in Chinese stores, who travel to other countries instead. Our brands quickly responded by increasing the range of products appealing to Chinese consumers in key tourist doors in the markets they visited across Asia and Europe.
Fiscal year 2016 was also marked by rapid changes in global prestige beauty. Thanks to our 10-year compass, we had anticipated many of the trends, and we're well positioned to meet consumer-changing desires and shopping habits. For instance, we have increasingly invested in digital marketing and e-commerce, which was our fastest growing channel this past year. 
Our global E&M commerce sales surpassed $1 billion for the first time, a milestone we are very proud of, and we expect our strong online growth to continue. We made progress on our strategy as we strengthen in many of our brands and diversified our portfolio. Our compass pointed to the growing interest among millennials for more specialized brands, so we nurtured the ones in our portfolio into significant competitors. Several of them, including Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Smashbox, M-A-C, La Mer, powered matched our growth and gained share. As makeup sales soared across the industry, Smashbox and M-A-C grew sharply, driven by their creativity and strong consumer demand. Our specialized luxury brands were big winners, and we are quiet by By Kilian. We strengthened our standing in the fastest-growing area of fragrance, the Ulta prestige gear.
Additionally, we made a minority investments in the successful Korea skincare brand, Dr. Jart+, which give us an interest in the local brand in that very influential market. 
Our 2 big multi-category brands stabilized overall, as they each ended the year with flat sales. However, both brands have restarted slowly growth in makeup. Estée Lauder makeup sales rose in every region, led by foundations and lip products. Its long-standing Double Wear foundation continued to be a bestseller worldwide. 
In skin care, its innovative advanced [indiscernible] repair powerful mask helped accelerated sales of the [indiscernible] franchise in China and generated buzz and photos on social media. The brand's global net sales reflected strong growth in the European region and emerging market, offset by declining Asia Pacific largely due to Hong Kong.
Clinique also advanced on many fronts. Its makeup sales were up sharply on a global basis and pep start eye cream of set top seller in several markets. Clinique rated digital campaigns featuring millennial influences that had contributed to solid sales growth in the specialty multichannel and in Europe. These gains were offset by declining in U.S. mid-tier department stores in Hong Kong.
Looking at our business geographically. Sales in emerging markets rose 15% overall and 25%, excluding China. To fuel our momentum, we further emphasized our local relevance in products and social media. This past years, our brand reached many new consumers in emerging markets. Jo Malone entered Brazil, for example. We launched our first e-commerce operations in Mexico, and La Mer had a terrific growth in Russia.
Our channels' strength reflected industry trends, and we invested in areas with the best traffic and growth. Sales in our online business rose 27%, reflecting solid gains in brands and retailer sites. We opened more sites for our brands and with retailers globally to widen our product availability. Orders and conversion grew more than 20%. We continue to selectively expand our brands in specialty multi retailers globally to broaden our consumer base. 
For example, in North America, Estée Lauder introduced the millennial-oriented Estée Edit  collection in Sephora while Origins launched in select Sephora stores inside JCPenney and plans to roll out to full distribution there this year.
In Europe, Smashbox continued to broaden its presence in boots in the U.K. and entered the specialty multi retailers like [indiscernible] beauty in Italy. We strengthen our capabilities particularly in R&D, information technology digital and consumer insights.
Across our brands, creativity and innovation remained a priority. Approximately 24% of our sales came from new products, and our investment in research and development [indiscernible] in line with our sales growth. 
Our global patent portfolio has increased 40% in the last 4 years, primarily in skin care and strategic areas with high consumer interests. Our U.S. patents covers technologies that would anchor high-quality products that we expect to have broad appeal and delight global consumers. 
We also launched Leading Beauty Forward to reduce costs and free up resources to invest in the areas that will help fuel our growth, including retail, innovation, digital, social media and new consumer-facing activities. In this fast-paced environment, we want to improve our speed and flexibility as we go-to-market and serve global consumers in creative and contemporary ways.
In this new fiscal year, our actions fall into 2 broad areas. The first is increasing the reach of our target consumers throughout whitespace opportunities across geographic -- geographies and channels. The second is enhancing our consumer engagement with new experiences and innovative high quality products and services, which will encompass digital marketing, disruptive in-store merchandising, compelling creativity and omnichannel offering. Our brands have numerous opportunities to attract new consumers in every region. 
M-A-C is one of our largest brands, but isn't as widely distributed as other brands. It has approximately 1/10 the doors of Estée Lauder and Clinique and about half [ph] the distribution of several guided global competitors. So there are millions of untapped new consumers the brand can potentially reach.
Many of our small- and medium-sized brands are now poised for global expansion. For example, in travel retail, Jo Malone today is available in less than half [ph] of KIA-1 [ph] airports, so there is a lot of ground to a left to reach additional traveling consumers. Online, Jo Malone has e-commerce website in just 8 countries compared to 26 for Clinique. In fact, Jo Malone expect to launch E&M commerce in approximately 10 new markets this year.
As our consumer coverage increases, we are carefully watching same-store sales growth as well. We expect new points of distribution, same-store growth and pricing to each contribution approximately the same amount to our total sales growth this year. 3 [ph] standing stores are expected to account about 1/3 of our new distribution this year.
As our brands broaden their reach, they will emphasize fast-growing image-building channels. In the online world, our focus is on mobile and omnichannel. Consumers expect a seamless integrated experience across channels, platforms and social media. We are implementing new technology and digital experiences, including online booking for in-store appointments, omnichannel loyalty programs and high-touch mobile services.
With sales in specialty multi retailers on a fast track, we will increase the number of doors we are in and widen the scope of our brands in the channel to reach the consumer to shop there. For example, Clinique plans to roll out more Ulta locations and enter some Sephora store inside JCPenney. Estée Lauder, meanwhile, will reach new stoppers with a curated selection of products in Ulta in 30 stores and on Ulta's website.
In travel retail, global passenger traffic is forecasted to grow mid-single digit. We expect our net sales to surpass traffic growth, led by many of our midsized brands that have opportunities to enter additional airports all over the world. We are working closely with department stores to bring more traffic to beauty, both in-store and online. We will elevate the consumer experience in department stores with differentiated customized services such as makeup lessons from our expert advisers, for which there is a strong demand.
Although department stores had been challenged in the U.S., they continue growing internationally, including the U.K., Western Europe, Australia, Canada or Latin America. Social media is integral to every beauty brand today and an important component in winning with millennials.
To engage consumers, our brands plan to utilize more global and local influences, beauty consultants and makeup artists to amplify their messages. Estée Lauder is collaborating on a makeup collection with fashion designers and influencers, Victoria Beckham, and she is promoting it to her 12 million Instagram followers.
Our brands are increasing their media spending and devoted more resources to digital, which allows them to target their communications to potential new consumers with relevant messages. Thanks to better data and new technologies. Approximately 30% of our total [indiscernible] spending is now digital, up 15% from last year. 
Our brands are doing interesting activities in the digital space. Estée Lauder launched the interactive global content network based in New York in words liken in newsroom. And Bobbi Brown held its first live video on Facebook, celebrating its 26th anniversary and a new campaign, which attract nearly 1 million viewers.
Innovation remains paramount, as our brands pursue high-growth subcategories. One area is skin care with instant benefit such as masks from [indiscernible] brands, they make skin grow. In addition, Clinique's pep start eye [indiscernible] moisturizer [indiscernible] and skin imperfections on the spot. And Estée Lauder revitalizing supreme plus [indiscernible] creates instant morning radiance.
We plan to accelerate our growth in skin care. The recent launch of Estée Lauder advance [indiscernible] should help drive the brand's important franchise. Clinique created a collection around pep start with the addition of moisturizers and cleansers, and La Mer is rolling out a new formula or it's called moisturizing line. 
With new innovations and consumer engagement activities, we believe we can further strengthen our leading position in makeup. Estée Lauder is building on its Double Wear foundation with an innovative cushion stick. Clinique introduced super balance sleep makeup and [indiscernible] foundation with some protection. And M-A-C Instant Curve Lush Mascara has a customizable brush.
We also plan to propel our fragrance business, particularly in the Ulta prestige tier, where we have a large and desirable portfolio. Jo Malone highly anticipated major fall launch is [indiscernible] and Tom Ford newest entry in its seniors collection is Orchids Sole [ph]
Prestige beauty is a driving consumer area and it is growth continues to exceed mass beauty in key countries. Underlying demographic trends are positive. The media class in energy markets, millennials and ageless consumers has a big appetite for prestige beauty, and those populations are increasing. We operate in an unpredictable global environment and carefully monitor ongoing issues such as the ramification of Brexit on our business. We are aware that unforeseen challenges will arise, however, we have comfort in knowing that we have many strengths that underpin our financial performance. Our diversified business is anchored by multiple engines of growth, a wealth of creativity and the ability to quickly react and adapt to events and trends making us optimistic about our long-term success.
Over the next 3 years, we expect to generate sales growth of 6% to 8% and double-digit EPS increases in constant currency. This year, we expect to, once again, outplace global prestige beauty growth and gain share despite external headwinds and challenges. In fiscal 2017, we [indiscernible] constant currencies a growth of 6% to 7% with double-digit EPS growth.
I want to thank my executive team and every one of our employees for their hard work and passion. They are one of the key reasons we have performed so well and continue to be so confident about our future.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey."

First, I will review our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year financial results and then cover our expectations for the fiscal 2017 first quarter and full year.
As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. Additionally, the fiscal 2016 full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior year implementation of our strategic modernization initiative.
Net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.65 billion, up 7% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Incremental sales from our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 50 basis points of this growth. Our business was quite strong in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, despite macro events in France, Germany and Turkey as well as the U.K. Brexit vote.
Net sales rose 12% in constant currency with double-digit growth in most countries, notably the U.K., Germany and most of the region's emerging markets. Our sales declined in France due to a large drop in tourism and in the Middle East because of continued economic uncertainty.
Our global travel retail channel delivered an 11% net sales increase, reflecting strong retail trends in many tourist destinations, partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong and in Brazil. Currency volatility and terrorist activity continue to affect travel and consumption patterns, and we saw a moderation in passenger traffic to Europe in the quarter. 
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. Australia was a standout, growing strong double digits, while China, Korea and Japan grew mid- to high single digits. Our net sales in Hong Kong continued to decline but less than in the previous quarter.
Net sales in the Americas increased 3% in constant currency. Latin America grew more than 20%, led by Mexico and Brazil; and Canada rose mid-single digits. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits.
Our sales through both online and specialty multi channels continue to rise double digits, however, declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued weakness in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores curtailed growth.
Makeup sales again led product category growth, rising 12% in constant currency. M-A-C, Smashbox, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford achieved double-digit makeup growth, and Estée Lauder rose mid-single digits. Foundation, lip products, kits and pallets have been very popular among all consumers. 
Hair care sales increased 5% in constant currency. Aveda benefited from the launch of Enbody [ph] for men products and Bumble and Bumble experienced solid growth in Germany and in France.
Skincare sales grew 3% in constant currency, led by growth from La Mer and Origins. These increases were partially offset by Estée Lauder and Clinique, reflecting continued weakness in U.S. mid-tier department stores as well as in Hong Kong.
Sales of fragrance products rose 2% in constant currency. Jo Malone was the largest contributor to growth as sales rose strong double digits. Our recent acquisitions, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, are growing rapidly and By Kilian provided incremental sales. 
Our gross margin was unchanged from the prior year. Favorability from pricing, lower obsolescence and supply chain savings were offset by channel mix, currency and new products. Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined 10 basis points. Higher store operating costs associated with our retail store growth was offset by lower selling and shipping costs and cost savings from our SMI program. As a result, operating income rose 7% and operating margin improved 10 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9%. Net earnings increased 7% to $163.1 million. Diluted EPS of $0.43 was 9% above the prior year, reflecting higher earnings and a small benefit from a lower share count and lower effective tax rate. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.01 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 11%.
Switching to our full year. Details of our performance are largely covered in the press release so I will focus on some of the highlights. With strong net sales up 7%, our gross margin improved 10 basis points. Manufacturing favorability and lower obsolescence were partially offset by product category mix and currency. Our full year operating margin declined 40 basis points to 15.5%. While the decrease included slight dilution from the recent acquisition of By Kilian, the decline was almost entirely driven by 50 basis points from the impact of adverse currency. We continue to benefit from our cost savings and sales growth leverage.
We ended fiscal 2016 with an effective income tax rate of 28.3%, a 200 basis point improvement from the prior year. Net interest expense rose to $55.1 million from $45.7 million in the year earlier, reflecting the increase in debt from our May 2016 bond issuances, partially offset by higher investment income.
In fiscal 2016, we realized approximately $135 million in restructuring and other charges, $54 million of it related to the transformation and modernization of our global technology infrastructure, which is largely complete; and approximately $81 million in charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiative.
Operating cash flow was $1.79 billion, representing a slight improvement over the prior year, adjusted for the SMI shift. We invested $525 million in capital projects, 2/3 of which was in consumer-facing areas such as counters, retail stores and E&M commerce sites. We've repurchased 10.5 million shares of our stock for $890 million and paid $423 million in dividends to stockholders, increasing our dividend rate by 25%.
In total, we returned approximately 104% of free cash flow to stockholders, contributed to our 6.4% total stockholder return for the fiscal year, which compares with 4% for the S&P 500 for the same period.
Additionally, we invested in an acquisition in a minority interest, and we increased our balance sheet leverage by issuing $600 million in senior notes at favorable rates.
Overall, we are very pleased with the performance we delivered in fiscal 2016. Our 7% net sales growth and 13% EPS growth in constant currency are strongly aligned with our long-term goal, and we have laid the foundation for a more efficient and effective organization to leverage growth with the launch of Leading Beauty Forward.
Now looking ahead over the next few years. We plan to continue to focus on our strategic priorities with an even greater emphasis on speed and agility and the context of a rapidly evolving prestige beauty landscape. The recent Brexit vote has added a layer of uncertainty that will most likely not be fully understood for some time, and we believe the risks of other economic and political disruptions will remain high as we start our new fiscal year. Nevertheless, our strategies are sound and as a result, over the next 3 years, we expect our business to continue to become even more balanced and diversified by product category, brand, geography and channel.
Prestige beauty is expected to grow at 4% to 5% annually for the next few years, and we remain committed to our goal of exceeding the growth of global prestige beauty by at least 1 percentage point annually. We also expect to continue to drive value from our existing cost saving programs, and we expect to begin realizing some of the initial benefits from Leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2018 and generate annualized net benefit of $200 million to $300 million upon full implementation of the program.
With the recent approvals of the first initiative under Leading Beauty Forward, we can now develop more effective organization structures to enable increasing improvements and consumer engagement for our brands as well as develop more efficient and effective processes for many of our corporate functions, including the initial organization design of a potential shared service support structure. We expect to approve further initiatives throughout the next few years. All of these efforts should permanently reduce the run rate of the area addressed [ph] under the program and provide funds for continued investment and capabilities that more directly support the sustainability of our profitable top line growth.
It is more important than ever that we maintain the financial and operational flexibility to compete effectively in the dynamic prestige beauty industry. We must be able to nimbly allocate the appropriate amount of resources as consumer preferences, travel quarters and exchange rates continually shift. Balancing cost savings, sales leverage and reinvestment for future growth, we expect operating margin expansion of approximately 110 to 150 basis points in constant currency for fiscal 2019. We remain committed to our goal of growing EPS double digits in constant currency each year, which we have delivered consistently for the last 7 years. 
Working capital improvement also continues to be a focus, and we expect improved cash-to-cash cycle performance across accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory. Over the next 3 years, we plan to free up over $400 million in additional cash, which would increase our growth in cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings growth. We are targeting inventory days to sell of approximately 150 days by the end of fiscal 2019, a market improvement from today's levels.
Now let me focus on our outlook for the fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter. In fiscal 2017, sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency. We expect all product categories in regions to grow, led by the makeup category and the EMEA region. By channel, growth is expected to continue to be strongest in online, specialty multi, freestanding stores and travel retail.
As Fabrizio mentioned, several of our brands will accelerate their expansion in specialty multi retailers and online, which should enable us to reach new consumers as they increasingly shop multiple channels for prestige beauty products. The impact of this activity and the cadence of our new product launches are expected to produce stronger top line growth subsequent to our first quarter.
Our estimate reflects current spot rates given the recent volatility we have experienced the last 2 years. Those spot rates are 1 12 for the euro, 1 31 for the pound and 1 01 for the yen.
We continue to achieve cost savings from our SMI program. In fiscal 2017, we expect to generate approximately $150 million in savings, primarily from indirect procurement, MP optimization, supply chain initiatives and selling effectiveness, some of which will be used to invest behind our newly acquired brands and omnichannel capabilities. We anticipate our tax rate will range between 28% and 29%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44, before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to take restructuring and other charges of $80 million to $100 million, with about $35 million to $45 million in the first quarter. We expect to update these estimates when additional initiatives are improved. And as a reminder, total program costs beyond fiscal 2017 over multiple years are anticipated to be in the $500 million to $600 million range.
In fiscal 2017, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $1.8 billion, relatively flat with last year, with the inclusion of the impact of Leading Beauty Forward. Capital expenditures are planned approximately $550 million or 4.5% to 5% of sales.
With respect to our capital structure, we have room to grow our dividend while maintaining a sustainable payout ratio. And as of June 30, we had approximately 18 million shares remaining in our buyback authorization. We will continue to assess the need for greater leverage to support our strategies, including shareholder returns.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales to rise approximately 2% to 3% in constant currency. Translation could hinder growth by approximately 1 percentage point. We expect our small- to midsized brands to continue to be strong contributors in many global markets, owing to their increasing appeal with multiple consumer groups across various channels. We also expect continued growth to be generated in many developed and emerging markets, particularly in Europe. Partially offsetting these growth drivers in the quarter are some macro issues that we expect to impact our results. 
Our U.S. business continues to be affected by low traffic in midtier department stores and tourist-driven doors, and we are facing a difficult comparison to the prior year quarter, which was our strongest quarter in the U.S. when Estée Lauder and Clinique launched major skin care products and M-A-C had exceptionally strong results. Our cadence of product launches reflect smaller programs for all 3 in this year's first quarter.
The Middle East is projected to decline as distributors adjust inventory levels to reflect sluggish consumer spending. And we're experiencing weak sales in France as the threat of terrorism curtails travel and domestic spending in the near term.
For the first quarter, our EPS forecast is between $0.73 and $0.77 before restructuring charges. The adverse currency translation on sales for the first quarter equates to about $0.03 of EPS.
And as a reminder, the size and quarterly cadence of our new product launches and our programs changes from year-to-year. We continue to focus on delivering annual results in our overall long-term sales and profit growth plans.
We look forward to another successful year ahead for our company and for our brands. We are fortunate to operate in one of the highest demand consumer categories today. Our brands are among the most desirable in the industry, and we believe our team is the most talented in the industry with their incredible creativity, passion for the business and the depth of knowledge on what products consumers inspire to have. This winning formula continues to support our confidence in our plan despite a volatile, political, economic and currency environment.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

We certainly have some of the mixed impact related to makeup and skincare going on as well this year. So some of it is mixed impact and some of it is the currency impact. As I indicated, we still do have our cost savings programs to offset a lot of the unfavorability that we're experiencing, and we continued to work on other initiatives to improve the margin. On fragrance, one of the things that we've spoken about, Jason, in the past is some of our fragrance brands that have a higher margin characteristics. So Jo Malone is a very profitable fragrance brand for us. Our newer acquisitions because of some of the purchase accounting don't yet have the margin characteristics of a Jo Malone, but we certainly expect that they will once we get past the purchase accounting impact in the next year or 2."

Now where have the travel and culture absolutely reliant right, less of them travel to Hong Kong and more of them travel to different destination internationally. That is also true that there is an enormous increase of travel within China, and we are very well positioned. We have, as you know, there are duty-free areas within China where we are very strong, for example, Hainan islands that are increasing and there is more people traveling there. On top of that, the fact that consumer travel touristically within the country offer us the possibility of continue building distribution in 3rd-tier [ph] and 4-tier [ph] cities where we are enjoying this internal travel, which obviously in this case is not duty free. So both are cheery, continued increase of external travel and increase of it internal travel, and we are capturing to bet opportunities. As far as Korea is concerned, we are doing very well in Korea.

And it's the skin care brand, although small, but it's a skin care brand in our opinion with great potential to grow it to become big and also it's focused exactly on the new skin care brand, so instant benefits like masks and specialty multichannel dynamics.

The building block is that the first building block is pricing. And as I said, out of the 6%, 7%, about 2 points will be pricing. A lot of the price increases of the year happened in January, and so already this 2% of pricing is cute toward more -- the second part of the year. Then think of the distribution. So the second 2% of increase of the year is greater distribution reaching new consumers around the world. Now many of these new distribution, including the one in specialty that you just mentioned, are going to happen after October. Many of the free-standing stores in Europe that we [indiscernible] of the free-standing stores we have went to, that will happen in the period. And many of the new specialty multi doors in the U.S. will happen after October. So that's the second different. That's the second positive which is going to happen more skewed ahead in the fiscal year versus the first quarter. The third the point is the -- as I said before into the previous question, we have a very solid new fragrance portfolio in the high end. Now this fragrance portfolio, as you know, tend to have a huge opportunity to grow during holiday periods. And so all the holiday periods, they're not only Christmas but also Valentine, Mother Day happen to be after the October, and this will be another big acceleration element which is later in the fiscal year. Then we have all our innovation program, as Tracey, said in her prepared remarks, our innovation schedule change in the year. We have less blockbuster initiative this year because we believe the consumer and the social media environment, which is developing, need more diffusion of newness versus blockbuster approach. So a lot of innovation is more skewed as of October. In our portfolio, this is the other building block on same door that we [indiscernible] by the same door 2%, 3% of progress that we see in the year. Then as I said, Estée Lauder and Clinique are on an improvement trends, and we expect Estée Lauder Clinique to continue to improve and M-A-C U.S. is expected to continue to improve in the second part of the year. And so all these factors will improve the comp part of the fiscal year. So a lot of good steps that we believe will, over the year, accelerate. The last thing I want to say of that is that we have proven just the year with fiscal year '16 that we've finished. We grew 2 of the quarter's more than 8% and another quarter is [ph] 5%. So we have proven that we have the capability and the potential to grow at [ph] 8% plus in the quarters where all the key elements of our building blocks start acting together."

We also opened third-party stores as well in the year, and that's where we indicated of our total distribution growth, that's about 1/3 of the growth of that 2% distribution is freestanding stores.

So when you see the disproportionate growth of makeup, which is happening in the industry and certainly we're both driving and benefiting from and then the slowdown that we've seen in skincare, it does have a mixed impact. So that is a piece of it. The other pieces that Hong Kong is a quite profitable area of the world for us from a sales perspective, sales and profit perspective in that region. And the double-digit declines that we've seen in Hong Kong have also had an impact. So there's a geographic impact. The Middle East would be the same. So there's a geographic impact and then there's a category impact from a mix standpoint that we have experienced.

The second thing is around cost savings. I believe for fiscal '16, you started the year expecting $200 million of SMI-related savings. You lowered that to $175 million for the year as you back in May. And then as you look into fiscal '17, you're talking about $150 million. So there are like some of those expected savings aren't achievable for some reason? Some things changed because I would have thought maybe it was a delay in timing but something with SMI, it just feels like perhaps savings are not quite what had been anticipated in even 12 months ago."

At some point, as you start to grow further and deeper on some of these initiatives there's going to be less opportunity. Clearly, when we initiated the second phase of our savings program, we went after the biggest opportunities first and then you start to see that weighing down, hence the reason why we announced Leading Beauty Forward, which certainly will generate more savings in future years as the SMI savings start to narrow a bit. So I think we're right on track with respect to where we expect to be in terms of SMI savings, and we certainly will always strive. We have a very competitive team so we always strive to exceed what we -- what our targets are."

One is still in your 2017 guidance, your 6% to 7% constant currency, 8% to 10% on the bottom line. I guess, I'm still not convinced that the margins you're projecting are flat because of currencies and maybe just tell me of that confusion because it looks like it's less than 1% of impact on your top line for the year. You talked about $0.08 on the EPS line. That's like 2.5% of EPS, and that's like a very large multiplier much bigger than we would have expected. So trying to get a sense of why that's the case? And even that, by the way, doesn't explain the margin structure being flat given all the cost cutting that you're doing, the good cost cutting that you're doing. That's question 1. The other one is I do want to go back to the question terms of distribution expansion into Sephora [indiscernible] and JCPenney into Ulta with Estée Lauder, which I think we [indiscernible] ago if Ulta had existed [indiscernible] which would have been crazy, Jo Malone pushing more. I mean, we've seen a lot of knot the same but the analogous issues. I am just recently coached as an example said, look, we're pulling back from department stores. Again slightly different issue because they were discounting a lot but we've heard this before from timing, Burberry, Ralph Lauren as Tracey knows very well. And you look at this a lot, guys I wanted to get a sense of our you're looking at it, I appreciate your thoughts on this because there is a concern that at some point, you're going to get rid of the scarcity. At some point, you're going to mask by the brands which drives the brand erosion and you kind of view it as a little bit of prestige. So given some of the analogies, can you explain kind of long term how much longer do you have before you start hurting the brands."

So currency is an of a big impact and we give you the spot with the we're using, which you can certainly good change during the course of the year. But rather than us predicting how that will change, we're using current spot rates and that definitely has at least 30 basis point impact on our margin for the year. In addition to that, we did talk about the fact that some of our very high profit margin regions are actually showing even slower growth were declines in the case of Hong Kong as we mentioned. The Middle East slowed quite a bit. U.K. is a bit softer than what we certainly have experienced over the last couple of years. So those are all impacting. If nothing changed with respect to either our category mix or geographic mix, then you would be absolutely spot on. But those are things that we're managing as well. So our cost savings programs not only help us to expand the margin but they helped and fund some of our investment, but they've also helped us because of the programs that we put in place a few years ago and are continuing to deliver on are helping us to offset the negative impact of some of the macro situations that we're experiencing right now."

And on distribution, Ali, my point is we vet every single decision starting with a consumer point of view. So we are not distributing our brands anywhere where the consumer doesn't demand them and the consumer is the target consumer. The distribution decision we are taking are always brand building, meaning there are consumers that are on target, particularly millennial, then we would not be able to reach opposing the brand that areas and that is what is happening around the world, particularly the millennial consumer changing their shopping habits. The brands that do not evolve their shopping habits to reach this consumer will basically actually lose structure with then you luxury consumer rather than risk their image. And so it's an evolution and it's driven mainly by the habits of the millennial consumer also is very different by category. This is happening very aggressively in makeup, for example, and the way the millennial consumer in makeup is happening also around the world. And a lot of this is about online, and we have the availability of the brands online. So second thing is not the image of the distribution but is the -- we call it consumer reach. So the way we look at it, because again that's your question, we don't look at it like only the image. We look at it do we reach the right consumers. So its analysis starts from target consumer reach. And in fact, that's what we have used as language in our prepared remark, Coverage, reach rather than expanded distribution. Then when you look at it in terms of number of doors, that's actually -- there are a lot of closures. There are a lot of stores which are being closed and not only in the U.S. around the worlds. So in terms of a number of stores, this is not necessarily an increase of our ability. So it's putting the brands where the consumer expect them at a certain moment of the [indiscernible]. Last thing I want to say is that you mentioned Estée Lauder Clinique, which are today within prestige broadly distributed brands. But keep in mind that all the rest of our portfolio is actually an enormous amount of extra distribution opportunity, meaning our brands have not even started being available to the right level of consumer around the world. So a lot of our distribution expansion is not about [indiscernible] and Clinique. It's about bringing the rest of our portfolio to available to the right target consumer around the world and numerical internal sales and profit. That's where the biggest opportunity us."

Sometimes a new distribution decision actually help sales for the brand in the total country, including in the retailers where the brands was previously distributed. And by the way, our brands very rarely are exclusive to a retailer. They are targeting certain group of consumer, that's clear. For example, Macy's, as you know, has announced to close 100 doors. We are collaborating -- we'll collaborate with Macy's to protect the consumption of our brands in these doors transferring to other Macy's doors consumers. We will do our best to support Macy's in this plan, which we believe they're doing the right thing.

Depending on our innovation in a particular year, in some cases, we actually choose to launch some innovation that actually has lower gross margin because that we've identified a consumer need in that particular space and believe that, that product will drive incremental sales and will build to be a large franchise, particularly for franchises like Estée Lauder and Clinique and particularly in skin care. So we have seen in recent years some new innovation that actually years a bit of a lower gross profit margin. Clearly, as sales continued to build on products that we launched that are new, you're amortizing the tooling and you're getting some more favorably in terms of gross profit margin. But largely, they stay relatively close to where they're at, unless there's a significant increase in volume, in which case you can get lower cost of goods. So but we do manage in our teams when you think about the number of brands that we have and the number of new product launches that we have where we have had, to Fabrizio's earlier comment, steady increase i nthe amount of innovation, our teams manage that gross margin mix quite tightly in terms of making sure that to me -- in the new innovation, at least we were [indiscernible] of years were offset by innovation that also was more margin accretive."

And yes, that is obviously the impact of the first 44, 45 doors that we have closed before in fiscal year '16 in the first quarter. But you called question for the long term, we definitely are focused to support our department store partners to improve -- to continue to improve the experience on our brands and in general in the beauty floor of the department store. We have many activities in this area, many in the area of improved services, many in the activity of innovation and distortion, many in the area of connecting social media to the activities and activity in the area of sampling. In other words, we are really focused in working together how to increase traffic in-store, which is in this moment, the key opportunity. And then to your second question is what do we see in this moment? Yes, we see a lower traffic than what we would like to see in our counters in mid-tier department stores, and that's what you see in our quarter 1 estimate as well.

And so there has been a significant improvement or trend. We said they would have started from tone around in the makeup area of both brands because it was the area that was better fitting than other goal, which was to attract more millennials to the brands. And we have done it. In the U.S., Lauder Clinique makeup is growing double digit, which frankly was declining just a year ago and this is an impressive improvement and also globally, both brands are growing their makeup in a very strong way. Now the skin care also did some progress as we explained in the prepared remarks. However, on the skin care, the 2 key issues, which is Hong Kong continues to decline and the media department store traffic issue that we just discussed in the last half an hour. Those 2 have been a drag to accelerate as well the skin care part, which now we will do our best to do in fiscal year '17. So good progress on both brands with an excellent start in makeup and some more work to do in skin care. Last point is to your question. So is that what we had forecasted. Frankly, we have done in line or slightly better than what we expected, but we did not forecast Hong Kong to continue to decline in the way has declined, and we did not anticipate the kind of traffic reduction in midtier department store that we have seen in the course of the area. So those 2 things actually were different than what we anticipated a year ago."

There are 2 dynamics which are happening, which we believe are for the long term. The first one is the Asian consumer is using makeup more and more. So the dynamic of skin care versus makeup a global level. The strength of skin care was driven by the fact that the fastest growing demand was coming from Asia and Asia consume use much more skin care than makeup. I think this will continue. So nothing wrong with the skincare trend, but the makeup trend in Asia is dramatically accelerated because the billion of Asian consumers are using makeup more and more. This is a very strong long-term trend. The second is the millennial generation. We -- the data shows that the average millennial use more makeup in more occasions during the week than their mothers. So the more the millennial generation grows in percentage of the total population, the more makeup usage will continue to accelerate. So those 2 trends are long term. However, it doesn't mean the skincare needs to continue being -- growing less. Actually we see in already the first signs that as and as the millennial will discover also more of the skin care routine. This can impact the skin care. For example, our new brands like Ground Glow, which are more focused on millennials and they are more based on instant benefit skin cares, which are more important for millennials, have seen amazing growth when they do a good product launch. So I personally believe also skin care will accelerate in the future driven by positive trends."

Our company had a very successful year in fiscal 2016. We delivered excellent financial results with adjusted constant-currency net sales growth exceeding 7%, faster than global prestige beauty growth, and adjusted earnings per share rose 13%.
We also made progress on our strategic objectives by further diversifying our business, strengthening our multiple engines of growth and advancing our creativity and innovation. These new products represent the nearly 1/4 of our sales, an all-time high. Additionally, we designed a launch, Leading Beauty Forward, a multiyear initiative to increase our efficiency, speed to market and agility.
Our strong performance confirmed our resiliency during a volatile fiscal period that began with MERS in Korea and ended with Brexit in the U.K. In between, we experienced sharp currency fluctuations, disruptive geopolitical events, including increased terrorism and slowing economies in some of our key merchants.
In global prestige beauty, we also faced tougher competition in changing consumer behavior. Nonetheless, we successfully navigated these new challenges by also strengthening the company's fundamentals, making us confident we can sustain our strong and profitable growth and achieve our long-term goals.
Our best growth came from our makeup categories, especially M-A-C, our luxury brands, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and the online and specialty multichannels. Our ability to grow so strongly in such a dynamic landscape is a testament to our more balanced and better-diversified business and strategic ability to identify and anticipate changing consumers and industry trends. That is what defines and distinguish our company.
Another of our key attributes is our increasing agility. During the year, we saw a variety of markets impacted by unexpected economic, political and social events. During those times, we made sure our resources were aligned with other areas having better growth potential.
Another key strength is our multiple engines of growth throughout our more than 25 brands that span categories, channels and countries. This allowed us to achieve double-digit growth in some brands, channels or market, while balancing slower growth in other areas. For example, continued political unrest in Hong Kong caused a sharp drop in Chinese tourists, who traveled to other countries instead. Our brands quickly responded by increasing the range of products appealing to Chinese consumers in key tourist doors in the markets they visited across Asia and Europe.
Fiscal year 2016 was also marked by rapid changes in global prestige beauty. Thanks to our 10-year compass, we had anticipated many of the trends, and we're well positioned to meet consumer-changing desires and shopping habits. For instance, we have increasingly invested in digital marketing and e-commerce, which was our fastest-growing channel this past year. Our global e- and m-commerce sales surpassed $1 billion for the first time, a milestone we are very proud of. And we expect our strong online growth to continue.
We made progress on our strategy as we strengthened many of our brands and diversified our portfolio. Our compass pointed to the growing interest among millennials for more specialized brands, so we nurtured the ones in our portfolio into significant competitors. Several of them, including Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Smashbox, M-A-C, La Mer, powered, matched to our growth and gained share. As makeup sales soared across the industry, Smashbox and M-A-C grew sharply, driven by their creativity and strong consumer demand. Our specialized luxury brands were big winners, and we acquired By Kilian. We strengthened our standing in the fastest-growing area of fragrance, the Ulta prestige tier.  Additionally, we made a minority investment in a successful Korea skincare brand, Dr. Jart+, which give us an interest in the local brand in that very influential market.
Our 2 big multi-category brands stabilized overall as they each ended the year with flat sales. However, both brands have restarted solid growth in makeup. Estée Lauder makeup sales rose in every region, led by foundations and lip products. Its long-standing Double Wear foundation continued to be a bestseller worldwide. In skincare, its innovative Advanced Night Repair powerful mask helped accelerate the sales of the ANR franchise in China and generated buzz and photos on social media. The brand's global net sales reflected strong growth in the European region and emerging market, offset by a decline in Asia Pacific, largely due to Hong Kong.
Clinique also advanced on many fronts. Its makeup sales were up sharply on a global basis, and Pep-Start Eye Cream was a top seller in several markets. Clinique created digital campaigns featuring millennial influencers that contributed to solid sales growth in the specialty multichannel and in Europe. These gains were offset by a decline in U.S. mid-tier department stores and Hong Kong.
Looking at our business geographically. Sales in emerging markets rose 15% overall and 25% excluding China. To fuel our momentum, we further emphasized our local relevance in products and social media. These past years, our brand reached many new consumers in emerging markets. Jo Malone entered Brazil, for example. We launched our first e-commerce operations in Mexico, and La Mer had a terrific growth in Russia.
Our channels' strengths reflected industry trends, and we invested in areas with the best traffic and growth. Sales in our online business rose 27%, reflecting solid gains in brands and retailer sites. We opened more sites for our brands and with retailers globally to widen our product availability. Orders and conversion grew more than 20%. 
We continue to selectively expand our brands in specialty multi-retailers globally to broaden our consumer base. For example, in North America, Estée Lauder introduced the millennial-oriented Estée Edit  collection in Sephora, while Origins launched in select Sephora stores inside JCPenney and plans to roll out to full distribution there this year.
In Europe, Smashbox continued to broaden its presence in Boots in the U.K. and entered the specialty multi-retailers like Avena Beauty in Italy.
We strengthened our capabilities, particularly in R&D, information technology, digital and consumer insights. Across our brands, creativity and innovation remained a priority. Approximately 24% of our sales came from new products, and our investment in research and development climbed in line with our sales growth.
Our global patent portfolio has increased 40% in the last 4 years, primarily in skincare and strategic areas with high consumer interest. Our newest patents covers technologies that will anchor high-quality products that we expect to have broad appeal and delight global consumers.
We also launched Leading Beauty Forward to reduce costs and free up resources to invest in the areas that will help fuel our growth, including retail, innovation, digital, social media and new consumer-facing activities. In this fast-paced environment, we want to improve our speed and flexibility as we go to market and serve global consumers in creative and contemporary ways.
In this new fiscal year, our actions fall into 2 broad areas. The first is increasing the reach of our target consumers throughout whitespace opportunities across geographic -- geographies and channels. The second is enhancing our consumer engagement with new experiences and innovative high-quality products and services, which will encompass digital marketing, disruptive in-store merchandising, compelling creativity and omnichannel offering. Our brands have numerous opportunities to attract new consumers in every region.
M-A-C is one of our largest brands but isn't as widely distributed as other brands. It has approximately 1/10 the doors of Estée Lauder and Clinique and about half the distribution of several guided [ph] global competitors. So there are millions of untapped new consumers the brand can potentially reach.
Many of our small- and medium-sized brands are now poised for global expansion. For example, in travel retail, Jo Malone today is available in less than half of tier 1 airports, so there is a lot of runway left to reach additional traveling consumers. Online, Jo Malone has e-commerce website in just 8 countries compared to 26 for Clinique. In fact, Jo Malone expects to launch e- and m-commerce in approximately 10 new markets this year.
As our consumer coverage increases, we are carefully watching same-store sales growth as well. We expect new points of distribution, same-store growth and pricing to each contribute approximately the same amount to our total sales growth this year. Freestanding stores are expected to account about 1/3 of our new distribution this year.
As our brands broaden their reach, they will emphasize fast-growing, image-building channels. In the online world, our focus is on mobile and omnichannel. Consumers expect a seamless integrated experience across channels, platforms and social media. We are implementing new technology and digital experiences, including online booking for in-store appointments, omnichannel loyalty programs and high-touch mobile services.
With sales in specialty multi-retailers on a fast track, we will increase the number of doors we are in and widen the scope of our brands in the channel to reach the consumer who shops there. For example, Clinique plans to roll out more Ulta locations and enter some Sephora stores inside JCPenney. Estée Lauder, meanwhile, will reach new shoppers with a curated selection of products in Ulta in 30 stores and on Ulta's website.
In travel retail, global passenger traffic is forecasted to grow mid-single digit. We expect our net sales to surpass traffic growth, led by many of our midsized brands that have opportunities to enter additional airports all over the world. We are working closely with department stores to bring more traffic to beauty, both in-store and online. We will elevate the consumer experience in department stores with differentiated customized services such as makeup lessons from our expert advisers, for which there is a strong demand.
Although department stores had been challenged in the U.S., they continue growing internationally, including the U.K., Western Europe, Australia, Canada or Latin America. Social media is integral to every beauty brand today and an important component in winning with millennials.
To engage consumers, our brands plan to utilize more global and local influencers, beauty consultants and makeup artists to amplify their messages. Estée Lauder is collaborating on a makeup collection with fashion designers and influencers, Victoria Beckham, and she is promoting it to her 12 million Instagram followers.
Our brands are increasing their media spending and devoting more resources to digital, which allows them to target their communications to potential new consumers with relevant messages, thanks to better data and new technologies. Approximately 30% of our total advertising spending is now digital, up 15% from last year.
Our brands are doing interesting activities in the digital space. Estée Lauder launched the interactive global content network based in New York that works like in newsroom. And Bobbi Brown held its first live video on Facebook, celebrating its 26th anniversary and a new campaign, which attracted nearly 1 million viewers.
Innovation remains paramount as our brands pursue high-growth subcategories. One area is skincare with instant benefit such as masks from some of our brands, they make skin glow. In addition, Clinique's Pep-Start HydroBlur Moisturizer hydrates and blurs skin imperfections on the spot. And Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme Plus Wake Up Balm creates instant morning radiance.
We plan to accelerate our growth in skincare. The recent launch of Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair ampoules should help drive the brand's important franchise. Clinique created a collection around Pep-Start with the addition of moisturizers and cleansers, and La Mer is rolling out a new formula of its core moisturizing line.
With new innovations and consumer engagement activities, we believe we can further strengthen our leading position in makeup. Estée Lauder is building on its Double Wear foundation with an innovative cushion stick. Clinique introduced Superbalanced Silk Makeup, an entry-price foundation with some protection. And M-A-C InstaCurl Lash Mascara has a customizable brush.
We also plan to propel our fragrance business, particularly in the Ulta prestige tier, where we have a large and desirable portfolio. Jo Malone's highly anticipated major fall launch is Basil & Neroli. And Tom Ford's newest entry in its seniors [ph] collection is Orchid Soleil.
Prestige beauty is a driving consumer area, and its growth continues to exceed mass beauty in key countries. Underlying demographic trends are positive. The middle class in emerging markets, millennials and ageless consumers have a big appetite for prestige beauty, and those populations are increasing.
We operate in an unpredictable global environment and carefully monitor ongoing issues such as the ramification of Brexit on our business. We are aware that unforeseen challenges will arise. However, we have comfort in knowing that we have many strengths that underpin our financial performance. Our diversified business is anchored by multiple engines of growth, a wealth of creativity and the ability to quickly react and adapt to events and trends, making us optimistic about our long-term success.
Over the next 3 years, we expect to generate sales growth of 6% to 8% and double-digit EPS increases in constant currency. This year, we expect to once again outpace global prestige beauty growth and gain share, despite external headwinds and challenges. In fiscal 2017, we forecast constant-currency sales growth of 6% to 7% with double-digit EPS growth.
I want to thank my executive team and every one of our employees for their hard work and passion. They are one of the key reasons we have performed so well and continue to be so confident about our future.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey."

First, I will review our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year financial results and then cover our expectations for the fiscal 2017 first quarter and full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. Additionally, the fiscal 2016 full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior year implementation of our strategic modernization initiative.
Net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.65 billion, up 7% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Incremental sales from our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 50 basis points of this growth. Our business was quite strong in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, despite macro events in France, Germany and Turkey as well as the U.K. Brexit vote.
Net sales rose 12% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in most countries, notably the U.K., Germany and most of the region's emerging markets. Our sales declined in France due to a large drop in tourism and in the Middle East because of continued economic uncertainty.
Our global travel retail channel delivered an 11% net sales increase, reflecting strong retail trends in many tourist destinations, partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong and in Brazil. Currency volatility and terrorist activity continue to affect travel and consumption patterns, and we saw a moderation in passenger traffic to Europe in the quarter.
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. Australia was a standout, growing strong double digits, while China, Korea and Japan grew mid- to high single digits. Our net sales in Hong Kong continue to decline but less than in the previous quarter.
Net sales in the Americas increased 3% in constant currency. Latin America grew more than 20%, led by Mexico and Brazil, and Canada rose mid-single digits. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits.
Our sales through both online and specialty multichannels continue to rise double digits. However, declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued weakness in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores curtailed growth.
Makeup sales again led product category growth, rising 12% in constant currency. M-A-C, Smashbox, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford achieved double-digit makeup growth, and Estée Lauder rose mid-single digits. Foundation, lip products, kits and pallets have been very popular among all consumers.
Haircare sales increased 5% in constant currency. Aveda benefited from the launch of Invati for Men products, and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in Germany and in France.
Skincare sales grew 3% in constant currency, led by growth from La Mer and Origins. These increases were partially offset by Estée Lauder and Clinique, reflecting continued weakness in U.S. mid-tier department stores as well as in Hong Kong.
Sales of fragrance products rose 2% in constant currency. Jo Malone was the largest contributor to growth as sales rose strong double digits. Our recent acquisitions, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, are growing rapidly, and By Kilian provided incremental sales.
Our gross margin was unchanged from the prior year. Favorability from pricing, lower obsolescence and supply chain savings were offset by channel mix, currency and new products.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined 10 basis points. Higher store operating costs associated with our retail store growth was offset by lower selling and shipping costs and cost savings from our SMI program. As a result, operating income rose 7%, and operating margin improved 10 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9%. 
Net earnings increased 7% to $163.1 million. Diluted EPS of $0.43 was 9% above the prior year, reflecting higher earnings and a small benefit from a lower share count and lower effective tax rate. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.01 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 11%.
Switching to our full year. Details of our performance are largely covered in the press release, so I will focus on some of the highlights. With strong net sales up 7%, our gross margin improved 10 basis points. Manufacturing favorability and lower obsolescence were partially offset by product category mix and currency.
Our full year operating margin declined 40 basis points to 15.5%. While the decrease included slight dilution from the recent acquisition of By Kilian, the decline was almost entirely driven by 50 basis points from the impact of adverse currency. We continue to benefit from our cost savings and sales growth leverage.
We ended fiscal 2016 with an effective income tax rate of 28.3%, a 200 basis point improvement from the prior year. Net interest expense rose to $55.1 million from $45.7 million in the year earlier, reflecting the increase in debt from our May 2016 bond issuances, partially offset by higher investment income.
In fiscal 2016, we realized approximately $135 million in restructuring and other charges, $54 million of it related to the transformation and modernization of our global technology infrastructure, which is largely complete, and approximately $81 million in charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiative.
Operating cash flow was $1.79 billion, representing a slight improvement over the prior year, adjusted for the SMI shift. We invested $525 million in capital projects, 2/3 of which was in consumer-facing areas such as counters, retail stores and e- and m-commerce sites.
We've repurchased 10.5 million shares of our stock for $890 million and paid $423 million in dividends to stockholders, increasing our dividend rate by 25%.
In total, we returned approximately 104% of free cash flow to stockholders, contributing to our 6.4% total stockholder return for the fiscal year, which compares with 4% for the S&P 500 for the same period.
Additionally, we invested in an acquisition and a minority interest, and we increased our balance sheet leverage by issuing $600 million in senior notes at favorable rates.
Overall, we are very pleased with the performance we delivered in fiscal 2016. Our 7% net sales growth and 13% EPS growth in constant currency are strongly aligned with our long-term goal, and we have laid the foundation for a more efficient and effective organization to leverage growth with the launch of Leading Beauty Forward.
Now looking ahead over the next few years, we plan to continue to focus on our strategic priorities with an even greater emphasis on speed and agility in the context of a rapidly evolving prestige beauty landscape. The recent Brexit vote has added a layer of uncertainty that will most likely not be fully understood for some time, and we believe the risks of other economic and political disruptions will remain high as we start our new fiscal year. Nevertheless, our strategies are sound, and as a result, over the next 3 years, we expect our business to continue to become even more balanced and diversified by product category, brand, geography and channel.
Prestige beauty is expected to grow at 4% to 5% annually for the next few years, and we remain committed to our goal of exceeding the growth of global prestige beauty by at least 1 percentage point annually. We also expect to continue to drive value from our existing cost saving programs, and we expect to begin realizing some of the initial benefits from Leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2018 and generate annualized net benefit of $200 million to $300 million upon full implementation of the program.
With the recent approvals of the first initiative under Leading Beauty Forward, we can now develop more effective organization structures to enable increasing improvements and consumer engagement for our brands as well as develop more efficient and effective processes for many of our corporate functions, including the initial organization design of a potential shared service support structure. We expect to approve further initiatives throughout the next few years. All of these efforts should permanently reduce the run rate of the areas addressed under the program and provide funds for continued investment in capabilities that more directly support the sustainability of our profitable top line growth.
It is more important than ever that we maintain the financial and operational flexibility to compete effectively in the dynamic prestige beauty industry. We must be able to nimbly allocate the appropriate amount of resources as consumer preferences, travel corridors and exchange rates continually shift. Balancing cost savings, sales leverage and reinvestment for future growth, we expect operating margin expansion of approximately 110 to 150 basis points in constant currency through fiscal 2019. We remain committed to our goal of growing EPS double digits in constant currency each year, which we have delivered consistently for the last 7 years.
Working capital improvement also continues to be a focus, and we expect improved cash-to-cash cycle performance across accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory. Over the next 3 years, we plan to free up over $400 million in additional cash, which would increase our growth in cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings growth. We are targeting inventory days to sell of approximately 150 days by the end of fiscal 2019, a marked improvement from today's levels.
Now let me focus on our outlook for the fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter. In fiscal 2017, sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency. We expect all product categories in regions to grow, led by the makeup category and the EMEA region. By channel, growth is expected to continue to be strongest in online, specialty multi, freestanding stores and travel retail.
As Fabrizio mentioned, several of our brands will accelerate their expansion in specialty multi-retailers and online, which should enable us to reach new consumers as they increasingly shop multiple channels for prestige beauty products. The impact of this activity and the cadence of our new product launches are expected to produce stronger top line growth subsequent to our first quarter.
Our estimate reflects current spot rates given the recent volatility we have experienced the last 2 years. Those spot rates are $1.12 for the euro, $1.31 for the pound and JPY 101 for the yen.
We continue to achieve cost savings from our SMI program. In fiscal 2017, we expect to generate approximately $150 million in savings, primarily from indirect procurement, A&P optimization, supply chain initiatives and selling effectiveness, some of which will be used to invest behind our newly acquired brands and omnichannel capabilities.
We anticipate our tax rate will range between 28% and 29%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to take restructuring and other charges of $80 million to $100 million, with about $35 million to $45 million in the first quarter. We expect to update these estimates when additional initiatives are approved. And as a reminder, total program costs beyond fiscal 2017 over multiple years are anticipated to be in the $500 million to $600 million range.
In fiscal 2017, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $1.8 billion, relatively flat with last year, with the inclusion of the impact of Leading Beauty Forward. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $550 million or 4.5% to 5% of sales.
With respect to our capital structure, we have room to grow our dividend while maintaining a sustainable payout ratio. And as of June 30, we had approximately 18 million shares remaining in our buyback authorization. We will continue to assess the need for greater leverage to support our strategies, including shareholder returns.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales to rise approximately 2% to 3% in constant currency. Translation could hinder growth by approximately 1 percentage point. We expect our small to midsized brands to continue to be strong contributors in many global markets, owing to their increasing appeal with multiple consumer groups across various channels. We also expect continued growth to be generated in many developed and emerging markets, particularly in Europe. Partially offsetting these growth drivers in the quarter are some macro issues that we expect to impact our results.
Our U.S. business continues to be affected by low traffic in mid-tier department stores and tourist-driven doors. And we are facing a difficult comparison to the prior year quarter, which was our strongest quarter in the U.S. when Estée Lauder and Clinique launched major skincare products and M-A-C had exceptionally strong results. Our cadence of product launches reflects smaller programs for all 3 in this year's first quarter.
The Middle East is projected to decline as distributors adjust inventory levels to reflect sluggish consumer spending. And we are experiencing weak sales in France as the threat of terrorism curtails travel and domestic spending in the near term.
For the first quarter, our EPS forecast is between $0.73 and $0.77 before restructuring charges. The adverse currency translation on sales for the first quarter equates to about $0.03 of EPS.
And as a reminder, the size and quarterly cadence of our new product launches and our programs changes from year-to-year. We continue to focus on delivering annual results in our overall long-term sales and profit growth plans.
We look forward to another successful year ahead for our company and for our brands. We are fortunate to operate in one of the highest-demand consumer categories today. Our brands are among the most desirable in the industry, and we believe our team is the most talented in the industry with their incredible creativity, passion for the business and depth of knowledge on what products consumers aspire to have. This winning formula continues to support our confidence in our plan despite a volatile political, economic and currency environment.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

As I indicated, we still do have our cost savings programs to offset a lot of the unfavorability that we're experiencing, and we continue to work on other initiatives to improve the margin. On fragrance, one of the things that we've spoken about, Jason, in the past is some of our fragrance brands that have higher margin characteristics. So Jo Malone is a very profitable fragrance brand for us.

We will start to see savings in fiscal '18, more in fiscal '19, and beyond fiscal '19 is when we expect to achieve those run rate savings of net $200 million to $300 million."

Now where they travel, you are absolutely right, less of them travel to Hong Kong, and more of them travel to different destination internationally. But it's also true that there is an enormous increase of travel within China, and we are very well positioned. We have -- as you know, there are duty-free areas within China where we are very strong, for example, Hainan islands, that are increasing and there is more people traveling there. On top of that, the fact that consumers travel touristically within the country offer us the possibility of continue building distribution in 3rd-tier and 4-tier cities where we are enjoying this internal travel, which obviously in this case is not duty free. So both are true, continued increase of external travel and increase of internal travel, and we are capturing to both opportunities. As far as Korea is concerned, we are doing very well in Korea. We are growing. For the year, we've been growing more than the market. So we've built market share, and we continue to see very strong growth also in the Seoul airport. And so the Korea trend in fiscal year '16 has been very, very strong. And we expect the Korea market to continue to have a strong influence on Asia in general and that the Korea consumers continue to be high demanding consumers that we use also to -- as a benchmark for the kind of new ideas and new products that we've got to launch in Asia or globally."

First of all, we agree, it's not about buying small brands. That's not a strategy.

That was the acquisition strategy there. It's not about small brands or big brands. It was about building the most amazing portfolio of artisanal fragrance brands, and we have done this. So you are also right that there is a growing makeup business around the world. We already have an amazing portfolio that some of our competitors didn't have. So we have M-A-C, Bobbi Brown, Smashbox. By the way, Smashbox was the first acquisition that we have done. It was exactly makeup, so, but we agree with you that the future we'll  see opportunities to continue growing in makeup and there will be opportunities for more makeup brands in our portfolio. And in terms of skin care, we purchased GLAMGLOW, which is a skincare brand. And it's a skin care brand, although small, but it's a skin care brand in our opinion with great potential to grow it to become big and also it's focused exactly on the new skin care trend, so instant benefits like masks and specialty multichannel dynamics. And finally, we purchased a minority interest, is one of the fastest-growing skin care brands in Korea today, which is Dr. Jart+, which was exactly the strategy. So I believe that the point is the strategy is not about fragrances or small brands. The strategy is about acquiring brands that fills strategic opportunities in our portfolio and this will continue to be the strategy."

The competitiveness of the U.S. market in makeup has definitely increased. And in fact, we see the need of increasing the competitiveness in the makeup also activity of M-A-C in the U.S. but for example, we saw the same opportunity on those in Clinique a year ago. And I just want to repeat that in the last 12 months, Lauder and Clinique makeup in the U.S. grew double digits showing that when we focus on a specific market and specific area, we can get the results. So yes, but there is an opportunity there and we are very focused on it."

The -- so the building blocks of fiscal year '17, and it is the best way I can address your question, the building block is that the first building block is pricing. And as I said, out of the 6%, 7%, about 2 points will be pricing. A lot of the price increases of the year happened in January, and so already this 2% of pricing is cued toward more -- the second part of the year. Then think of the distribution. So the second 2% of increase of the year is greater distribution reaching new consumers around the world. Now many of these new distribution, including the one in specialty that you just mentioned, are going to happen after October. Many of the free-standing stores in Europe that we target the majority of the free-standing stores we are going to open, will happen in the period. And many of the new specialty multi doors in the U.S. will happen after October. So that's the second different. That's second positive, which is going to happen more skewed ahead in the fiscal year versus the first quarter. The third -- the point is the -- as I said before to the previous question, we have a very solid new fragrance portfolio in the high end. Now this fragrance portfolio, as you know, tend to have a huge opportunity to grow during holiday periods. And so all the holiday periods, they're not only Christmas but also Valentine, Mother Day happen to be after the October, and this will be another big acceleration element which is later in the fiscal year. Then we have all our innovation program, as Tracey said in her prepared remarks, our innovation schedule changed in the year. We have less blockbuster initiative this year because we believe the consumer and the social media environment, which is developing, need more diffusion of newness versus blockbuster approach. So a lot of the innovation is more skewed as of October. In our portfolio, this is the other building block on same door that will impact the same door 2%, 3% of progress that we see in the year. Then as I said, Estée Lauder and Clinique are on an improvement trends, and we expect Estée Lauder Clinique to continue to improve and M-A-C U.S. is expected to continue to improve in the second part of the year. And so all these factors will improve the comp part of the fiscal year. So a lot of good steps that we believe will, over the year, accelerate. The last thing I want to say of that is that we have proven just the year with fiscal year '16 that finished, we grew 2 of the quarters more than 8% and another quarter is 5%. So we have proven that we have the capability and the potential to grow 8% plus in the quarters where all the key elements of our building blocks start acting together."

We don't plan to distribute in any area where prestige or luxury is not well presented and we do not plan to distribute anywhere where the service quality will not be for the level of prestige. So we continue to be completely focused on luxury prestige distribution. That means great environment, the right target consumer, the right service level. However, the world is evolving, the world is changing. There are many new opportunities online, specialty, travel retail, freestanding stores and obviously some very promising new activities also in the department store world. And we are focusing on all of them and wherever there is growth or prestige consumers. So that's really the strategy. What you see in the specific examples we are sharing are the median excepts, but these are median excepts of the long-term strategy.

We opened a little over 170 of those stores in the full year. We also opened third-party stores as well in the year, and as Fabrizio indicated, of our total distribution growth, that's about 1/3 of the growth of that 2% distribution is freestanding stores.

So when you see the disproportionate growth of makeup, which is happening in the industry and certainly we're both driving and benefiting from and the slowdown that we've seen in skincare, it does have a mixed impact. So that is a piece of it. The other pieces that -- Hong Kong is a quite profitable area of the world for us from a sales perspective, sales and profit perspective, in that region. And the double-digit declines that we've seen in Hong Kong have also had an impact. So there's a geographic impact. The Middle East would be the same. So there's a geographic impact and then there's a category impact from a mix standpoint that we have experienced.

So I justify [ph] which it really is, understanding risks on the table and the macro environment [indiscernible] that 8 to 12 -- 8 to 10 versus double digit is 2 different things. The second thing is around cost savings. I believe for fiscal '16, you've started the year expecting $200 million of SMI-related savings. You lowered that to $175 million for the year, I think, back in May. And then as you look into fiscal '17, you're talking about $150 million. So it feels like some of those expected savings aren't achievable for some reason, some things changed because I would have thought maybe it was a delay in timing but something with SMI, it just feels like perhaps the savings are not quite what had been anticipated even 12 months ago."

And so that's what 8% to 10% means, but let's not take anything away from our commitment to do all what we can to deliver the double-digit, meaning to 10. And so that's simply the way we see that. And then Tracey, you want to add to that?"

At some point, as you start to go further and deeper on some of these initiatives there's going to be less opportunity. Clearly, when we initiated the second phase of our savings program, we went after the biggest opportunities first and then you start to see that weighing down, hence the reason why we announced Leading Beauty Forward, which certainly will generate more savings in future years as the SMI savings start to narrow a bit. So I think we're right on track with respect to where we expect to be in terms of SMI savings, and we certainly will always strive. We have a very competitive team so we always strive to exceed what we -- what our targets are."

One is still in your 2017 guidance, your 6% to 7% constant currency, 8% to 10% on the bottom line. I guess, I'm still not convinced that the margins you're projecting are flat because of currencies and maybe just to help me with that confusion because it looks like it's less than 1% of impact on your top line for the year. You talked about $0.08 on the EPS line, but that's like 2.5% of EPS, and it's such a very large multiplier much bigger than we would have expected. So trying to get a sense of why that's the case. And even that, by the way, doesn't explain the margin structure being flat given all the cost cutting that you're doing, the good cost cutting that you're doing. That's question 1. The other one is I do want to go back to the question in terms of distribution expansion into Sephora and that's more in JCPenney, into Ulta with Estée Lauder, which I think we would have said 10 years ago, if Ulta had existed it would have been crazy, Jo Malone pushing more. I mean, we've seen a lot of not the same but analogous issues. I mean, just recently Coach, as an example said, ""Look, we're pulling back from department stores."" Again slightly different issue because they're discounting a lot but we've heard this before from Tommy, Burberry, Ralph Lauren as Tracey knows very well. And you look at this a lot, guys I want to get a sense of how you're looking at it, what your -- I appreciate your thoughts on this because there is a concern that at some point you're going to get rid of the scarcity. At some point, you're going to massify the brands, which drives the brand erosion and you kind of lose it a little bit, that prestige. So given some of the analogies, can you explain kind of long term how much longer do you have before you start hurting the brand?"

So let me start with your questions with respect to margin. So currency is another big impact and we gave you the spot rates that we're using, which, again, certainly could change during the course of the year but rather than us predicting how that will change, we're using current spot rates and that definitely has at least 30 basis point impact on our margin for the year. In addition to that, we did talk about the fact that some of our very high profit margin regions are actually showing either slower growth or declines in the case of Hong Kong as we mentioned. The Middle East slowed quite a bit. U.K. is a bit softer than what we certainly have experienced over the last couple of years. So those are all impacting. If nothing changed with respect to either our category mix or geographic mix, then you would be absolutely spot on, but those are things that we're managing as well. So our cost savings programs not only help us to expand the margin but they have helped and fund some of our investment, but they've also helped us because of the programs that we put in place a few years ago and are continuing to deliver on are helping us to offset the negative impact of some of the macro situations that we're experiencing right now."

And on distribution, Ali, my point is we vet every single decision starting with a consumer point of view. So we are not distributing our brands anywhere where the consumer doesn't demand them and the consumer is the target consumer. The distribution decision we are taking are always brand building, meaning, there are consumers that are on target, particularly millennial, that we would not be able to reach without proposing the brand in that areas. And that's what is happening around the world, particularly the millennial consumer are changing their shopping habits. The brands that do not evolve their shopping habits to reach this consumer will basically actually lose structure with the new luxury consumer rather than risk their image. And so it's an evolution and it's driven mainly by the habits of the millennial consumer, also it's very different by category. This is happening very aggressively in makeup, for example, and the way the millennial consumer in makeup is happening also around the world. And a lot of this is about online and the availability of the brands online. So second thing is not the image of the distribution but is the -- we call it consumer reach. So the way we look at it, because again that's your question, we don't look at it like only the image. We look at it, do we reach the right consumers. So its analysis start from target consumer reach. And in fact, that's what we have used as language in our prepared remark, coverage, reach rather than expanded distribution. Then when you look it in terms of number of doors, that's actually -- there are a lot of closures. There are a lot of stores which are being closed and not only in the U.S. around the world. So in terms of a number of stores, this is not necessarily an increase availability, so it's putting the brands where the consumer expect them at a certain moment of the progress. [ph] Last thing I want to say is that you mentioned Estée Lauder and Clinique, which are today within prestige broadly distributed brands. But keep in mind that all the rest of our portfolio is actually an enormous amount of extra distribution opportunity, meaning our brands have not even started being available to the right level of consumer around the world. So a lot of our distribution expansion is not about Lauder and Clinique, it's about bringing the rest of our portfolio to available to the right target consumer around the world, and numerically, internal sales and profit, that's where the biggest opportunity us."

And they always know these things before and we have very, very honest discussions about what's needed for the brand. Sometimes a new distribution decision actually help sales for the brand in the total country, including in the retailers where the brands was previously distributed. And by the way, our brands very rarely are exclusive to a retailer. They are targeting certain group of consumer, that's clear. For example, Macy's, as you know, has announced to close 100 doors. We are collaborating we will collaborate with Macy's to protect the consumption of our brands in these doors, transfer it to other Macy's doors consumers. We will do our best to support Macy's in this plan, which we believe they're doing the right thing. We will focus a lot to support Macy's in selling more in the remaining doors that they will focus on as well as we'll continue to support Macy's in building the best we can their online business that we have together. So also our retailers decide to close doors or 2 other things, and we collaborate with them in keeping the sales, continue increasing the sales. So it's not about one or the other. If we focus on the client, on the final customer, we get always the right decision made and there are normally win-win for the brands, for our retail partners and for the consumers. That's what we are looking. That's our principle. As far as your question in term of, if I understood correctly, in terms of internal, I think we just have our normal processes.

So it's actually easier for us to capture it in stores as well as online. We certainly do, our teams look at that information. Our brands look at that information and understand what trends are selling in freestanding stores and whether or not that mirrors or not What is selling in, in department stores and put plans together accordingly. And those are all areas that we -- as we expand distribution, as consumers continue to shop in multiple points of distribution, we continue to aggregate that information and look at whether or not there are any differential trends that the entire business can benefit from in terms of our strategies and how we allocate resources."

And I probably should have mentioned this as well when Ali asked his question on margin. Depending on our innovation in a particular year, in some cases, we actually choose to launch some innovation that actually has lower gross margin because that we've identified a consumer need in that particular space and believe that, that product will drive incremental sales and we'll build to be a large franchise, particularly for franchises like Estée Lauder and Clinique and particularly in skin care. So we have seen, in recent years, some new innovation that actually is a bit of a lower gross profit margin. Clearly, as sales continue to build on products that we launched that are new, you're amortizing the tooling and you're getting some more favorability in terms of gross profit margin. But largely, they stay relatively close to where they're at unless there's a significant increase in volume, in which case you can get lower cost of goods, so, but we do manage. And our teams, when you think about the number of brands that we have and the number of new product launches that we have where we have had, to Fabrizio's earlier comment, steady increase in the amount of innovation, our teams manage that gross margin mix quite tightly in terms of making sure that we -- in the new innovation, at least over the -- over a few years is offset by innovation that also is more margin accretive."

And yes, there is obviously the impact of the first 44, 45 doors that we have closed before in fiscal year '16 in the first quarter. But to your core question for the long term, we definitely are focused to support our department store partners to improve -- to continue to improve the experience on our brands and in general in the beauty floor of department store. We have many activities in this area, many in the area of improved services, many in the activity of innovation and distortion, many in the area of connecting social media to the activities and activity in the area of sampling. In other words, we are really focused in working together how to increase traffic in-store, which is in this moment, the key opportunity. And then to your second question is what do we see in this moment. Yes, we see a lower traffic than what we would like to see in our counters in mid-tier department stores, and that's what you see in our quarter 1 estimate as well.

And so there has been a significant improvement or trend. We said they would have started from turn around in the makeup area of both brands because it was the area that was better fitting than other goal, which was to attract more millennials to the brands. And we have done it. In the U.S., Lauder Clinique makeup is growing double digit, which frankly was declining just a year ago and this is an impressive improvement and also globally, both brands are growing their makeup in a very strong way. Now the skin care also did some progress as we explained in the prepared remarks. However, on the skin care, the 2 key issues, which is Hong Kong continues decline and the media department store traffic issue that we just discussed in the last half an hour. Those 2 have been a drag to accelerate as well the skin care part, which now we will do our best to do in fiscal year '17. So good progress on both brands with an excellent start in makeup and some more work to do in skin care. Last point is to your question, is that what we forecasted. Frankly, we have done in line or slightly better than what we expected, but we did not forecast Hong Kong to continue to decline in the way it has declined, and we did not anticipate the kind of traffic reduction in mid-tier department store that we have seen in the course of the area.

There are 2 dynamics which are happening, which we believe are for the long term. The first one is the Asian consumer is using makeup more and more. So the dynamic of skin care versus makeup a global level. The strength of skin care was driven by the fact that the fastest growing demand was coming from Asia, and Asia consume and use much more skin care than makeup. I think this will continue. So nothing wrong with the skincare trend but the makeup trend in Asia is dramatically accelerated because the billion of Asian consumers are using makeup more and more. This is a very strong long-term trend. The second is the millennial generation. We -- the data shows that the average millennial use more makeup in more occasions during the week than their mothers. So the more the millennial generation grows in percentage of the total population, the more makeup usage will continue to accelerate. So those 2 trends are long term. However, it doesn't mean the skincare needs to continue being -- growing less. Actually we see in already the first signs that as soon as the millennial will discover also more of the skin care routine, this can impact the skin care. For example, our new brands like GLAMGLOW, which are more focused on millennials and they are more based on instant benefit skin cares, which are more important for millennials, have seen amazing growth when they do a good product launch. So I personally believe also skin care will accelerate in the future driven by positive trends."

Our company had a very successful year in fiscal 2016.

Our company had a very successful year in fiscal 2016. We delivered excellent financial results with adjusted constant currency net sales growth exceeding 7%, faster than global prestige beauty growth, and adjusted earnings per share rose 13%.
We also made progress on our strategic objectives by further diversifying our business, strengthening our multiple engines of growth and advancing our creativity and innovation. These new products represented nearly 1/4 of our sales, an all-time high. Additionally, we designed and launched Leading Beauty Forward, a multiyear initiative to increase our efficiency, speed to market and agility.
Our strong performance confirmed our resiliency during a volatile fiscal period that began with MERS in Korea and ended with Brexit in the U.K. In between, we experienced sharp currency fluctuations, disruptive geopolitical events, including increased terrorism and slowing economies in some of our key markets.
In global prestige beauty, we also faced tougher competition and changing consumer behavior. Nonetheless, we successfully navigated these new challenges by also strengthening the company's fundamentals, making us confident we can sustain our strong and profitable growth and achieve our long-term goals.
Our best growth came from our makeup categories, especially M-A-C, our luxury brands, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and the online and specialty multichannels. Our ability to grow so strongly in such a dynamic landscape is a testament to our more balanced and better-diversified business and strategic ability to identify and anticipate changing consumers and industry trends. That is what defines and distinguish our company.
Another of our key attributes is our increasing agility. During the year, we saw a variety of markets impacted by unexpected economic, political and social events. During those times, we made sure our resources were aligned with other areas having better growth potential.
Another key strength is our multiple engines of growth throughout our more than 25 brands that span categories, channels and countries. This allowed us to achieve double-digit growth in some brands, channels or market, while balancing slower growth in other areas. For example, continued political unrest in Hong Kong caused a sharp drop in Chinese tourists, who traveled to other countries instead. Our brands quickly responded by increasing the range of products appealing to Chinese consumers in key tourist doors in the markets they visited across Asia and Europe.
Fiscal year 2016 was also marked by rapid changes in global prestige beauty. Thanks to our 10-year compass, we had anticipated many of the trends, and we're well positioned to meet consumer's changing desires and shopping habits. For instance, we have increasingly invested in digital marketing and e-commerce, which was our fastest-growing channel this past year. Our global e- and m-commerce sales surpassed $1 billion for the first time, a milestone we are very proud of. And we expect our strong online growth to continue.
We made progress on our strategy as we strengthened many of our brands and diversified our portfolio. Our compass pointed to the growing interest among millennials for more specialized brands, so we nurtured the ones in our portfolio into significant competitors. Several of them, including Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Smashbox, M-A-C, La Mer, powered much of our growth and gained share. As makeup sales soared across the industry, Smashbox and M-A-C grew sharply, driven by their creativity and strong consumer demand. Our specialized luxury brands were big winners, and we acquired By Kilian. We strengthened our standing in the fastest-growing area of fragrance, the Ulta prestige tier.  Additionally, we made a minority investment in a successful Korea skincare brand, Dr. Jart+, which give us an interest in a local brand in that very influential market.
Our 2 big multi-category brands stabilized overall as they each ended the year with flat sales. However, both brands have restarted solid growth in makeup. Estée Lauder makeup sales rose in every region, led by foundations and lip products. Its long-standing Double Wear foundation continued to be a bestseller worldwide. In skincare, its innovative Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask helped accelerate the sales of the ANR franchise in China and generated buzz and photos on social media. The brand's global net sales reflected strong growth in the European region and emerging market, offset by a decline in Asia Pacific, largely due to Hong Kong.
Clinique also advanced on many fronts. Its makeup sales were up sharply on a global basis, and Pep-Start Eye Cream was a top seller in several markets. Clinique created digital campaigns featuring millennial influencers that contributed to solid sales growth in the specialty multichannel and in Europe. These gains were offset by a decline in U.S. mid-tier department stores and Hong Kong.
Looking at our business geographically. Sales in emerging markets rose 15% overall and 25% excluding China. To fuel our momentum, we further emphasized our local relevance in products and social media. These past years, our brand reached many new consumers in emerging markets. Jo Malone entered Brazil, for example. We launched our first e-commerce operations in Mexico, and La Mer had a terrific growth in Russia.
Our channels' strengths reflected industry trends, and we invested in areas with the best traffic and growth. Sales in our online business rose 27%, reflecting solid gains in brands and retailer sites. We opened more sites for our brands and with retailers globally to widen our product availability. Orders and conversion grew more than 20%. 
We continue to selectively expand our brands in specialty multi-retailers globally to broaden our consumer base. For example, in North America, Estée Lauder introduced the millennial-oriented Estée Edit collection in Sephora, while Origins launched in select Sephora stores inside JCPenney and plans to roll out to full distribution there this year.
In Europe, Smashbox continued to broaden its presence in Boots in the U.K. and entered the specialty multi-retailers like Avena Beauty in Italy.
We strengthened our capabilities, particularly in R&D, information technology, digital and consumer insights. Across our brands, creativity and innovation remained a priority. Approximately 24% of our sales came from new products, and our investment in research and development climbed in line with our sales growth.
Our global patent portfolio has increased 40% in the last 4 years, primarily in skincare and strategic areas with high consumer interest. Our newest patents covers technologies that will anchor high-quality products that we expect to have broad appeal and delight global consumers.
We also launched Leading Beauty Forward to reduce costs and free up resources to invest in the areas that will help fuel our growth, including retail, innovation, digital, social media and new consumer-facing activities. In this fast-paced environment, we want to improve our speed and flexibility as we go to market and serve global consumers in creative and contemporary ways.
In this new fiscal year, our actions fall into 2 broad areas. The first is increasing the reach of our target consumers throughout whitespace opportunities across geographic -- geographies and channels. The second is enhancing our consumer engagement with new experiences and innovative high-quality products and services, which will encompass digital marketing, disruptive in-store merchandising, compelling creativity and omnichannel offering. Our brands have numerous opportunities to attract new consumers in every region.
M-A-C is one of our largest brands but isn't as widely distributed as other brands. It has approximately 1/10 the doors of Estée Lauder and Clinique and about half the distribution of several guided [ph] global competitors. So there are millions of untapped new consumers the brand can potentially reach.
Many of our small- and medium-sized brands are now poised for global expansion. For example, in travel retail, Jo Malone today is available in less than half of tier 1 airports, so there is a lot of runway left to reach additional traveling consumers. Online, Jo Malone has e-commerce website in just 8 countries compared to 26 for Clinique. In fact, Jo Malone expects to launch e- and m-commerce in approximately 10 new markets this year.
As our consumer coverage increases, we are carefully watching same-store sales growth as well. We expect new points of distribution, same-store growth and pricing to each contribute approximately the same amount to our total sales growth this year. Freestanding stores are expected to account about 1/3 of our new distribution this year.
As our brands broaden their reach, they will emphasize fast-growing, image-building channels. In the online world, our focus is on mobile and omnichannel. Consumers expect a seamless integrated experience across channels, platforms and social media. We are implementing new technology and digital experiences, including online booking for in-store appointments, omnichannel loyalty programs and high-touch mobile services.
With sales in specialty multi-retailers on a fast track, we will increase the number of doors we are in and widen the scope of our brands in the channel to reach the consumer who shops there. For example, Clinique plans to roll out more Ulta locations and enter some Sephora stores inside JCPenney. Estée Lauder, meanwhile, will reach new shoppers with a curated selection of products in Ulta in 30 stores and on Ulta's website.
In travel retail, global passenger traffic is forecasted to grow mid-single digit. We expect our net sales to surpass traffic growth, led by many of our midsized brands that have opportunities to enter additional airports all over the world. We are working closely with department stores to bring more traffic to beauty, both in-store and online. We will elevate the consumer experience in department stores with differentiated customized services such as makeup lessons from our expert advisers, for which there is a strong demand.
Although department stores had been challenged in the U.S., they continue growing internationally, including the U.K., Western Europe, Australia, Canada or Latin America. Social media is integral to every beauty brand today and an important component in winning with millennials.
To engage consumers, our brands plan to utilize more global and local influencers, beauty consultants and makeup artists to amplify their messages. Estée Lauder is collaborating on a makeup collection with fashion designer and influencer, Victoria Beckham, and she is promoting it to her 12 million Instagram followers.
Our brands are increasing their media spending and devoting more resources to digital, which allows them to target their communications to potential new consumers with relevant messages, thanks to better data and new technologies. Approximately 30% of our total advertising spending is now digital, up 15% from last year.
Our brands are doing interesting activities in the digital space. Estée Lauder launched the interactive global content network based in New York that works like a newsroom. And Bobbi Brown held its first live video on Facebook, celebrating its 26th anniversary and a new campaign, which attracted nearly 1 million viewers.
Innovation remains paramount as our brands pursue high-growth subcategories. One area is skincare with instant benefit such as masks from some of our brands that make skin glow. In addition, Clinique's Pep-Start HydroBlur Moisturizer hydrates [ph] and blurs skin imperfections on the spot. And Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme Plus Wake Up Balm creates instant morning radiance.
We plan to accelerate our growth in skincare. The recent launch of Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair ampoules should help drive the brand's important franchise. Clinique created a collection around Pep-Start with the addition of moisturizers and cleansers, and La Mer is rolling out a new formula of its core moisturizing line.
With new innovations and consumer engagement activities, we believe we can further strengthen our leading position in makeup. Estée Lauder is building on its Double Wear foundation with an innovative cushion stick. Clinique introduced Superbalanced Silk Makeup, an entry-price foundation with some protection. And M-A-C InstaCurl Lash Mascara has a customizable brush.
We also plan to propel our fragrance business, particularly in the Ulta prestige tier, where we have a large and desirable portfolio. Jo Malone's highly anticipated major fall launch is Basil & Neroli. And Tom Ford's newest entry in its Signature collection is Orchid Soleil.
Prestige beauty is a driving consumer area, and its growth continues to exceed mass beauty in key countries. Underlying demographic trends are positive. The middle class in emerging markets, millennials and ageless consumers have a big appetite for prestige beauty, and those populations are increasing.
We operate in an unpredictable global environment and carefully monitor ongoing issues such as the ramification of Brexit on our business. We are aware that unforeseen challenges will arise. However, we have comfort in knowing that we have many strengths that underpin our financial performance. Our diversified business is anchored by multiple engines of growth, a wealth of creativity and the ability to quickly react and adapt to events and trends, making us optimistic about our long-term success.
Over the next 3 years, we expect to generate sales growth of 6% to 8% and double-digit EPS increases in constant currency. This year, we expect to once again outpace global prestige beauty growth and gain share, despite external headwinds and challenges. In fiscal 2017, we forecast constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% with double-digit EPS growth.
I want to thank my executive team and every one of our employees for their hard work and passion. They are one of the key reasons we have performed so well and continue to be so confident about our future.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey."

First, I will review our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year financial results and then cover our expectations for the fiscal 2017 first quarter and full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. Additionally, the fiscal 2016 full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior year implementation of our strategic modernization initiative.
Net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.65 billion, up 7% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Incremental sales from our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 50 basis points of this growth. Our business was quite strong in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, despite macro events in France, Germany and Turkey as well as the U.K. Brexit vote.
Net sales rose 12% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in most countries, notably the U.K., Germany and most of the region's emerging markets. Our sales declined in France due to a large drop in tourism, and in the Middle East because of continued economic uncertainty.
Our global travel retail channel delivered an 11% net sales increase, reflecting strong retail trends in many tourist destinations, partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong and in Brazil. Currency volatility and terrorist activity continue to affect travel and consumption patterns, and we saw a moderation in passenger traffic to Europe in the quarter.
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. Australia was a standout, growing strong double digits, while China, Korea and Japan grew mid- to high single digits. Our net sales in Hong Kong continue to decline but less than in the previous quarter.
Net sales in the Americas increased 3% in constant currency. Latin America grew more than 20%, led by Mexico and Brazil, and Canada rose mid-single digits. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits.
Our sales through both online and specialty multichannels continue to rise double digits. However, declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued weakness in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores curtailed growth.
Makeup sales again led product category growth, rising 12% in constant currency. M-A-C, Smashbox, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford achieved double-digit makeup growth, and Estée Lauder rose mid-single digits. Foundation, lip products, kits and palettes have been very popular among all consumers.
Haircare sales increased 5% in constant currency. Aveda benefited from the launch of Invati for Men products, and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in Germany and in France.
Skincare sales grew 3% in constant currency, led by growth from La Mer and Origins. These increases were partially offset by Estée Lauder and Clinique, reflecting continued weakness in U.S. mid-tier department stores as well as in Hong Kong.
Sales of fragrance products rose 2% in constant currency. Jo Malone was the largest contributor to growth as sales rose strong double digits. Our recent acquisitions, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, are growing rapidly, and By Kilian provided incremental sales.
Our gross margin was unchanged from the prior year. Favorability from pricing, lower obsolescence and supply chain savings were offset by channel mix, currency and new products.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined 10 basis points. Higher store operating costs associated with our retail store growth was offset by lower selling and shipping costs and cost savings from our SMI program. As a result, operating income rose 7%, and operating margin improved 10 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9%. 
Net earnings increased 7% to $163.1 million. Diluted EPS of $0.43 was 9% above the prior year, reflecting higher earnings and a small benefit from a lower share count and a lower effective tax rate. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.01 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 11%.
Switching to our full year. Details of our performance are largely covered in the press release, so I will focus on some of the highlights. With strong net sales up 7%, our gross margin improved 10 basis points. Manufacturing favorability and lower obsolescence were partially offset by product category mix and currency.
Our full year operating margin declined 40 basis points to 15.5%. While the decrease included slight dilution from the recent acquisition of By Kilian, the decline was almost entirely driven by 50 basis points from the impact of adverse currency. We continue to benefit from our cost savings and sales growth leverage.
We ended fiscal 2016 with an effective income tax rate of 28.3%, a 200 basis point improvement from the prior year. Net interest expense rose to $55.1 million from $45.7 million in the year earlier, reflecting the increase in debt from our May 2016 bond issuances, partially offset by higher investment income.
In fiscal 2016, we realized approximately $135 million in restructuring and other charges, $54 million of it related to the transformation and modernization of our global technology infrastructure, which is largely complete, and approximately $81 million in charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiative.
Operating cash flow was $1.79 billion, representing a slight improvement over the prior year, adjusted for the SMI shift. We invested $525 million in capital projects, 2/3 of which was in consumer-facing areas such as counters, retail stores and e- and m-commerce sites.
We've repurchased 10.5 million shares of our stock for $890 million and paid $423 million in dividends to stockholders, increasing our dividend rate by 25%.
In total, we returned approximately 104% of free cash flow to stockholders, contributing to our 6.4% total stockholder return for the fiscal year, which compares with 4% for the S&P 500 for the same period.
Additionally, we invested in an acquisition and a minority interest, and we increased our balance sheet leverage by issuing $600 million in senior notes at favorable rates.
Overall, we are very pleased with the performance we delivered in fiscal 2016. Our 7% net sales growth and 13% EPS growth in constant currency are strongly aligned with our long-term goals, and we have laid the foundation for a more efficient and effective organization to leverage growth with the launch of Leading Beauty Forward.
Now looking ahead over the next few years, we plan to continue to focus on our strategic priorities with an even greater emphasis on speed and agility in the context of a rapidly evolving prestige beauty landscape. The recent Brexit vote has added a layer of uncertainty that will most likely not be fully understood for some time, and we believe the risks of other economic and political disruptions will remain high as we start our new fiscal year. Nevertheless, our strategies are sound, and as a result, over the next 3 years, we expect our business to continue to become even more balanced and diversified by product category, brand, geography and channel.
Prestige beauty is expected to grow at 4% to 5% annually for the next few years, and we remain committed to our goal of exceeding the growth of global prestige beauty by at least 1 percentage point annually. We also expect to continue to drive value from our existing cost saving programs, and we expect to begin realizing some of the initial benefits from Leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2018 and generate annualized net benefit of $200 million to $300 million upon full implementation of the program.
With the recent approvals of the first initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward, we can now develop more effective organization structures to enable increasing improvements and consumer engagement for our brands as well as develop more efficient and effective processes for many of our corporate functions, including the initial organization design of a potential shared service support structure. We expect to approve further initiatives throughout the next few years. All of these efforts should permanently reduce the run rate of the areas addressed under the program and provide funds for continued investment in capabilities that more directly support the sustainability of our profitable top line growth.
It is more important than ever that we maintain the financial and operational flexibility to compete effectively in the dynamic prestige beauty industry. We must be able to nimbly allocate the appropriate amount of resources as consumer preferences, travel corridors and exchange rates continually shift. Balancing cost savings, sales leverage and reinvestment for future growth, we expect operating margin expansion of approximately 110 to 150 basis points in constant currency through fiscal 2019. We remain committed to our goal of growing EPS double digits in constant currency each year, which we have delivered consistently for the last 7 years.
Working capital improvement also continues to be a focus, and we expect improved cash-to-cash cycle performance across accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory. Over the next 3 years, we plan to free up over $400 million in additional cash, which would increase our growth in cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings growth. We are targeting inventory days to sell of approximately 150 days by the end of fiscal 2019, a marked improvement from today's levels.
Now let me focus on our outlook for the fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter. In fiscal 2017, sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency. We expect all product categories and regions to grow, led by the makeup category and the EMEA region. By channel, growth is expected to continue to be strongest in online, specialty multi, freestanding stores and travel retail.
As Fabrizio mentioned, several of our brands will accelerate their expansion in specialty multi-retailers and online, which should enable us to reach new consumers as they increasingly shop multiple channels for prestige beauty products. The impact of this activity and the cadence of our new product launches are expected to produce stronger top line growth subsequent to our first quarter.
Our estimate reflects current spot rates given the recent volatility we have experienced the last 2 years. Those spot rates are $1.12 for the euro, $1.31 for the pound and JPY 101 for the yen.
We continue to achieve cost savings from our SMI program. In fiscal 2017, we expect to generate approximately $150 million in savings, primarily from indirect procurement, A&P optimization, supply chain initiatives and selling effectiveness, some of which will be used to invest behind our newly acquired brands and omnichannel capabilities.
We anticipate our tax rate will range between 28% and 29%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to take restructuring and other charges of $80 million to $100 million, with about $35 million to $45 million in the first quarter. We expect to update these estimates when additional initiatives are approved. And as a reminder, total program costs beyond fiscal 2017 over multiple years are anticipated to be in the $500 million to $600 million range.
In fiscal 2017, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $1.8 billion, relatively flat with last year, with the inclusion of the impact of Leading Beauty Forward. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $550 million or 4.5% to 5% of sales.
With respect to our capital structure, we have room to grow our dividend while maintaining a sustainable payout ratio. And as of June 30, we had approximately 18 million shares remaining in our buyback authorization. We will continue to assess the need for greater leverage to support our strategies, including shareholder returns.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales to rise approximately 2% to 3% in constant currency. Translation could hinder growth by approximately 1 percentage point. We expect our small to midsized brands to continue to be strong contributors in many global markets, owing to their increasing appeal with multiple consumer groups across various channels. We also expect continued growth to be generated in many developed and emerging markets, particularly in Europe. Partially offsetting these growth drivers in the quarter are some macro issues that we expect to impact our results.
Our U.S. business continues to be affected by low traffic in mid-tier department stores and tourist-driven doors. And we are facing a difficult comparison to the prior year quarter, which was our strongest quarter in the U.S. when Estée Lauder and Clinique launched major skincare products and M-A-C had exceptionally strong results. Our cadence of product launches reflects smaller programs for all 3 in this year's first quarter.
The Middle East is projected to decline as distributors adjust inventory levels to reflect sluggish consumer spending. And we are experiencing weak sales in France as the threat of terrorism curtails travel and domestic spending in the near term.
For the first quarter, our EPS forecast is between $0.73 and $0.77 before restructuring charges. The adverse currency translation on sales for the first quarter equates to about $0.03 of EPS.
And as a reminder, the size and quarterly cadence of our new product launches and our programs changes from year-to-year. We continue to focus on delivering annual results in our overall long-term sales and profit growth plans.
We look forward to another successful year ahead for our company and for our brands. We are fortunate to operate in one of the highest-demand consumer categories today. Our brands are among the most desirable in the industry, and we believe our team is the most talented in the industry with their incredible creativity, passion for the business and depth of knowledge on what products consumers aspire to have. This winning formula continues to support our confidence in our plans despite a volatile political, economic and currency environment.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

And if so, maybe what are some of the puts and takes that get you there? And then sticking on margins. There was really good progress a couple of years ago in seeing fragrances sort of march higher. We had a setback last year. We've kind of stalled at margins this year with some weakness in the back half of this year.

As I indicated, we still do have our cost savings programs to offset a lot of the unfavorability that we're experiencing, and we continue to work on other initiatives to improve the margin. On fragrance, one of the things that we've spoken about, Jason, in the past is some of our fragrance brands that have higher-margin characteristics. So Jo Malone is a very profitable fragrance brand for us. Our newer acquisitions, because of some of the purchase accounting, don't yet have the margin characteristics of Jo Malone, but we certainly expect that they will once we get past the purchase accounting impact in the next year or 2."

As you know, it's well above 100 million this year. 117 million is the numbers we calculate, and it's growing. So first of all, there is no, at least to our knowledge, any reduction of travel. Now where they travel, you are absolutely right, less of them travel to Hong Kong, and more of them travel to different destination internationally. But it's also true that there is an enormous increase of travel within China, and we are very well positioned. We have -- as you know, there are duty-free areas within China where we are very strong, for example, Hainan islands, that are increasing and there is more people traveling there. On top of that, the fact that consumers travel touristically within the country offer us the possibility of continue building distribution in 3rd-tier and 4-tier cities where we are enjoying this internal travel, which obviously in this case is not duty free. So both are true, continued increase of external travel and increase of internal travel, and we are capturing to both opportunities. As far as Korea is concerned, we are doing very well in Korea. We are growing. For the year, we've been growing more than the market. So we've built market share, and we continue to see very strong growth also in the Seoul airport. And so the Korea trend in fiscal year '16 has been very, very strong. And we expect the Korea market to continue to have a strong influence on Asia in general and that the Korea consumers continue to be high-demanding consumers that we use also, too, as a benchmark for the kind of new ideas and new products that we go to launch in Asia or globally."

First of all, we agree, it's not about buying small brands. That's not a strategy. The strategy was to create a portfolio of the high-end artisanal fragrances, that combined, could change really the market and make the fragrance market again a market of high-end consumer demand-driven brands that can inspire the consumer in the world of fragrance and make it so the company with the best portfolio in this growth area of the future. That was the acquisition strategy there. It's not about small brands or big brands. It was about building the most amazing portfolio of artisanal fragrance brands, and we have done this. So you are also right that there is a growing makeup business around the world. We already have an amazing portfolio that some of our competitors didn't have. So we have M-A-C, Bobbi Brown, Smashbox. By the way, Smashbox was the first acquisition that we have done. It was exactly makeup, so -- but we agree with you that the future we'll see opportunities to continue growing in makeup and there will be opportunities for more makeup brands in our portfolio. And in terms of skin care, we purchased GLAMGLOW, which is a skincare brand. And it's a skin care brand, although small, but it's a skin care brand in our opinion with great potential to grow it to become big and also it's focused exactly on the new skin care trend, so instant benefits like masks and specialty multichannel dynamics. And finally, we purchased a minority interest, is one of the fastest-growing skin care brands in Korea today, which is Dr. Jart+, which was exactly the strategy. So I believe that the point is the strategy is not about fragrances or small brands. The strategy is about acquiring brands that fills strategic opportunities in our portfolio, and this will continue to be the strategy."

The competitiveness of the U.S. market in makeup has definitely increased. And in fact, we see the need of increasing the competitiveness in the makeup also activity of M-A-C in the U.S. But, for example, we saw the same opportunity on Lauder and Clinique a year ago. And I just want to repeat that in the last 12 months, Lauder and Clinique makeup in the U.S. grew double digits, showing that when we focus on a specific market and specific area, we can get the results.

The building blocks is that -- the first building block is pricing. And as I said, out of the 6%, 7%, about 2 points will be pricing. A lot of the price increases of the year happened in January, and so already this 2% of pricing is cued toward more -- the second part of the year. Then think of the distribution. So the second 2% of increase of the year is greater distribution, reaching new consumers around the world. Now many of these new distribution, including the one in specialty that you just mentioned, are going to happen after October. Many of the freestanding stores in Europe that we target, the majority of the freestanding stores we are going to open will happen in the period. And many of the new specialty multi doors in the U.S. will happen after October. So that's the second different. That's second positive, which is going to happen more skewed ahead in the fiscal year versus the first quarter. The third -- the point is the -- as I said before to the previous question, we have a very solid new fragrance portfolio in the high end. Now this fragrance portfolio, as you know, tend to have a huge opportunity to grow during holiday periods. And so all the holiday periods, they're not only Christmas but also Valentine, Mother's Day happen to be after October, and this will be another big acceleration element which is later in the fiscal year. Then we have all our innovation programs. As Tracey said in her prepared remarks, our innovation schedule changed in the year. We have less blockbuster initiative this year because we believe the consumer and the social media environment, which is developing, need more diffusion of newness versus blockbuster approach. So a lot of the innovation is more skewed as of October. In our portfolio, this is the other building block on same door that will impact the same door 2%, 3% of progress that we see in the year. Then as I said, Estée Lauder and Clinique are on improvement trends, and we expect Estée Lauder and Clinique to continue to improve and M-A-C U.S. is expected to continue to improve in the second part of the year. And so all these factors will improve the comp part of the fiscal year. So a lot of good steps that we believe will, over the year, accelerate. The last thing I want to say on that is that we have proven just the year with fiscal year '16 that we finished, we grew 2 of the quarters more than 8% and another quarter is 5%. So we have proven that we have the capability and the potential to grow 8% plus in the quarters where all the key elements of our building blocks start acting together."

It's really about reaching new consumers and reaching where the traffic of prestige consumers are. We don't plan to reach consumer which are not interested in the prestige.

So we continue to be completely focused on luxury prestige distribution. That means great environment, the right target consumer, the right service level. However, the world is evolving, the world is changing. There are many new opportunities online, specialty, travel retail, freestanding stores and obviously some very promising new activities also in the department store world. And we are focusing on all of them and wherever there is growth or prestige consumers. So that's really the strategy.

We opened a little over 170 of those stores in the full year. We also opened third-party stores as well in the year, and as Fabrizio indicated, of our total distribution growth, that's about 1/3 of the growth of that 2% distribution is freestanding stores.

So when you see the disproportionate growth of makeup, which is happening in the industry and certainly we're both driving and benefiting from, and the slowdown that we've seen in skincare, it does have a mix impact. So that is a piece of it. The other pieces that -- Hong Kong is a quite profitable area of the world for us from a sales perspective, sales and profit perspective, in that region. And the double-digit declines that we've seen in Hong Kong have also had an impact. So there's a geographic impact. The Middle East would be the same. So there's a geographic impact and then there's a category impact from a mix standpoint that we have experienced.

So I [indiscernible] which it really is, understanding there are risks on the table and the macro environment is what it is, but 8% to 12% -- 8% to 10% versus double digit is 2 different things. The second thing is around cost savings. I believe for fiscal '16, you've started the year expecting $200 million of SMI-related savings. You lowered that to $175 million for the year, I think, back in May. And then as you look into fiscal '17, you're talking about $150 million. So it feels like some of those expected savings aren't achievable for some reason, something's changed because I would have thought maybe it was a delay in timing, but something with SMI, it just feels like perhaps the savings are not quite what had been anticipated even 12 months ago."

But to tell you 8% to 10% in this moment in time, at the beginning of fiscal year, where there are so many volatility out there and so many social political situation that we have also explained in our remarks, we are basically acknowledging that there are some risks. And so that's what 8% to 10% means, but does not take anything away from our commitment to do all what we can to deliver the double-digit, meaning the 10%. And so that's simply the way we see that.

At some point, as you start to go further and deeper on some of these initiatives, there's going to be less opportunity. Clearly, when we initiated the second phase of our savings program, we went after the biggest opportunities first and then you start to see that weighing down, hence the reason why we announced Leading Beauty Forward, which certainly will generate more savings in future years as the SMI savings start to narrow a bit. So I think we're right on track with respect to where we expect to be in terms of SMI savings, and we certainly will always strive. We have a very competitive team so we always strive to exceed what we -- what our targets are."

One is still in your 2017 guidance, 6% to 7% constant currency, 8% to 10% on the bottom line. I guess I'm still not convinced that the margins you're projecting are flat because of currencies, and maybe just to help me with that confusion because it looks like it's less than 1% of impact on your top line for the year. You talked about $0.08 on the EPS line, but that's like 2.5% of EPS, and it's such a very large multiplier, much bigger than we would have expected. So trying to get a sense of why that's the case. And even that, by the way, doesn't explain the margin structure being flat given all the cost cutting that you're doing, the good cost cutting that you're doing. That's question 1. The other one is I do want to go back to the question in terms of distribution expansion into Sephora and Sephora in JCPenney, into Ulta with Estée Lauder, which I think we would have said 10 years ago, if Ulta had existed it would have been crazy, Jo Malone pushing more. I mean, we've seen a lot of, not the same, but analogous issues. I mean, just recently Coach, as an example, said, ""Look, we're pulling back from department stores."" Again, slightly different issue because they were discounting a lot but we've heard this before from Tommy, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, as Tracey knows very well. And you look at this a lot, guys. I want to get a sense of how you're looking at it, what your -- I appreciate your thoughts on this because there is a concern that at some point you're going to get rid of the scarcity. At some point, you're going to massify the brands, which drives the brand erosion and you kind of lose a little bit of that prestige. So given some of the analogies, can you explain kind of long term how much longer do you have before you start hurting the brand?"

So currency is another big impact and we gave you the spot rates that we're using, which, again, certainly could change during the course of the year. But rather than us predicting how that will change, we're using current spot rates and that definitely has at least a 30 basis point impact on our margin for the year. In addition to that, we did talk about the fact that some of our very high-profit-margin regions are actually showing either slower growth or declines in the case of Hong Kong, as we mentioned. The Middle East has slowed quite a bit. U.K. is a bit softer than what we certainly have experienced over the last couple of years. So those are all impacting. If nothing changed with respect to either our category mix or geographic mix, then you would be absolutely spot on, but those are things that we're managing as well. So our cost savings programs not only help us to expand the margin, but they have helped -- and fund some of our investment, but they've also helped us, because of the programs that we put in place a few years ago and are continuing to deliver on, are helping us to offset the negative impact of some of the macro situations that we're experiencing right now."

And on distribution, Ali, my point is we vet every single decision starting with a consumer point of view. So we are not distributing our brands anywhere where the consumer doesn't demand them, and the consumer is the target consumer. The distribution decision we are taking are always brand building, meaning there are consumers that are on target, particularly millennial, that we would not be able to reach without proposing the brand in that areas. And that's what is happening around the world, particularly the millennial consumer are changing their shopping habits. The brands that do not evolve their shopping habits to reach this consumer will basically actually lose structure with the new luxury consumer rather than risk their image. And so it's an evolution and it's driven mainly by the habits of the millennial consumer, also it's very different by category. This is happening very aggressively in makeup, for example, and the way the millennial consumer in makeup. It's happening also around the world. And a lot of this is about online and the availability of the brands online. So second thing is not the image of the distribution but is the -- we call it consumer reach. So the way we look at it, because again that's your question, we don't look at it like only the image. We look at it, do we reach the right consumers. So its analysis start from target consumer reach. And in fact, that's what we have used as language in our prepared remark, coverage, reach rather than expanded distribution. Then when you look it in terms of number of doors, that's actually -- there are a lot of closures. There are a lot of stores which are being closed, and not only in the U.S., around the world. So in terms of number of stores, this is not necessarily an increase of availability, so it's putting the brands where the consumer expect them at a certain moment of the progress. [ph] Last thing I want to say is that you mentioned Estée Lauder and Clinique, which are today, within prestige, broadly distributed brands. But keep in mind that all the rest of our portfolio is actually an enormous amount of extra distribution opportunity, meaning our brands have not even started being available to the right level of consumer around the world. So a lot of our distribution expansion is not about Lauder and Clinique, it's about bringing the rest of our portfolio to -- available to the right target consumer around the world, and numerically, in terms of sales and profit, that's where the biggest opportunity us."

And so that's the way we make distribution decision, and we make distribution decision in partnership with our retail partner. And they always know these things before and we have very, very honest discussions about what's needed for the brand. Sometimes a new distribution decision actually help sales for the brand in the total country, including in the retailers where the brands was previously distributed. And by the way, our brands very rarely are exclusive to a retailer. They are targeting certain group of consumer, that's clear. For example, Macy's, as you know, has announced to close 100 doors. We are collaborating and we will collaborate with Macy's to protect the consumption of our brands in these doors, transfer it to other Macy's doors consumers. We will do our best to support Macy's in this plan, which we believe they're doing the right thing. We will focus a lot to support Macy's in selling more in the remaining doors that they will focus on as well as we'll continue to support Macy's in building the best we can their online business that we have together. So also our retailers decide to close doors or do other things, and we collaborate with them in keeping the sales, continue increasing the sales. So it's not about one or the other. If we focus on the client, on the final customer, we get always the right decision made and they are normally win-win for the brands, for our retail partners and for the consumers. That's what we are looking. That's our principle. As far as your question in term of, if I understood correctly, in terms of internal, I think we just have our normal processes.

So it's actually easier for us to capture it in stores as well as online. We certainly do, our teams look at that information. Our brands look at that information and understand what trends are selling in freestanding stores and whether or not that mirrors or not what is selling in, in department stores and put plans together accordingly. And those are all areas that we -- as we expand distribution, as consumers continue to shop in multiple points of distribution, we continue to aggregate that information and look at whether or not there are any differential trends that the entire business can benefit from in terms of our strategies and how we allocate resources."

And I probably should have mentioned this as well when Ali asked his question on margin. Depending on our innovation in a particular year, in some cases, we actually choose to launch some innovation that actually has lower gross margin because that we've identified a consumer need in that particular space and believe that, that product will drive incremental sales and will build to be a large franchise, particularly for franchises like Estée Lauder and Clinique, and particularly in skin care. So we have seen, in recent years, some new innovation that actually is a bit of a lower gross profit margin. Clearly, as sales continue to build on products that we launched that are new, you're amortizing the tooling and you're getting some more favorability in terms of gross profit margin. But largely, they stay relatively close to where they're at unless there's a significant increase in volume, in which case you can get lower cost of goods. So -- but we do manage. And our teams, when you think about the number of brands that we have and the number of new product launches that we have where we have had, to Fabrizio's earlier comment, steady increase in the amount of innovation, our teams manage that gross margin mix quite tightly in terms of making sure that we -- in the new innovation, at least over the -- over a few years, is offset by innovation that also is more margin accretive."

And yes, there is obviously the impact of the first 44, 45 doors that we have closed before in fiscal year '16 in the first quarter. But to your core question for the long term, we definitely are focused to support our department store partners to improve -- to continue to improve the experience on our brands and in general in the beauty floor of department store. We have many activities in this area, many in the area of improved services, many in the activity of innovation and distortion, many in the area of connecting social media to the activities and activity in the area of sampling. In other words, we are really focused in working together how to increase traffic in-store, which is in this moment, the key opportunity. And then to your second question is what do we see in this moment.

And so there has been a significant improvement or trend. We said they would have started from turn around in the makeup area of both brands because it was the area that was better fitting the other goal, which was to attract more millennials to the brands. And we have done it. In the U.S., Lauder and Clinique makeup is growing double digit, which frankly was declining just a year ago and this is an impressive improvement, and also globally, both brands are growing their makeup in a very strong way. Now the skin care also did some progress, as we explained in the prepared remarks. However, on the skin care, the 2 key issues, which is Hong Kong continues decline and the mid-tier department store traffic issue that we just discussed in the last half an hour. Those 2 have been a drag to accelerate as well the skin care part, which now we will do our best to do in fiscal year '17. So good progress on both brands with an excellent start in makeup and some more work to do in skin care. Last point is to your question, is that what we forecasted. Frankly, we have done in line or slightly better than what we expected, but we did not forecast Hong Kong to continue to decline in the way it has declined, and we did not anticipate the kind of traffic reduction in mid-tier department store that we have seen in the course of the year.

There are 2 dynamics which are happening, which we believe are for the long term. The first one is the Asian consumer is using makeup more and more. So the dynamic of skin care versus makeup, a global level. The strength of skin care was driven by the fact that the fastest-growing demand was coming from Asia, and Asia consumer use much more skin care than makeup. I think this will continue. So nothing wrong with the skincare trend, but the makeup trend in Asia is dramatically accelerated because the billion of Asian consumers are using makeup more and more. This is a very strong long-term trend. The second is the millennial generation. We -- the data shows that the average millennial use more makeup in more occasions during the week than their mothers. So the more the millennial generation grows in percentage of the total population, the more makeup usage will continue to accelerate. So those 2 trends are long term. However, it doesn't mean the skincare needs to continue being -- growing less. Actually we see in already the first signs that as soon as the millennial will discover also more of the skin care routine, this can impact the skin care. For example, our new brands like GLAMGLOW, which are more focused on millennials and they are more based on instant-benefit skin cares, which are more important for millennials, have seen amazing growth when they do a good product launch. So I personally believe also skin care will accelerate in the future, driven by positive trends."

Our company had a very successful year in fiscal 2016. We delivered excellent financial results with adjusted constant currency net sales growth exceeding 7%, faster than global prestige beauty growth, and adjusted earnings per share rose 13%.
We also made progress on our strategic objectives by further diversifying our business, strengthening our multiple engines of growth and advancing our creativity and innovation. These new products represented nearly 1/4 of our sales, an all-time high. Additionally, we designed and launched Leading Beauty Forward, a multiyear initiative to increase our efficiency, speed to market and agility.
Our strong performance confirmed our resiliency during a volatile fiscal period that began with MERS in Korea and ended with Brexit in the U.K. In between, we experienced sharp currency fluctuations, disruptive geopolitical events, including increased terrorism and slowing economies in some of our key markets.
In global prestige beauty, we also faced tougher competition and changing consumer behavior. Nonetheless, we successfully navigated these new challenges by also strengthening the company's fundamentals, making us confident we can sustain our strong and profitable growth and achieve our long-term goals.
Our best growth came from our makeup categories, especially M-A-C, our luxury brands, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and the online and specialty multichannels. Our ability to grow so strongly in such a dynamic landscape is a testament to our more balanced and better-diversified business and strategic ability to identify and anticipate changing consumers and industry trends. That is what defines and distinguish our company.
Another of our key attributes is our increasing agility. During the year, we saw a variety of markets impacted by unexpected economic, political and social events. During those times, we made sure our resources were aligned with other areas having better growth potential.
Another key strength is our multiple engines of growth throughout our more than 25 brands that span categories, channels and countries. This allowed us to achieve double-digit growth in some brands, channels or market, while balancing slower growth in other areas. For example, continued political unrest in Hong Kong caused a sharp drop in Chinese tourists, who traveled to other countries instead. Our brands quickly responded by increasing the range of products appealing to Chinese consumers in key tourist doors in the markets they visited across Asia and Europe.
Fiscal year 2016 was also marked by rapid changes in global prestige beauty. Thanks to our 10-year compass, we had anticipated many of the trends, and we're well positioned to meet consumer's changing desires and shopping habits. For instance, we have increasingly invested in digital marketing and e-commerce, which was our fastest-growing channel this past year. Our global e- and m-commerce sales surpassed $1 billion for the first time, a milestone we are very proud of. And we expect our strong online growth to continue.
We made progress on our strategy as we strengthened many of our brands and diversified our portfolio. Our compass pointed to the growing interest among millennials for more specialized brands, so we nurtured the ones in our portfolio into significant competitors. Several of them, including Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Smashbox, M-A-C, La Mer, powered much of our growth and gained share. As makeup sales soared across the industry, Smashbox and M-A-C grew sharply, driven by their creativity and strong consumer demand. Our specialized luxury brands were big winners, and we acquired By Kilian. We strengthened our standing in the fastest-growing area of fragrance, the Ulta prestige tier. Additionally, we made a minority investment in a successful Korea skincare brand, Dr. Jart+, which give us an interest in a local brand in that very influential market.
Our 2 big multi-category brands stabilized overall as they each ended the year with flat sales. However, both brands have restarted solid growth in makeup. Estée Lauder makeup sales rose in every region, led by foundations and lip products. Its long-standing Double Wear foundation continued to be a bestseller worldwide. In skincare, its innovative Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask helped accelerate the sales of the ANR franchise in China and generated buzz and photos on social media. The brand's global net sales reflected strong growth in the European region and emerging market, offset by a decline in Asia Pacific, largely due to Hong Kong.
Clinique also advanced on many fronts. Its makeup sales were up sharply on a global basis, and Pep-Start Eye Cream was a top seller in several markets. Clinique created digital campaigns featuring millennial influencers that contributed to solid sales growth in the specialty multichannel and in Europe. These gains were offset by a decline in U.S. mid-tier department stores and Hong Kong.
Looking at our business geographically. Sales in emerging markets rose 15% overall and 25% excluding China. To fuel our momentum, we further emphasized our local relevance in products and social media. These past years, our brand reached many new consumers in emerging markets. Jo Malone entered Brazil, for example. We launched our first e-commerce operations in Mexico, and La Mer had a terrific growth in Russia.
Our channels' strengths reflected industry trends, and we invested in areas with the best traffic and growth. Sales in our online business rose 27%, reflecting solid gains in brands and retailer sites. We opened more sites for our brands and with retailers globally to widen our product availability. Orders and conversion grew more than 20%. 
We continue to selectively expand our brands in specialty multi-retailers globally to broaden our consumer base. For example, in North America, Estée Lauder introduced the millennial-oriented Estée Edit collection in Sephora, while Origins launched in select Sephora stores inside JCPenney and plans to roll out to full distribution there this year.
In Europe, Smashbox continued to broaden its presence in Boots in the U.K. and entered the specialty multi-retailers like Avena Beauty in Italy.
We strengthened our capabilities, particularly in R&D, information technology, digital and consumer insights. Across our brands, creativity and innovation remained a priority. Approximately 24% of our sales came from new products, and our investment in research and development climbed in line with our sales growth.
Our global patent portfolio has increased 40% in the last 4 years, primarily in skincare and strategic areas with high consumer interest. Our newest patents covers technologies that will anchor high-quality products that we expect to have broad appeal and delight global consumers.
We also launched Leading Beauty Forward to reduce costs and free up resources to invest in the areas that will help fuel our growth, including retail, innovation, digital, social media and new consumer-facing activities. In this fast-paced environment, we want to improve our speed and flexibility as we go to market and serve global consumers in creative and contemporary ways.
In this new fiscal year, our actions fall into 2 broad areas. The first is increasing the reach of our target consumers throughout whitespace opportunities across geographic -- geographies and channels. The second is enhancing our consumer engagement with new experiences and innovative high-quality products and services, which will encompass digital marketing, disruptive in-store merchandising, compelling creativity and omnichannel offering. Our brands have numerous opportunities to attract new consumers in every region.
M-A-C is one of our largest brands but isn't as widely distributed as other brands. It has approximately 1/10 the doors of Estée Lauder and Clinique and about half the distribution of several guided [ph] global competitors. So there are millions of untapped new consumers the brand can potentially reach.
Many of our small- and medium-sized brands are now poised for global expansion. For example, in travel retail, Jo Malone today is available in less than half of tier 1 airports, so there is a lot of runway left to reach additional traveling consumers. Online, Jo Malone has e-commerce website in just 8 countries compared to 26 for Clinique. In fact, Jo Malone expects to launch e- and m-commerce in approximately 10 new markets this year.
As our consumer coverage increases, we are carefully watching same-store sales growth as well. We expect new points of distribution, same-store growth and pricing to each contribute approximately the same amount to our total sales growth this year. Freestanding stores are expected to account about 1/3 of our new distribution this year.
As our brands broaden their reach, they will emphasize fast-growing, image-building channels. In the online world, our focus is on mobile and omnichannel. Consumers expect a seamless integrated experience across channels, platforms and social media. We are implementing new technology and digital experiences, including online booking for in-store appointments, omnichannel loyalty programs and high-touch mobile services.
With sales in specialty multi-retailers on a fast track, we will increase the number of doors we are in and widen the scope of our brands in the channel to reach the consumer who shops there. For example, Clinique plans to roll out more Ulta locations and enter some Sephora stores inside JCPenney. Estée Lauder, meanwhile, will reach new shoppers with a curated selection of products in Ulta in 30 stores and on Ulta's website.
In travel retail, global passenger traffic is forecasted to grow mid-single digit. We expect our net sales to surpass traffic growth, led by many of our midsized brands that have opportunities to enter additional airports all over the world. We are working closely with department stores to bring more traffic to beauty, both in-store and online. We will elevate the consumer experience in department stores with differentiated customized services such as makeup lessons from our expert advisers, for which there is a strong demand.
Although department stores had been challenged in the U.S., they continue growing internationally, including the U.K., Western Europe, Australia, Canada or Latin America. Social media is integral to every beauty brand today and an important component in winning with millennials.
To engage consumers, our brands plan to utilize more global and local influencers, beauty consultants and makeup artists to amplify their messages. Estée Lauder is collaborating on a makeup collection with fashion designer and influencer, Victoria Beckham, and she is promoting it to her 12 million Instagram followers.
Our brands are increasing their media spending and devoting more resources to digital, which allows them to target their communications to potential new consumers with relevant messages, thanks to better data and new technologies. Approximately 30% of our total advertising spending is now digital, up 15% from last year.
Our brands are doing interesting activities in the digital space. Estée Lauder launched the interactive global content network based in New York that works like a newsroom. And Bobbi Brown held its first live video on Facebook, celebrating its 26th anniversary and a new campaign, which attracted nearly 1 million viewers.
Innovation remains paramount as our brands pursue high-growth subcategories. One area is skincare with instant benefit such as masks from some of our brands that make skin glow. In addition, Clinique's Pep-Start HydroBlur Moisturizer hydrates [ph] and blurs skin imperfections on the spot. And Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme Plus Wake Up Balm creates instant morning radiance.
We plan to accelerate our growth in skincare. The recent launch of Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair ampoules should help drive the brand's important franchise. Clinique created a collection around Pep-Start with the addition of moisturizers and cleansers, and La Mer is rolling out a new formula of its core moisturizing line.
With new innovations and consumer engagement activities, we believe we can further strengthen our leading position in makeup. Estée Lauder is building on its Double Wear foundation with an innovative cushion stick. Clinique introduced Superbalanced Silk Makeup, an entry-price foundation with some protection. And M-A-C InstaCurl Lash Mascara has a customizable brush.
We also plan to propel our fragrance business, particularly in the Ulta prestige tier, where we have a large and desirable portfolio. Jo Malone's highly anticipated major fall launch is Basil & Neroli. And Tom Ford's newest entry in its Signature collection is Orchid Soleil.
Prestige beauty is a driving consumer area, and its growth continues to exceed mass beauty in key countries. Underlying demographic trends are positive. The middle class in emerging markets, millennials and ageless consumers have a big appetite for prestige beauty, and those populations are increasing.
We operate in an unpredictable global environment and carefully monitor ongoing issues such as the ramification of Brexit on our business. We are aware that unforeseen challenges will arise. However, we have comfort in knowing that we have many strengths that underpin our financial performance. Our diversified business is anchored by multiple engines of growth, a wealth of creativity and the ability to quickly react and adapt to events and trends, making us optimistic about our long-term success.
Over the next 3 years, we expect to generate sales growth of 6% to 8% and double-digit EPS increases in constant currency. This year, we expect to once again outpace global prestige beauty growth and gain share, despite external headwinds and challenges. In fiscal 2017, we forecast constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% with double-digit EPS growth.
I want to thank my executive team and every one of our employees for their hard work and passion. They are one of the key reasons we have performed so well and continue to be so confident about our future.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey."

First, I will review our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year financial results and then cover our expectations for the fiscal 2017 first quarter and full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. Additionally, the fiscal 2016 full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior year implementation of our strategic modernization initiative.
Net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.65 billion, up 7% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Incremental sales from our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 50 basis points of this growth. Our business was quite strong in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, despite macro events in France, Germany and Turkey as well as the U.K. Brexit vote.
Net sales rose 12% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in most countries, notably the U.K., Germany and most of the region's emerging markets. Our sales declined in France due to a large drop in tourism, and in the Middle East because of continued economic uncertainty.
Our global travel retail channel delivered an 11% net sales increase, reflecting strong retail trends in many tourist destinations, partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong and in Brazil. Currency volatility and terrorist activity continue to affect travel and consumption patterns, and we saw a moderation in passenger traffic to Europe in the quarter.
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. Australia was a standout, growing strong double digits, while China, Korea and Japan grew mid- to high single digits. Our net sales in Hong Kong continue to decline but less than in the previous quarter.
Net sales in the Americas increased 3% in constant currency. Latin America grew more than 20%, led by Mexico and Brazil, and Canada rose mid-single digits. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits.
Our sales through both online and specialty multichannels continue to rise double digits. However, declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued weakness in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores curtailed growth.
Makeup sales again led product category growth, rising 12% in constant currency. M-A-C, Smashbox, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford achieved double-digit makeup growth, and Estée Lauder rose mid-single digits. Foundation, lip products, kits and palettes have been very popular among all consumers.
Haircare sales increased 5% in constant currency. Aveda benefited from the launch of Invati for Men products, and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in Germany and in France.
Skincare sales grew 3% in constant currency, led by growth from La Mer and Origins. These increases were partially offset by Estée Lauder and Clinique, reflecting continued weakness in U.S. mid-tier department stores as well as in Hong Kong.
Sales of fragrance products rose 2% in constant currency. Jo Malone was the largest contributor to growth as sales rose strong double digits. Our recent acquisitions, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle, are growing rapidly, and By Kilian provided incremental sales.
Our gross margin was unchanged from the prior year. Favorability from pricing, lower obsolescence and supply chain savings were offset by channel mix, currency and new products.
Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined 10 basis points. Higher store operating costs associated with our retail store growth was offset by lower selling and shipping costs and cost savings from our SMI program. As a result, operating income rose 7%, and operating margin improved 10 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9%. 
Net earnings increased 7% to $163.1 million. Diluted EPS of $0.43 was 9% above the prior year, reflecting higher earnings and a small benefit from a lower share count and a lower effective tax rate. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.01 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 11%.
Switching to our full year. Details of our performance are largely covered in the press release, so I will focus on some of the highlights. With strong net sales up 7%, our gross margin improved 10 basis points. Manufacturing favorability and lower obsolescence were partially offset by product category mix and currency.
Our full year operating margin declined 40 basis points to 15.5%. While the decrease included slight dilution from the recent acquisition of By Kilian, the decline was almost entirely driven by 50 basis points from the impact of adverse currency. We continue to benefit from our cost savings and sales growth leverage.
We ended fiscal 2016 with an effective income tax rate of 28.3%, a 200 basis point improvement from the prior year. Net interest expense rose to $55.1 million from $45.7 million in the year earlier, reflecting the increase in debt from our May 2016 bond issuances, partially offset by higher investment income.
In fiscal 2016, we realized approximately $135 million in restructuring and other charges, $54 million of it related to the transformation and modernization of our global technology infrastructure, which is largely complete, and approximately $81 million in charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiative.
Operating cash flow was $1.79 billion, representing a slight improvement over the prior year, adjusted for the SMI shift. We invested $525 million in capital projects, 2/3 of which was in consumer-facing areas such as counters, retail stores and e- and m-commerce sites.
We've repurchased 10.5 million shares of our stock for $890 million and paid $423 million in dividends to stockholders, increasing our dividend rate by 25%.
In total, we returned approximately 104% of free cash flow to stockholders, contributing to our 6.4% total stockholder return for the fiscal year, which compares with 4% for the S&P 500 for the same period.
Additionally, we invested in an acquisition and a minority interest, and we increased our balance sheet leverage by issuing $600 million in senior notes at favorable rates.
Overall, we are very pleased with the performance we delivered in fiscal 2016. Our 7% net sales growth and 13% EPS growth in constant currency are strongly aligned with our long-term goals, and we have laid the foundation for a more efficient and effective organization to leverage growth with the launch of Leading Beauty Forward.
Now looking ahead over the next few years, we plan to continue to focus on our strategic priorities with an even greater emphasis on speed and agility in the context of a rapidly evolving prestige beauty landscape. The recent Brexit vote has added a layer of uncertainty that will most likely not be fully understood for some time, and we believe the risks of other economic and political disruptions will remain high as we start our new fiscal year. Nevertheless, our strategies are sound, and as a result, over the next 3 years, we expect our business to continue to become even more balanced and diversified by product category, brand, geography and channel.
Prestige beauty is expected to grow at 4% to 5% annually for the next few years, and we remain committed to our goal of exceeding the growth of global prestige beauty by at least 1 percentage point annually. We also expect to continue to drive value from our existing cost saving programs, and we expect to begin realizing some of the initial benefits from Leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2018 and generate annualized net benefit of $200 million to $300 million upon full implementation of the program.
With the recent approvals of the first initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward, we can now develop more effective organization structures to enable increasing improvements and consumer engagement for our brands as well as develop more efficient and effective processes for many of our corporate functions, including the initial organization design of a potential shared service support structure. We expect to approve further initiatives throughout the next few years. All of these efforts should permanently reduce the run rate of the areas addressed under the program and provide funds for continued investment in capabilities that more directly support the sustainability of our profitable top line growth.
It is more important than ever that we maintain the financial and operational flexibility to compete effectively in the dynamic prestige beauty industry. We must be able to nimbly allocate the appropriate amount of resources as consumer preferences, travel corridors and exchange rates continually shift. Balancing cost savings, sales leverage and reinvestment for future growth, we expect operating margin expansion of approximately 110 to 150 basis points in constant currency through fiscal 2019. We remain committed to our goal of growing EPS double digits in constant currency each year, which we have delivered consistently for the last 7 years.
Working capital improvement also continues to be a focus, and we expect improved cash-to-cash cycle performance across accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory. Over the next 3 years, we plan to free up over $400 million in additional cash, which would increase our growth in cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings growth. We are targeting inventory days to sell of approximately 150 days by the end of fiscal 2019, a marked improvement from today's levels.
Now let me focus on our outlook for the fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter. In fiscal 2017, sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency. We expect all product categories and regions to grow, led by the makeup category and the EMEA region. By channel, growth is expected to continue to be strongest in online, specialty multi, freestanding stores and travel retail.
As Fabrizio mentioned, several of our brands will accelerate their expansion in specialty multi-retailers and online, which should enable us to reach new consumers as they increasingly shop multiple channels for prestige beauty products. The impact of this activity and the cadence of our new product launches are expected to produce stronger top line growth subsequent to our first quarter.
Our estimate reflects current spot rates given the recent volatility we have experienced the last 2 years. Those spot rates are $1.12 for the euro, $1.31 for the pound and JPY 101 for the yen.
We continue to achieve cost savings from our SMI program. In fiscal 2017, we expect to generate approximately $150 million in savings, primarily from indirect procurement, A&P optimization, supply chain initiatives and selling effectiveness, some of which will be used to invest behind our newly acquired brands and omnichannel capabilities.
We anticipate our tax rate will range between 28% and 29%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to take restructuring and other charges of $80 million to $100 million, with about $35 million to $45 million in the first quarter. We expect to update these estimates when additional initiatives are approved. And as a reminder, total program costs beyond fiscal 2017 over multiple years are anticipated to be in the $500 million to $600 million range.
In fiscal 2017, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $1.8 billion, relatively flat with last year, with the inclusion of the impact of Leading Beauty Forward. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $550 million or 4.5% to 5% of sales.
With respect to our capital structure, we have room to grow our dividend while maintaining a sustainable payout ratio. And as of June 30, we had approximately 18 million shares remaining in our buyback authorization. We will continue to assess the need for greater leverage to support our strategies, including shareholder returns.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales to rise approximately 2% to 3% in constant currency. Translation could hinder growth by approximately 1 percentage point. We expect our small to midsized brands to continue to be strong contributors in many global markets, owing to their increasing appeal with multiple consumer groups across various channels. We also expect continued growth to be generated in many developed and emerging markets, particularly in Europe. Partially offsetting these growth drivers in the quarter are some macro issues that we expect to impact our results.
Our U.S. business continues to be affected by low traffic in mid-tier department stores and tourist-driven doors. And we are facing a difficult comparison to the prior year quarter, which was our strongest quarter in the U.S. when Estée Lauder and Clinique launched major skincare products and M-A-C had exceptionally strong results. Our cadence of product launches reflects smaller programs for all 3 in this year's first quarter.
The Middle East is projected to decline as distributors adjust inventory levels to reflect sluggish consumer spending. And we are experiencing weak sales in France as the threat of terrorism curtails travel and domestic spending in the near term.
For the first quarter, our EPS forecast is between $0.73 and $0.77 before restructuring charges. The adverse currency translation on sales for the first quarter equates to about $0.03 of EPS.
And as a reminder, the size and quarterly cadence of our new product launches and our programs changes from year-to-year. We continue to focus on delivering annual results in our overall long-term sales and profit growth plans.
We look forward to another successful year ahead for our company and for our brands. We are fortunate to operate in one of the highest-demand consumer categories today. Our brands are among the most desirable in the industry, and we believe our team is the most talented in the industry with their incredible creativity, passion for the business and depth of knowledge on what products consumers aspire to have. This winning formula continues to support our confidence in our plans despite a volatile political, economic and currency environment.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

And if so, maybe what are some of the puts and takes that get you there? And then sticking on margins. There was really good progress a couple of years ago in seeing fragrances sort of march higher.

As I indicated, we still do have our cost savings programs to offset a lot of the unfavorability that we're experiencing, and we continue to work on other initiatives to improve the margin. On fragrance, one of the things that we've spoken about, Jason, in the past is some of our fragrance brands that have higher-margin characteristics. So Jo Malone is a very profitable fragrance brand for us.

Now where they travel, you are absolutely right, less of them travel to Hong Kong, and more of them travel to different destination internationally. But it's also true that there is an enormous increase of travel within China, and we are very well positioned. We have -- as you know, there are duty-free areas within China where we are very strong, for example, Hainan islands, that are increasing and there is more people traveling there. On top of that, the fact that consumers travel touristically within the country offer us the possibility of continue building distribution in 3rd-tier and 4-tier cities where we are enjoying this internal travel, which obviously in this case is not duty free. So both are true, continued increase of external travel and increase of internal travel, and we are capturing to both opportunities. As far as Korea is concerned, we are doing very well in Korea. We are growing. For the year, we've been growing more than the market. So we've built market share, and we continue to see very strong growth also in the Seoul airport. And so the Korea trend in fiscal year '16 has been very, very strong. And we expect the Korea market to continue to have a strong influence on Asia in general and that the Korea consumers continue to be high-demanding consumers that we use also, too, as a benchmark for the kind of new ideas and new products that we go to launch in Asia or globally."

And it's a skin care brand, although small, but it's a skin care brand in our opinion with great potential to grow it to become big and also it's focused exactly on the new skin care trend, so instant benefits like masks and specialty multichannel dynamics. And finally, we purchased a minority interest, is one of the fastest-growing skin care brands in Korea today, which is Dr. Jart+, which was exactly the strategy. So I believe that the point is the strategy is not about fragrances or small brands. The strategy is about acquiring brands that fills strategic opportunities in our portfolio, and this will continue to be the strategy."

The competitiveness of the U.S. market in makeup has definitely increased.

The building blocks is that -- the first building block is pricing. And as I said, out of the 6%, 7%, about 2 points will be pricing. A lot of the price increases of the year happened in January, and so already this 2% of pricing is cued toward more -- the second part of the year. Then think of the distribution. So the second 2% of increase of the year is greater distribution, reaching new consumers around the world. Now many of these new distribution, including the one in specialty that you just mentioned, are going to happen after October. Many of the freestanding stores in Europe that we target, the majority of the freestanding stores we are going to open will happen in the period. And many of the new specialty multi doors in the U.S. will happen after October. So that's the second different. That's second positive, which is going to happen more skewed ahead in the fiscal year versus the first quarter. The third -- the point is the -- as I said before to the previous question, we have a very solid new fragrance portfolio in the high end. Now this fragrance portfolio, as you know, tend to have a huge opportunity to grow during holiday periods. And so all the holiday periods, they're not only Christmas but also Valentine, Mother's Day happen to be after October, and this will be another big acceleration element which is later in the fiscal year. Then we have all our innovation programs. As Tracey said in her prepared remarks, our innovation schedule changed in the year. We have less blockbuster initiative this year because we believe the consumer and the social media environment, which is developing, need more diffusion of newness versus blockbuster approach. So a lot of the innovation is more skewed as of October. In our portfolio, this is the other building block on same door that will impact the same door 2%, 3% of progress that we see in the year. Then as I said, Estée Lauder and Clinique are on improvement trends, and we expect Estée Lauder and Clinique to continue to improve and M-A-C U.S. is expected to continue to improve in the second part of the year. And so all these factors will improve the comp part of the fiscal year. So a lot of good steps that we believe will, over the year, accelerate. The last thing I want to say on that is that we have proven just the year with fiscal year '16 that we finished, we grew 2 of the quarters more than 8% and another quarter is 5%. So we have proven that we have the capability and the potential to grow 8% plus in the quarters where all the key elements of our building blocks start acting together."

So we continue to be completely focused on luxury prestige distribution. That means great environment, the right target consumer, the right service level. However, the world is evolving, the world is changing. There are many new opportunities online, specialty, travel retail, freestanding stores and obviously some very promising new activities also in the department store world. And we are focusing on all of them and wherever there is growth or prestige consumers. So that's really the strategy.

We opened a little over 170 of those stores in the full year. We also opened third-party stores as well in the year, and as Fabrizio indicated, of our total distribution growth, that's about 1/3 of the growth of that 2% distribution is freestanding stores.

So that is a piece of it. The other pieces that -- Hong Kong is a quite profitable area of the world for us from a sales perspective, sales and profit perspective, in that region. And the double-digit declines that we've seen in Hong Kong have also had an impact. So there's a geographic impact. The Middle East would be the same.

So I [indiscernible] which it really is, understanding there are risks on the table and the macro environment is what it is, but 8% to 12% -- 8% to 10% versus double digit is 2 different things. The second thing is around cost savings. I believe for fiscal '16, you've started the year expecting $200 million of SMI-related savings. You lowered that to $175 million for the year, I think, back in May. And then as you look into fiscal '17, you're talking about $150 million. So it feels like some of those expected savings aren't achievable for some reason, something's changed because I would have thought maybe it was a delay in timing, but something with SMI, it just feels like perhaps the savings are not quite what had been anticipated even 12 months ago."

But to tell you 8% to 10% in this moment in time, at the beginning of fiscal year, where there are so many volatility out there and so many social political situation that we have also explained in our remarks, we are basically acknowledging that there are some risks. And so that's what 8% to 10% means, but does not take anything away from our commitment to do all what we can to deliver the double-digit, meaning the 10%. And so that's simply the way we see that.

At some point, as you start to go further and deeper on some of these initiatives, there's going to be less opportunity. Clearly, when we initiated the second phase of our savings program, we went after the biggest opportunities first and then you start to see that weighing down, hence the reason why we announced Leading Beauty Forward, which certainly will generate more savings in future years as the SMI savings start to narrow a bit. So I think we're right on track with respect to where we expect to be in terms of SMI savings, and we certainly will always strive. We have a very competitive team so we always strive to exceed what we -- what our targets are."

One is still in your 2017 guidance, 6% to 7% constant currency, 8% to 10% on the bottom line. I guess I'm still not convinced that the margins you're projecting are flat because of currencies, and maybe just to help me with that confusion because it looks like it's less than 1% of impact on your top line for the year. You talked about $0.08 on the EPS line, but that's like 2.5% of EPS, and it's such a very large multiplier, much bigger than we would have expected. So trying to get a sense of why that's the case. And even that, by the way, doesn't explain the margin structure being flat given all the cost cutting that you're doing, the good cost cutting that you're doing. That's question 1. The other one is I do want to go back to the question in terms of distribution expansion into Sephora and Sephora in JCPenney, into Ulta with Estée Lauder, which I think we would have said 10 years ago, if Ulta had existed it would have been crazy, Jo Malone pushing more. I mean, we've seen a lot of, not the same, but analogous issues. I mean, just recently Coach, as an example, said, ""Look, we're pulling back from department stores."" Again, slightly different issue because they were discounting a lot but we've heard this before from Tommy, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, as Tracey knows very well. And you look at this a lot, guys. I want to get a sense of how you're looking at it, what your -- I appreciate your thoughts on this because there is a concern that at some point you're going to get rid of the scarcity. At some point, you're going to massify the brands, which drives the brand erosion and you kind of lose a little bit of that prestige. So given some of the analogies, can you explain kind of long term how much longer do you have before you start hurting the brand?"

So currency is another big impact and we gave you the spot rates that we're using, which, again, certainly could change during the course of the year. But rather than us predicting how that will change, we're using current spot rates and that definitely has at least a 30 basis point impact on our margin for the year. In addition to that, we did talk about the fact that some of our very high-profit-margin regions are actually showing either slower growth or declines in the case of Hong Kong, as we mentioned. The Middle East has slowed quite a bit. U.K. is a bit softer than what we certainly have experienced over the last couple of years. So those are all impacting. If nothing changed with respect to either our category mix or geographic mix, then you would be absolutely spot on, but those are things that we're managing as well. So our cost savings programs not only help us to expand the margin, but they have helped -- and fund some of our investment, but they've also helped us, because of the programs that we put in place a few years ago and are continuing to deliver on, are helping us to offset the negative impact of some of the macro situations that we're experiencing right now."

And on distribution, Ali, my point is we vet every single decision starting with a consumer point of view. So we are not distributing our brands anywhere where the consumer doesn't demand them, and the consumer is the target consumer. The distribution decision we are taking are always brand building, meaning there are consumers that are on target, particularly millennial, that we would not be able to reach without proposing the brand in that areas. And that's what is happening around the world, particularly the millennial consumer are changing their shopping habits. The brands that do not evolve their shopping habits to reach this consumer will basically actually lose structure with the new luxury consumer rather than risk their image. And so it's an evolution and it's driven mainly by the habits of the millennial consumer, also it's very different by category. This is happening very aggressively in makeup, for example, and the way the millennial consumer in makeup. It's happening also around the world. And a lot of this is about online and the availability of the brands online. So second thing is not the image of the distribution but is the -- we call it consumer reach. So the way we look at it, because again that's your question, we don't look at it like only the image. We look at it, do we reach the right consumers. So its analysis start from target consumer reach. And in fact, that's what we have used as language in our prepared remark, coverage, reach rather than expanded distribution. Then when you look it in terms of number of doors, that's actually -- there are a lot of closures. There are a lot of stores which are being closed, and not only in the U.S., around the world. So in terms of number of stores, this is not necessarily an increase of availability, so it's putting the brands where the consumer expect them at a certain moment of the progress. [ph] Last thing I want to say is that you mentioned Estée Lauder and Clinique, which are today, within prestige, broadly distributed brands. But keep in mind that all the rest of our portfolio is actually an enormous amount of extra distribution opportunity, meaning our brands have not even started being available to the right level of consumer around the world. So a lot of our distribution expansion is not about Lauder and Clinique, it's about bringing the rest of our portfolio to -- available to the right target consumer around the world, and numerically, in terms of sales and profit, that's where the biggest opportunity us."

And so that's the way we make distribution decision, and we make distribution decision in partnership with our retail partner. And they always know these things before and we have very, very honest discussions about what's needed for the brand. Sometimes a new distribution decision actually help sales for the brand in the total country, including in the retailers where the brands was previously distributed. And by the way, our brands very rarely are exclusive to a retailer. They are targeting certain group of consumer, that's clear. For example, Macy's, as you know, has announced to close 100 doors. We are collaborating and we will collaborate with Macy's to protect the consumption of our brands in these doors, transfer it to other Macy's doors consumers. We will do our best to support Macy's in this plan, which we believe they're doing the right thing. We will focus a lot to support Macy's in selling more in the remaining doors that they will focus on as well as we'll continue to support Macy's in building the best we can their online business that we have together. So also our retailers decide to close doors or do other things, and we collaborate with them in keeping the sales, continue increasing the sales. So it's not about one or the other. If we focus on the client, on the final customer, we get always the right decision made and they are normally win-win for the brands, for our retail partners and for the consumers.

Our brands look at that information and understand what trends are selling in freestanding stores and whether or not that mirrors or not what is selling in, in department stores and put plans together accordingly.

And I probably should have mentioned this as well when Ali asked his question on margin. Depending on our innovation in a particular year, in some cases, we actually choose to launch some innovation that actually has lower gross margin because that we've identified a consumer need in that particular space and believe that, that product will drive incremental sales and will build to be a large franchise, particularly for franchises like Estée Lauder and Clinique, and particularly in skin care. So we have seen, in recent years, some new innovation that actually is a bit of a lower gross profit margin. Clearly, as sales continue to build on products that we launched that are new, you're amortizing the tooling and you're getting some more favorability in terms of gross profit margin. But largely, they stay relatively close to where they're at unless there's a significant increase in volume, in which case you can get lower cost of goods. So -- but we do manage. And our teams, when you think about the number of brands that we have and the number of new product launches that we have where we have had, to Fabrizio's earlier comment, steady increase in the amount of innovation, our teams manage that gross margin mix quite tightly in terms of making sure that we -- in the new innovation, at least over the -- over a few years, is offset by innovation that also is more margin accretive."

We said they would have started from turn around in the makeup area of both brands because it was the area that was better fitting the other goal, which was to attract more millennials to the brands. And we have done it. In the U.S., Lauder and Clinique makeup is growing double digit, which frankly was declining just a year ago and this is an impressive improvement, and also globally, both brands are growing their makeup in a very strong way. Now the skin care also did some progress, as we explained in the prepared remarks. However, on the skin care, the 2 key issues, which is Hong Kong continues decline and the mid-tier department store traffic issue that we just discussed in the last half an hour. Those 2 have been a drag to accelerate as well the skin care part, which now we will do our best to do in fiscal year '17. So good progress on both brands with an excellent start in makeup and some more work to do in skin care. Last point is to your question, is that what we forecasted. Frankly, we have done in line or slightly better than what we expected, but we did not forecast Hong Kong to continue to decline in the way it has declined, and we did not anticipate the kind of traffic reduction in mid-tier department store that we have seen in the course of the year.

There are 2 dynamics which are happening, which we believe are for the long term. The first one is the Asian consumer is using makeup more and more. So the dynamic of skin care versus makeup, a global level. The strength of skin care was driven by the fact that the fastest-growing demand was coming from Asia, and Asia consumer use much more skin care than makeup. I think this will continue. So nothing wrong with the skincare trend, but the makeup trend in Asia is dramatically accelerated because the billion of Asian consumers are using makeup more and more. This is a very strong long-term trend. The second is the millennial generation. We -- the data shows that the average millennial use more makeup in more occasions during the week than their mothers. So the more the millennial generation grows in percentage of the total population, the more makeup usage will continue to accelerate. So those 2 trends are long term. However, it doesn't mean the skincare needs to continue being -- growing less. Actually we see in already the first signs that as soon as the millennial will discover also more of the skin care routine, this can impact the skin care. For example, our new brands like GLAMGLOW, which are more focused on millennials and they are more based on instant-benefit skin cares, which are more important for millennials, have seen amazing growth when they do a good product launch. So I personally believe also skin care will accelerate in the future, driven by positive trends."

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, sales grew in line with our forecast, and earnings per share growth exceeded our expectations due to more prudent expense management as we navigated through some of the macro uncertainty in the quarter.
Across our business, many brands, countries [ph] and channels achieved double-digit sales gains. Our strongest performers were our small and midsized brands, particularly, those in the latter [ph] tier, many European markets and young line, specialty multi and travel retail channels. Yet as we had anticipated, our strong gains were partially offset by challenging markets and economic conditions in certain countries. 
In constant currency, our sales rose 2% and adjusted EPS increased 5%. We managed our business with a full year perspective. So even though the first quarter top line growth is starting off at a [ph] lower than usual pace, we are confident in our ability to achieve the solid sales and earnings growth we forecasted for fiscal year '17. 
Our first quarter growth was lower, primarily due to ongoing challenge in U.S. mid-tier department stores caused by lower traffic. The market slowdown in the Middle East and visible [ph] comparison in France and Germany and a continued negative trend in Hong Kong. All these challenges were anticipated, and plans are in place to gradually accelerate our sales growth quarter by quarter, and position us to deliver our full fiscal year plan.
Despite headwinds, there are expected -- we are expected to continue in [ph] some areas -- sorry, despite headwinds are expected to continue win some areas, we have plans to further leverage our stronger brands, channels and countries. We have robust holiday programs and a strong innovation pipeline, exciting opportunities to reach new target consumers and geographies, especially with our fast-growing brands and compelling programs to better engage shoppers. By being well diversified to having multiple engines of growth, we are able to activate the drivers that we believe will fuel stronger sales.
These are expected to include a number of international markets, the makeup and fragrance categories, and target distribution opportunities. We are reaffirming our previously stated goal of constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2017. This will come from a combination of factors.
Our organic growth is expected to accelerate, mainly in makeup and fragrance, fueled by strong innovation in the second half, and supported by greater social media initiatives for improved consumer engagement. We should have easier comparisons in several markets since external events that impacted our results last year will be in our base.
Also contributing to growth will be new points of distribution globally for our fast-growing high-productivity brands, with a higher concentration coming in the second half, as well as planned price increases. Additionally, the planned acquisition of BECCA will provide incremental sales.  As a result, we are also reaffirming our goal of adjusted constant currency EPS growth of 8% to 10% for full year.
In the past several months, we have continued to make excellent progress on our strategic objectives. We believe that the industry's strong growth in global makeup sales will continue. So we are focusing on building and strengthening our makeup portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved solid makeup growth in several brands, however, the total category was affected by declines at M-A-C in the United States, owing to fewer foreign tourists, particularly in New York City and Florida and [ph] lower traffic in department stores. M-A-C is a powerful and authentic brand that speaks to all ages, races and sexes, and we expect its U.S. business to deliver stronger results through the rest of the year.
As of October, M-A-C U.S. sales started to improve. Thanks to the launch of its successful Selena makeup Collection, and the new range of lipstick called Liptensity. The Selena Collection was inspired by the late singer and her huge fan base, and accounted for the highest online traffic in 1 day on the brand site. M-A-C will bring back the Selena Collection in January to meet continued demand. It has other exciting collaborations in plans, including a Nutcracker themed holiday collection and compelling social media programs that will leverage M-A-C rapidly expansion, expanding fan base, which now includes 16 million global Facebook fans and 12 million followers on Instagram. The brand also has an active presence on YouTube, Twitter and other popular digital platforms right now. M-A-C's international business grew in line with the global prestige makeup, fueled by double-digit growth in most European and Asian markets. Internationally, we expect M-A-C to grow double digit in the fiscal year and gaining share, driven by continued organic growth, stronger innovation program, expansion of social media and new opportunity to reach target consumer that don't yet have access to the brand. Today, M-A-C is sold in a relatively small and select number of doors in each market, and it is an opportunity for us to further build its presence where it is underrepresented, primarily in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in the EMEA region and in China. M-A-C doors are among the most productive of the entire industry.
Smashbox, our pure-play makeup brand, generated double-digit global growth for the quarter, and we expect to deliver strong double-digit increases for the fiscal year. The brand is focused on winning in the specialty-multi and direct-to-consumer channels, and recently redesigned its U.S. e-commerce site for a greater consumer engagement. 
Our Tom Ford brand had an outstanding quarter, with its makeup business nearly doubling, led by its popular new lipsticks. Makeup is expected to continue to be a major growth driver, and the brand should benefit from upcoming color collection, inspired by the designers, Runway Fashion. [indiscernible] represent the majority of this luxury brand business and continues to generate strong momentum.
La Mer, our luxury skincare brand, just launched its innovative skin color collection, which includes 15 shades of foundation, a growing subcategory, plus powder and concealer. These products incorporate the brand's signature Miracle Broth and are expected to capitalize on growing demand for product that reach skincare with makeup. The collection has increased traffic to the Fabrizio Freda counters and websites, and the brand anticipates it will attract new consumers and providing incremental sales to its core products of moisturizers, eye creams and serums.
We are also building on our global leadership in prestige makeup. 2 weeks ago, we agreed to acquire [indiscernible], a prestige makeup brand with a unique positioning that is complementary to our other makeup brands. [indiscernible] strengths is in foundations and complexions products, which are a high or loyalty areas. It has grown rapidly by offering a broad and balanced range of shades that appeals to multicultural consumers, along with a strong presence in fast-growing North America specialty-multi retailers. It also is active on social media and attracts a diverse and loyal fan base. We also see great opportunity to strategically expand the brand internationally as well as in travel retail and online, which are key growth areas for the company.
Strong gains in fragrance this quarter were again led by our luxury brands that are experiencing rapid global growth. Our newest fragrance brand experiences [indiscernible] to authentic point of view. Similar to our makeup fastest brands and are resonating strongly with the new consumers. 
For example, we are continue to build out our seasonal Le Labo brand to reach more of its target consumers by opening select high-growth department store doors and freestanding stores globally. At the same time, the brand has had strong LIFO growth, leading to exceptional sales increases.
Jo Malone superior growth was reinforced by its travel retail business, which benefits from increasing awareness of the brand in key local markets. Jo Malone is capitalizing on growth opportunities by opening new store formats in the travel retail channel. After many quarters of strong growth, Jo Malone rose 3 places in the rankings to become the third largest women prestige private brand in the United States in the first quarter. This is especially noteworthy given the brand's limited distribution in only 250 doors in the entire United States. Jo Malone is the second largest prestige fragrance brand in its home market, the U.K., and growing double digits, yet it has just 1/10 [ph] the number of points of sales compared to the market leader.
We are anticipating on our high-end fragrances will perform well in the holiday season with enticing gift offering and new classic scents, and we expect that momentum to carry into the second half of the fiscal year.
In skincare, natural products are growing in popularity, and we are well positioned with our Aveda and Origins brands. Aveda's news to Lazada's [ph] skincare line which creates glowing skin inspired by [indiscernible] healing art of India led to the brand robust skincare sales growth worldwide exceeding its expectations. Aveda plans to broaden its franchise in the next few 2 [ph] months with masks for the face and eyes centered on the theme at weddings.
Origins strengthened its leading position in facial masks, and its skincare sales climbed at double digits in every region. This includes a new line of face and body masks infused with tea that provides immediate benefit and feature desired by today's consumers.
Many of our brands are enhancing their distribution in the fastest-growing channels to reach target consumers where they are shopping today. Our brands continue to successfully penetrate the specialty-multi channel globally. In the U.S., Clinique continue its [indiscernible] rollout in Ulta. And in September, Estée Lauder introduced a greater selection of top-selling skincare and makeup products in 30 Ulta doors and on ulta.com. 
Clinique, Origins and Bumble and bumble added location in Sephora stores inside JCPenney. Our brands are also further penetrating the channels in foreign markets. For example, in Germany, GLAMGLOW successfully partnered with Douglas the target core consumers throughout all of its locations. Likewise when Smashbox entered Finland this quarter, it reached its target consumer by launching in the specialty retailer kits.
Our travel retail business was vibrant in the quarter as our net sales growth far outpaced fashion and traffic growth despite some difficult markets including Hong Kong, Japan and Latin America. Our smaller and midsized brands as well as M-A-C are in a high demand in the channel. They all increased double digits at retail with very solid like-door [ph] growth as we continue to accelerate their rollout. Geographically, Asia Pacific was the best performer in travel retail and the makeup, fragrance and haircare categories grew sharply. 
We expect to continue our strong sales increases in travel retail, fueled in part by positive traffic growth, which is projected to rise during the next 3 [ph] quarters.
Our online sales this quarter were once again very strong. Mobile continues to be the fastest-growing area in e- and m-commerce and trend also reflected in our business.
In the quarter, m-commerce [ph] represented 41% of our online global sales, up from 37% last year. And sales from mobile devices grew 23%. In the recent period, we opened approximately 100 new sites, mostly with international retailers.
Looking at our heritage brands. Estée Lauder and Clinique have remained stable. Importantly, in the quarter, both brands grew in makeup globally. They have generated makeup growth for several quarters, and we expect each of them to accelerate the makeup business in the second half of the year. 
Estée Lauder's international makeup sales were vibrant, with a particularly strong performance in the U.K., following the Brexit vote. When a drop in the pound increased in a wave of tourists, the brand sold specialty well in department stores, favored by foreign visitors such as Harrods where Estée Lauder retain sales grows [ph] 20%. Estée Lauder Double Wear foundation was a strong seller worldwide fueled by its innovative cushion stick applicator. In skincare, Estée Lauder had global success with Advanced Night Repair, another powerful growth engine for the brand. Estée Lauder continue to see strategic opportunity to accelerate its business this year by fueling these 2 core pillars. With new products and compelling digital assets as it targets a wider consumer base and increased penetration in higher growth channels.
Clinique business in North America increased in makeup and skincare, driven by higher sales in specialty-multi retailers, online and in select department stores. Clinique also had solid growth in makeup internationally, with strong results for its new foundation called Superbalanced Silk Makeup. It has started a redesign of some counters and stores in the United States and Hong Kong. And as a result, sales climbed in those locations. 
Clinique expects to broaden its reach in high-growth channels, particularly in North America, and at the same time, work with department store to increase traffic at counters and accelerate its growth.
Improving productivity is the focus for our entire organization. Through Leading Beauty Forward, our multiyear initiative, we aim to increase our efficiency and reduce costs to achieve both leverage and for reinvestment in growth drivers. Additionally, we will improve our speed to market [indiscernible]. We are making good progress. Much of the organization design work and several projects are underway.
In closing, we continue to deploy the strategies to drive our sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Our diversified business is fueled by multiple engines of growth, and our financial agility  enable us to quickly move resources to take advantage of changing consumer demand and new opportunities.
This year, we will further accelerate our stronger growth engines, reinvigorate slower areas and create more resources to invest in opportunities and capabilities as we adopt to the changing dynamics in prestige beauty. 
As we discussed in our August call, our sales profile this year is weighted to the second half and is rolling out as we had anticipated. We expect that fiscal year '17 will be another successful year that will advance our financial performance and strengthen our leadership.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracy."

First, I will review our fiscal 2017 first quarter result and then I will cover our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward program. 
Net sales for the quarter -- for the first quarter were $2.87 billion, up 2% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Incremental sales from By Kilian contributed approximately 20 basis points of this growth.
From a geographic perspective, Europe, the Middle East and Africa South saw the fastest growth again this quarter. Net sales rose 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth from the travel retail channel, developed markets like Italy and Spain as well as most of the region's emerging markets. Sales in Germany and the U.K. were also solid.
Last quarter we called are 2 issues that we predicted would put some pressure on our first quarter sales in EMEA. As we anticipated, sales in France declined due to a significant drop in tourism against the tough comparison with an exceptionally strong first quarter of last year. 
Net sales in the Middle East fell sharply, as the distributors in the area significantly rebalanced inventory levels to adjust to weaker retail traffic, due primarily to the impact of lower oil prices on the overall macro environment. We do see some travel and luxury consumers from the Middle East taking advantage of the weaker pound and buying more in the U.K. Excluding the Middle East, the EMEA region grew 10%. 
Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was led by Korea, which grew low double digit, followed by strong growth in Australia, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan. China grew in line with the overall region. Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline. Excluding Hong Kong, the region grew 7%.
Net sales in the Americas declined 2% in constant currency. Latin America grew 15%, led by strong growth in Mexico while Brazil remains challenged.
Canada rose low single digits, and the U.S. declined mid-single digits. Our sales through both online and specialty-multi channels again rose double digits, however, we saw continued declines in the brick and mortar business of midtier department stores as well as tourist-driven freestanding stores. Additionally, the U.S. had a tough comparison to the prior year, which included some major new product launches in department stores.
Net sales by product category were led by the 10% constant currency growth in fragrance for the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on the higher-margin, top tier segment of the category. Jo Malone was once again the largest contributor to our overall fragrance growth.
The launch of Basil & Neroli, strong comp door growth and expanded customer reach drove a strong double-digit increase in sales. By Kilian contributed incremental sales, adding about 1 point to the fragrance category growth, and Le Labo also grew rapidly. Makeup sales rose 1% in constant currency. Tom Ford delivered exceptional growth, nearly doubling its makeup business this quarter.
Smashbox rose double-digit, and Estée Lauder and Clinique innovation and makeup also drove the category as previously mentioned. And as Fabrizio discussed earlier, M-A-C continued its strong double-digit trend in most international markets. However, the brands U.S. business continues to experience lower foot traffic in tourism and its core channels of distribution, constraining overall makeup growth in the quarter.
Haircare sales increased 1% in constant currency, primarily due to growth from Bumble and bumble. Skincare sales were less than 1% in constant currency. Double-digit growth, supported by strong innovation from La Mer, Origins and Aveda was mostly offset by lower sales from Estée Lauder, which had a major launch in the prior year period and from Clinique, reflecting continued softness in Asia and in EMEA.
Our gross margin declined 30 basis points from the prior year, due primarily to unfavorable currency and a slightly unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales increased 10 basis points. Higher store operating costs and selling expenses associated with our retail store growth, along with the accounting for stock compensation expenses, were mostly offset by favorable currency transactions and a gain on the sale of a fixed asset as well as more prudent expense management. As a result, operating income fell 1%, and operating margin decreased 30 basis points. Net earnings increased 2% to $314 million, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Diluted EPS rose 3% to $0.84 or 5% in constant currency.
Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to more prudent expense management.
As you are aware, we have seasonally higher working capital requirements in our fiscal first quarter as we build inventory to support the holiday selling period.
During the quarter, we used $150 million in net cash flows from operating activities, and we invested $85 million in capital projects. We used $222 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares of our stock and paid $111 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that our board approved a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the next quarter and for the full year. As Fabrizio mentioned, we continue to expect sales to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency for the fiscal 2017 year. This range includes the expected contribution from BECCA as we plan to close the transaction this quarter. On a preliminary basis, we estimated that BECCA could add approximately 30 basis points to sales growth and dilute EPS by $0.02 in fiscal 2007 [ph], which won't affect the range of our forecast. Currency translation is expected to depress sales by less than 1%, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, $1.22 for the ground and $1.05 for the yen for the fiscal year.
Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%.
For the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 5% to 6% in constant currency, reflecting new product launches and holiday promotions as well as easier comparisons in the U.S. and France. The Middle East and Hong Kong are expected to continue to win [ph] sales growth until the second half. Negative currency translation is estimated at approximately 2 percentage points. Our most recent acquisitions could add approximately 50 basis points to sales growth for the quarter.
EPS is forecast between $1.10 and $1.15 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.05 dilution from currency. The acceleration in EPS growth implied in the second half of the year is directly related to the sales growth trends.
We are pleased with the performance we made in our strategic initiatives in the first quarter, and we remain focused on delivering another successful year despite the volatile political, economic and currency environment.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

We talked a bit about the innovation that we're expecting in the second half. We talked about pricing, and we also talked about an acceleration of consumer coverage for many of our smaller brands. As you're aware, we most recently acquired a number of smaller brands that are in expansion mode. Brands like Jo Malone and Tom Ford and others have quite a bit of expansion opportunity as well ahead of them. And so they are certainly much of that distribution growth is planned for the second half of the year. If you were to think about the second half in terms of the building blocks that we typically talk to you about for the full year, 2% is roughly -- a little over 2% is roughly the pricing expectation that we expect to get in the second half of the year. New distribution will be about 3% to 4%, so a bit of a step up versus the first half of the year. And then our existing and new business, including our newer acquisitions, are another 3% to 4%. So that's how we get to the numbers for the full year that we guided to in terms of 6% to 7%."

And as far as M-A-C is concerned is first of all, I said in my prepared remarks that M-A-C is still growing double digit in many of the global markets where there is equally new [indiscernible] and new competition that there is in the U.S. And M-A-C internationally has been growing in line with the very fast growing market, continuing to well compete with mask and all the mass brands that despite some of them are now using prestige codes. They continue to grow on average less than the prestige brand. So M-A-C continue to be one of our most successful brands and a fast-growing brand, and we will count on this for the future. In the U.S., there is the specific 2 issues in the short term that we have already commented on, which is obviously M-A-C is very concentrated and focused on high internal distribution and presence in high touristic areas and in nitty department stores and the traffic in both of this area has been lower, significant lower than in the past. And so M-A-C will need to react to that. The second is the programs. And you're right, there is new competition. There is some very successful brands. We have acquired one of them, BECCA, and there are many other successful brands, particularly specialty-multi, which are a new competition among the millennial generation and M-A-C is stepping up their activity there, innovation, their collection, their social media and their penetration of this new target group with new activity. That's why in our prepared, we brought up the example of Selena and what's happening there when M-A-C speaks to this target growth more directly. And we plan to do those much more also in the second semester of the fiscal year. So net, we expect M-A-C to continue to be one of our strong growth brands in the long term."

But it seems philosophically as though maintaining the top line of 6-plus percent really dominates the other 2. And arguably, that's not wrong assuming the 6-plus percent growth is there. But I guess as we hear questions today related to the top line, what would it take for you to see, whether in your business or in your end markets, where you'd say, ""You know what, we're going to follow back just a bit on top line investments and see to generate some of our profits, maybe improve free cash flow by going more after margin."" I guess, my concern is you've been growing 6, 7, 8 in a market growing 4 to 5 for a while. And clearly, that can't go on forever, at least not without significantly higher costs. I think the market's concern is that's what we're starting to see this quarter. And to that point, if you do happen to trend short of 6% in fiscal '17, I think the market's fears that you'll continue to spend as if you were still growing at that level, leading ultimately to deleverage an EPS reduction. So can you just help frame for us how you're monitoring top line trends? And give us confidence that if the revenue does start to fall short, that the flexibility you've been speaking of the past few quarters can be applied to cost management to better protect bottom line and even the fact -- even in the face of a top line disappointment?"

So I will like also Tracey to add on this. But first of all, our -- in a market which is growing 4% to 5%, as I said, our long-term opportunity of growth remain between 6% and 8%. And again, it's between 6% and 8%. It could be 8% in some years. Of co",528,"Yes. So I will like also Tracey to add on this. But first of all, our -- in a market which is growing 4% to 5%, as I said, our long-term opportunity of growth remain between 6% and 8%. And again, it's between 6% and 8%. It could be 8% in some years. Of course, those could be 6% in others depending on the external situation and in -- of our internal innovation program and priorities and spending as you mentioned. So I still believe the range for the long term is the right range and that -- and we are moving to that and continue to use this range as an opportunity. The key areas of opportunities, we continue to have pricing power. So as we say in our -- for example, in our 6% to 7% this year, which is a representation of our long-term view is 2 points are coming from pricing. And then 2.5 [ph] are coming from distribution and 2.[ph] -- 2.5 from organic growth. So our portfolio brands as [indiscernible] maybe for still of a lot of opportunity of more distribution of at least half of our brands, which are high growth, high productivity and not at all available to the global consumers in many areas. And this will be true for many years to come. As an example, even our recent acquisition, BECCA, is enormous opportunities for growing also international, online, in travel retail and all these areas, which will be value and today are now leveraged by the brands which is doing very well among its target growth. And we have planned the example like this in our portfolio. The 2.5% organic growth in a market, which is growing 4% to 5% in prestige that continues to grow much faster than mass is frankly achievable if we get our plans together. So we still believe that the 6% to 8% range is achievable, but also it's possible that in some areas will be 6% and not 8%, as we have demonstrated in the past. In terms of your second question, which is our flexibility, it's actually the key point. Our financial flexibility is there, and we are regularly adjusting resources to -- not only to the overall growth level but also to the different priorities that we have around the world and to reallocating resources to the winning areas. That I believe is the most important element of flexibility we have demonstrated to have. Why this is important? Because in this moment, the markets around the world is very volatile, and there is a lot to change going on. So the ability to adapt and to reallocate resources in a dry way is one of the biggest trends that I think we can exercise to continue to succeed. And we are ready to do it. We are prepared to do this, and our Leading Beauty Forward program among other benefits is also the benefit of making us stronger in our ability to do exactly that. So to close on your question, yes, we have committed to adjust and adopt costs to the future sales growth opportunity that we will have."

The rest of M-A-C growth around the world can be double digits as being high single digits in the quarter, which has closed, and is projected to be double digit. So a brand that has a double-digit power already demonstrated an enormous amount of opportunity, including extra distribution opportunity internationally, is a brand that can definitely grow and go back to grow very fast. Now in the U.S. specifically, the growth -- to go back to growth, there will be certain actions that are required, including new successful innovation and some other activity in social media that I can understand, you say, they need to be proven successful before believing them, but we know where they are and so we have trust in them. But even in term of mix, the power of the brands will allow a double-digit growth in that medium, long term. And then on the -- that was the first part."

So the -- then on Estée Lauder and Clinique, as we said, we have stabilized the brands. These brands have been declining in the past. We have stabilized them, and we started growing consistently that makeup apart. As we said, we have said that our program was to start growing from makeup. And now the quarter we just closed is 1 more quarter where this seems to be now sticking and we keep doing this well. By the way, makeup is one of our priorities, and a lot of the growth in the second semester of this fiscal year as we anticipated will come from makeup acceleration. And Estée Lauder in Clinique will be part of contributing to this makeup acceleration in the second part of the fiscal year. Next, we need to address the skincare trends on these 2 brands. This has been slower than what we wanted. But in the situation with Hong Kong, not really been declining and the traffic softness in U.S. department stores, which are 2 of the biggest skincare contributors to these brands has been tough, but we have now plans to also add skincare acceleration to the already achieved makeup acceleration. In our -- and the last thing I want to say, in our plan, we play the portfolio brands. And I said other times that we have 1/3 of our portfolio, which is growing always double digit. 1/3 of our portfolio that could be just growing single, low single digit. And 1/3 of our portfolio that is growing high single digit. And in this way, we deliver the total. And so yes, we are not saying that the big brands have the role to drive 6 to 8 on the high side. The big brands that are going to drive growth but there are the other brands in the portfolio we are trying double digit and the portfolio mix is what's driving our long-term algorithm. Think of it like 1/3 pricing, 1/3 distribution, 1/3 organic growth and 1/3, the small brands, the high-growth brands; 1/3, medium-sized brands and then the big brands. And that's why this flexibility of managing through the different levels of growth and different brands in the portfolio and the different countries make us a more -- a less volatile, more reliable, more sustainable company than any other company. Today, company that just counts a 1 or 2 brands given the volatility of the worlds and only 1 or 2 markets I believe are less reliable in the long term than the model that we build."

I also said Germany in my prepared remarks and Hong Kong are other examples of market that are driving down, but down significantly the growth. Middle East had a very difficult moment, and so double-digit declines numbers that are impacting in quarter 1, offset by other phenomenon. So it's not only the U.S. But in the U.S., was specifically M-A-C. The rest of our portfolio in the U.S. has been performing well as we anticipated also in the prepared remarks. Lauder and Clinique makeup in the U.S. has been growing of both brands, for example. So that's the -- how we fix it I think I just answered this question. We will improve the trend in M-A-C in the U.S., continue to accelerate our distribution in that or roll our makeup brands that have distribution opportunity internationally, turn around our M-A-C organic growth in the U.S. and continued to accelerate our winning makeup brands around the world also in the organic growth with most programs, particularly outstanding innovation and better social media plan, and we will activate the planned price increases in January that we plan to activate."

And then my bigger sort of conceptual question, I get and I understand the opportunity for distribution expansion for so many of the brands in so many new markets, and I see why that will drive a third of your growth and that's great, but my concern is that you're gaining more market share seems through distribution expansion as opposed to with your own innovation. And I look at your 2 really big new products over the last year, new dimensions and Estée Edit, which we heard about for several quarters before they were launched, they were supposed to be game changers. New dimensions was supposed to set up a whole new category. Estée Edit was supposed to revitalize the brand with millennial. And both of those brands have fallen well short of your expectations. I know it may take time, and Estée Edit maybe a slow build, well that kind of stuff. But my bigger question for retail, and you even mentioned it at Barclays that the company is changing its focus less from blockbuster home runs, successful new product innovations and more smaller things. But I'm just wondering how big a change that is culturally? Does that change the cost to compete? Those kinds of things. Because that strikes me as a very, very different philosophy or approach to building your brands and launching new products than we've seen historically at the company."

You raised a lot of questions. So China, China, this was again a quarter where China retained [indiscernible] double digit. So we are very happy. China retail grew overall 10%.

So China, China, this was again a quarter where China retained [indiscernible] double digit. So we are very happy. China retail grew overall 10%. M-A-C in China grew outstandingly and our same door in China grew in 2%, yes. So that's the situation. So we have the gain good interesting growth in China. By the way, this is also driven by our makeup brands in a big way and by the makeup part of our heritage brands as well. And M-A-C is really strong driver of this growth in China among others. Same thing in Korea. We are competing very well with Korea brands. We have another quarter in which in Korea, we have been a very strong retail and continue to grow market share in the country of Korean brands, which makes us very competitive. And again, this is being driven by a lot of our makeup brands as well, including M-A-C. The second part of your question is the innovation plan. Definitely, New Dimension was below our expectation and in fact, by the way, the loan for New Dimension last year was in the first quarter and part of what we see is in skincare this year in term of base is that we are anniversarying a base where there was the launch of New Dimension, and although below our expectation was significant in term of overall volumes of innovation. And the future of our innovation is changing as I explained in the Barclays conference. Meaning there are some real exciting innovation, less blockbuster. We believe this is much more in line with current consumers' expectations where consumer want to try new products and [indiscernible] them. And the model is not -- the breakthrough model assume a lot of advertising before the product is in store. So we have these higher risk financial. While the model where we used the growth of innovation to attract new consumers and to engage them. And then when we see success, we further accelerate and further leverage this innovation is a model that particularly on our midsized smaller brands is much more manageable and allow faster and better financial results from this innovation than in the past. So actually we are going to add a mix, we still are going to have some breakthrough technology innovation and some more commercial innovations, including product, packaging, aesthetics, et cetera, innovation. The fact that a lot of the growth come from makeup is increasing the percentage of innovation, which is not about breakthrough technology obviously but this is still part of our portfolio. But the way in which we will look even this breakthrough technology will be less risky upfront investment, a more gradual evolution of the winners. And that is a change in our innovation program and is a change that will be and is associated already with some great results where we have the right innovation and will be associated I believe with a lot of good success innovation. As I said before, last year, we went from 20% of our sales growth coming from innovation fiscal year '15 to 24% coming in fiscal year '16 [ph] from innovation. In term of the cost of innovation, which was last part of your question, frankly, I believe is the opposite. This new improvement of our innovation program is decreasing the cost of innovation, because it's decreasing the face of it. It's decreasing the amount of money that our upfront on innovation that don't work and are allowing us a better ability in tailor the resources where the consumers react positively to our innovation. So it's increasing the effectiveness and the rate of return on our innovation."

And so we're very excited about that. Certainly, we expect that, that is going to drive a great amount of volume and sales for M-A-C. In terms of Jo Malone, many of our brands are fragrance brands. Obviously, we're well positioned for holiday. We are still mindful off the fact that there are many parts of the globe that are weak, and certainly Fabrizio talked about some of those. Hong Kong, the Middle East, we're not expecting a big pickup in those markets in the second quarter in the holiday season. We expect the U.K. to have a bit of a pickup, certainly given the currency favorability there. We do expect that, that will be the case, and we were actually in the U.K. last week and certainly saw quite a bit of traffic in the U.K. in the shop. So I would say it's a mixed bag. I think we're very in tuned with what's happening around our globe and certainly our regional presidents are as we migrate into this holiday season.

And this, you can make the same assumption by channel, by country. We will manage the portfolio of different overall levels. So specifically to M-A-C, M-A-C is international. So outside of the United States, M-A-C is a relatively untapped brand in term of price and distribution in many countries. Take countries like China where M-A-C is really, really on top. It's enormous opportunities, only a limited number of cities and a lot to go, and there are many examples like that. And there are other places where M-A-C is well penetrated, well developed like the U.S. or the U.K. So depend by the mix. Each one of this brand has a very different mix and portfolio. That's why I don't think we are going to deploy every single brand and every single opportunity in price and distribution of organic growth, their brand. And that's why summarize it with the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. And then -- so this will continue. And the second part of the question is the role of acquisitions. Yes, we have -- in the fragrance business, the role of acquisition is being to create the engines of growth of this new high-end of seasonal fragrance category where we want to lead and to drive growth. And I think this quarter, you see for the first time a very significant sign of that and the potential of it in the long term. We are doing priorities where we did in makeup [indiscernible] or makeup and then we will continue to drive that. In the other categories, acquisition will play a role like they always play and then we continue to play a role to create the right portfolio brands and to create the right possibility of growing in areas where we have strategic opportunity or strategic gaps. And so you can expect us to continue leveraging acquisition and continuing analyzing the opportunities on new acquisition in the future to manage these strategic gaps or opportunities. And last, we have also some minority investments around the world that could be very interesting in the long term. For example, Dr. Jart+ in Korea, which is one of the fastest-growing Korean brands, where we have a minority investment that could be an acquisition in the future is an example of strategic opportunities that we continue to enrich our different engines of growth. And to close, I mean, we are building engines of growth, differentiated, different than many to diversifying our opportunity for growth in the long term. That is the strategy. And frankly, we are making great progress on it quarter by quarter."

Across our business, many brands, counters and channels achieved double-digit sales gains. Our strongest performers were our small and midsized brands, particularly, those in the luxury tier, many European markets and young line, specialty multi and travel retail channels. Yet as we had anticipated, our strong gains were partially offset by challenging markets and economic conditions in certain countries. 
In constant currency, our sales rose 2% and adjusted EPS increased 5%. We managed our business with a full year perspective. So even though the first quarter top line growth is starting off at its lower than usual pace, we are confident in our ability to achieve the solid sales and earnings growth we forecasted for fiscal year '17. 
Our first quarter growth was lower, primarily due to ongoing challenge in U.S. mid-tier department stores caused by lower traffic, the market slowdown in the Middle East and difficult comparison in France and Germany and a continued negative trend in Hong Kong. All these challenges were anticipated, and plans are in place to gradually accelerate our sales growth quarter by quarter, and position us to deliver our full fiscal year plan.
Despite headwinds, there are expected -- we are expected to continue in some areas -- sorry, despite headwinds are expected to continue in some areas. We have plans to further leverage our stronger brands, channels and counters. We have robust holiday programs and a strong innovation pipeline, exciting opportunities to reach new target consumers and geographies, especially with our fast-growing brands and compelling programs to better engage shoppers. By being well diversified to having multiple engines of growth, we are able to activate the drivers that we believe will fuel stronger sales.
These are expected to include a number of international markets, the makeup and fragrance categories, and target distribution opportunities. We are reaffirming our previously stated goal of constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2017. This will come from a combination of factors.
Our organic growth is expected to accelerate, mainly in makeup and fragrance, fueled by strong innovation in the second half, and supported by greater social media initiatives for improved consumer engagement. We should have easier comparisons in several markets since external events that impacted our results last year will be in our base.
Also contributing to growth will be new points of distribution globally for our fast-growing high-productivity brands, with a higher concentration coming in the second half, as well as planned price increases. Additionally, the planned acquisition of BECCA will provide incremental sales.  As a result, we are also reaffirming our goal of adjusted constant currency EPS growth of 8% to 10% for full year.
In the past several months, we have continued to make excellent progress on our strategic objectives. We believe that the industry's strong growth in global makeup sales will continue. So we are focusing on building and strengthening our makeup portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved solid makeup growth in several brands, however, the total category was affected by declines at M-A-C in the United States, owing to fewer foreign tourists, particularly in New York City and Florida, is lower traffic in department stores. M-A-C is a powerful and authentic brand that speaks to all ages, races and sexes, and we expect its U.S. business to deliver stronger results through the rest of the year.
As of October, M-A-C U.S. sales started to improve. Thanks to the launch of its successful Selena makeup Collection, and the new range of lipstick called Liptensity. The Selena Collection was inspired by the late singer and her huge fan base, and accounted for the highest online traffic in 1 day on the brand site. M-A-C will bring back the Selena Collection in January to meet continued demand. It has other exciting collaborations in plans, including a Nutcracker themed holiday collection and compelling social media programs that will leverage M-A-C rapidly expansion, expanding fan base, which now includes 16 million global Facebook fans and 12 million followers on Instagram. The brand also has an active presence on YouTube, Twitter and other popular digital platforms right now. M-A-C's international business grew in line with the global prestige makeup, fueled by double-digit growth in most European and Asian markets. Internationally, we expect M-A-C to grow double digit in the fiscal year and gaining share, driven by continued organic growth, stronger innovation program, expansion of social media and new opportunity to reach target consumer that don't yet have access to the brand. Today, M-A-C is sold in a relatively small and select number of doors in each market, and it is an opportunity for us to further build its presence where it is underrepresented, primarily in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in the EMEA region and in China. M-A-C doors are among the most productive of the entire industry.
Smashbox, our pure-play makeup brand, generated double-digit global growth for the quarter, and we expect to deliver strong double-digit increases for the fiscal year. The brand is focused on winning in the specialty-multi and direct-to-consumer channels, and recently redesigned its U.S. e-commerce site for a greater consumer engagement. 
Our Tom Ford brand had an outstanding quarter, with its makeup business nearly doubling, led by its popular new lipsticks. Makeup is expected to continue to be a major growth driver, and the brand should benefit from upcoming color collection, inspired by the designers' runway fashion. Fragrance represent the majority of this luxury brand business, and continues to generate strong momentum.
La Mer, our luxury skincare brand, just launched its innovative skin color collection, which includes 15 shades of foundation, a growing subcategory, plus powder and concealer. These products incorporate the brand's signature Miracle Broth, and are expected to capitalize on growing demand [indiscernible] skincare with makeup. The collection has increased traffic to the La Mer counters and websites, and the brand anticipates it will attract new consumers and provide incremental sales to its core products of moisturizers, eye creams and serums.
We are also building on our global leadership in Prestige makeup. 2 weeks ago, we agreed to acquire BECCA, a prestige makeup brand with a unique positioning that is complementary to our other makeup brands. BECCA's strength is in foundations and complexions products, which are their high or loyalty areas. It has grown rapidly by offering a broad and balanced range of shades that appeal to multicultural consumers, along with a strong presence in fast-growing North America specialty-multi retailers. It also is active on social media, and attracts a diverse and loyal fan base. We also see great opportunity to strategically expand the brand internationally, as well as in travel retail and online, which are key growth areas for the company.
Strong gains in fragrance this quarter were again led by our luxury brands that are experiencing rapid global growth. Our newest fragrance brands' experience is trusted to authentic point of view, similar to our makeup artist brands, and are resonating strongly with the new consumers. For example, we have continued to build out our seasonal Le Labo brand to reach more of its target consumers by opening select high-growth department store doors, and freestanding stores globally. At the same time, the brand has had strong light door growth, leading to exceptional sales increases.
Jo Malone, superior growth was reinforced by its travel retail business, which benefits from increasing awareness of the brand in key local markets. Jo Malone is capitalizing on growth opportunities by opening new store formats in the travel retail channel. After many quarters of strong growth, Jo Malone rose 3 places in the rankings to become the third largest women prestige private brand in the United States in the first quarter. This is especially noteworthy, given the brand's limited distribution in only 250 doors in the entire United States. Jo Malone is the second largest prestige fragrance brand in its home market, the U.K., and growing double digits, yet it has just 1/10 the number of points of sales compared to the market leader.
We are anticipating on our high-end fragrances will perform well in the holiday season, with enticing gift offering and new classic scents, and we expect their momentum to carry into the second half of the fiscal year. In skincare, natural products are growing in popularity, and we are well positioned with our Aveda and Origins brands. Aveda's news to Lazada's skincare line, which creates glowing skin inspired by ancient healing art of India, led to the brand robust skincare sales growth worldwide, exceeding its expectations. Aveda plans to broaden their franchise in the next few months, with masks for the face and eyes centered on the theme of weddings.
Origins strengthened its leading position in facial masks, and its skincare sales climbed at double digits in every region. This includes a new line of face and body masks, infused with tea that provides immediate benefit and feature desired by today's consumers. Many of our brands are enhancing their distribution in the fastest-growing channels to reach target consumers where they are shopping today. Our brands continue to successfully penetrate the specialty-multi channel globally. In the U.S., Clinique continue its rollout in Ulta. And in September, Estée Lauder introduced a curated selection of top-selling skincare and makeup products in 30 Ulta doors and on ulta.com. 
Clinique, Origins and Bumble and bumble added location in Sephora stores inside JCPenney. Our brands are also further penetrating the channels in foreign markets. For example, in Germany, GLAMGLOW successfully partnered with Douglas to target core consumers throughout all of its locations. Likewise, when Smashbox entered Finland this quarter, it reached its target consumer by launching in the specialty retailer kits.  Our travel retail business was vibrant in the quarter, as our net sales growth far outpaced fashion and traffic growth despite some difficult markets, including Hong Kong, Japan and Latin America. Our smaller and midsized brands, as well as M-A-C, are in a high demand in the channel. They all increased double digits at retail, with very solid light door growth as we continue to accelerate their rollout. Geographically, Asia Pacific was the best performer in travel retail and the makeup, fragrance and haircare categories grew sharply. 
We expect to continue our strong sales increases in travel retail, fueled in part by positive traffic growth, which is projected to rise during the next 3 quarters. Our online sales this quarter were once again very strong. Mobile continues to be the fastest-growing area in e- and m-commerce, and trend also reflected in our business. In the quarter, m-commerce represented 41% of our online global sales, up from 37% last year. And sales from mobile devices grew 23%. In the recent period, we opened approximately 100 new sites, mostly with international retailers.
Looking at our heritage brands. Estée Lauder and Clinique have remained stable. Importantly, in the quarter, both brands grew in makeup globally. They have generated makeup growth for several quarters, and we expect each of them to accelerate their makeup business in the second half of the year. 
Estée Lauder's international makeup sales were vibrant, with a particularly strong performance in the U.K., following the Brexit vote. When a drop in the pound increased in a wave of tourists, the brand sold specialty well in department stores, favored by foreign visitors, such as Harrods, where Estée Lauder retail sales growth 20%. Estée Lauder Double Wear foundation was a strong seller worldwide, fueled by its innovative cushion stick applicator. In skincare, Estée Lauder had global success with Advanced Night Repair, another powerful growth engine for the brand. Estée Lauder continue to see strategic opportunity to accelerate its business this year by fueling these 2 core pillars, with new products and compelling digital assets as it targets a wider consumer base and increased penetration in higher growth channels.
Clinique business in North America increased in makeup and skincare, driven by higher sales in specialty-multi retailers, online and in select department stores. Clinique also had solid growth in makeup internationally, with strong results for its new foundation, called Superbalanced Silk Makeup. It has started a redesign of some counters and stores in the United States and Hong Kong, and as a result, sales climbed in those locations. 
Clinique expects to broaden its reach in high-growth channels, particularly in North America, and at the same time, work with department store to increase traffic at counters and accelerate its growth. Improving productivity is the focus for our entire organization. Through Leading Beauty Forward, our multiyear initiative, we aim to increase our efficiency and reduce costs to achieve both leverage and for reinvestment in growth drivers. Additionally, we will improve our speed to market and agility. We are making good progress. Much of the organization design work and several projects are underway.
In closing, we continue to deploy the strategies to drive our sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Our diversified business is fueled by multiple engines of growth, and our financial agility enable us to quickly move resources to take advantage of changing consumer demand and new opportunities.
This year, we will further accelerate our stronger growth engines, reinvigorate slower areas, and create more resources to invest in opportunities and capabilities as we adopt to the changing dynamics in prestige beauty. 
As we discussed in our August call, our sales profile this year is weighted to the second half, and is rolling out as we had anticipated. We expect that fiscal year '17 will be another successful year that will advance our financial performance and strengthen our leadership.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracy."

First, I will review our fiscal 2017 first quarter result, and then I will cover our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges, primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward program. 
Net sales for the quarter -- for the first quarter were $2.87 billion, up 2% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Incremental sales from By Kilian contributed approximately 20 basis points of this growth. From a geographic perspective, Europe, the Middle East and Africa saw the fastest growth again this quarter. Net sales rose 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth from the travel retail channel, developed markets like Italy and Spain, as well as most of the region's emerging markets. Sales in Germany and the U.K. were also solid. Last quarter, we called out 2 issues that we predicted would put some pressure on our first quarter sales in EMEA. As we anticipated, sales in France declined due to a significant drop in tourism against the tough comparison with an exceptionally strong first quarter of last year. 
Net sales in the Middle East fell sharply, as distributors in the area significantly rebalanced inventory levels to adjust to weaker retail traffic, due primarily to the impact of lower oil prices on the overall macro environment. We do see some travel and luxury consumers from the Middle East, taking advantage of the weaker pound, and buying more in the U.K. Excluding the Middle East, the EMEA region grew 10%. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was led by Korea, which grew low double digit, followed by strong growth in Australia, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan. China grew in line with the overall region. Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline. Excluding Hong Kong, the region grew 7%.
Net sales in the Americas declined 2% in constant currency. Latin America grew 15%, led by strong growth in Mexico, while Brazil remains challenged. Canada rose low single digits, and the U.S. declined mid-single digits. Our sales through both online and specialty-multi channels again rose double digits. However, we saw continued declines in the brick and mortar business of mid-tier department stores, as well as tourist-driven freestanding stores. Additionally, the U.S. had a tough comparison to the prior year, which included some major new product launches in department stores. Net sales by product category were led by the 10% constant currency growth in fragrance for the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on the higher-margin, top-tier segment of the category. Jo Malone was once again the largest contributor to our overall fragrance growth. The launch of Basil & Neroli, strong comp door growth and expanded customer reach drove a strong double-digit increase in sales. By Kilian contributed incremental sales, adding about 1 point to the fragrance category growth, and Le Labo also grew rapidly. Makeup sales rose 1% in constant currency. Tom Ford delivered exceptional growth, nearly doubling its makeup business this quarter.
Smashbox rose double-digit, and Estée Lauder and Clinique innovation and makeup also drove the category as previously mentioned. And as Fabrizio discussed earlier, M-A-C continued its strong double-digit trend in most international markets. However, the brands U.S. business continues to experience lower foot traffic in tourism and its core channels of distribution, constraining overall makeup growth in the quarter.  Haircare sales increased 1% in constant currency, primarily due to growth from Bumble and bumble. Skincare sales were less than 1% in constant currency. Double-digit growth, supported by strong innovation from La Mer, Origins and Aveda was mostly offset by lower sales from Estée Lauder, which had a major launch in the prior year period and from Clinique, reflecting continued softness in Asia and in EMEA.
Our gross margin declined 30 basis points from the prior year, due primarily to unfavorable currency and a slightly unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, increased 10 basis points. Higher store operating cost and selling expenses associated with our retail store growth, along with the accounting for stock compensation expenses, were mostly offset by favorable currency transactions and a gain on the sale of a fixed asset, as well as more prudent expense management. As a result, operating income fell 1%, and operating margin decreased 30 basis points. Net earnings increased 2% to $314 million, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Diluted EPS rose 3% to $0.84 or 5% in constant currency.
Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to more prudent expense management. As you are aware, we have seasonally higher working capital requirements in our fiscal first quarter, as we build inventory to support the holiday selling period.
During the quarter, we used $150 million in net cash flows from operating activities, and we invested $85 million in capital projects. We used $222 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares of our stock, and paid $111 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that our board approved a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the next quarter and for the full year. As Fabrizio mentioned, we continue to expect sales to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency for the fiscal 2017 year. This range includes the expected contribution from BECCA, as we plan to close the transaction this quarter. On a preliminary basis, we estimated that BECCA could add approximately 30 basis points to sales growth, and dilute EPS by $0.02 in fiscal 2017, which won't affect the range of our forecast. Currency translation is expected to depress sales by less than 1%, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, $1.22 for the pound and $1.05 for the yen for the fiscal year.
Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. For the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 5% to 6% in constant currency, reflecting new product launches and holiday promotions, as well as easier comparisons in the U.S. and France. The Middle East and Hong Kong are expected to continue to win sales growth until the second half. Negative currency translation is estimated at approximately 2 percentage points. Our most recent acquisitions could add approximately 50 basis points to sales growth for the quarter. EPS is forecast between $1.10 and $1.15 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.05 dilution from currency. The acceleration in EPS growth implied in the second half of the year is directly related to the sales growth trends. We are pleased with the performance we made in our strategic initiatives in the first quarter, and we remain focused on delivering another successful year despite the volatile political, economic and currency environment.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

We talked a bit about the innovation that we're expecting in the second half. We talked about pricing, and we also talked about an acceleration of consumer coverage for many of our smaller brands. As you're aware, we most recently acquired a number of smaller brands that are in expansion mode. Brands like Jo Malone and Tom Ford and others have quite a bit of expansion opportunity as well ahead of them, and so they are -- or certainly, much of that distribution growth is planned for the second half of the year. If you were to think about the second half in terms of the building blocks that we typically talk to you about for the full year, 2% is roughly -- a little over 2% is roughly the pricing expectation that we expect to get in the second half of the year. New distribution will be about 3% to 4%, so a bit of a step up versus the first half of the year. And then our existing and new business, including our newer acquisitions, are another 3% to 4%. So that's how we get to the numbers for the full year that we guided to in terms of 6% to 7%."

And as far as M-A-C is concerned is, first of all, I said in my prepared remarks M-A-C is still growing double digit in many of the global markets, where there is equally new -- is equally tough in new competition that there is in the U.S. And M-A-C, internationally, has been growing in line with the very fast growing market, continuing to well compete with mass and all the mass brands that despite some of them are now using ""prestige"", they continue to grow, on average less, than the prestige brand. So M-A-C continue to be one of our most successful brands and a fast-growing brand, and we will count on this for the future. In the U.S., there is the specific 2 issues in the short term that we have already commented on, which is obviously M-A-C is very concentrated and focused on high internal distribution and presence in high touristic areas and in mid-tier department stores and in the traffic in both of this area has been lower, significantly lower than in the past, and so M-A-C will need to react to that. The second is the programs, and you're right, there is new competition. There are some very successful brands. We have acquired one of them, BECCA, and there are many other successful brands, particularly specialty multi, which are a new competition among the millennial generation, and M-A-C is stepping up their activity, their innovation, their collection, their social media and their penetration of this new target group with new activity. That's why in our prepared remarks, we brought up the example of the Selena and what's happening there when M-A-C speaks to this target growth more directly. And we plan to do those much more also in the second semester of the fiscal year. So net, we expect M-A-C to continue to be one of our strong growth brands in the long term."

But it seems, philosophically, as though maintaining the top line at 6-plus-percent really dominates the other 2, and arguably that's not wrong, assuming the 6-plus percent growth is there. But I guess, as we hear questions today related to the top line, what would it take for you to see, whether in your business or in your end markets, where you'd say, ""You know what, we're going to throttle back just a bit on top line investment and seek to generate similar profits, maybe improve free cash flow by going more after margin."" I guess my concern is that you've been growing 6%, 7%, 8% in a market growing 4 to 5 for a while. And clearly, that can't go on forever, at least, not without significantly higher cost, and I think the market's concern is that's what we're starting to see this quarter. And to that point, if you do happen to trend short of 6% in fiscal '17, I think the market's fear is that you'll continue to spend as if you were still growing at that level, leading ultimately to deleverage an EPS reduction. So can you just help frame for us how you're monitoring top line trends? And give us confidence that if the revenue does start to fall short, that the flexibility you've been speaking of the past few quarters can be applied to cost management to better protect bottom line and even in the fact -- even in the face of top line disappointment?"

And then 2.5 are coming from distribution and 2.5 from organic growth. So our portfolio brands, as Tracey explained before, still offer a lot of opportunity of more distribution of at least half of our brands, which are high growth, high productivity and not at all available to the global consumers in many areas, and this will be true for many years to come. As an example, even our recent acquisition, BECCA, is enormous opportunities for growing also international, online, in travel retail and all these areas, which will be value, and today are now leveraged by a brand, which is doing very well among its target growth, and we have plenty example like this in our portfolio. The 2.5% organic growth in a market, which is growing 4% to 5% in prestige that continues to grow much faster than mass is frankly achievable if we get our plans together. So we still believe that the 6% to 8% range is achievable, but also it's possible that in some areas will be 6% and not 8%, as we have demonstrated in the past. In terms of your second question, which is our flexibility, it's actually the key point. Our financial flexibility is there, and we are regularly adjusting resources to -- not only to the overall growth level, but also to the different priorities that we have around the world and to reallocating resources to the winning areas. That, I believe, is the most important element of flexibility we have demonstrated to have. Why this is important? Because in this moment, the markets around the world is very volatile, and there is a lot of change going on. So the ability to adapt and to reallocate resources in a dry way is one of the biggest trends that I think we can exercise to continue to succeed, and we are ready to do it. We are prepared to do this, and our Leading Beauty Forward program, among other benefits, is also the benefit of making us stronger in our ability to do exactly that. So to close on your question, yes, we are committed to adjust and adopt costs to the future sales growth opportunity that we will have."

So we are seeing almost an equal offset in terms of some of the benefits that we're achieving from an organic growth standpoint in -- with some of those factors. As I had mentioned, I think, on our year-end call last year, that purchase accounting will bleed off over the next year or so, and you'll actually start to see some more of the margin flow through. One of the things that we also look at here, obviously, is EBITDA, given the fact that we have done a number of acquisitions in the last few years, and certainly, you'll see more progression in terms of our EBITDA margin."

The rest of M-A-C growth around the world can be double digit, as being high single digit in the quarter, which has closed, and is projected to be double digit. So a brand that has a double-digit power already demonstrated an enormous amount of opportunity, including extra distribution opportunity internationally, is a brand that can definitely grow and go back to grow very fast. Now in the U.S., specifically, the growth -- to go back to growth, there will be certain actions that are required, including new successful innovation, and some other activity in social media that I can understand. You say, they need to be proven successful before believing them, but we know where they are and so we have trust in them. But even in terms of mix, the power of the brands will allow a double-digit growth in that medium, long term, and then on the -- that was the first part."

So the -- then on Estée Lauder and Clinique, as we said, we have stabilized the brands. These brands have been declining in the past. We have stabilized them, and we started growing consistently the makeup part. As we said, we have said that our program was to start growing from makeup. And now the quarter we just closed is 1 more quarter where this seems to be now sticking, and we keep doing this well. By the way, makeup is one of our priority, and a lot of the growth in the second semester of this fiscal year, as we anticipated, will come from makeup acceleration. And Estée Lauder and Clinique will be part of contribution to this makeup acceleration in the second part of the fiscal year. Next, we need to address the skincare trend on these 2 brands. This has been slower than what we wanted. But in the situation with Hong Kong, not really been declining and the traffic softness in U.S. department stores, which are 2 of the biggest skincare contributors to these brands has been tougher, but we have now plans to also add skincare acceleration to the already achieved makeup acceleration. In our -- and the last thing I want to say, in our plan, we play the portfolio brands. And I said other times that we have 1/3 of our portfolio, which is growing always double digit, 1/3 of our portfolio that could be just growing single, low single digit, and 1/3 of our portfolio that is growing high single digit, and in this way, we deliver the total. And so yes, we are not saying that the big brands have the role to drive the 6 to 8 on the high side. The big brands have the role to drive growth, but there are -- the other brands in the portfolio, we are growing double digit, and the portfolio mix is what's driving our long-term algorithm. Think of it like 1/3 pricing, 1/3 distribution, 1/3 organic growth and 1/3 small brands, the high-growth brands; 1/3, the medium-sized brands and then the big brands. And that's why this flexibility of managing through the different levels of growth and different brands in the portfolio and the different countries make us a more -- a less volatile, more reliable, more sustainable company than any other company. Today, company that just counts on 1 or 2 brands, given the volatility of the worlds, and only 1 or 2 markets, I believe, are less reliable in the long term than the model that we build."

And then my bigger sort of conceptual question, I get and I understand the opportunity for distribution expansion for so many of the brands in so many new markets, and I see why that will drive 1/3 of your growth, and that's great. But my concern is that you're gaining more market share, it seems, through distribution expansion as opposed to with your own innovation. And I look at your 2 really big new products over the last year, new dimensions and Estée Edit, which we heard about for several quarters before they were launched. They were supposed to be game changers. New dimensions was supposed to set off a whole new category. Estée Edit was supposed to revitalize the brand with millennials. And both of those brands have fallen well short of your expectations. I know it may take time, and Estée Edit maybe a slow build and all that kind of stuff. But my bigger question for retail, and you even mentioned it at Barclays, that the company is changing its focus less from blockbuster home runs, successful new product innovations and more smaller things. But I'm just wondering how big a change that is culturally? Does that change the cost to compete, those kinds of things? Because that strikes me as a very, very different philosophy or approach to building your brands and launching new products than we've seen historically at the company."

You raised a lot of questions. So China, China, this was again a quarter where China retail touched double digit. So we are very happy. China retail grew overall 10%.

So China, China, this was again a quarter where China retail touched double digit. So we are very happy. China retail grew overall 10%. M-A-C in China grew outstandingly and our same door in China grew in 2%, yes, and so that's the situation. So we have again good interesting growth in China. By the way, this is also driven by our makeup brands in a big way and by the makeup part of our heritage brands as well, and M-A-C is a really strong driver of this growth in China among others. Same thing in Korea. We are competing very well with Korea brands. We have another quarter in which in Korea, we have been a very strong retail and continue to grow market share in the country of Korean brands, which make us very competitive, and again, this has been driven by a lot of our makeup brands as well, including M-A-C. The second part of your question is the innovation plan. Definitely, New Dimension was below our expectation, and in fact, by the way, the loan for New Dimension last year was in the first quarter, and part of what we see is in skincare this year in term of base is that we are anniversarying a base where there was the launch of New Dimension, that although below our expectation, was significant in term of overall volumes of innovation. And the future of our innovation is changing, as I explained, in the Barclays Conference the rest, meaning, there are some very exciting innovation and less blockbusters. We believe this is much more in line with current consumers' expectations, where consumer want to try new products and have a variety of them, and the model is not -- the breakthrough model assume a lot of advertising before the product is in store. So in reality, it's higher risk financial. While the model, where we used the growth, the innovation, to attract new consumers and to engage them, and then when we see success, we further accelerate and further leverage this innovation, is a model that particularly on our mid-sized smaller brands is much more manageable and allow faster and better financial results from this innovation than in the past. So in reality, we are going to add a mix. We still are going to have some breakthrough technology innovation and some more commercial innovations, including product, packaging, aesthetics, et cetera, innovation. The fact that a lot of the growth come from makeup is increasing the percentage of innovation, which is not about breakthrough technology, obviously, but this is still part of our portfolio. But the way in which we will look even this breakthrough technology will be with less risky upfront investment, a more gradual evolution of the winners. And that is a change in our innovation program, and is a change that will be -- is associated already with some great results where we have the right innovation, and will be associated, I believe, with a lot of good success innovation. As we said before, last year, we went from 20% of our sales growth coming from innovation in fiscal year '15 to 24% coming in fiscal year '16 from innovation. In term of the cost of innovation, which was last part of your question, frankly, I believe is the opposite. This new improvement of our innovation program is decreasing the cost of innovation, because it's decreasing the risk of it. It's decreasing the amount of money that are put upfront on innovation that don't work, and are allowing us better agility and tailor the resources, where the consumers react positively to our innovation. So it's increasing the effectiveness and the rate of return on our innovation."

We expect the U.K. to have a bit of a pickup, certainly, given the currency favorability there.

And this, you can make the same assumption by channel, by country. We will manage the portfolio of different growth levels. So specifically to M-A-C, M-A-C is international. So outside of the United States, M-A-C is a relatively untapped brand in term of price and distribution in many countries. Take countries like China, where M-A-C is really, really on top, there's enormous opportunities only in a limited number of cities and a lot to go, and there are many examples like that. And there are other places where M-A-C is well penetrated, well developed, like the U.S. or the U.K. So depend by the mix. Each one of this brand has a very different mix and portfolio. That's why I don't think we are going to deploy every single brand and every single opportunity in price and distribution of organic growth, their brand. And that's why I summarize it with 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 and then -- so this will continue. And the second part of the question is the role of acquisitions.

And I think, this quarter, you see for the first time a very significant sign of that and the potential of it in the long term. We are doing in fragrances what we did in makeup artistry on makeup, and then we will continue to drive that. In the other categories, acquisition will play a role, like they always play, then will continue to play a role to create the right portfolio brands and to create the right possibility of growing in areas where we have strategic opportunity or strategic gaps. And so you can expect us to continue leveraging acquisition, and continuing -- analyzing the opportunities on new acquisition in the future to manage these strategic gaps or opportunities, and last, we have also some minority investments around the world that could be very interesting in the long term. For example, Dr. Jart+ in Korea, which is one of the fastest-growing Korean brands, where we have a minority investment that could be an acquisition in the future, is an example of strategic opportunities that we continue to mold to enrich our different engines of growth. And to close, I mean, we are building engines of growth, differentiated, different in many to diversifying our opportunity for growth in the long term. That is the strategy, and frankly, we are making great progress on it quarter by quarter."

207221,332689814,1070747,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, sales grew in line with our forecast, and earnings per share growth exceeded our expectations due to more prudent expense management as we navigated through some of t",2309,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, sales grew in line with our forecast, and earnings per share growth exceeded our expectations due to more prudent expense management as we navigated through some of the macro uncertainty in the quarter.
Across our business, many brands, countries and channels achieved double-digit sales gains. Our strongest performers were our small and midsized brands, particularly, those in the luxury tier, many European markets and the online specialty multi and travel retail channels. Yet as we had anticipated, our strong gains were partially offset by challenging markets and economic conditions in certain countries. 
In constant currency, our sales rose 2% and adjusted EPS increased 5%. We managed our business with a full year perspective. So even though the first quarter top line growth is starting off at its lower than usual pace, we are confident in our ability to achieve the solid sales and earnings growth we forecasted for fiscal year '17. 
Our first quarter growth was lower, primarily due to ongoing challenge in U.S. mid-tier department stores caused by lower traffic, the market slowdown in the Middle East and difficult comparison in France and Germany and a continued negative trend in Hong Kong. All these challenges were anticipated, and plans are in place to gradually accelerate our sales growth quarter by quarter, and position us to deliver our full fiscal year plan.
Despite headwinds, there are expected -- we are expected to continue in some areas -- sorry, despite headwinds are expected to continue in some areas. We have plans to further leverage our stronger brands, channels and countries. We have robust holiday programs and a strong innovation pipeline, exciting opportunities to reach new target consumers and geographies, especially with our fast-growing brands and compelling programs to better engage shoppers. By being well diversified to having multiple engines of growth, we are able to activate the drivers that we believe will fuel stronger sales.
These are expected to include a number of international markets, the makeup and fragrance categories, and target distribution opportunities. We are reaffirming our previously stated goal of constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2017. This will come from a combination of factors.
Our organic growth is expected to accelerate, mainly in makeup and fragrance, fueled by strong innovation in the second half, and supported by greater social media initiatives for improved consumer engagement. We should have easier comparisons in several markets since external events that impacted our results last year will be in our base.
Also contributing to growth will be new points of distribution globally for our fast-growing high-productivity brands, with a higher concentration coming in the second half, as well as planned price increases. Additionally, the planned acquisition of BECCA will provide incremental sales. As a result, we are also reaffirming our goal of adjusted constant currency EPS growth of 8% to 10% for full year.
In the past several months, we have continued to make excellent progress on our strategic objectives. We believe that the industry's strong growth in global makeup sales will continue. So we are focusing on building and strengthening our makeup portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved solid makeup growth in several brands, however, the total category was affected by declines at M-A-C in the United States, owing to fewer foreign tourists, particularly in New York City and Florida, is lower traffic in department stores. M-A-C is a powerful and authentic brand that speaks to all ages, races and sexes, and we expect its U.S. business to deliver stronger results through the rest of the year.
As of October, M-A-C U.S. sales started to improve. Thanks to the launch of its successful Selena makeup Collection, and the new range of lipstick called Liptensity. The Selena Collection was inspired by the late singer and her huge fan base, and accounted for the highest online traffic in 1 day on the brand site. M-A-C will bring back the Selena Collection in January to meet continued demand. It has other exciting collaborations in plans, including a Nutcracker themed holiday collection and compelling social media programs that will leverage M-A-C rapidly expansion, expanding fan base, which now includes 16 million global Facebook fans and 12 million followers on Instagram. The brand also has an active presence on YouTube, Twitter and other popular digital platforms right now. M-A-C's international business grew in line with the global prestige makeup, fueled by double-digit growth in most European and Asian markets. Internationally, we expect M-A-C to grow double digit in the fiscal year and gaining share, driven by continued organic growth, stronger innovation program, expansion of social media and new opportunity to reach target consumer that don't yet have access to the brand. Today, M-A-C is sold in a relatively small and select number of doors in each market, and it is an opportunity for us to further build its presence where it is underrepresented, primarily in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in the EMEA region and in China. M-A-C doors are among the most productive of the entire industry.
Smashbox, our pure-play makeup brand, generated double-digit global growth for the quarter, and we expect to deliver strong double-digit increases for the fiscal year. The brand is focused on winning in the specialty-multi and direct-to-consumer channels, and recently redesigned its U.S. e-commerce site for a greater consumer engagement. 
Our Tom Ford brand had an outstanding quarter, with its makeup business nearly doubling, led by its popular new lipsticks. Makeup is expected to continue to be a major growth driver, and the brand should benefit from upcoming color collection, inspired by the designers' runway fashion. Fragrance represent the majority of this luxury brand business, and continues to generate strong momentum.
La Mer, our luxury skincare brand, just launched its innovative skin color collection, which includes 15 shades of foundation, a growing subcategory, plus powder and concealer. These products incorporate the brand's signature Miracle Broth, and are expected to capitalize on growing demand for product that breach skincare with makeup. The collection has increased traffic to the La Mer counters and websites, and the brand anticipates it will attract new consumers and provide incremental sales to its core products of moisturizers, eye creams and serums.
We are also building on our global leadership in Prestige makeup. 2 weeks ago, we agreed to acquire BECCA, a prestige makeup brand with a unique positioning that is complementary to our other makeup brands. BECCA's strength is in foundations and complexions products, which are a high or loyalty areas. It has grown rapidly by offering a broad and balanced range of shades that appeal to multicultural consumers, along with a strong presence in fast-growing North America specialty-multi retailers. It also is active on social media, and attracts a diverse and loyal fan base. We also see great opportunity to strategically expand the brand internationally, as well as in travel retail and online, which are key growth areas for the company.
Strong gains in fragrance this quarter were again led by our luxury brands that are experiencing rapid global growth. Our newest fragrance brands' experience is trusted to authentic point of view, similar to our makeup artist brands, and are resonating strongly with the new consumers. For example, we have continued to build out our seasonal Le Labo brand to reach more of its target consumers by opening select high-growth department store doors, and freestanding stores globally. At the same time, the brand has had strong light door growth, leading to exceptional sales increases.
Jo Malone, superior growth was reinforced by its travel retail business, which benefits from increasing awareness of the brand in key local markets. Jo Malone is capitalizing on growth opportunities by opening new store formats in the travel retail channel. After many quarters of strong growth, Jo Malone rose 3 places in the rankings to become the third largest women prestige private brand in the United States in the first quarter. This is especially noteworthy, given the brand's limited distribution in only 250 doors in the entire United States. Jo Malone is the second largest prestige fragrance brand in its home market, the U.K., and growing double digits, yet it has just 1/10 the number of points of sales compared to the market leader.
We are anticipating on our high-end fragrances will perform well in the holiday season, with enticing gift offering and new classic scents, and we expect their momentum to carry into the second half of the fiscal year. In skincare, natural products are growing in popularity, and we are well positioned with our Aveda and Origins brands. Aveda's news to Lazada's skincare line, which creates glowing skin inspired by ancient healing art of India, led to the brand robust skincare sales growth worldwide, exceeding its expectations. Aveda plans to broaden their franchise in the next few months, with masks for the face and eyes centered on the theme of weddings.
Origins strengthened its leading position in facial masks, and its skincare sales climbed at double digits in every region. This includes a new line of face and body masks, infused with tea that provides immediate benefit and feature desired by today's consumers. Many of our brands are enhancing their distribution in the fastest-growing channels to reach target consumers where they are shopping today. Our brands continue to successfully penetrate the specialty-multi channel globally. In the U.S., Clinique continue its rollout in Ulta. And in September, Estée Lauder introduced a curated selection of top-selling skincare and makeup products in 30 Ulta doors and on ulta.com. 
Clinique, Origins and Bumble and bumble added location in Sephora stores inside JCPenney. Our brands are also further penetrating the channels in foreign markets. For example, in Germany, GLAMGLOW successfully partnered with Douglas to target core consumers throughout all of its locations. Likewise, when Smashbox entered Finland this quarter, it reached its target consumer by launching in the specialty retailer kits.  Our travel retail business was vibrant in the quarter, as our net sales growth far outpaced fashion and traffic growth despite some difficult markets, including Hong Kong, Japan and Latin America. Our smaller and midsized brands, as well as M-A-C, are in a high demand in the channel. They all increased double digits at retail, with very solid light door growth as we continue to accelerate their rollout. Geographically, Asia Pacific was the best performer in travel retail and the makeup, fragrance and haircare categories grew sharply. 
We expect to continue our strong sales increases in travel retail, fueled in part by passenger traffic growth, which is projected to rise during the next 3 quarters. Our online sales this quarter were once again very strong. Mobile continues to be the fastest-growing area in e- and m-commerce, and trend also reflected in our business. In the quarter, m-commerce represented 41% of our online global sales, up from 37% last year. And sales from mobile devices grew 23%. In the recent period, we opened approximately 100 new sites, mostly with international retailers.
Looking at our heritage brands. Estée Lauder and Clinique have remained stable. Importantly, in the quarter, both brands grew in makeup globally. They have generated makeup growth for several quarters, and we expect each of them to accelerate their makeup business in the second half of the year. 
Estée Lauder's international makeup sales were vibrant, with a particularly strong performance in the U.K., following the Brexit vote. When a drop in the pound increased in a wave of tourists, the brand sold specialty well in department stores, favored by foreign visitors, such as Harrods, where Estée Lauder retail sales rose 20%. Estée Lauder Double Wear foundation was a strong seller worldwide, fueled by its innovative cushion stick applicator. In skincare, Estée Lauder had global success with Advanced Night Repair, another powerful growth engine for the brand. Estée Lauder continue to see strategic opportunity to accelerate its business this year by fueling these 2 core pillars, with new products and compelling digital assets as it targets a wider consumer base and increased penetration in higher growth channels.
Clinique business in North America increased in makeup and skincare, driven by higher sales in specialty-multi retailers, online and in select department stores. Clinique also had solid growth in makeup internationally, with strong results for its new foundation, called Superbalanced Silk Makeup. It has started a redesign of some counters and stores in the United States and Hong Kong, and as a result, sales climbed in those locations. 
Clinique expects to broaden its reach in high-growth channels, particularly in North America, and at the same time, work with department store to increase traffic at counters and accelerate its growth. Improving productivity is the focus for our entire organization. Through Leading Beauty Forward, our multiyear initiative, we aim to increase our efficiency and reduce costs to achieve both leverage and for reinvestment in growth drivers. Additionally, we will improve our speed to market and agility. We are making good progress. Much of the organization design work and several projects are underway.
In closing, we continue to deploy the strategies to drive our sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Our diversified business is fueled by multiple engines of growth, and our financial agility enable us to quickly move resources to take advantage of changing consumer demand and new opportunities.
This year, we will further accelerate our stronger growth engines, reinvigorate slower areas, and create more resources to invest in opportunities and capabilities as we adapt to the changing dynamics in prestige beauty. 
As we discussed in our August call, our sales profile this year is weighted to the second half, and is rolling out as we had anticipated. We expect that fiscal year '17 will be another successful year that will advance our financial performance and strengthen our leadership.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracy."

Net sales for the quarter -- for the first quarter were $2.87 billion, up 2% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Incremental sales from By Kilian contributed approximately 20 basis points of this growth. From a geographic perspective, Europe, the Middle East and Africa saw the fastest growth again this quarter. Net sales rose 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth from the travel retail channel, developed markets like Italy and Spain, as well as most of the region's emerging markets. Sales in Germany and the U.K. were also solid. Last quarter, we called out 2 issues that we predicted would put some pressure on our first quarter sales in EMEA. As we anticipated, sales in France declined due to a significant drop in tourism against the tough comparison with an exceptionally strong first quarter of last year. 
Net sales in the Middle East fell sharply, as distributors in the area significantly rebalanced inventory levels to adjust to weaker retail traffic, due primarily to the impact of lower oil prices on the overall macro environment. We do see some traveling luxury consumers from the Middle East, taking advantage of the weaker pound, and buying more in the U.K. Excluding the Middle East, the EMEA region grew 10%. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was led by Korea, which grew low double digit, followed by strong growth in Australia, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan. China grew in line with the overall region. Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline. Excluding Hong Kong, the region grew 7%.
Net sales in the Americas declined 2% in constant currency. Latin America grew 15%, led by strong growth in Mexico, while Brazil remains challenged. Canada rose low single digits, and the U.S. declined mid-single digits. Our sales through both online and specialty-multi channels again rose double digits. However, we saw continued declines in the brick and mortar business of mid-tier department stores, as well as tourist-driven freestanding stores. Additionally, the U.S. had a tough comparison to the prior year, which included some major new product launches in department stores. Net sales by product category were led by the 10% constant currency growth in fragrance for the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on the higher-margin, top-tier segment of the category. Jo Malone was once again the largest contributor to our overall fragrance growth. The launch of Basil & Neroli, strong comp door growth and expanded consumer reach drove a strong double-digit increase in sales. By Kilian contributed incremental sales, adding about 1 point to the fragrance category growth, and Le Labo also grew rapidly. Makeup sales rose 1% in constant currency. Tom Ford delivered exceptional growth, nearly doubling its makeup business this quarter.
Smashbox rose double-digit, and Estée Lauder and Clinique innovation and makeup also drove the category as previously mentioned. And as Fabrizio discussed earlier, M-A-C continued its strong double-digit trend in most international markets. However, the brands U.S. business continues to experience lower foot traffic in tourism and its core channels of distribution, constraining overall makeup growth in the quarter.  Haircare sales increased 1% in constant currency, primarily due to growth from Bumble and bumble. Skincare sales were less than 1% in constant currency. Double-digit growth, supported by strong innovation from La Mer, Origins and Aveda was mostly offset by lower sales from Estée Lauder, which had a major launch in the prior year period and from Clinique, reflecting continued softness in Asia and in EMEA.
Our gross margin declined 30 basis points from the prior year, due primarily to unfavorable currency and a slightly unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, increased 10 basis points. Higher store operating cost and selling expenses associated with our retail store growth, along with the accounting for stock compensation expenses, were mostly offset by favorable currency transactions and a gain on the sale of a fixed asset, as well as more prudent expense management. As a result, operating income fell 1%, and operating margin decreased 30 basis points. Net earnings increased 2% to $314 million, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Diluted EPS rose 3% to $0.84 or 5% in constant currency.
Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to more prudent expense management. As you are aware, we have seasonally higher working capital requirements in our fiscal first quarter, as we build inventory to support the holiday selling period.
During the quarter, we used $150 million in net cash flows from operating activities, and we invested $85 million in capital projects. We used $222 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares of our stock, and paid $111 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that our board approved a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the next quarter and for the full year. As Fabrizio mentioned, we continue to expect sales to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency for the fiscal 2017 year. This range includes the expected contribution from BECCA, as we plan to close the transaction this quarter. On a preliminary basis, we estimated that BECCA could add approximately 30 basis points to sales growth, and dilute EPS by $0.02 in fiscal 2017, which won't affect the range of our forecast. Currency translation is expected to depress sales by less than 1%, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, $1.22 for the pound and $1.05 for the yen for the fiscal year.
Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. For the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 5% to 6% in constant currency, reflecting new product launches and holiday promotions, as well as easier comparisons in the U.S. and France. The Middle East and Hong Kong are expected to continue to weigh on sales growth until the second half. Negative currency translation is estimated at approximately 2 percentage points. Our most recent acquisitions could add approximately 50 basis points to sales growth for the quarter. EPS is forecast between $1.10 and $1.15 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.05 dilution from currency. The acceleration in EPS growth implied in the second half of the year is directly related to the sales growth trends. We are pleased with the performance we made in our strategic initiatives in the first quarter, and we remain focused on delivering another successful year despite the volatile political, economic and currency environment.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

We talked a bit about the innovation that we're expecting in the second half. We talked about pricing, and we also talked about an acceleration of consumer coverage for many of our smaller brands. As you're aware, we most recently acquired a number of smaller brands that are in expansion mode. Brands like Jo Malone and Tom Ford and others have quite a bit of expansion opportunity as well ahead of them, and so they are -- or certainly, much of that distribution growth is planned for the second half of the year. If you were to think about the second half in terms of the building blocks that we typically talk to you about for the full year, 2% is roughly -- a little over 2% is roughly the pricing expectation that we expect to get in the second half of the year. New distribution will be about 3% to 4%, so a bit of a step up versus the first half of the year. And then our existing and new business, including our newer acquisitions, are another 3% to 4%. So that's how we get to the numbers for the full year that we guided to in terms of 6% to 7%."

And as far as M-A-C is concerned is, first of all, I said in my prepared remarks M-A-C is still growing double digit in many of the global markets, where there is equally new -- is equally tough in new competition that there is in the U.S. And M-A-C, internationally, has been growing in line with the very fast growing market, continuing to well compete with mass and all the mass brands that despite some of them are now using ""prestige"" codes. They continue to grow, on average less, than the prestige brand. So M-A-C continue to be one of our most successful brands and a fast-growing brand, and we will count on this for the future. In the U.S., there is the specific 2 issues in the short term that we have already commented on, which is obviously M-A-C is very concentrated and focused on high internal distribution and presence in high touristic areas and in mid-tier department stores and in the traffic in both of this area has been lower, significantly lower than in the past, and so M-A-C will need to react to that. The second is the programs, and you're right, there is new competition. There are some very successful brands. We have acquired one of them, BECCA, and there are many other successful brands, particularly specialty multi, which are a new competition among the millennial generation, and M-A-C is stepping up their activity, their innovation, their collection, their social media and their penetration of this new target group with new activity. That's why in our prepared remarks, we brought up the example of the Selena and what's happening there when M-A-C speaks to this target growth more directly. And we plan to do those much more also in the second semester of the fiscal year. So net, we expect M-A-C to continue to be one of our strong growth brands in the long term."

But it seems, philosophically, as though maintaining the top line at 6-plus-percent really dominates the other 2, and arguably that's not wrong, assuming the 6-plus percent growth is there. But I guess, as we hear questions today related to the top line, what would it take for you to see, whether in your business or in your end markets, where you'd say, ""You know what, we're going to throttle back just a bit on top line investment and seek to generate similar profits, maybe improve free cash flow by going more after margin."" I guess my concern is that you've been growing 6%, 7%, 8% in a market growing 4% to 5% for a while. And clearly, that can't go on forever, at least, not without significantly higher cost, and I think the market's concern is that's what we're starting to see this quarter. And to that point, if you do happen to trend short of 6% in fiscal '17, I think the market's fear is that you'll continue to spend as if you were still growing at that level, leading ultimately to deleverage and EPS reductions. So can you just help frame for us how you're monitoring top line trends? And give us confidence that if the revenue does start to fall short, that the flexibility you've been speaking of the past few quarters can be applied to cost management to better protect bottom line and even in the fact -- even in the face of top line disappointment?"

So I will like also Tracey to add on this, but first of all, our -- in a market, which is growing 4% to 5%, as I said, our long-term opportunity of growth remain between 6% and 8%, and again, it's between 6% and 8%. It could be 8% in some years. Of c",524,"Yes. So I will like also Tracey to add on this, but first of all, our -- in a market, which is growing 4% to 5%, as I said, our long-term opportunity of growth remain between 6% and 8%, and again, it's between 6% and 8%. It could be 8% in some years. Of course, this could be 6% in others, depending on the external situation and in -- of our internal innovation program and priorities and spending, as you mentioned. So I still believe the range for the long term is the right range and that -- and we are moving to that, and continue to use this range as an opportunity. The key areas of opportunities, we continue to have pricing power. So as we say in our -- for example, in our 6% to 7% this year, which is a representation of our long-term view, is 2 points are coming from pricing. And then 2.5 are coming from distribution and 2.5 from organic growth. So our portfolio brands, as Tracey explained before, still offer a lot of opportunity of more distribution of at least half of our brands, which are high growth, high productivity and not at all available to the global consumers in many areas, and this will be true for many years to come. As an example, even our recent acquisition, BECCA, has enormous opportunities for growing also international, online, in travel retail and all these areas, which will build value, and today are not leveraged by a brand which is doing very well among its target group. And we have plenty example like this in our portfolio. The 2.5% organic growth in a market, which is growing 4% to 5% in prestige that continues to grow much faster than mass is frankly achievable if we get our plans together. So we still believe that the 6% to 8% range is achievable, but also it's possible that in some areas will be 6% and not 8%, as we have demonstrated in the past. In terms of your second question, which is our flexibility, it's actually the key point. Our financial flexibility is there, and we are regularly adjusting resources to -- not only to the overall growth level, but also to the different priorities that we have around the world and to reallocating resources to the winning areas. That, I believe, is the most important element of flexibility we have demonstrated to have. Why this is important? Because in this moment, the markets around the world is very volatile, and there is a lot of change going on. So the ability to adapt and to reallocate resources in an agile way is one of the biggest strengths that I think we can exercise to continue to succeed, and we are ready to do it. We are prepared to do this, and our Leading Beauty Forward program, among other benefits, is also the benefit of making us stronger in our ability to do exactly that. So to close on your question, yes, we are committed to adjust and adapt costs to the future sales growth opportunity that we will have."

So we are seeing almost an equal offset in terms of some of the benefits that we're achieving from an organic growth standpoint in -- with some of those factors. As I had mentioned, I think, on our year-end call last year, that purchase accounting will bleed off over the next year or so, and you'll actually start to see some more of the margin flow through. One of the things that we also look at here, obviously, is EBITDA, given the fact that we have done a number of acquisitions in the last few years, and certainly, you'll see more progression in terms of our EBITDA margin."

The rest of M-A-C growth around the world can be double digit, as being high single digit in the quarter, which has just closed, and is projected to be double digit. So a brand that has a double-digit power already demonstrated an enormous amount of opportunity, including extra distribution opportunity internationally, is a brand that can definitely grow and go back to grow very fast. Now in the U.S., specifically, the growth -- to go back to growth, there will be certain actions that are required, including new successful innovation, and some other activity in social media that I can understand. You say, they need to be proven successful before believing them, but we know what they are and so we have trust in them. But even in terms of mix, the power of the brands will allow a double-digit growth in that medium, long term, and then on the -- that was the first part."

So the -- then on Estée Lauder and Clinique, as we said, we have stabilized the brands. These brands have been declining in the past. We have stabilized them, and we started growing consistently the makeup part. As we said, we have said that our program was to start growing from makeup. And now the quarter we just closed is 1 more quarter where this seems to be now sticking, and we keep doing this well. By the way, makeup is one of our priority, and a lot of the growth in the second semester of this fiscal year, as we anticipated, will come from makeup acceleration. And Estée Lauder and Clinique will be part of contribution to this makeup acceleration in the second part of the fiscal year. Next, we need to address the skincare trend on these 2 brands. This has been slower than what we wanted. But in the situation with Hong Kong, not really been declining and the traffic softness in U.S. department stores, which are 2 of the biggest skincare contributors to these brands has been tougher, but we have now plans to also add skincare acceleration to the already achieved makeup acceleration. In our -- and the last thing I want to say, in our plan, we play the portfolio brands. And I said other times that we have 1/3 of our portfolio, which is growing always double digit, 1/3 of our portfolio that could be just growing single, low single digit, and 1/3 of our portfolio that is growing high single digit, and in this way, we deliver the total. And so yes, we are not saying that the big brands have the role to drive the 6 to 8 on the high side. The big brands have the role to drive growth, but there are -- the other brands in the portfolio, we are growing double digit, and the portfolio mix is what's driving our long-term algorithm. Think of it like 1/3 pricing, 1/3 distribution, 1/3 organic growth and 1/3 small brands, the high-growth brands; 1/3, the medium-sized brands and then the big brands. And that's why this flexibility of managing through the different levels of growth and different brands in the portfolio and the different countries make us a more -- a less volatile, more reliable, more sustainable company than any other company. Today, company that just counts on 1 or 2 brands, given the volatility of the worlds, and only 1 or 2 markets, I believe, are less reliable in the long term than the model that we built."

But my concern is that you're gaining more market share, it seems, through distribution expansion as opposed to with your own innovation. And I look at your 2 really big new products over the last year, new dimensions and Estée Edit, which we heard about for several quarters before they were launched. They were supposed to be game changers. New dimensions was supposed to set off a whole new category. Estée Edit was supposed to revitalize the brand with millennials. And both of those brands have fallen well short of your expectations. I know it may take time, and Estée Edit maybe a slow build and all that kind of stuff. But my bigger question, Fabrizio, and you even mentioned it at Barclays, that the company is changing its focus less from blockbuster home runs, successful new product innovations and more smaller things. But I'm just wondering how big a change that is culturally? Does that change the cost to compete, those kinds of things? Because that strikes me as a very, very different philosophy or approach to building your brands and launching new products than we've seen historically at the company."

M-A-C in China grew outstandingly and our same door in China grew in 2%, yes, and so that's the situation. So we have again good interesting growth in China. By the way, this is also driven by our makeup brands in a big way and by the makeup part of our heritage brands as well, and M-A-C is a really strong driver of this growth in China among others. Same thing in Korea. We are competing very well with Korea brands. We have another quarter in which in Korea, we have been a very strong retail and continue to grow market share in the country of Korean brands, which make us very competitive, and again, this has been driven by a lot of our makeup brands as well, including M-A-C. The second part of your question is the innovation plan. Definitely, New Dimension was below our expectation, and in fact, by the way, the loan for New Dimension last year was in the first quarter, and part of what we see in skincare this year in term of base is that we are anniversarying a base where there was the launch of New Dimension, that although below our expectation, was significant in term of overall volumes of innovation. And the future of our innovation is changing, as I explained, in the Barclays Conference the rest, meaning, there are some very exciting innovation and less blockbusters. We believe this is much more in line with current consumers' expectations, where consumer want to try new products and have a variety of them, and the model is not -- the breakthrough model assume a lot of advertising before the product is in store. So in reality, it's higher risk financial. While the model, where we used the growth, the innovation, to attract new consumers and to engage them, and then when we see success, we further accelerate and further leverage this innovation, is a model that particularly on our mid-sized smaller brands is much more manageable and allow faster and better financial results from this innovation than in the past. So in reality, we are going to have a mix. We still are going to have some breakthrough technology innovation and some more commercial innovations, including product, packaging, aesthetics, et cetera, innovation. The fact that a lot of the growth come from makeup is increasing the percentage of innovation, which is not about breakthrough technology, obviously, but this is still part of our portfolio. But the way in which we will look even this breakthrough technology will be with less risky upfront investment, a more gradual evolution of the winners. And that is a change in our innovation program, and is a change that will be -- is associated already with some great results where we have the right innovation, and will be associated, I believe, with a lot of good success innovation. As we said before, last year, we went from 20% of our sales growth coming from innovation in fiscal year '15 to 24% coming in fiscal year '16 from innovation. In term of the cost of innovation, which was last part of your question, frankly, I believe is the opposite. This new improvement of our innovation program is decreasing the cost of innovation, because it's decreasing the risk of it. It's decreasing the amount of money that are put upfront on innovation that don't work, and are allowing us better agility in tailored resources, where the consumers react positively to our innovation. So it's increasing the effectiveness and the rate of return on our innovation."

Hong Kong, the Middle East, we're not expecting a big pickup in those markets in the second quarter and the holiday season. We expect the U.K. to have a bit of a pickup, certainly, given the currency favorability there. We do expect that, that will be the case, and we were actually in the U.K. last week and certainly saw quite a bit of traffic in the U.K. in the shop. So I would say it's a mixed bag.

So if it's falling, and I get the comment about international being called 70% of brand volume, but how much can the company make up with acquisitions or other assuming that the rest of the portfolio doesn't accelerate? And why or why not is this a good way to think about that?"

And this, you can make the same assumption by channel, by country. We manage the portfolio at different growth levels. So specifically to M-A-C, M-A-C is internationally. So outside of the United States, M-A-C is a relatively untapped brand in term of price and distribution in many countries. Take countries like China, where M-A-C is really, really untapped, there's enormous opportunities only in a limited number of cities and a lot to go, and there are many examples like that. And there are other places where M-A-C is well penetrated, well developed, like the U.S. or the U.K. So depend by the mix. Each one of this brand has a very different mix and portfolio. That's why I don't think we are going to deploy every single brand and every single opportunity in price and distribution of organic growth per brand. And that's why I summarize it with 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 and then -- so this will continue. And the second part of the question is the role of acquisitions. Yes, we have -- in the fragrance business, the role of acquisition has been to create the engines of growth of this new high-end artisanal fragrance category, where we want to lead and to drive growth. And I think, this quarter, you see for the first time a very significant sign of that and the potential of it in the long term. We are doing in fragrances what we did in makeup artistry on makeup, and then we will continue to drive that. In the other categories, acquisition will play a role, like they always play, they will continue to play a role to create the right portfolio brands and to create the right possibility of growing in areas where we have strategic opportunity or strategic gaps. And so you can expect us to continue leveraging acquisition, and continuing -- analyzing the opportunities on new acquisition in the future to manage these strategic gaps or opportunities, and last, we have also some minority investments around the world that could be very interesting in the long term. For example, Dr. Jart+ in Korea, which is one of the fastest-growing Korean brands, where we have a minority investment that could be an acquisition in the future, is an example of strategic opportunities that we continue to mold to enrich our different engines of growth. And to close, I mean, we are building engines of growth, differentiated, different in many to diversify our opportunity for growth in the long term. That is the strategy, and frankly, we are making great progress on it quarter by quarter."

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, sales grew in line with our forecast, and earnings per share growth exceeded our expectations due to more prudent expense management as we navigated through some of t",2309,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, sales grew in line with our forecast, and earnings per share growth exceeded our expectations due to more prudent expense management as we navigated through some of the macro uncertainty in the quarter.
Across our business, many brands, countries and channels achieved double-digit sales gains. Our strongest performers were our small and midsized brands, particularly, those in the luxury tier, many European markets and the online specialty multi and travel retail channels. Yet as we had anticipated, our strong gains were partially offset by challenging markets and economic conditions in certain countries. 
In constant currency, our sales rose 2% and adjusted EPS increased 5%. We managed our business with a full year perspective. So even though the first quarter top line growth is starting off at its lower than usual pace, we are confident in our ability to achieve the solid sales and earnings growth we forecasted for fiscal year '17. 
Our first quarter growth was lower, primarily due to ongoing challenge in U.S. mid-tier department stores caused by lower traffic, the market slowdown in the Middle East and difficult comparison in France and Germany and a continued negative trend in Hong Kong. All these challenges were anticipated, and plans are in place to gradually accelerate our sales growth quarter by quarter, and position us to deliver our full fiscal year plan.
Despite headwinds, there are expected -- we are expected to continue in some areas -- sorry, despite headwinds are expected to continue in some areas. We have plans to further leverage our stronger brands, channels and countries. We have robust holiday programs and a strong innovation pipeline, exciting opportunities to reach new target consumers and geographies, especially with our fast-growing brands and compelling programs to better engage shoppers. By being well diversified to having multiple engines of growth, we are able to activate the drivers that we believe will fuel stronger sales.
These are expected to include a number of international markets, the makeup and fragrance categories, and target distribution opportunities. We are reaffirming our previously stated goal of constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2017. This will come from a combination of factors.
Our organic growth is expected to accelerate, mainly in makeup and fragrance, fueled by strong innovation in the second half, and supported by greater social media initiatives for improved consumer engagement. We should have easier comparisons in several markets since external events that impacted our results last year will be in our base.
Also contributing to growth will be new points of distribution globally for our fast-growing high-productivity brands, with a higher concentration coming in the second half, as well as planned price increases. Additionally, the planned acquisition of BECCA will provide incremental sales. As a result, we are also reaffirming our goal of adjusted constant currency EPS growth of 8% to 10% for full year.
In the past several months, we have continued to make excellent progress on our strategic objectives. We believe that the industry's strong growth in global makeup sales will continue. So we are focusing on building and strengthening our makeup portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved solid makeup growth in several brands, however, the total category was affected by declines at M-A-C in the United States, owing to fewer foreign tourists, particularly in New York City and Florida, is lower traffic in department stores. M-A-C is a powerful and authentic brand that speaks to all ages, races and sexes, and we expect its U.S. business to deliver stronger results through the rest of the year.
As of October, M-A-C U.S. sales started to improve. Thanks to the launch of its successful Selena makeup Collection, and the new range of lipstick called Liptensity. The Selena Collection was inspired by the late singer and her huge fan base, and accounted for the highest online traffic in 1 day on the brand site. M-A-C will bring back the Selena Collection in January to meet continued demand. It has other exciting collaborations in plans, including a Nutcracker themed holiday collection and compelling social media programs that will leverage M-A-C rapidly expansion, expanding fan base, which now includes 16 million global Facebook fans and 12 million followers on Instagram. The brand also has an active presence on YouTube, Twitter and other popular digital platforms right now. M-A-C's international business grew in line with the global prestige makeup, fueled by double-digit growth in most European and Asian markets. Internationally, we expect M-A-C to grow double digit in the fiscal year and gaining share, driven by continued organic growth, stronger innovation program, expansion of social media and new opportunity to reach target consumer that don't yet have access to the brand. Today, M-A-C is sold in a relatively small and select number of doors in each market, and it is an opportunity for us to further build its presence where it is underrepresented, primarily in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in the EMEA region and in China. M-A-C doors are among the most productive of the entire industry.
Smashbox, our pure-play makeup brand, generated double-digit global growth for the quarter, and we expect to deliver strong double-digit increases for the fiscal year. The brand is focused on winning in the specialty-multi and direct-to-consumer channels, and recently redesigned its U.S. e-commerce site for a greater consumer engagement. 
Our Tom Ford brand had an outstanding quarter, with its makeup business nearly doubling, led by its popular new lipsticks. Makeup is expected to continue to be a major growth driver, and the brand should benefit from upcoming color collection, inspired by the designers' runway fashion. Fragrance represent the majority of this luxury brand business, and continues to generate strong momentum.
La Mer, our luxury skincare brand, just launched its innovative skin color collection, which includes 15 shades of foundation, a growing subcategory, plus powder and concealer. These products incorporate the brand's signature Miracle Broth, and are expected to capitalize on growing demand for product that breach skincare with makeup. The collection has increased traffic to the La Mer counters and websites, and the brand anticipates it will attract new consumers and provide incremental sales to its core products of moisturizers, eye creams and serums.
We are also building on our global leadership in Prestige makeup. 2 weeks ago, we agreed to acquire BECCA, a prestige makeup brand with a unique positioning that is complementary to our other makeup brands. BECCA's strength is in foundations and complexions products, which are a high or loyalty areas. It has grown rapidly by offering a broad and balanced range of shades that appeal to multicultural consumers, along with a strong presence in fast-growing North America specialty-multi retailers. It also is active on social media, and attracts a diverse and loyal fan base. We also see great opportunity to strategically expand the brand internationally, as well as in travel retail and online, which are key growth areas for the company.
Strong gains in fragrance this quarter were again led by our luxury brands that are experiencing rapid global growth. Our newest fragrance brands' experience is trusted to authentic point of view, similar to our makeup artist brands, and are resonating strongly with the new consumers. For example, we have continued to build out our seasonal Le Labo brand to reach more of its target consumers by opening select high-growth department store doors, and freestanding stores globally. At the same time, the brand has had strong light door growth, leading to exceptional sales increases.
Jo Malone, superior growth was reinforced by its travel retail business, which benefits from increasing awareness of the brand in key local markets. Jo Malone is capitalizing on growth opportunities by opening new store formats in the travel retail channel. After many quarters of strong growth, Jo Malone rose 3 places in the rankings to become the third largest women prestige private brand in the United States in the first quarter. This is especially noteworthy, given the brand's limited distribution in only 250 doors in the entire United States. Jo Malone is the second largest prestige fragrance brand in its home market, the U.K., and growing double digits, yet it has just 1/10 the number of points of sales compared to the market leader.
We are anticipating on our high-end fragrances will perform well in the holiday season, with enticing gift offering and new classic scents, and we expect their momentum to carry into the second half of the fiscal year. In skincare, natural products are growing in popularity, and we are well positioned with our Aveda and Origins brands. Aveda's news to Lazada's skincare line, which creates glowing skin inspired by ancient healing art of India, led to the brand robust skincare sales growth worldwide, exceeding its expectations. Aveda plans to broaden their franchise in the next few months, with masks for the face and eyes centered on the theme of weddings.
Origins strengthened its leading position in facial masks, and its skincare sales climbed at double digits in every region. This includes a new line of face and body masks, infused with tea that provides immediate benefit and feature desired by today's consumers. Many of our brands are enhancing their distribution in the fastest-growing channels to reach target consumers where they are shopping today. Our brands continue to successfully penetrate the specialty-multi channel globally. In the U.S., Clinique continue its rollout in Ulta. And in September, Estée Lauder introduced a curated selection of top-selling skincare and makeup products in 30 Ulta doors and on ulta.com. 
Clinique, Origins and Bumble and bumble added location in Sephora stores inside JCPenney. Our brands are also further penetrating the channels in foreign markets. For example, in Germany, GLAMGLOW successfully partnered with Douglas to target core consumers throughout all of its locations. Likewise, when Smashbox entered Finland this quarter, it reached its target consumer by launching in the specialty retailer kits.  Our travel retail business was vibrant in the quarter, as our net sales growth far outpaced fashion and traffic growth despite some difficult markets, including Hong Kong, Japan and Latin America. Our smaller and midsized brands, as well as M-A-C, are in a high demand in the channel. They all increased double digits at retail, with very solid light door growth as we continue to accelerate their rollout. Geographically, Asia Pacific was the best performer in travel retail and the makeup, fragrance and haircare categories grew sharply. 
We expect to continue our strong sales increases in travel retail, fueled in part by passenger traffic growth, which is projected to rise during the next 3 quarters. Our online sales this quarter were once again very strong. Mobile continues to be the fastest-growing area in e- and m-commerce, and trend also reflected in our business. In the quarter, m-commerce represented 41% of our online global sales, up from 37% last year. And sales from mobile devices grew 23%. In the recent period, we opened approximately 100 new sites, mostly with international retailers.
Looking at our heritage brands. Estée Lauder and Clinique have remained stable. Importantly, in the quarter, both brands grew in makeup globally. They have generated makeup growth for several quarters, and we expect each of them to accelerate their makeup business in the second half of the year. 
Estée Lauder's international makeup sales were vibrant, with a particularly strong performance in the U.K., following the Brexit vote. When a drop in the pound increased in a wave of tourists, the brand sold specialty well in department stores, favored by foreign visitors, such as Harrods, where Estée Lauder retail sales rose 20%. Estée Lauder Double Wear foundation was a strong seller worldwide, fueled by its innovative cushion stick applicator. In skincare, Estée Lauder had global success with Advanced Night Repair, another powerful growth engine for the brand. Estée Lauder continue to see strategic opportunity to accelerate its business this year by fueling these 2 core pillars, with new products and compelling digital assets as it targets a wider consumer base and increased penetration in higher growth channels.
Clinique business in North America increased in makeup and skincare, driven by higher sales in specialty-multi retailers, online and in select department stores. Clinique also had solid growth in makeup internationally, with strong results for its new foundation, called Superbalanced Silk Makeup. It has started a redesign of some counters and stores in the United States and Hong Kong, and as a result, sales climbed in those locations. 
Clinique expects to broaden its reach in high-growth channels, particularly in North America, and at the same time, work with department store to increase traffic at counters and accelerate its growth. Improving productivity is the focus for our entire organization. Through Leading Beauty Forward, our multiyear initiative, we aim to increase our efficiency and reduce costs to achieve both leverage and for reinvestment in growth drivers. Additionally, we will improve our speed to market and agility. We are making good progress. Much of the organization design work and several projects are underway.
In closing, we continue to deploy the strategies to drive our sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Our diversified business is fueled by multiple engines of growth, and our financial agility enable us to quickly move resources to take advantage of changing consumer demand and new opportunities.
This year, we will further accelerate our stronger growth engines, reinvigorate slower areas, and create more resources to invest in opportunities and capabilities as we adapt to the changing dynamics in prestige beauty. 
As we discussed in our August call, our sales profile this year is weighted to the second half, and is rolling out as we had anticipated. We expect that fiscal year '17 will be another successful year that will advance our financial performance and strengthen our leadership.
Now I will turn the call over to Tracy."

Net sales for the quarter -- for the first quarter were $2.87 billion, up 2% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Incremental sales from By Kilian contributed approximately 20 basis points of this growth. From a geographic perspective, Europe, the Middle East and Africa saw the fastest growth again this quarter. Net sales rose 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth from the travel retail channel, developed markets like Italy and Spain, as well as most of the region's emerging markets. Sales in Germany and the U.K. were also solid. Last quarter, we called out 2 issues that we predicted would put some pressure on our first quarter sales in EMEA. As we anticipated, sales in France declined due to a significant drop in tourism against the tough comparison with an exceptionally strong first quarter of last year. 
Net sales in the Middle East fell sharply, as distributors in the area significantly rebalanced inventory levels to adjust to weaker retail traffic, due primarily to the impact of lower oil prices on the overall macro environment. We do see some traveling luxury consumers from the Middle East, taking advantage of the weaker pound, and buying more in the U.K. Excluding the Middle East, the EMEA region grew 10%. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was led by Korea, which grew low double digit, followed by strong growth in Australia, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan. China grew in line with the overall region. Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline. Excluding Hong Kong, the region grew 7%.
Net sales in the Americas declined 2% in constant currency. Latin America grew 15%, led by strong growth in Mexico, while Brazil remains challenged. Canada rose low single digits, and the U.S. declined mid-single digits. Our sales through both online and specialty-multi channels again rose double digits. However, we saw continued declines in the brick and mortar business of mid-tier department stores, as well as tourist-driven freestanding stores. Additionally, the U.S. had a tough comparison to the prior year, which included some major new product launches in department stores. Net sales by product category were led by the 10% constant currency growth in fragrance for the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on the higher-margin, top-tier segment of the category. Jo Malone was once again the largest contributor to our overall fragrance growth. The launch of Basil & Neroli, strong comp door growth and expanded consumer reach drove a strong double-digit increase in sales. By Kilian contributed incremental sales, adding about 1 point to the fragrance category growth, and Le Labo also grew rapidly. Makeup sales rose 1% in constant currency. Tom Ford delivered exceptional growth, nearly doubling its makeup business this quarter.
Smashbox rose double-digit, and Estée Lauder and Clinique innovation and makeup also drove the category as previously mentioned. And as Fabrizio discussed earlier, M-A-C continued its strong double-digit trend in most international markets. However, the brands U.S. business continues to experience lower foot traffic in tourism and its core channels of distribution, constraining overall makeup growth in the quarter.  Haircare sales increased 1% in constant currency, primarily due to growth from Bumble and bumble. Skincare sales were less than 1% in constant currency. Double-digit growth, supported by strong innovation from La Mer, Origins and Aveda was mostly offset by lower sales from Estée Lauder, which had a major launch in the prior year period and from Clinique, reflecting continued softness in Asia and in EMEA.
Our gross margin declined 30 basis points from the prior year, due primarily to unfavorable currency and a slightly unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, increased 10 basis points. Higher store operating cost and selling expenses associated with our retail store growth, along with the accounting for stock compensation expenses, were mostly offset by favorable currency transactions and a gain on the sale of a fixed asset, as well as more prudent expense management. As a result, operating income fell 1%, and operating margin decreased 30 basis points. Net earnings increased 2% to $314 million, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Diluted EPS rose 3% to $0.84 or 5% in constant currency.
Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to more prudent expense management. As you are aware, we have seasonally higher working capital requirements in our fiscal first quarter, as we build inventory to support the holiday selling period.
During the quarter, we used $150 million in net cash flows from operating activities, and we invested $85 million in capital projects. We used $222 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares of our stock, and paid $111 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that our board approved a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share.
Now let's turn to our outlook for the next quarter and for the full year. As Fabrizio mentioned, we continue to expect sales to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency for the fiscal 2017 year. This range includes the expected contribution from BECCA, as we plan to close the transaction this quarter. On a preliminary basis, we estimated that BECCA could add approximately 30 basis points to sales growth, and dilute EPS by $0.02 in fiscal 2017, which won't affect the range of our forecast. Currency translation is expected to depress sales by less than 1%, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, $1.22 for the pound and $1.05 for the yen for the fiscal year.
Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. For the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 5% to 6% in constant currency, reflecting new product launches and holiday promotions, as well as easier comparisons in the U.S. and France. The Middle East and Hong Kong are expected to continue to weigh on sales growth until the second half. Negative currency translation is estimated at approximately 2 percentage points. Our most recent acquisitions could add approximately 50 basis points to sales growth for the quarter. EPS is forecast between $1.10 and $1.15 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.05 dilution from currency. The acceleration in EPS growth implied in the second half of the year is directly related to the sales growth trends. We are pleased with the performance we made in our strategic initiatives in the first quarter, and we remain focused on delivering another successful year despite the volatile political, economic and currency environment.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

But really, what I wanted to ask more about was M-A-C because -- what are you doing to sort of remedy some of the things that are going on in the U.S. piece? I guess, a part of this is an appeal to tourists and less travel and the impact of that. But how much of this is just how much more competitive the make up category has become, particularly with younger consumers that M-A-C has captured for so long?"

We talked a bit about the innovation that we're expecting in the second half. We talked about pricing, and we also talked about an acceleration of consumer coverage for many of our smaller brands. As you're aware, we most recently acquired a number of smaller brands that are in expansion mode. Brands like Jo Malone and Tom Ford and others have quite a bit of expansion opportunity as well ahead of them, and so they are -- or certainly, much of that distribution growth is planned for the second half of the year. If you were to think about the second half in terms of the building blocks that we typically talk to you about for the full year, 2% is roughly -- a little over 2% is roughly the pricing expectation that we expect to get in the second half of the year. New distribution will be about 3% to 4%, so a bit of a step up versus the first half of the year. And then our existing and new business, including our newer acquisitions, are another 3% to 4%. So that's how we get to the numbers for the full year that we guided to in terms of 6% to 7%."

And as far as M-A-C is concerned is, first of all, I said in my prepared remarks M-A-C is still growing double digit in many of the global markets, where there is equally new -- is equally tough in new competition that there is in the U.S. And M-A-C, internationally, has been growing in line with the very fast growing market, continuing to well compete with mass and all the mass brands that despite some of them are now using ""prestige"" codes. They continue to grow, on average less, than the prestige brand. So M-A-C continue to be one of our most successful brands and a fast-growing brand, and we will count on this for the future. In the U.S., there is the specific 2 issues in the short term that we have already commented on, which is obviously M-A-C is very concentrated and focused on high internal distribution and presence in high touristic areas and in mid-tier department stores and in the traffic in both of this area has been lower, significantly lower than in the past, and so M-A-C will need to react to that. The second is the programs, and you're right, there is new competition. There are some very successful brands. We have acquired one of them, BECCA, and there are many other successful brands, particularly specialty multi, which are a new competition among the millennial generation, and M-A-C is stepping up their activity, their innovation, their collection, their social media and their penetration of this new target group with new activity. That's why in our prepared remarks, we brought up the example of the Selena and what's happening there when M-A-C speaks to this target growth more directly. And we plan to do those much more also in the second semester of the fiscal year. So net, we expect M-A-C to continue to be one of our strong growth brands in the long term."

But it seems, philosophically, as though maintaining the top line at 6-plus-percent really dominates the other 2, and arguably that's not wrong, assuming the 6-plus percent growth is there. But I guess, as we hear questions today related to the top line, what would it take for you to see, whether in your business or in your end markets, where you'd say, ""You know what, we're going to throttle back just a bit on top line investment and seek to generate similar profits, maybe improve free cash flow by going more after margin."" I guess my concern is that you've been growing 6%, 7%, 8% in a market growing 4% to 5% for a while. And clearly, that can't go on forever, at least, not without significantly higher cost, and I think the market's concern is that's what we're starting to see this quarter. And to that point, if you do happen to trend short of 6% in fiscal '17, I think the market's fear is that you'll continue to spend as if you were still growing at that level, leading ultimately to deleverage and EPS reductions. So can you just help frame for us how you're monitoring top line trends? And give us confidence that if the revenue does start to fall short, that the flexibility you've been speaking of the past few quarters can be applied to cost management to better protect bottom line and even in the fact -- even in the face of top line disappointment?"

So I will like also Tracey to add on this, but first of all, our -- in a market, which is growing 4% to 5%, as I said, our long-term opportunity of growth remain between 6% and 8%, and again, it's between 6% and 8%. It could be 8% in some years. Of c",524,"Yes. So I will like also Tracey to add on this, but first of all, our -- in a market, which is growing 4% to 5%, as I said, our long-term opportunity of growth remain between 6% and 8%, and again, it's between 6% and 8%. It could be 8% in some years. Of course, this could be 6% in others, depending on the external situation and in -- of our internal innovation program and priorities and spending, as you mentioned. So I still believe the range for the long term is the right range and that -- and we are moving to that, and continue to use this range as an opportunity. The key areas of opportunities, we continue to have pricing power. So as we say in our -- for example, in our 6% to 7% this year, which is a representation of our long-term view, is 2 points are coming from pricing. And then 2.5 are coming from distribution and 2.5 from organic growth. So our portfolio brands, as Tracey explained before, still offer a lot of opportunity of more distribution of at least half of our brands, which are high growth, high productivity and not at all available to the global consumers in many areas, and this will be true for many years to come. As an example, even our recent acquisition, BECCA, has enormous opportunities for growing also international, online, in travel retail and all these areas, which will build value, and today are not leveraged by a brand which is doing very well among its target group. And we have plenty example like this in our portfolio. The 2.5% organic growth in a market, which is growing 4% to 5% in prestige that continues to grow much faster than mass is frankly achievable if we get our plans together. So we still believe that the 6% to 8% range is achievable, but also it's possible that in some areas will be 6% and not 8%, as we have demonstrated in the past. In terms of your second question, which is our flexibility, it's actually the key point. Our financial flexibility is there, and we are regularly adjusting resources to -- not only to the overall growth level, but also to the different priorities that we have around the world and to reallocating resources to the winning areas. That, I believe, is the most important element of flexibility we have demonstrated to have. Why this is important? Because in this moment, the markets around the world is very volatile, and there is a lot of change going on. So the ability to adapt and to reallocate resources in an agile way is one of the biggest strengths that I think we can exercise to continue to succeed, and we are ready to do it. We are prepared to do this, and our Leading Beauty Forward program, among other benefits, is also the benefit of making us stronger in our ability to do exactly that. So to close on your question, yes, we are committed to adjust and adapt costs to the future sales growth opportunity that we will have."

So we are seeing almost an equal offset in terms of some of the benefits that we're achieving from an organic growth standpoint in -- with some of those factors. As I had mentioned, I think, on our year-end call last year, that purchase accounting will bleed off over the next year or so, and you'll actually start to see some more of the margin flow through. One of the things that we also look at here, obviously, is EBITDA, given the fact that we have done a number of acquisitions in the last few years, and certainly, you'll see more progression in terms of our EBITDA margin."

The rest of M-A-C growth around the world can be double digit, as being high single digit in the quarter, which has just closed, and is projected to be double digit. So a brand that has a double-digit power already demonstrated an enormous amount of opportunity, including extra distribution opportunity internationally, is a brand that can definitely grow and go back to grow very fast. Now in the U.S., specifically, the growth -- to go back to growth, there will be certain actions that are required, including new successful innovation, and some other activity in social media that I can understand. You say, they need to be proven successful before believing them, but we know what they are and so we have trust in them. But even in terms of mix, the power of the brands will allow a double-digit growth in that medium, long term, and then on the -- that was the first part."

So the -- then on Estée Lauder and Clinique, as we said, we have stabilized the brands. These brands have been declining in the past. We have stabilized them, and we started growing consistently the makeup part. As we said, we have said that our program was to start growing from makeup. And now the quarter we just closed is 1 more quarter where this seems to be now sticking, and we keep doing this well. By the way, makeup is one of our priority, and a lot of the growth in the second semester of this fiscal year, as we anticipated, will come from makeup acceleration. And Estée Lauder and Clinique will be part of contribution to this makeup acceleration in the second part of the fiscal year. Next, we need to address the skincare trend on these 2 brands. This has been slower than what we wanted. But in the situation with Hong Kong, not really been declining and the traffic softness in U.S. department stores, which are 2 of the biggest skincare contributors to these brands has been tougher, but we have now plans to also add skincare acceleration to the already achieved makeup acceleration. In our -- and the last thing I want to say, in our plan, we play the portfolio brands. And I said other times that we have 1/3 of our portfolio, which is growing always double digit, 1/3 of our portfolio that could be just growing single, low single digit, and 1/3 of our portfolio that is growing high single digit, and in this way, we deliver the total. And so yes, we are not saying that the big brands have the role to drive the 6 to 8 on the high side. The big brands have the role to drive growth, but there are -- the other brands in the portfolio, we are growing double digit, and the portfolio mix is what's driving our long-term algorithm. Think of it like 1/3 pricing, 1/3 distribution, 1/3 organic growth and 1/3 small brands, the high-growth brands; 1/3, the medium-sized brands and then the big brands. And that's why this flexibility of managing through the different levels of growth and different brands in the portfolio and the different countries make us a more -- a less volatile, more reliable, more sustainable company than any other company. Today, company that just counts on 1 or 2 brands, given the volatility of the worlds, and only 1 or 2 markets, I believe, are less reliable in the long term than the model that we built."

But my bigger question, Fabrizio, and you even mentioned it at Barclays, that the company is changing its focus less from blockbuster home runs, successful new product innovations and more smaller things. But I'm just wondering how big a change that is culturally? Does that change the cost to compete, those kinds of things? Because that strikes me as a very, very different philosophy or approach to building your brands and launching new products than we've seen historically at the company."

You raised a lot of questions. So China, China, this was again a quarter where China retail touched double digit. So we are very happy. China retail grew overall 10%. M-A-C in China grew outstandingly and our same door in China grew in 2%, yes, and s",626,"Yes. You raised a lot of questions. So China, China, this was again a quarter where China retail touched double digit. So we are very happy. China retail grew overall 10%. M-A-C in China grew outstandingly and our same door in China grew in 2%, yes, and so that's the situation. So we have again good interesting growth in China. By the way, this is also driven by our makeup brands in a big way and by the makeup part of our heritage brands as well, and M-A-C is a really strong driver of this growth in China among others. Same thing in Korea. We are competing very well with Korea brands. We have another quarter in which in Korea, we have been a very strong retail and continue to grow market share in the country of Korean brands, which make us very competitive, and again, this has been driven by a lot of our makeup brands as well, including M-A-C. The second part of your question is the innovation plan. Definitely, New Dimension was below our expectation, and in fact, by the way, the loan for New Dimension last year was in the first quarter, and part of what we see in skincare this year in term of base is that we are anniversarying a base where there was the launch of New Dimension, that although below our expectation, was significant in term of overall volumes of innovation. And the future of our innovation is changing, as I explained, in the Barclays Conference the rest, meaning, there are some very exciting innovation and less blockbusters. We believe this is much more in line with current consumers' expectations, where consumer want to try new products and have a variety of them, and the model is not -- the breakthrough model assume a lot of advertising before the product is in store. So in reality, it's higher risk financial. While the model, where we used the growth, the innovation, to attract new consumers and to engage them, and then when we see success, we further accelerate and further leverage this innovation, is a model that particularly on our mid-sized smaller brands is much more manageable and allow faster and better financial results from this innovation than in the past. So in reality, we are going to have a mix. We still are going to have some breakthrough technology innovation and some more commercial innovations, including product, packaging, aesthetics, et cetera, innovation. The fact that a lot of the growth come from makeup is increasing the percentage of innovation, which is not about breakthrough technology, obviously, but this is still part of our portfolio. But the way in which we will look even this breakthrough technology will be with less risky upfront investment, a more gradual evolution of the winners. And that is a change in our innovation program, and is a change that will be -- is associated already with some great results where we have the right innovation, and will be associated, I believe, with a lot of good success innovation. As we said before, last year, we went from 20% of our sales growth coming from innovation in fiscal year '15 to 24% coming in fiscal year '16 from innovation. In term of the cost of innovation, which was last part of your question, frankly, I believe is the opposite. This new improvement of our innovation program is decreasing the cost of innovation, because it's decreasing the risk of it. It's decreasing the amount of money that are put upfront on innovation that don't work, and are allowing us better agility in tailored resources, where the consumers react positively to our innovation. So it's increasing the effectiveness and the rate of return on our innovation."

It certainly is difficult to predict the environment certainly most near term here in the U.S. But at least the election uncertainty will be over next week and we can move forward. I think that we are very pleased with the programs that we have to take advantage of the holiday season, and M-A-C has an incredibly strong giftable program this year. And so we're very excited about that. Certainly, we expect that, that is going to drive a great amount of volume and sales for M-A-C. In terms of Jo Malone, many of our brands are fragrance brands. Obviously, we're well positioned for holiday. We are still mindful of the fact that there are many parts of the globe that are weak, and certainly, Fabrizio talked about some of those. Hong Kong, the Middle East, we're not expecting a big pickup in those markets in the second quarter and the holiday season. We expect the U.K. to have a bit of a pickup, certainly, given the currency favorability there. We do expect that, that will be the case, and we were actually in the U.K. last week and certainly saw quite a bit of traffic in the U.K. in the shop. So I would say it's a mixed bag. I think we're very in tune with what's happening around our globe, and certainly, our regional presidents are as we migrate into this holiday season. And I think we feel we have an incredibly strong lineup across all of our brands, including Estée Lauder and Clinique for holiday."

And how sustainable current double-digit growth is? And sort of, broadly, we've estimated M-A-C has driven somewhere around 20%, 25% of company sales growth in recent years. So if it's falling, and I get the comment about international being called 70% of brand volume, but how much can the company make up with acquisitions or other assuming that the rest of the portfolio doesn't accelerate?

And this, you can make the same assumption by channel, by country. We manage the portfolio at different growth levels. So specifically to M-A-C, M-A-C is internationally. So outside of the United States, M-A-C is a relatively untapped brand in term of price and distribution in many countries. Take countries like China, where M-A-C is really, really untapped, there's enormous opportunities only in a limited number of cities and a lot to go, and there are many examples like that. And there are other places where M-A-C is well penetrated, well developed, like the U.S. or the U.K. So depend by the mix. Each one of this brand has a very different mix and portfolio. That's why I don't think we are going to deploy every single brand and every single opportunity in price and distribution of organic growth per brand. And that's why I summarize it with 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 and then -- so this will continue. And the second part of the question is the role of acquisitions. Yes, we have -- in the fragrance business, the role of acquisition has been to create the engines of growth of this new high-end artisanal fragrance category, where we want to lead and to drive growth. And I think, this quarter, you see for the first time a very significant sign of that and the potential of it in the long term. We are doing in fragrances what we did in makeup artistry on makeup, and then we will continue to drive that. In the other categories, acquisition will play a role, like they always play, they will continue to play a role to create the right portfolio brands and to create the right possibility of growing in areas where we have strategic opportunity or strategic gaps. And so you can expect us to continue leveraging acquisition, and continuing -- analyzing the opportunities on new acquisition in the future to manage these strategic gaps or opportunities, and last, we have also some minority investments around the world that could be very interesting in the long term. For example, Dr. Jart+ in Korea, which is one of the fastest-growing Korean brands, where we have a minority investment that could be an acquisition in the future, is an example of strategic opportunities that we continue to mold to enrich our different engines of growth. And to close, I mean, we are building engines of growth, differentiated, different in many to diversify our opportunity for growth in the long term. That is the strategy, and frankly, we are making great progress on it quarter by quarter."
