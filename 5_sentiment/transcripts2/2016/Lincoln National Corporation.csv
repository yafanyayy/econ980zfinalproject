867423,319736908,926626,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience of Lincoln's franchise, we had a solid finish and what proved to be a very volatile year for capital markets. Our EPS, excluding notable items incr",1812,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience of Lincoln's franchise, we had a solid finish and what proved to be a very volatile year for capital markets. Our EPS, excluding notable items increased 5% in the fourth quarter, under the same measure for the full year, our EPS also increased by 5%, which resulted in a ROE of just over 12%.
As we begin 2016, we recognized that there a number of questions around the impact of weak capital markets on our businesses, and Randy will discuss this later.
However, it is important to note, we have positive momentum in key business drivers and our strategic initiatives are enabling us to execute on our growth, profitability and capital management initiatives. 
Some of that examples of these include, consolidated net flows of $1.4 billion in the quarter, nearly double the prior year quarter, and up 9% for the full year. 
Individual Life Insurance sales increased 11% in the quarter, while total Life Insurance sales were up 8% in 2015. 
Our book value per share, excluding AOIC is now over $52, a record and up 6% from the prior year. 
Balance sheet strength combined with solid capital generation enabled us to deploy another $250 million towards buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter, increasing our total capital return to shareholders in $2015 to $1.1 billion.
Now turning to our business lines starting with individual life. 
As I noted up front, individual Life Insurance sales were very strong this quarter, up 11%, while total Life Insurance sales are $725 million in 2015 or up more than 8%. 
It is worth spending a few minutes digging into some product stories, as sales for many of our products increased double digits in the fourth quarter.
MoneyGuard sales increased 15% as we continue to benefit from market acceptance of our MoneyGuard 2 product, and traction in recently approved states growths. For the full year, MoneyGuard had record sales. 
Indexed Universal Life sales increased 13%, as we were held by a new product launch and regulations that began in September that required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates. This resulted in an improvement in our competitive position. 
Finally, Term up 19% and VUL up 10%, also benefited product enhancements.
As a reminder, our focus on sales is not just to grow but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. In the fourth quarter, we once again achieved these objectives, with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15%, and no single product represented more than 30% of our total production. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees.
Our outlook for our Life Insurance business remains positive, as our diversified product portfolio combined with the depth and breadth of our distribution distinguishes Lincoln in the marketplace.
Turning to Group Protection. We're pleased with continued progress we are making with our repricing efforts and the improvement of our claims management effectiveness. 
Earnings once again increased from the best results in the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter sales $223 million, were down 11% in the same period last year, and full year sales were down 1%. With our pricing actions on the core performing employer paid block largely behind us, our renewal actions have moderated, but we continue to build additional margin into our book of business. 
As our pricing action stabilize, the degree of market disruption has been reduced, and we see the pace of sales activity improving. 
For example, our disability sales decreased just 9% in the quarter, after being down 30% through the first 9 months of 2015.
We expect continued improvement in sales activity, and growth to reemerge during 2016 after 2 straight years of declining sales. This will be important as we look to drive future margins improvement by growing premiums and sustaining our pricing discipline.
Declining sales -- posting strong operating results and minimal hedge breakage in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $3 billion, and we continue to consistently generate positive organic growth with a $435 million of net flows in the quarter, and $1.6 billion for the full year.
As I noticed last quarter, noted last quarter, market volatility dampen demand for most equity sensitive products, including variable annuities, and it was hard to tell a Department of Labor proposal was also having an impact on industry sales.
Given continued investor interest on the VUL combined with overhang on our stock, we want to give you more specifics how we are internally approaching the DOL proposal. First, it is important to note that there are number of possible outcomes, which we're planning for, including some I had mentioned in the past that would be less owners on VAs than the original proposal. This morning, I will specifically focus on this scenario, where no changes are made to the current proposal, as that is the situation we get asked about most frequently. While this is the most adverse scenario, it is manageable for Lincoln. 
So I would note a few things.
1, in the fourth quarter, we had nearly a $0.5 billion of positive net flows, only 30% of our sales came from products that would be impacted by the VUL proposal, namely variable annuities within qualified plans. This compares to nearly 60% of the top 10 VA writers. 
2, it's also important to note that VUL proposal does not impact the nonqualified market, where our patented Eye for Life has long to known as the income product of choice and has resulted in Lincoln being the market leader in nonqualified VA sales .
3, few years back, we decided to focus on diversifying  our mix annuity sales shifting away from VAs with living benefits and lowering our risk profile without having a meaningful impact on returns. As part of this our sales of products that are not impacted by the DOL proposal has increased to 70% of total sales, up from 50% pre-pivot.. Importantly, given our focus and momentum on diversification, we would expect this percentage to continue to increase, further reducing our dependence on sales impacted by the DOL proposal. 
Our next point, sales of VA and qualified plans will not entirely go away, as the current proposal allows for products to be sold on a commissional basis and many distributors will continue to offer the important guarantees that VAs provide. In addition, we expect to see accelerated growth in our fee-based VA products, as we have been approached by many of our largest distribution partners about fee-based opportunity. 
We're also increasing our focus on fixed and index annuities, which still have PTEA4-24 exemption. Finally, recall we have said that there is a sales disruption, we would be able to reallocate capital to share buybacks to block much of the EPS impact over the next several years as we pivot to the extent wide, as skill and capability, we have successfully demonstrated in the past. 
So I believe companies like Lincoln with market-leader position and have scale that have a broad portfolio of products along with leading distribution will continue to succeed.
Let me turn retirement plan services. Retirement plan services, earnings  and net flows were consistent with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.1 billion were down 10%, however,, excluding 1 large case from the prior year, deposits increased nearly 40%. 
Full year results were very good story, with record total deposits $7.5 billion, supported by strength in both small and mid-to large markets. 
Notably, small market deposits were up 18% to a record $2.1 billion, and mid-to large market 1,2x as many plans as compared to the prior year.
Total outflows for the quarter negative $222 million and included a large case termination, we referenced on our the third quarter call. Full year net flows increased $452 million compared to outflows of $881 million in the prior year. 
The increase was driven by our strong deposits and improvement in our retention rate, as we benefit on from our strategic investments.
Looking ahead to 2016, we would not be surprise to see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows, however, we expect our net flows will exceed 2015 levels. This confidence is driven by our strategy, which aligns the fastest-growing market customers that value our high touch service model. This combination enables us to better depend profitability and achieve our target return.
Bottom line, we remain optimistic in the growth outlook for our retirement business.
Lastly on investment management, different profitability and achieve our targeted turns. Bottom line, I remain optimistic in the growth outlook for our retirement business.
Lastly on investment management, we put new money to work in the fourth quarter at an average yield 4.3%, which was consistent with recent quarters and 210 basis points over the average tenure treasury. Following strong results in our alternatives portfolio in the third quarter, alternative did not contribute to earnings this quarter, which makes our EPS growth even more impressive. 
Over the last 4 years, our alternatives portfolio has returned more than 10% annually, a level we target over the long run.
Our investment portfolio's high-quality and diversified by industry, geography and issuance. We ended the year with a net unrealized gain of approximately $3 billion and our below investment grade exposure is just 5.1% of invested assets, a slight improvement from the prior year.
With the recent volatility and weakness in the energy markets, I want to update you on our exposure. First, it's worth noting, that we stopped investing in the energy sector a year ago. And since the end of 2014, we have reduced our fixed income energy exposure by nearly $1 billion. 
This included approximately $400 million in maturities, and roughly $600 million of asset sales based on a assessment of our exposures with our external Asset Managers. Importantly, the sales produced fewer losses than what was in our capital plan. At year end, market value of our $8.6 billion energy portfolio was 95% of book value. Our high yield energy exposure was about $600 million, up modestly from the prior year due to ratings migration, and represented just 7.5% of our energy exposure.
We continue to proactively monitor and manage our energy exposure.
So in closing, I'm very pleased we were able to grow EPS mid-single digits in 2015, despite equity market declines, consistently with low interest rates and mortality fluctuations. 
We showed great progress on several strategic initiatives, including restoring profitability in Group Protection, growth in RPS, highlighted by significant improvement in net flows, continued momentum in our annuity pivot, which positions us well for the DOL, and a strong life new business returns. Bottom line, we remain confident in our franchise and our ability to grow earnings.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."
867423,319736908,926626,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $382 million or $1.54 per share for the fourth quarter. The current quarter did not include any notable items, and as Dennis mentioned, EPS increased 5% year-over-year, excluding $0.20",1464,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $382 million or $1.54 per share for the fourth quarter. 
The current quarter did not include any notable items, and as Dennis mentioned, EPS increased 5% year-over-year, excluding $0.20 of favorable items in the prior year quarter, primarily related to our reinsurance recapture. Under the same measure, full year EPS increased 5% to $6.04.
One other item to point to specific to the fourth quarter, alternative investment income was $18 million below our plan or $0.07 per share. Moving to the performance of key financial metrics, all of which normalized for notable items. Top line growth remained strong, operating revenue up 6% for the quarter, and for the full year driven by positive net flows in every quarter of the year, and product mix shift.
Continued focus on managing expenses created further margin expansion as the 4% growth in annual G&A, net of capitalized expenses, trailed revenue growth.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI grew 6% to $52.38. Operating return on equity came in at 12% for the quarter, and 12.2% for the full year. 
Our balance sheet remain an important source of strength with strong capital and liquidity metric, which gives us significant financial taxability. And finally, our year-end cash flow testing continues to point to a significant statutory reserve advocacy and we do not anticipate reserve deficiency in any of our entities. And, we completed our goodwill review and do not have any impairments.
Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items. The largest of which was a noneconomic charge of $43 million related to nonperformance risk, which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Hedge break, which was modest at just $13 million.
Before moving to segment results, I wanted to provide some perspective on the current market environment. First on the recent equity market weakness. It's obviously presents a headwind to earnings growth and we have been very clear on the sensitivity, roughly $9 million for every 1% moving equity markets. 
Also, it is worth reminding you that we have a reversing to the mean approach within in our debt model, and as of year end is provided a cushion against weak equity markets. 
Next, the interest rate environment. We know low interest rates remains topical, but it's important to recognize that we have effectively manage through persistently low rate and will continue to do so. 
Importantly, our product portfolio has been repriced over the past several years to reflect a low interest rate environment, and last quarter, we lowered our long-term earn rate, which leaves us very well positioned for this particular assumption. Bottom line, low rates remain just in earnings headwind, and the impact had consistent with the 2% to 3% we have noted in the past.
With respect to the current capital markets environment, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS.
Now, I will turn to segment results. And starting with annuity. Reported earnings for the quarter were $243 million, a 3% increase over last year. 
Operating revenues increased 12% from the fourth quarter of 2014, as premiums benefited from an increase in fixed annuity deposits. Positive net flows in every quarter of 2015 resulted in average account balances, reaching over $124 billion, up 4%.
Return metrics remain strong and consistent with recent periods. For the full year, ROE increased 3 basis points, ROE came in at 24%. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past 3 years, and has averaged 20% for nearly a decade. Outstanding results that highlights returns that are high quality annuity book can deliver. 
And return with planned services, we reported earnings of $33 million. Fourth quarter revenue growth was unchanged year-over-year with annual revenue growth up 1%. Average account values ended the year at $54 billion, up 3% compared to 2014, driven by positive net flows.
Normalized spreads compress 11 basis points for the year. This is at the low end of our guidance, and looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points. 
Return on assets was 25 basis points for the fourth quarter, and 26 basis points for the full year. 2015 was a good year for the retirement business highlighted by record deposits, nearly $0.5 billion of net flows, and returns that fell within our targeted range.
While earnings will slight the headwinds of low interest rates and weak markets start the year, we expect to see continued growth in net flows.
The Life Insurance segment reported fourth quarter earnings of $119 million compared to $14 million last year after normalizing items, primarily related to the reinsurance recapture. 
Of the $18 million of below plan alternative investment income I noted up front, $12 million of it hit the life business. 
results were consistent with the third quarter, following elevated experience in the first half of 2015. But I would note the mix of claims was a little different, so the financial impact was slightly worse than we would have thought. An example of this would be a higher proportion of term plans that have less reserve offsets and a typical interest sensitive claim.
Normalized spreads in the fourth quarter were down to 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and down 6 basis points for the full year. Looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 5 to 10 basis points on an annual basis. Earnings drivers remains steady for the quarter and year, with average account balances up 3% to 4%, and Life Insurance and force up 3%.
Overall, this year's earnings were drag down by elevated mortality, which overshadowed strong sales results. While we would -- while we continue to assume first quarter results will be negatively impacted by typical seasonality, we do not expect 2015's elevated mortality to persist in the coming year.
Group Protection earnings of $13 million compared to a loss of $7 million the prior year quarter. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 75.3% from 81% in the prior year quarter, driven by our life and disability product lines, which benefited from pricing actions and improvements in disability claims management.
For the full year, our loss ratio improved by 300 basis points, and we expect further progress in 2016.
Our renewal pricing actions continue to have a favorable way impact on margins, but they have negatively impacted persistency and sales. The result is a nonmedical earned premiums decreased 5% compared to the prior year quarter.
Our extensive repricing of policy renewals was also have an impact on DAC conversation. With the first quarter, our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period.
In the first quarter, we expect this acceleration of DAC to pressure earnings  relative for the most recent run rate. 
So overall, another quarter that validates we are on a path to an earnings recovery, and we expect further improvement in our underwriting profitability in 2016.
As the sales momentum Dennis mentioned starts to build and emerges into premium, we believe margins will continue to improve.
Let me discuss capital management and our capital position before we turn to Q&A. This quarter we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. For the full year, we repurchased $900 million of stock, which is a 38% increase from the prior year. When combined with a 25% increase in our dividend per share, total deployment to shareholders increased to $1.1 billion.
We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow, and as importantly, we have actually returned that cash to shareholders. The share buybacks totaling $3.1 billion over the last 5 years, and dividends more than tripling over the same period.
Historically, I have pointed to 45% to 50% of operating earnings as the good proxy for free cash flow, what is available for buybacks and dividends. 
Based on the shift in our product mix. Notably, the successful pivots within our life annuity businesses, I'm increasing our outlook for 50% to 55%. 
This positions us well to remain active returning capital to shareholders, and the recent weakness in the share price enables us to acquire stock below book value and excellent use of capital. 
It is also worth noting, our revised free cash flow estimate does not include, the reallocation of capital under the adversity scenario Dennis spoke to earlier.
Quickly on capital and liquidity, where we are extremely well positioned. Statutory surplus at $8.4 billion, and an estimated RBC ratio of 490%. Holding company cash at $608 million is well above our target of $500 million, and we remain comfortable with our current leverage and capital structure. 
And would know our next debt maturity is not until 2018.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

So and from a balance sheet standpoint, it becomes credit risk. We have been through credit cycle in a while, and we may be entering or we may not be. 
Now as we enter the future period, I feel very comfortable with our overall position, very strong balance sheet, a balance sheet that arguably is in a position to handle any stress that comes its way.

With respect to Met, le me just make a couple of comments, Steve is a bright guys day, and he's got strong management team, and I'm sure whatever they end up doing is going to benefit shareholders. When I come back to their individual life business, and I think about it on a competitive perspective as competing against them is I understand what they attempt to achieve the spit-up is to get U.S. business out from underneath the city Regulation. And what that will do, reporting from them of a capital perspective putting on the same as Lincoln and the rest of the industry. 
So on that respect, we just sort of getting back on a level playing field from a capital perspective, and we don't compete companies on the basis of uneven capital 
So that's help doesn't bother us. And so, when I think about that U.S. versus Lincoln. First of all, we have much more diversification in our business, and what I understand they will end up with and from back to competition, we have such a strong distribution franchise, we have such a strong breadth of product portfolio just comparatively, we sell twice as much life and annuity as Met does. 
So I think they will be a good competitor, they have solid base in The United States. But the strength of Lincoln, the competition, the capability or competitive, I think our capabilities are strong, and are going to continue to grow."

But I personally been negotiating at least discussing this with the executive committee at the NEIC. And so I think I have a pretty good handle on the direction that going. 
And so let me take -- make a couple of comments. The high level objective of the review is to eliminate the statutory and gap reserve issue that has to do simply with market value versus book value accounting. 
And the regulators understand that there should be a regulation in place, where you can't protect yourself against both potential challenges, which you have to pick one or the other. Okay. 
So what they're trying to do is eliminate this negative arbitrage between sometimes it called economics, sometimes it called book value. But the intent is to try to find a way to eliminate that having to choose 1 versus the other. The proposal that has come out very definitely goes in that direction. 
And so there is an attempt again to improve the regulation, hopeful the benefit of regulators as well the benefit of the companies. 
And so that's the direction it's moving. is about to start and study and try to measure this problem from all the different companies data. 
So that's substitute of what's going on specifically with respect to captives, the need for captives, if this goes in the direction it seems to be going is lessened. And the current thinking at NEIC is that, even though it's a lessened, whatever captives are in place will be grandfather. So I generally see this is moving a very positive direction for the entire VA industry and the regulators. Having said that, there is a long way to go before we get to the final regulations."

Over the long-term, as Dennis mentioned, we're very excited about the way the NEIC is moving. And so, we'll see what our thoughts are, if and when those rules get change, But the interim, no need or reason to Let me expand and explain a little bit, why I think that is. Every company has its own facts and circumstances, and I'm not going to speak to why or why not other companies would or would not capture the captives. 
But Lincoln's fact and circumstances around this issue are the following. The way we have operated our captive over the years with a hedge program link to the economics has left us in a very desirable position. In that we have significant amount of hard assets, hard assets that exceed both the economic base liability and at the end of the year, they exceeded them by a $1.4 billion and significantly exceed the statutory reserve credit required, at the end of the year, they exceeded statutory reserve credit by $900 million. 
So the way we have operated our captive in the past from our reserving standpoint, from a hedging standpoint has left us in a very favorable position, that a position that I don't believe all companies necessarily share. 
The second thing I would point out is that the way, we have capitalized our VA business also contributes to that very favorable position. We capitalized our variable annuity guaranteed business is that, we have a formula that has a greater of approach, it's greater of CP 98 and a floor percentage of our comp
actually for a while now that floor has been the controlling item, instead of the capital formula. But the CT 98 is a very high level, high threshold from a capital standpoint. It's actually, if we were to take the CTA 98 down to CTE 95, which is where I hear some of my peer companies talk about the capitalization at, you would actually see a $1 billion less of required capital against our VA business. 
So we're in a very good position, recapturing our captive would have very little impact at all on the parent company, where we to do that. And that is directly linked to how we have operated this company in the past both from a hedging standpoint and from a capitalization standpoint."

867423,319736908,926964,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience of Lincoln's franchise, as we had a solid finish and what proved to be a very volatile year for capital markets. Our EPS, excluding notable items,",1818,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience of Lincoln's franchise, as we had a solid finish and what proved to be a very volatile year for capital markets. Our EPS, excluding notable items, increased 5% in the fourth quarter. Under the same measure for the full year, our EPS also increased by 5%, which resulted in a ROE of just over 12%.
As we begin 2016, we recognized that there a number of questions around the impact of weak capital markets on our businesses, and Randy will discuss this later.
However, it is important to note, we have positive momentum in key business drivers and our strategic initiatives are enabling us to execute on our growth, profitability and capital management initiatives. 
Some examples of these include consolidated net flows of $1.4 billion in the quarter, nearly double the prior year quarter, and up 9% for the full year. 
Individual Life Insurance sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, while total Life Insurance sales were up 8% in 2015. 
Our book value per share, excluding AOIC, is now over $52, a record and up 6% from the prior year. 
Balance sheet strength combined with solid capital generation enabled us to deploy another $250 million towards buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter, increasing our total capital return to shareholders in $2015 to $1.1 billion.
Now turning to our business lines, starting with individual life. 
As I noted up front, individual Life Insurance sales were very strong this quarter, up 11%, while total Life Insurance sales of $725 million in 2015 were up more than 8%. 
It is worth spending a few minutes digging into some product stories, as sales for many of our products increased double digits in the fourth quarter.
MoneyGuard sales increased 15% as we continue to benefit from market acceptance of our MoneyGuard 2 product, and traction in recently approved states growths. For the full year, MoneyGuard had record sales. 
Indexed Universal Life sales increased 13%, as we were helped by a new product launch and regulation that began in September that required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates. This resulted in an improvement in our competitive position. 
Finally, Term up 19% and VUL up 10%, also benefited from product enhancements.
As a reminder, our focus on sales is not just to grow but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. In the fourth quarter, we once again achieved these objectives, with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15%, and no single product represented more than 30% of our total production. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees.
Our outlook for our Life Insurance business remains positive, as our diversified product portfolio combined with the depth and breadth of our distribution distinguishes Lincoln in the marketplace.
Turning to Group Protection. We're pleased with the continued progress we are making with our repricing efforts and the improvement of our claims management effectiveness. 
Earnings once again increased from depressed results in the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter sales of $223 million were down 11% from the same period last year, and full year sales were down 16%. With our pricing actions on the core performing employer-paid block largely behind us, our renewal actions have moderated, but we continue to build additional margin into our book of business. 
As our pricing actions have stabilized, the degree of market disruption has been reduced, and we see the pace of sales activity improving. 
For example, our disability sales decreased just 9% in the quarter, after being down 30% through the first 9 months of 2015.
We expect continued improvement in sales activity and growth to reemerge during 2016 after 2 straight years of declining sales. This will be important as we look to drive future margin improvement by growing premiums and sustaining our pricing discipline.
Turning to annuities, our annuity business remains a high quality source of earnings as we posted strong operating results and minimal hedge breakage in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $3 billion, and we continue to consistently generate positive organic growth with $435 million of net flows in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year.
As I noticed last quarter -- noted last quarter, market volatility dampened demand for most equity-sensitive products, including variable annuities, and it was hard to tell if Department of Labor proposal was also having an impact on industry sales.
Given continued investor interest on the DOL combined with an obvious overhang on our stock, we wanted to give you more specifics of how we are internally approaching the DOL proposal. First, it is important to note that there are a number of possible outcomes, which we are planning for, including some I have mentioned in the past that would be less owners on VAs than the original proposal. This morning, I will specifically focus on this scenario where no changes are made to the current proposal, as that is the situation we get asked about most frequently. While this is the most adverse scenario, it is manageable for Lincoln. 
So I would note a few things.
One, in the fourth quarter, we had nearly a $0.5 billion of positive net flows, only 30% of our sales came from products that would be impacted by the DOL proposal, namely variable annuities within qualified plans. This compares to nearly 60% for the top 10 VA writers. 
Point 2, it's also important to note, the DOL proposal does not impact the nonqualified market where our patented Eye for Life has long been known as the income product of choice and has resulted in Lincoln being the market leader in nonqualified VA sales.
Point 3, a few years back, we decided to focus on diversifying our mix annuity sales, tilting away from VAs with living benefits and lowering our risk profile without having a meaningful impact on returns. As part of this pivot, our sales of products that are not impacted by the DOL proposal has increased to 70% of total sales, up from 50% pre-pivot. Importantly, given our focus and momentum on diversification, we would expect this percentage to continue to increase, further reducing our dependence on sales impacted by the DOL proposal. 
My next point, sales of VA and qualified plans will not entirely go away, as the current proposal allows for products to be sold on a commissional basis and many distributors will continue to offer the important guarantees that VAs provide. In addition, we would expect to see accelerated growth in our fee-based VA products, as we have been approached by many of our largest distribution partners about fee-based opportunity. We're also increasing our focus on fixed and indexed annuities, which still have PTEA4-24 exemption. 
Finally, recall we have said that there is a sales disruption, we would be able to reallocate capital to share buybacks to block much of the EPS impact over the next several years as we pivot to the extent required, a skill and capability we have successfully demonstrated in the past. 
So I believe companies like Lincoln with market-leader positions and have scale that have a broad portfolio of products along with leading distribution will continue to succeed.
Let me turn to retirement plan services. In retirement plan services, earnings and net flows were consistent with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.1 billion were down 10%, however, excluding 1 large case from the prior year, deposits increased nearly 40%. 
Full year results were a very good story, with record total deposits $7.5 billion, supported by strength in both small and mid to large markets. 
Notably, small market deposits were up 18% to a record $2.1 billion, and mid to large market won 2x as many plans as compared to the prior year.
Total outflows for the quarter were negative $220 million and included a large case termination we referenced on our third quarter call. Full year net flows increased $452 million compared to outflows of $881 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by our strong deposits and improvement in our retention rate as we benefit from our strategic investments.
Looking ahead to 2016, we would not be surprised to see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows. However, we expect our net flows will exceed 2015 levels. This confidence is driven by our strategy, which aligns the fastest-growing market with customers that value our high touch service model. This combination enables us to better defend profitability and achieve our target returns. Bottom line, we remain optimistic in the growth outlook for our retirement business.
Lastly on investment management, we put new money to work in the fourth quarter at an average yield of 4.3%, which was consistent with recent quarters, and 210 basis points over the average 10-year treasury.
Following strong results in our alternatives portfolio in the third quarter, alternatives did not contribute to earnings this quarter, which makes our EPS growth even more impressive. Over the last 4 years, our alternatives portfolio has returned more than 10% annually, a level we target over the long run.
Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography and issuers. We ended the year with a net unrealized gain of approximately $3 billion and our below investment grade exposure is just 5.1% of invested assets, a slight improvement from the prior year.
With the recent volatility and weakness in the energy market, I want to update you on our exposure. First, it is worth noting that we stopped investing in the energy sector a year ago. And since the end of 2014, we have reduced our fixed income energy exposure by nearly $1 billion. 
This included approximately $400 million in maturities and roughly $600 million of asset sales based on an assessment of our exposures with our external asset managers. Importantly, these sales produced fewer losses than what was in our capital plan. At year end, the market value of our $8.6 billion energy portfolio was 95% of book value. Our high-yield energy exposure was about $600 million, up modestly from the prior year due to ratings migration, and represented just 7.5% of our energy exposure. We continue to proactively monitor and manage our energy exposure.
So in closing, I'm very pleased we were able to grow EPS mid-single digits in 2015, despite equity market declines, persistently low interest rates and mortality fluctuations. We showed great progress on several strategic initiatives, including restoring profitability in Group Protection, growth in RPS highlighted by significant improvement in net flows, continued momentum in our annuity pivot, which positions us well for the DOL, and strong life new business returns. Bottom line, we remain confident in our franchise and our ability to grow earnings.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $382 million or $1.54 per share for the fourth quarter. The current quarter did not include any notable items, and as Dennis mentioned, EPS increased 5% year-over-year, excluding $0.20 of favorable items in the prior year quarter, primarily related to our reinsurance recapture. Under the same measure, full year EPS increased 5% to $6.04.
One other item to point to is specific to the fourth quarter. Alternative investment income was $18 million below our plan or $0.07 per share. Moving to the performance of key financial metrics, all of which normalized for notable items. Top line growth remained strong, with operating revenue up 6% for the quarter and for the full year, driven by positive net flows in every quarter of the year and product mix shift.
Continued focus on managing expenses created further margin expansion as the 4% growth in annual G&A, net of capitalized expenses, trailed revenue growth.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 6% to $52.38. Operating return on equity came in at 12% for the quarter and 12.2% for the full year. 
Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, with strong capital and liquidity metrics, which gives us significant financial taxability. And finally, our year-end cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy, and we do not anticipate reserve deficiencies in any of our entities. And we completed our goodwill review and did not have any impairments.
Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items. The largest of which was a noneconomic charge of $43 million related to nonperformance risk, which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Hedge breakage was modest at just $13 million.
Before moving to segment results, I wanted to provide some perspective on the current market environment. First, on the recent equity market weakness, it obviously presents a headwind to earnings growth and we have been very clear on the sensitivity, roughly $9 million for every 1% move in equity markets. 
Also, it is worth reminding you that we have a reversion to the mean approach within in our DAC model, and as of year end, has provided a cushion against weak equity markets. 
Next, the interest rate environment. We know low interest rates remains topical, but it's important to recognize that we have effectively managed through persistently low rates and will continue to do so. 
Importantly, our product portfolio has been repriced over the past several years to reflect a low interest rate environment, and last quarter, we lowered our long-term earn rate, which leaves us very well-positioned for this particular assumption. Bottom line, low rates remain just an earnings headwind, and the impact is consistent with the 2% to 3% we have noted in the past.
So despite the current capital markets environment, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS.
Now I will turn to segment results. And starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $243 million, a 3% increase over last year. 
Operating revenues increased 12% from the fourth quarter of 2014, as premiums benefited from an increase in fixed annuity deposits. Positive net flows in every quarter of 2015 resulted in average account balances reaching over $124 billion, up 4%.
Return metrics remain strong and consistent with recent periods. For the full year, ROA increased 3 basis points, while ROE came in at 24%. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past 3 years, and has averaged 20% for nearly a decade, outstanding results that highlights the returns that a high quality annuity book can deliver. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $33 million. Fourth quarter revenue growth was unchanged year-over-year, with annual revenue growth up 1%. Average account values ended the year at $54 billion, up 3% compared to 2014, driven by positive net flows.
Normalized spreads compressed 11 basis points for the year. This is at the low end of our guidance, and looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points. Return on assets was 25 basis points for the fourth quarter and 26 basis points for the full year. 
2015 was a good year for the retirement business, highlighted by record deposits, nearly $0.5 billion of net flows, and returns that fell within our targeted range.
While earnings will fight the headwinds of low interest rates and weak markets at the start of the year, we expect to see continued growth in net flows.
The Life Insurance segment reported fourth quarter earnings of $119 million compared to $140 million last year after normalizing items, primarily related to the reinsurance recapture. 
Of the $18 million of below plan alternative investment income I noted up front, $12 million of it hit the life business. 
Mortality results were consistent with the third quarter, following elevated experience in the first half of 2015. But I would note, the mix of claims was a little different, so the financial impact was slightly worse than we would have hoped. An example of this would be a higher portion of term plans that have less reserve offsets than a typical interest-sensitive claim.
Normalized spreads in the fourth quarter were down to 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and down 6 basis points for the full year. Looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 5 to 10 basis points on an annual basis. Earnings drivers remain steady for the quarter and year, with average account balances up 3% to 4%, and life insurance in force up 3%.
Overall, this year's earnings were dragged down by elevated mortality, which overshadowed strong sales results. While we would -- while we continue to assume first quarter results will be negatively impacted by typical seasonality, we do not expect 2015's elevated mortality to persist in the coming year.
Group Protection earnings of $13 million compared to a loss of $7 million the prior year quarter. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 75.3% from 81% in the prior year quarter, driven by our life and disability product lines, which benefited from pricing actions and improvements in disability claims management.
For the full year, our loss ratio improved by 300 basis points, and we expect further progress in 2016.
Our renewal pricing actions continue to have a favorable impact on margins, but they have negatively impacted persistency in sales. The result is that nonmedical earned premiums decreased 5% compared to the prior year quarter.
Our extensive repricing of policy renewals also has an impact on DAC conversation. With the first quarter, our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period.
In the first quarter, we expect this acceleration of DAC to pressure earnings relative to the most recent run rate. 
So overall, another quarter that validates we are on a path to an earnings recovery, and we expect further improvement in our underwriting profitability in 2016.
As the sales momentum Dennis mentioned starts to build and emerges into premiums, we believe margins will continue to improve.
Let me discuss capital management and our capital position before we turn to Q&A. This quarter we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. For the full year, we repurchased $900 million of stock, which is a 38% increase from the prior year. When combined with a 25% increase in our dividend per share, total deployment to shareholders increased to $1.1 billion.
We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow, and as importantly, we have actually returned that cash to shareholders with share buybacks totaling $3.1 billion over the last 5 years, and dividends more than tripling over the same period.
Historically, I have pointed to 45% to 50% of operating earnings as a good proxy for free cash flow, or what is available for buybacks and dividends. 
Based on the shift in our product mix, notably the successful pivots within our life and annuity businesses, I'm increasing our outlook to 50% to 55%.  This positions us well to remain active returning capital to the shareholders, and the recent weakness in the share price enables us to acquire stock below book value and excellent use of capital. 
It is also worth noting, our revised free cash flow estimate does not include the reallocation of capital under the adversity of oil scenario Dennis spoke to earlier.
Quickly on capital and liquidity where we are extremely well-positioned, with statutory surplus at $8.4 billion, and an estimated RBC ratio of 490%. Holding company cash at $608 million is well above our target of $500 million, and we remain comfortable with our current leverage and capital structure. And I would note, our next debt maturity is not until 2018.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

All that being said, we're going to be cognizant of the environment that exist today.

So from a balance sheet standpoint, it becomes credit risk. We haven't been through a credit cycle in a while, and we may be entering or we may not be.

It's just over the long-term where we're building value for our shareholders. With respect to MET, let me just make a couple of comments. One, Steve is a bright guy and he's got he's got a strong management team. And I'm sure whatever they end up doing is going to benefit shareholders. When I come back to their individual life business, and I think about it from a competitive perspective, us competing against them, is I understand what they attempt to achieve by the split up is to get the U.S. life business out from underneath the specific regulations. And what that would do, and importantly for them, from a capital perspective, will put them on the same footing as Lincoln and the rest of the industry. So from that respect, they're just sort of getting back on a level playing field from a capital perspective, and we don't compete against companies on the basis of uneven capital regime, so that's helped them, it doesn't bother us. And so, when I think about MET U.S. versus Lincoln, first of all, we have much more diversification in our business than what I understand they'll end up with. And from back to competition, we have such a strong distribution franchise, we have such a strong breadth of product portfolio, just comparatively, we sell twice as much life and annuity as MET does. So I think, they'll be a good competitor, they have a solid base in The United States, but the strength of Lincoln, the competition, the capability from a competitive stance, I think, our capabilities are strong and are going to continue to grow."

But I've personally been negotiating, at least discussing this with the executive committee of the NAIC. And so I think I have a pretty good handle on the direction that it's going. And so let me take -- make a couple of comments. The high level objective of the review is to eliminate the statutory and GAAP reserve issue that has to do simply with market value versus book value accounting. And the regulators understand that there shouldn't be a regulation in place where you can't protect yourself against both potential challenges, but you have to pick one or the other, okay? So what they're trying to do is eliminate this negative arbitrage between, sometimes it's called economics, sometimes it's called book value. But the intent is to try to find a way to eliminate that, having to choose 1 versus the other. The proposal that has come out very definitely goes in that direction. And so there's an attempt again to improve the regulation, hopefully the benefit of regulators as well the benefit of the companies. And so that's the direction it's moving. Oliver Wyman is about to start and study and sort of try to measure this problem from all the different companies' data. So that's subsequently what's going, specifically with respect to captives, the need for captives, if this goes in the direction it seems to be going, is lessened. And the current thinking at NAIC is that even though it's lessened, whatever captives are in place will be grandfathered. So I generally see this is moving in a very positive direction for the entire VA industry and the regulators. Having said that, there's a long way to go before we get to the final regulations."

Over the long-term, as Dennis mentioned, we're very excited about the way the NAIC is moving. And so we'll see what our thoughts are if and when those rules get changed. But in the interim, no need or reason to do that. Let me expand and explain a little bit why I think that is. Every company has its own facts and circumstances, and I'm not going to speak to why or why not other companies would or would not recapture their captives. But Lincoln's facts and circumstances around this issue are the following. The way we have operated our captive over the years with a hedge program linked to the economics has left us in a very desirable position in that we have significant amount of hard assets, hard assets that exceed both the economic base liability, and at the end of the year, they exceeded them by $1.4 billion, and significantly exceed the statutory reserve credit required at the end of the year, they exceeded statutory reserve credit by $900 million. So the way we've operated our captive in the past  from reserving standpoint, from a hedging standpoint, has left us in a very favorable position that -- a position that I don't believe all companies necessarily share. The second thing I would point out is that the way we have capitalized our VA business also contributes to that very favorable position. The way we capitalized our variable annuity of guaranteed business is that we have a formula that has a grader of approach, just a grader CT 98 [ph] and a floor percentage of our comp values. Factually, for a while now, that floor has been the controlling item inside of the capital formula. But the CT 98 is a very high level, high threshold from a capital standpoint. Factually, if we were to take the CT 98 down to CT 95, which is where I hear some of my peer companies talk about the capitalization at, you would actually see $1 billion less of required capital against our VA business. So we're in a very good position. Recapturing our captive would have very little impact at all on the parent company, were we to do that. And that is directly linked to how we have operated this company in the past, both from a hedging standpoint and from a capitalization standpoint."

But I think, given the position you're in, I think, it would be real positive if you all would consider, in the interest of better transparency, recapturing the captive, particularly if it's that strong. I think, right now, I think, there's, just generally speaking, those still using captives, there's confusion in terms of how do you compare it versus others and sort of what it might mean if it does move in the direction of where companies get pushed to move things to an opco. But anyway, so that's -- so I think, just from a perception, from a transparency standpoint, I think it would be a positive if you move in that direction.

867423,319736908,927267,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience of Lincoln's franchise, as we had a solid finish in what proved to be a very volatile year for capital markets. Our EPS, excluding notable items, i",1822,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience of Lincoln's franchise, as we had a solid finish in what proved to be a very volatile year for capital markets. Our EPS, excluding notable items, increased 5% in the fourth quarter. Under the same measure for the full year, our EPS also increased 5%, which resulted in a ROE of just over 12%.
As we begin 2016, we recognize that there are a number of questions around the impact of weak capital markets on our businesses, and Randy will discuss this later.
However, it is important to note, we have positive momentum in key business drivers and our strategic initiatives are enabling us to execute on our growth, profitability and capital management initiatives. 
Some examples of these include consolidated net flows of $1.4 billion in the quarter, nearly double the prior year quarter, and up 9% for the full year. 
Individual Life Insurance sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, while total Life Insurance sales were up 8% in 2015. 
Our book value per share, excluding AOIC, is now over $52, a record and up 6% from the prior year. 
Balance sheet strength combined with solid capital generation enabled us to deploy another $250 million towards buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter, increasing our total capital return to shareholders in 2015 to $1.1 billion.
Now turning to our business lines, starting with individual life. 
As I noted up front, individual Life Insurance sales were very strong this quarter, up 11%, while total Life Insurance sales of $725 million in 2015 were up more than 8%. 
It is worth spending a few minutes digging into some product stories, as sales for many of our products increased double digits in the fourth quarter.
MoneyGuard sales increased 15% as we continue to benefit from market acceptance of our MoneyGuard II product, and traction in recently approved states grows. For the full year, MoneyGuard had record sales. 
Indexed Universal Life sales increased 13%, as we were helped by a new product launch and regulation that began in September that required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates. This resulted in an improvement in our competitive position. 
Finally, Term, up 19%, and VUL, up 12%, also benefited from product enhancements. 
As a reminder, our focus on sales is not just to grow but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. In the fourth quarter, we once again achieved these objectives, with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15%, and no single product represented more than 30% of our total production. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees.
Our outlook for our Life Insurance business remains positive, as our diversified product portfolio, combined with the depth and breadth of our distribution, distinguishes Lincoln in the marketplace.
Turning to Group Protection. We're pleased with the continued progress we are making with our repricing efforts and the improvement of our claims management effectiveness. 
Earnings once again increased from depressed results in the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter sales of $223 million were down 11% from the same period last year, and full year sales were down 16%. With our pricing actions on the poor-performing employer-paid block largely behind us, our renewal actions have moderated, but we continue to build additional margin into our book of business. 
As our pricing actions have stabilized, the degree of market disruption has been reduced, and we see the pace of sales activity improving. 
For example, our disability sales decreased just 9% in the quarter, after being down 30% through the first 9 months of 2015.
We expect continued improvement in sales activity and growth to reemerge during 2016 after 2 straight years of declining sales. This will be important as we look to drive future margin improvement by growing premiums and sustaining our pricing discipline.
Turning to annuities, our annuity business remains a high quality source of earnings as we posted strong operating results and minimal hedge breakage in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $3 billion, and we continue to consistently generate positive organic growth with $435 million of net flows in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year.
As I noticed last quarter -- noted last quarter, market volatility dampened demand for most equity-sensitive products, including variable annuities, and it was hard to tell if the Department of Labor proposal was also having an impact on industry sales.
Given continued investor interest on the DOL combined with an obvious overhang on our stock, we wanted to give you more specifics of how we are internally approaching the DOL proposal. First, it is important to note that there are a number of possible outcomes which we are planning for, including some I have mentioned in the past that would be less onerous on VAs than the original proposal. This morning, I will specifically focus on the scenario where no changes are made to the current proposal, as that is the situation we get asked about most frequently. While this is the most adverse scenario, it is manageable for Lincoln. 
So I would note a few things.
One, in the fourth quarter, we had nearly a $0.5 billion of positive net flows, only 30% of our sales came from products that would be impacted by the DOL proposal, namely variable annuities within qualified plans. This compares to nearly 60% for the top 10 VA writers. 
Point 2, it's also important to note, the DOL proposal does not impact the nonqualified market where our patented i4LIFE has long been known as the income product of choice and has resulted in Lincoln being the market leader in nonqualified VA sales.
Point 3, a few years back, we decided to focus on diversifying our mix of annuity sales, tilting away from VAs with living benefits and lowering our risk profile without having a meaningful impact on returns. As part of this pivot, our sales of products that are not impacted by the DOL proposal has increased to 70% of total sales, up from 50% pre-pivot. Importantly, given our focus and momentum on diversification, we would expect this percentage to continue to increase, further reducing our dependence on sales impacted by the DOL proposal. 
My next point, sales of VA and qualified plans will not entirely go away, as the current proposal allows for products to be sold on a commissionable basis and many distributors will continue to offer the important guarantees that VAs provide. In addition, we would expect to see accelerated growth in our fee-based VA product, as we have been approached by many of our largest distribution partners about the fee-based opportunity. We're also increasing our focus on fixed and indexed annuities, which still have the PTE 8424 exemption. 
Finally, recall we have said that if there is a sales disruption, we would be able to reallocate capital to share buybacks to block much of the EPS impact over the next several years as we pivot to the extent required, a skill and capability we have successfully demonstrated in the past. 
So I believe companies like Lincoln with market-leader positions and at scale that have a broad portfolio of products along with leading distribution will continue to succeed.
Let me turn to retirement plan services. In retirement plan services, earnings and net flows were consistent with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.1 billion were down 10%, however, excluding 1 large case from the prior year, deposits increased nearly 40%. 
Full year results were a very good story, with record total deposits of $7.5 billion, supported by strength in both small and mid to large markets. 
Notably, small market deposits were up 18% to a record $2.1 billion, and mid to large markets won 2x as many plans as compared to the prior year.
Total outflows for the quarter were negative $220 million and included a large case termination we referenced on our third quarter call. Full year net flows increased to $452 million compared to outflows of $881 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by our strong deposits and improvement in our retention rate as we benefit from our strategic investments.
Looking ahead to 2016, we would not be surprised to see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows. However, we expect our net flows will exceed 2015 levels. This confidence is driven by our strategy, which aligns the fastest-growing markets with the customers that value our high-touch service model. This combination enables us to better defend profitability and achieve our targeted returns. Bottom line, we remain optimistic in the growth outlook for our retirement business.
Lastly on investment management, we put new money to work in the fourth quarter at an average yield of 4.3%, which was consistent with recent quarters and 210 basis points over the average 10-year Treasury.  
Following strong results in our alternatives portfolio in the third quarter, alternatives did not contribute to earnings this quarter, which makes our EPS growth even more impressive. Over the last 4 years, our alternatives portfolio has returned more than 10% annually, a level we target over the long run.  
Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography and issuers. We ended the year with a net unrealized gain of approximately $3 billion and our below investment grade exposure is just 5.1% of invested assets, a slight improvement from the prior year.
With the recent volatility and weakness in the energy markets, I want to update you on our exposure. First, it is worth noting that we stopped investing in the energy sector a year ago. And since the end of 2014, we have reduced our fixed income energy exposure by nearly $1 billion. 
This included approximately $400 million in maturities and roughly $600 million of asset sales based on an assessment of our exposures with our external asset managers. Importantly, these sales produced fewer losses than what was in our capital plan. At year-end, the market value of our $8.6 billion energy portfolio was 95% of book value. Our high-yield energy exposure was about $600 million, up modestly from the prior year due to ratings migration, and represented just 7.5% of our energy exposure. We continue to proactively monitor and manage our energy exposure.
So in closing, I'm very pleased we were able to grow EPS mid-single digits in 2015, despite equity market declines, persistently low interest rates and mortality fluctuations. We showed great progress on several strategic initiatives, including restoring profitability in Group Protection, growth in RPS highlighted by significant improvement in net flows, continued momentum in our annuity pivot, which positions us well for the DOL, and strong life new business returns. Bottom line, we remain confident in our franchise and our ability to grow earnings.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $382 million or $1.54 per share for the fourth quarter. The current quarter did not include any notable items, and as Dennis mentioned, EPS increased 5% year-over-year, excluding $0.20 of favorable items in the prior year quarter, primarily related to our reinsurance recapture. Under the same measure, full year EPS increased 5% to $6.04.
One other item to point to is specific to the fourth quarter. Alternative investment income was $18 million below our plan or $0.07 per share. Moving to the performance of key financial metrics, all of which normalized for notable items. Top line growth remained strong, with operating revenue up 6% for the quarter and for the full year, driven by positive net flows in every quarter of the year and product mix shift.
Continued focus on managing expenses created further margin expansion as the 4% growth in annual G&A, net of capitalized expenses, trailed revenue growth.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 6% to $52.38. Operating return on equity came in at 12% for the quarter and 12.2% for the full year. 
Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, with strong capital and liquidity metrics, which gives us significant financial flexibility. And finally, our year-end cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy, and we do not anticipate reserve deficiencies in any of our entities. And we completed our goodwill review and did not have any impairments.
Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items, the largest of which was a noneconomic charge of $43 million related to nonperformance risk, which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Hedge breakage was modest at just $13 million.
Before moving to segment results, I wanted to provide some perspective on the current market environment. First, on the recent equity market weakness, this obviously presents a headwind to earnings growth, and we have been very clear on the sensitivity, roughly $9 million for every 1% move in equity markets. 
Also, it is worth reminding you that we have a reversion to the mean approach within our DAC model, and as of year-end, it's provided a cushion against weak equity markets. 
Next, the interest rate environment. We know low interest rates remain topical, but it's important to recognize that we have effectively managed through persistently low rates and will continue to do so. 
Importantly, our product portfolio has been repriced over the past several years to reflect a low interest rate environment, and last quarter, we lowered our long-term earn rate, which leaves us very well positioned for this particular assumption. Bottom line, low rates remain just an earnings headwind, and the impact is consistent with the 2% to 3% we have noted in the past.
So despite the current capital markets environment, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS.
Now I will turn to segment results. And starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $243 million, a 3% increase over last year. 
Operating revenues increased 12% from the fourth quarter of 2014, as premiums benefited from an increase in fixed annuity deposits. Positive net flows in every quarter of 2015 resulted in average account balances reaching $124 billion, up 4%.
Return metrics remain strong and consistent with recent periods. For the full year, ROA increased 3 basis points, while ROE came in at 24%. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past 3 years and has averaged 20% for nearly a decade, outstanding results that highlight the returns that a high quality annuity book can deliver. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $33 million. Fourth quarter revenue growth was unchanged year-over-year, with annual revenue growth up 1%. Average account values ended the year at $54 billion, up 3% compared to 2014, driven by positive net flows.
Normalized spreads compressed 11 basis points for the year. This is at the low end of our guidance, and looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points. Return on assets was 25 basis points for the fourth quarter and 26 basis points for the full year. 
2015 was a good year for the retirement business, highlighted by record deposits, nearly $0.5 billion of net flows, and returns that fell within our targeted range.
While earnings will fight the headwinds of low interest rates and weak markets at the start of the year, we expect to see continued growth in net flows.
The Life Insurance segment reported fourth quarter earnings of $119 million compared to $140 million last year after normalizing items primarily related to the reinsurance recapture. 
Of the $18 million of below plan alternative investment income I noted up front, $12 million of it hit the life business. 
Mortality results were consistent with the third quarter, following elevated experience in the first half of 2015. But I would note, the mix of claims was a little different, so the financial impact was slightly worse than we would have hoped. An example of this would be a higher proportion of term claims that have less reserve offsets than a typical interest-sensitive claim.
Normalized spreads in the fourth quarter were down 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and down 6 basis points for the full year. Looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 5 to 10 basis points on an annual basis. Earnings drivers remain steady for the quarter and year, with average account balances up 3% to 4%, and life insurance in force up 3%.
Overall, this year's earnings were dragged down by elevated mortality, which overshadowed strong sales results. While we would -- while we continue to assume first quarter results will be negatively impacted by typical seasonality, we do not expect 2015's elevated mortality to persist in the coming year.
Group Protection earnings of $13 million compared to a loss of $7 million the prior year quarter. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 75.3% from 81% in the prior year quarter, driven by our life and disability product lines, which benefited from pricing actions and improvements in disability claims management.
For the full year, our loss ratio improved by 300 basis points, and we expect further progress in 2016. 
Our renewal pricing actions continue to have a favorable impact on margins, but they have negatively impacted persistency in sales. The result is that nonmedical earned premiums decreased 5% compared to the prior year quarter.
Our extensive repricing of policy renewals also has an impact on DAC amortization. With the first quarter our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period.
In the first quarter, we expect this acceleration of DAC to pressure earnings relative to the most recent run rate. 
So overall, another quarter that validates we are on a path to an earnings recovery, and we expect further improvement in our underwriting profitability in 2016.
As the sales momentum Dennis mentioned starts to build and emerges into premiums, we believe margins will continue to improve.
Let me discuss capital management and our capital position before we turn to Q&A. This quarter we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. For the full year, we repurchased $900 million of stock, which is a 38% increase from the prior year. When combined with a 25% increase in our dividend per share, total deployment to shareholders increased to $1.1 billion.
We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow, and as importantly, we have actually returned that cash to shareholders with share buybacks totaling $3.1 billion over the last 5 years, and dividends more than tripling over the same period.
Historically, I have pointed to 45% to 50% of operating earnings as a good proxy for free cash flow, or what is available for buybacks and dividends. 
Based on the shift in our product mix, notably the successful pivots within our life and annuity businesses, I'm increasing our outlook to 50% to 55%.  This positions us well to remain active returning capital to shareholders, and the recent weakness in the share price enables us to acquire stock below book value, an excellent use of capital. 
It is also worth noting, our revised free cash flow estimate does not include the reallocation of capital under the adverse DOL scenario Dennis spoke to earlier.
Quickly on capital and liquidity, where we are extremely well positioned with statutory surplus at $8.4 billion and an estimated RBC ratio of 490%. Holding company cash at $608 million is well above our target of $500 million, and we remain comfortable with our current leverage and capital structure, and would note, our next debt maturity is not until 2018.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

You have interest rate risk, and I talked about that not really being a balance sheet issue at this point in time; it's still just an earnings headwind issue, so we continue to manage that. So from a balance sheet standpoint, it becomes credit risk. We haven't been through a credit cycle in a while, and we may be entering or we may not be. Now as we enter this future period, I feel very comfortable with our overall position, very strong balance sheet, a balance sheet that arguably is in a position to handle any stress that comes its way. So we feel very comfortable with where we are, but I would agree with you that, overall, this is primarily a stress that will feature credit."

We're making progress overall with some things to do better.

I think reactions to ups and downs in the stock price in a short period of time is not the way we think about things. It's just over the long term where we're building value for our shareholders. With respect to MET, let me just make a couple of comments. One, Steve's a bright guy, and he's got a strong management team. And I'm sure whatever they end up doing is going to benefit shareholders. When I come back to their individual life business, and I think about it from a competitive perspective, us competing against them, if I understand, what they attempt to achieve by the split-up is to get the U.S. life business out from underneath the SIFI regulations. And what that would do, importantly for them, from a capital perspective, put them on the same footing as Lincoln and the rest of the industry. So from that perspective, they're just sort of getting back on a level playing field from a capital perspective, and we don't compete against companies on the basis of uneven capital regime, so if that's helpful to them, it doesn't bother us. And so, when I think about MET U.S. versus Lincoln, first of all, we have much more diversification in our business than what I understand they'll end up with. And from back to competition, we have such a strong distribution franchise, we have such a strong breadth of product portfolio, just comparatively, we sell twice as much life and annuity as MET does. So I think, they'll be a good competitor, they have a solid base in the United States, but the strength of Lincoln, the competition, the capability from a competitive stance, I think, our capabilities are strong and are going to continue to grow."

But I've personally been negotiating, at least discussing this with the executive committee of the NAIC. And so I think I have a pretty good handle on the direction that it's going. And so let me take -- make a couple of comments. The high-level objective of the review is to eliminate this statutory and GAAP reserve issue that has to do simply with market value versus book value accounting. And the regulators understand that there shouldn't be a regulation in place where you can't protect yourself against both potential challenges but you have to pick one or the other, okay? So what they're trying to do is eliminate this negative arbitrage between, sometimes it's called economics, sometimes it's called book value. But the intent is to try to find a way to eliminate that having to choose one versus the other. The proposal that has come out very definitely goes in that direction. So there's an attempt again to improve the regulation, all for the benefit of the regulators as well as the benefit of the companies. And so that's the direction it's moving. Oliver Wyman is about to start a study and sort of try to measure this problem from all the different companies' data. So that's substantively what's going on. Specifically with respect to captives, the need for captives, if this goes in the direction it seems to be going, is lessened. And the current thinking at the NAIC is that even though it's lessened, whatever captives are in place will be grandfathered. So I generally see this as moving in a very positive direction for the entire VA industry and the regulators. Having said that, there's a long way to go before we get to the final regulations."

Over the long term, as Dennis mentioned, we're very excited about the way the NAIC is moving. And so we'll see what our thoughts are if and when those rules get changed. But in the interim, no need or reason to do that. Let me expand and explain a little bit why I think that is. Every company has its own facts and circumstances, and I'm not going to speak to why or why not other companies would or would not recapture their captives. But Lincoln's facts and circumstances around this issue are the following. The way we have operated our captive over the years with a hedge program linked to the economics has left us in a very desirable position in that we have significant amount of hard assets, hard assets that exceed both the economic base liability, and at the end of the year, they exceeded them by $1.4 billion, and significantly exceed the statutory reserve credit required at the end of the year, they exceeded the statutory reserve credit by $900 million. So the way we've operated our captive in the past from a reserving standpoint, from a hedging standpoint, has left us in a very favorable position that -- a position that I don't believe all companies necessarily share. The second thing I would point out is that the way we have capitalized our VA business also contributes to that very favorable position. The way we capitalize our variable annuities guaranteed business is that we have a formula that has a greater of approach. It's the greater of CT 98 [ph] and a floor percentage of a comp value. Factually, for a while now, that floor has been a controlling item inside of the capital formula. But the CT 98 [ph] is a very high level, high threshold from a capital standpoint. Factually, if we were to take that CT 98 [ph] down to CT 95 [ph], which is where I hear some of my peer companies talk about the capitalization at, you would actually see $1 billion less of required capital against our VA business. So we're in a very good position. Recapturing our captive would have very little impact at all on the parent company, were we to do that. And that is directly linked to how we have operated this company in the past, both from a hedging standpoint and from a capitalization standpoint."

But I think, given the position you're in, I think it would be a real positive if you all would consider, in the interest of better transparency, recapturing the captive, particularly if it's that strong. I think, right now, I think there's, just generally speaking, those still using captives, there's confusion in terms of how do you compare it versus others and sort of what it might mean if it does move in the direction of where companies get pushed to move things to an opco. But anyway, so that's -- so I think, just from a perception, from a transparency standpoint, I think it would be a positive if you moved in that direction.

867423,319736908,927614,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience of Lincoln's franchise, as we had a solid finish in what proved to be a very volatile year for capital markets. Our EPS, excluding notable items, i",1822,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience of Lincoln's franchise, as we had a solid finish in what proved to be a very volatile year for capital markets. Our EPS, excluding notable items, increased 5% in the fourth quarter. Under the same measure for the full year, our EPS also increased 5%, which resulted in a ROE of just over 12%.
As we begin 2016, we recognize that there are a number of questions around the impact of weak capital markets on our businesses, and Randy will discuss this later.
However, it is important to note, we have positive momentum in key business drivers and our strategic initiatives are enabling us to execute on our growth, profitability and capital management initiatives. 
Some examples of these include consolidated net flows of $1.4 billion in the quarter, nearly double the prior year quarter, and up 9% for the full year. 
Individual Life Insurance sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, while total Life Insurance sales were up 8% in 2015. 
Our book value per share, excluding AOIC, is now over $52, a record and up 6% from the prior year. 
Balance sheet strength combined with solid capital generation enabled us to deploy another $250 million towards buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter, increasing our total capital return to shareholders in 2015 to $1.1 billion.
Now turning to our business lines, starting with individual life. 
As I noted up front, individual Life Insurance sales were very strong this quarter, up 11%, while total Life Insurance sales of $725 million in 2015 were up more than 8%. 
It is worth spending a few minutes digging into some product stories, as sales for many of our products increased double digits in the fourth quarter.
MoneyGuard sales increased 15% as we continue to benefit from market acceptance of our MoneyGuard II product, and traction in recently approved states grows. For the full year, MoneyGuard had record sales. 
Indexed Universal Life sales increased 13%, as we were helped by a new product launch and regulation that began in September that required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates. This resulted in an improvement in our competitive position. 
Finally, Term, up 19%, and VUL, up 12%, also benefited from product enhancements. 
As a reminder, our focus on sales is not just to grow but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. In the fourth quarter, we once again achieved these objectives, with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15%, and no single product represented more than 30% of our total production. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees.
Our outlook for our Life Insurance business remains positive, as our diversified product portfolio, combined with the depth and breadth of our distribution, distinguishes Lincoln in the marketplace.
Turning to Group Protection. We're pleased with the continued progress we are making with our repricing efforts and the improvement of our claims management effectiveness. 
Earnings once again increased from depressed results in the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter sales of $223 million were down 11% from the same period last year, and full year sales were down 16%. With our pricing actions on the poor-performing employer-paid block largely behind us, our renewal actions have moderated, but we continue to build additional margin into our book of business. 
As our pricing actions have stabilized, the degree of market disruption has been reduced, and we see the pace of sales activity improving. 
For example, our disability sales decreased just 9% in the quarter, after being down 30% through the first 9 months of 2015.
We expect continued improvement in sales activity and growth to reemerge during 2016 after 2 straight years of declining sales. This will be important as we look to drive future margin improvement by growing premiums and sustaining our pricing discipline.
Turning to annuities, our annuity business remains a high quality source of earnings as we posted strong operating results and minimal hedge breakage in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $3 billion, and we continue to consistently generate positive organic growth with $435 million of net flows in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year.
As I noticed last quarter -- noted last quarter, market volatility dampened demand for most equity-sensitive products, including variable annuities, and it was hard to tell if the Department of Labor proposal was also having an impact on industry sales.
Given continued investor interest on the DOL combined with an obvious overhang on our stock, we wanted to give you more specifics of how we are internally approaching the DOL proposal. First, it is important to note that there are a number of possible outcomes which we are planning for, including some I have mentioned in the past that would be less onerous on VAs than the original proposal. This morning, I will specifically focus on the scenario where no changes are made to the current proposal, as that is the situation we get asked about most frequently. While this is the most adverse scenario, it is manageable for Lincoln. 
So I would note a few things.
One, in the fourth quarter, we had nearly a $0.5 billion of positive net flows, only 30% of our sales came from products that would be impacted by the DOL proposal, namely variable annuities within qualified plans. This compares to nearly 60% for the top 10 VA writers. 
Point 2, it's also important to note, the DOL proposal does not impact the nonqualified market where our patented i4LIFE has long been known as the income product of choice and has resulted in Lincoln being the market leader in nonqualified VA sales.
Point 3, a few years back, we decided to focus on diversifying our mix of annuity sales, tilting away from VAs with living benefits and lowering our risk profile without having a meaningful impact on returns. As part of this pivot, our sales of products that are not impacted by the DOL proposal has increased to 70% of total sales, up from 50% pre-pivot. Importantly, given our focus and momentum on diversification, we would expect this percentage to continue to increase, further reducing our dependence on sales impacted by the DOL proposal. 
My next point, sales of VA and qualified plans will not entirely go away, as the current proposal allows for products to be sold on a commissionable basis and many distributors will continue to offer the important guarantees that VAs provide. In addition, we would expect to see accelerated growth in our fee-based VA product, as we have been approached by many of our largest distribution partners about the fee-based opportunity. We're also increasing our focus on fixed and indexed annuities, which still have the PTE 8424 exemption. 
Finally, recall we have said that if there is a sales disruption, we would be able to reallocate capital to share buybacks to block much of the EPS impact over the next several years as we pivot to the extent required, a skill and capability we have successfully demonstrated in the past. 
So I believe companies like Lincoln with market-leader positions and at scale that have a broad portfolio of products along with leading distribution will continue to succeed.
Let me turn to retirement plan services. In retirement plan services, earnings and net flows were consistent with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.1 billion were down 10%, however, excluding 1 large case from the prior year, deposits increased nearly 40%. 
Full year results were a very good story, with record total deposits of $7.5 billion, supported by strength in both small and mid to large markets. 
Notably, small market deposits were up 18% to a record $2.1 billion, and mid to large markets won 2x as many plans as compared to the prior year.
Total outflows for the quarter were negative $220 million and included a large case termination we referenced on our third quarter call. Full year net flows increased to $452 million compared to outflows of $881 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by our strong deposits and improvement in our retention rate as we benefit from our strategic investments.
Looking ahead to 2016, we would not be surprised to see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows. However, we expect our net flows will exceed 2015 levels. This confidence is driven by our strategy, which aligns the fastest-growing markets with the customers that value our high-touch service model. This combination enables us to better defend profitability and achieve our targeted returns. Bottom line, we remain optimistic in the growth outlook for our retirement business.
Lastly on investment management, we put new money to work in the fourth quarter at an average yield of 4.3%, which was consistent with recent quarters and 210 basis points over the average 10-year Treasury. 
Following strong results in our alternatives portfolio in the third quarter, alternatives did not contribute to earnings this quarter, which makes our EPS growth even more impressive. Over the last 4 years, our alternatives portfolio has returned more than 10% annually, a level we target over the long run. 
Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography and issuers. We ended the year with a net unrealized gain of approximately $3 billion and our below investment grade exposure is just 5.1% of invested assets, a slight improvement from the prior year.
With the recent volatility and weakness in the energy markets, I want to update you on our exposure. First, it is worth noting that we stopped investing in the energy sector a year ago. And since the end of 2014, we have reduced our fixed income energy exposure by nearly $1 billion. 
This included approximately $400 million in maturities and roughly $600 million of asset sales based on an assessment of our exposures with our external asset managers. Importantly, these sales produced fewer losses than what was in our capital plan. At year-end, the market value of our $8.6 billion energy portfolio was 95% of book value. Our high-yield energy exposure was about $600 million, up modestly from the prior year due to ratings migration, and represented just 7.5% of our energy exposure. We continue to proactively monitor and manage our energy exposure.
So in closing, I'm very pleased we were able to grow EPS mid-single digits in 2015, despite equity market declines, persistently low interest rates and mortality fluctuations. We showed great progress on several strategic initiatives, including restoring profitability in Group Protection, growth in RPS highlighted by significant improvement in net flows, continued momentum in our annuity pivot, which positions us well for the DOL, and strong life new business returns. Bottom line, we remain confident in our franchise and our ability to grow earnings.
With that, let me turn the call over to Randy."

Under the same measure, full year EPS increased 5% to $6.04.
One other item to point to is specific to the fourth quarter. Alternative investment income was $18 million below our plan or $0.07 per share. Moving to the performance of key financial metrics, all of which normalized for notable items. Top line growth remained strong, with operating revenue up 6% for the quarter and for the full year, driven by positive net flows in every quarter of the year and product mix shift.
Continued focus on managing expenses created further margin expansion as the 4% growth in annual G&A, net of capitalized expenses, trailed revenue growth.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 6% to $52.38. Operating return on equity came in at 12% for the quarter and 12.2% for the full year. 
Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, with strong capital and liquidity metrics, which gives us significant financial flexibility.

And we completed our goodwill review and did not have any impairments.
Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items, the largest of which was a noneconomic charge of $43 million related to nonperformance risk, which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Hedge breakage was modest at just $13 million.
Before moving to segment results, I wanted to provide some perspective on the current market environment. First, on the recent equity market weakness, this obviously presents a headwind to earnings growth, and we have been very clear on the sensitivity, roughly $9 million for every 1% move in equity markets. 
Also, it is worth reminding you that we have a reversion to the mean approach within our DAC model, and as of year-end, it's provided a cushion against weak equity markets. 
Next, the interest rate environment. We know low interest rates remain topical, but it's important to recognize that we have effectively managed through persistently low rates and will continue to do so. 
Importantly, our product portfolio has been repriced over the past several years to reflect a low interest rate environment, and last quarter, we lowered our long-term earn rate, which leaves us very well positioned for this particular assumption. Bottom line, low rates remain just an earnings headwind, and the impact is consistent with the 2% to 3% we have noted in the past.
So despite the current capital markets environment, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS.
Now I will turn to segment results. And starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $243 million, a 3% increase over last year. 
Operating revenues increased 12% from the fourth quarter of 2014, as premiums benefited from an increase in fixed annuity deposits. Positive net flows in every quarter of 2015 resulted in average account balances reaching $124 billion, up 4%.
Return metrics remain strong and consistent with recent periods. For the full year, ROA increased 3 basis points, while ROE came in at 24%. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past 3 years and has averaged 20% for nearly a decade, outstanding results that highlight the returns that a high quality annuity book can deliver. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $33 million. Fourth quarter revenue growth was unchanged year-over-year, with annual revenue growth up 1%. Average account values ended the year at $54 billion, up 3% compared to 2014, driven by positive net flows.
Normalized spreads compressed 11 basis points for the year. This is at the low end of our guidance, and looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points. Return on assets was 25 basis points for the fourth quarter and 26 basis points for the full year. 
2015 was a good year for the retirement business, highlighted by record deposits, nearly $0.5 billion of net flows, and returns that fell within our targeted range.
While earnings will fight the headwinds of low interest rates and weak markets at the start of the year, we expect to see continued growth in net flows.
The Life Insurance segment reported fourth quarter earnings of $119 million compared to $140 million last year after normalizing items primarily related to the reinsurance recapture. 
Of the $18 million of below plan alternative investment income I noted up front, $12 million of it hit the life business. 
Mortality results were consistent with the third quarter, following elevated experience in the first half of 2015. But I would note, the mix of claims was a little different, so the financial impact was slightly worse than we would have hoped. An example of this would be a higher proportion of term claims that have less reserve offsets than a typical interest-sensitive claim.
Normalized spreads in the fourth quarter were down 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and down 6 basis points for the full year. Looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 5 to 10 basis points on an annual basis. Earnings drivers remain steady for the quarter and year, with average account balances up 3% to 4%, and life insurance in force up 3%.
Overall, this year's earnings were dragged down by elevated mortality, which overshadowed strong sales results. While we would -- while we continue to assume first quarter results will be negatively impacted by typical seasonality, we do not expect 2015's elevated mortality to persist in the coming year.
Group Protection earnings of $13 million compared to a loss of $7 million the prior year quarter. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 75.3% from 81% in the prior year quarter, driven by our life and disability product lines, which benefited from pricing actions and improvements in disability claims management.
For the full year, our loss ratio improved by 300 basis points, and we expect further progress in 2016. 
Our renewal pricing actions continue to have a favorable impact on margins, but they have negatively impacted persistency in sales. The result is that nonmedical earned premiums decreased 5% compared to the prior year quarter.
Our extensive repricing of policy renewals also has an impact on DAC amortization. With the first quarter our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period.
In the first quarter, we expect this acceleration of DAC to pressure earnings relative to the most recent run rate. 
So overall, another quarter that validates we are on a path to an earnings recovery, and we expect further improvement in our underwriting profitability in 2016.
As the sales momentum Dennis mentioned starts to build and emerges into premiums, we believe margins will continue to improve.
Let me discuss capital management and our capital position before we turn to Q&A. This quarter we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. For the full year, we repurchased $900 million of stock, which is a 38% increase from the prior year. When combined with a 25% increase in our dividend per share, total deployment to shareholders increased to $1.1 billion.
We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow, and as importantly, we have actually returned that cash to shareholders with share buybacks totaling $3.1 billion over the last 5 years, and dividends more than tripling over the same period.
Historically, I have pointed to 45% to 50% of operating earnings as a good proxy for free cash flow, or what is available for buybacks and dividends. 
Based on the shift in our product mix, notably the successful pivots within our life and annuity businesses, I'm increasing our outlook to 50% to 55%. This positions us well to remain active returning capital to shareholders, and the recent weakness in the share price enables us to acquire stock below book value, an excellent use of capital. 
It is also worth noting, our revised free cash flow estimate does not include the reallocation of capital under the adverse DOL scenario Dennis spoke to earlier.
Quickly on capital and liquidity, where we are extremely well positioned with statutory surplus at $8.4 billion and an estimated RBC ratio of 490%. Holding company cash at $608 million is well above our target of $500 million, and we remain comfortable with our current leverage and capital structure, and would note, our next debt maturity is not until 2018.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

So from a balance sheet standpoint, it becomes credit risk. We haven't been through a credit cycle in a while, and we may be entering or we may not be. Now as we enter this future period, I feel very comfortable with our overall position, very strong balance sheet, a balance sheet that arguably is in a position to handle any stress that comes its way.

With respect to MET, let me just make a couple of comments. One, Steve's a bright guy, and he's got a strong management team. And I'm sure whatever they end up doing is going to benefit shareholders. When I come back to their individual life business, and I think about it from a competitive perspective, us competing against them, if I understand, what they attempt to achieve by the split-up is to get the U.S. life business out from underneath the SIFI regulations. And what that would do, importantly for them, from a capital perspective, put them on the same footing as Lincoln and the rest of the industry. So from that perspective, they're just sort of getting back on a level playing field from a capital perspective, and we don't compete against companies on the basis of uneven capital regime, so if that's helpful to them, it doesn't bother us. And so, when I think about MET U.S. versus Lincoln, first of all, we have much more diversification in our business than what I understand they'll end up with. And from back to competition, we have such a strong distribution franchise, we have such a strong breadth of product portfolio, just comparatively, we sell twice as much life and annuity as MET does. So I think, they'll be a good competitor, they have a solid base in the United States, but the strength of Lincoln, the competition, the capability from a competitive stance, I think, our capabilities are strong and are going to continue to grow."

But I've personally been negotiating, at least discussing this with the executive committee of the NAIC. And so I think I have a pretty good handle on the direction that it's going. And so let me take -- make a couple of comments. The high-level objective of the review is to eliminate this statutory and GAAP reserve issue that has to do simply with market value versus book value accounting. And the regulators understand that there shouldn't be a regulation in place where you can't protect yourself against both potential challenges but you have to pick one or the other, okay? So what they're trying to do is eliminate this negative arbitrage between, sometimes it's called economics, sometimes it's called book value. But the intent is to try to find a way to eliminate that having to choose one versus the other. The proposal that has come out very definitely goes in that direction. So there's an attempt again to improve the regulation, all for the benefit of the regulators as well as the benefit of the companies. And so that's the direction it's moving. Oliver Wyman is about to start a study and sort of try to measure this problem from all the different companies' data. So that's substantively what's going on. Specifically with respect to captives, the need for captives, if this goes in the direction it seems to be going, is lessened. And the current thinking at the NAIC is that even though it's lessened, whatever captives are in place will be grandfathered. So I generally see this as moving in a very positive direction for the entire VA industry and the regulators. Having said that, there's a long way to go before we get to the final regulations."

Over the long term, as Dennis mentioned, we're very excited about the way the NAIC is moving. And so we'll see what our thoughts are if and when those rules get changed. But in the interim, no need or reason to do that. Let me expand and explain a little bit why I think that is. Every company has its own facts and circumstances, and I'm not going to speak to why or why not other companies would or would not recapture their captives. But Lincoln's facts and circumstances around this issue are the following. The way we have operated our captive over the years with a hedge program linked to the economics has left us in a very desirable position in that we have significant amount of hard assets, hard assets that exceed both the economic base liability, and at the end of the year, they exceeded them by $1.4 billion, and significantly exceed the statutory reserve credit required at the end of the year, they exceeded the statutory reserve credit by $900 million. So the way we've operated our captive in the past from a reserving standpoint, from a hedging standpoint, has left us in a very favorable position that -- a position that I don't believe all companies necessarily share. The second thing I would point out is that the way we have capitalized our VA business also contributes to that very favorable position. The way we capitalize our variable annuities guaranteed business is that we have a formula that has a greater of approach. It's the greater of CT 98 [ph] and a floor percentage of a comp value. Factually, for a while now, that floor has been a controlling item inside of the capital formula. But the CT 98 [ph] is a very high level, high threshold from a capital standpoint. Factually, if we were to take that CT 98 [ph] down to CT 95 [ph], which is where I hear some of my peer companies talk about the capitalization at, you would actually see $1 billion less of required capital against our VA business. So we're in a very good position. Recapturing our captive would have very little impact at all on the parent company, were we to do that. And that is directly linked to how we have operated this company in the past, both from a hedging standpoint and from a capitalization standpoint."

But I think, given the position you're in, I think it would be a real positive if you all would consider, in the interest of better transparency, recapturing the captive, particularly if it's that strong. I think, right now, I think there's, just generally speaking, those still using captives, there's confusion in terms of how do you compare it versus others and sort of what it might mean if it does move in the direction of where companies get pushed to move things to an opco. But anyway, so that's -- so I think, just from a perception, from a transparency standpoint, I think it would be a positive if you moved in that direction. Anyway, I just wanted to make that comment."

First quarter results were disappointing as operating earnings fell short of our expectations. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our earnings appear to be temporary, and we anticipate a nice recovery in the second quarter. Randy will describe this in more detail. 
While earnings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong and resilient as we continue to grow book value per share and actively deploy capital. Our franchise also remains a competitive advantage. Product breadth and innovation, coupled with our distribution reach, gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities while also delivering on our strategic priorities, including shifting our new business mix towards products without long-term guarantees. This quarter, some of examples of this included: sales of life products without guarantees increased 13%; group sales grew 5% marking our first year-over-year increase since 2013; RPS deposits of $1.8 billion increased 5%; and nearly 50% of our annuity sales did not have guaranteed living benefits. 
Before turning to business line results, let me provide a high-level view of how the final DOL rule seems to impact Lincoln's business model. In general, as we anticipated, the final rules mostly moved in a constructive direction. On the positive side, the rule clearly documents the use of commissions alongside fees as appropriate compensation. Specifically, the DOL agreed in the final rule that commissions can be more cost-effective for investors who do not trade frequently as would be the case with annuity purchasers. In its discussion of annuities, the DOL also emphasized that the FIC exemption is designed preserve of commissions, allowing investors to choose the payment structure that works best for them. The inclusion of grandfathering address the concern of a major disruption related to a backward application of the new rules. The rule acknowledges the benefit of lifetime income guarantees, which significantly differentiates annuities from other financial products. The expansion of the education definition leaves our high-touch retirement business value proposition intact. 
Somewhat negative but generally not expected to seriously impact Lincoln would be: the inclusion of index annuities in the BIC will take some extra work in the independent channels where the compliance ecosystem is not as comprehensive as it is for registry products sold through broker-dealers. In the first quarter, only 3% of our total annuity sales are BIC index annuities sold through nonregistered insurance agents in the qualified space. Adding the Group Variable Annuity to the BIC may have eliminated a competitive advantage under the proposed rule, but we believe it leaves us in a competitively neutral position. 
Our distribution partner response so far is generally consistent in the expectation that they will use the BIC for commissions. It also may prove out that distribution partners will need to trim shelf space and focus on fewer higher-quality companies, which I believe would be an advantage to Lincoln over the long term. Our efforts are now turning to working with the DOL, our distribution partners and internally to be sure that an effective compliance system is developed to reduce the right of action risk that remains part of the rule. 
Now turning to our business segments starting with annuities. A 4% decrease in average account values and lower variable investment income resulted in annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, strong recovery in equity markets later in the quarter led to account balances ending the quarter flat with year-end, which positions us well for subsequent periods. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion, and net outflows were modest at just $35 million. Over the past year, net flows have added $1.3 billion to account balances. As I have noted in the past couple of quarters, market volatility has dampened consumer demand for equity-sensitive products, and there appears to be some regulatory impact as well. Higher persistency has helped net flows. Although sales are lower than last year as we said we would, we used some of the capital that was to be allocated towards annuity sales to buy back stock at attractive levels. So while we have experienced lower sales recently, longer term, our consistent approach and commitment to the annuity business positions us well to grow this high-quality source of earnings as marketplace headwinds subside. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We recognize there will be a focus on mortality experience in this quarter. While we typically expect higher claims in the first quarter, we also saw an unusual number of early duration claims. In terms of sales, total individual Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $132 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year quarter. Importantly, our focus on selling more products without long-term guarantees continues to gain traction. As I noted upfront, sales of these products increased 13% and represented 71% of our total Life Insurance sales, up from 62% of our sales last year. Included in these are many exciting product stories. For example, term sales increased to 32% as we continue to benefit for product enhancements made in the third quarter. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 20% as we were helped by our midyear product launch. Additionally, regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. 
MoneyGuard sales increased 5%, which is impressive coming off record annual sales in 2015. We continue to remain opportunistic with respect to executive benefit sales, which contributed $7 million to total life sales. Looking forward, our pipeline remains very strong, and given our product breadth and strength of our distribution, we remain optimistic about our new business opportunities. 
Turning to Group Protection. We're pleased with the year-over-year earnings increase, driven by the significant improvement in our nonmedical loss ratio, which continues to benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management processes. First quarter sales of $59 million increased 5% from the same period last year, which marked our first year-over-year sales increase since 2013. As our pricing actions have stabilized, the degree of market disruption has been reduced. As a result, we expect improvement in sales activity and growth to persist. As I noted last quarter, this would be important as we look to drive future margin improvement by growing premiums while sustaining pricing discipline. 
In retirement plan services, earnings, deposits and net flows were generally consistent with our outlook. First quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were up 5% from a year ago. Recurring deposits increased 6% and benefited from both employee and employer contributions. First year sales grew by 3%, and notably, our pipeline continues to be very strong, which should benefit sales in the second half of the year. Our focus on specific markets and our differentiated customer experience is working and help drive positive net flows for the retirement business, which marked the fourth time this has occurred in the past 5 quarters. Over this period, flows have added more than $0.5 billion to RPS account balances. While we continue to anticipate lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows, we expect annual net flows to exceed 2015 levels. Confidence in our growth momentum is driven by our alignment with the fastest-growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace with a high-touch service model. 
Spending a minute on investment management. We put money to work on the first quarter at an average yield of 4%, which was down 30 basis points from the fourth quarter. The decrease in new money rates was due to a drop in Treasury rates as we invested 210 basis points over the average 10-year Treasury in both periods. Our alternative investments generated an $8 million loss in the quarter. Headwinds from our hedge fund portfolio, which represents 1/3 of our alternatives carrying value and the impact of lower energy prices on our private equity investments were the primary drivers of this result. Over the last 4 years, our alternatives portfolio, which is now $1.2 billion of assets has averaged a 10% annual return, a level we expect to achieve over the long run. 
Let me also update you on our fixed income energy portfolio where we continue to proactively monitor and manage our credit exposure. Following nearly a $1 billion decrease in energy holdings in 2015, we trend almost $500 million in the first quarter and another $250 million in the second quarter. In total, this represents a 17% reduction in energy holdings over this period. Our sales targeted securities most likely to be at risk of credit loss in a sustained periods of low energy prices. In the quarter, we did experience some negative ratings migration from the energy sector, however, the RBC impact was manageable and downgrades have slowed. The increase in oil prices have helped reduce our energy net unrealized loss, which was $375 million at quarter-end, an improvement of $100 million from year-end. Bottom line, we feel comfortable with our energy exposure and the overall quality of our investment portfolio. 
Turning to distribution. The depth and breadth of our retail, wholesale and worksite teams continue to differentiate Lincoln. The strength of our distribution course has enabled the shift in sales mix to a point that now 75% of enterprise sales do not have long-term guarantees, up 65% -- up from 65% a year ago. While we continue to have success shifting sales to products about long-term guarantees, as I noted in the business sections, sales of our individual products were lower. This reflected the impact of market volatility on consumer demand, which keeps money on the sidelines, combined with some impact from regulatory uncertainty. That said, you have heard me say many times, distribution is a competitive advantage for Lincoln, and I expect Lincoln to once again differentiate itself as market headwinds subside and distributors adapt to regulatory changes. 
In closing, I'm looking beyond the first quarter as I anticipate items that impacted the quarter to abate or reverse, and I expect our earnings to return to levels you have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. Our strong franchise, balance sheet and capital position creates a lot of flexibility and opportunity. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

As Dennis mentioned, there were several items that negatively impacted our results this quarter. While",1362,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $314 million or $1.25 per share for the first quarter, $0.10 below the prior year. As Dennis mentioned, there were several items that negatively impacted our results this quarter. While we do consider these items to be part of normal volatility, at this time, we do not expect them to reoccur in the second quarter. 
First, group results were negatively impacted by accelerated amortization of DAC, which were around $18 million or $0.07 a share of our typical quarterly run rate. I will provide more detail on this later, but we fully expect amortization to moderate. Next, alternatives were below our expected results by $25 million, which negatively impacted the quarter by $0.10. While it is too early to comment on our expectations for the second quarter, the recent recovery in the broader equity and energy markets are likely to have a positive impact. The equity market recovery should also boost our fee-based earnings. First quarter results were impacted by decline in average account balances, but by the end of the quarter, account balances were largely unchanged from year-end. As a result, this should add roughly $0.05 to our quarterly run rate. Lastly, consistent with first quarter result the past few years, we experienced elevated mortality, which negatively impacted individual life earnings by $30 million or $0.12. We estimate that roughly 2/3 of this was the seasonally high mortality that we typically see in the first quarter. I will comment more in mortality in that life section of my comments. 
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased less than 1% in the quarter as another quarter of positive net flows was offset by decline in equity markets, resulting in a 2% decrease in average account values. G&A, net of capital expenses, decreased slightly and notably trailed revenue growth. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew more than 7% to $53.25, an all-time high. Finally, our balance sheet remains an important source of strength even with interest rates at or below levels we saw during the first quarter. This gives a significant financial flexibility, which we once again exhibited this quarter with $260 million of capital deployed to shareholders. Net income results for the quarter included an invested-related legal settlement, $27 million of variable annuity net derivative losses and a similar amount of general account investment losses. 
Now we'll turn to segment results and starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $218 million, a decline in average account values and lower variable investment income, which includes income from alternative investments and prepayments were drivers of the 9% year-over-year decrease in earnings. Operating revenues declined 2% from the first quarter over 2015 after excluding an increase in fixed income annuities deposits. Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled $1.3 billion. This 1% organic growth rate was more than offset by headwinds from equity markets. Return metrics remain strong as ROE came in at 20%, consistent with our average return over the last decade. ROA decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year and stands at 74 basis points. Given the equity market recovery, we expect annuity earnings and returns to see a nice boost in subsequent quarters. 
In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $31 million, down from $35 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in variable investment income. First quarter revenue decreased 2% year-over-year consistent with the change in average account balances as positive net flows of $415 million over the trailing 12 months were offset by unfavorable equity markets. Although average account values declined, end-of-period balances totaled more than $54 billion, in line with the prior quarter and prior year. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 3 basis points versus the prior quarter, better than our expectation for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points annually in the retirement business.  Our return on assets was 23 basis points for the first quarter. However, more normal variable investment income will produce an ROA at the low end of the 25 to 30 basis point range we have discussed in the past. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $75 million were down as a result of unfavorable mortality and $17 million of lower alternative investment income. This quarter, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million, and again, roughly 2/3 of this reflects typical seasonality. Included in this quarter's mortality result were an unusual number of early duration claims, which represented approximately $8 million and explains why our mortality experience exceeded normal seasonality. To provide some context, during the first quarter, we had claims on 16 large policies that were underwritten within the past 2 years versus a quarterly average of 3 policies over the past couple of years. 
Turning quickly to the life earnings drivers. Average account values were up 3% with average enforced face amount of 4%, both consistent with recent performance. Normalized spreads decreased 11 basis points, just above the top end of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. So the first quarter once again experienced typical seasonality. However, consistent with prior years, we do expect mortality to improve over the course of the year. 
Group Protection earnings of $5 million compared to a loss of $6 million in the prior year quarter with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. Importantly, we saw significant improvement in our nonmedical loss ratio, which came in at just under 70%, our best ratio since the fourth quarter of 2009 and an 850 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. This quarter's loss ratio clearly benefited from strong experienced across all of our businesses. Notably, life and disability continue to benefit from our pricing actions while the latter saw further improvement in claims management.
These positive earnings drivers were offset by a couple negative impacts from lower persistency owing to our extensive repricing of policy renewals. Notably, nonmedical earned premiums declined 9%, and we experienced accelerated amortization of DAC. As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $18 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate. As the first quarter is our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period but decreases in subsequent quarters. In fact, this is exactly what we saw last year as well, which gives us confidence that group's earnings power will continue to improve. 
Let me discuss liquidity, our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. Holding company cash ended the quarter at $539 million, above our target of $500 million. Statutory surplus end at $8.4 billion, and we estimate our RBC ratio to be approximately 480%, slightly below year-end despite active capital management and a roughly 10 point negative impact from ratings migration. Additionally, I would note that we executed on a reinsurance transaction in early April, which generated approximately $400 million of capital. This capital provides a buffer for uncertain macroenvironments while also giving us incremental capital to deploy. This quarter, we repurchased 200 million of Lincoln shares as we took advantage of our strong capital position, the decline in our share price and capital that was freed up owing to lower annuity sales. While I remain very comfortable of our long-term free cash flow outlook of 50% to 55% of operating earnings being available for buybacks and dividends, I do see upside to this number this year given the strength of our capital position. As we've noted in the past, returning capital to shareholders remains a priority for Lincoln. As a result, we expect to go to the board in a few weeks to ask for increase in our share repurchase authorization, consistent with past practices. 
So wrapping things up. Earnings were shorter of our expectations, but we see clear signs that our earnings power will recover in the very near term. As Dennis noted, our strong franchise gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, while the strength of our balance sheet and capital generation capabilities allows us to continue actively deploying capital. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

If you think about what's going on in the business then over the subsequent 5 years, what I would say is that the combined impact of spread compression, that's a real economic item and the sector that we have done a significant number of reserve transactions, reserve financings over the course of the year, has pulled roughly $35 million to $40 million out of that number. So you start at $135 million, you come down that $35 million to $40 million. To that, we've added back, I would estimate, roughly $30 million, $35 million a quarter from the new business that we sold over that point in time. When all said and done, what that leaves you, what would save the day, is roughly $125 million in that range a quarter. So we're $140 million. We pulled a significant amount of money out of the business due to the reserve financings. There has been some impact from spread compression, but we've added back a significant amount from new business. So that's why I see today, Jimmy."

What I would say about the $400 million of capital that we generated through reinsurance transaction, it's related to our New York book of business. If you remember it was about 4 years ago, the industry entered into an agreement with the SEM reserving for secondary guarantee. Well, at that time, 49 states signed up to that. New York, unfortunately, decided to go a different way and didn't adopt the agreed-upon approach. That created a significant amount of noneconomic reserves. If you remember for us, we have been putting up $90 million of additional reserves a year over 5-year period. We're in the fourth year of that for total of $450 million of additional reserves. When that happened, we set about -- immediately trying to figure out a way and figure would be a way to manage in a more effective way those additional reserves we're reporting up. You're working in New York, so you have to be a little bit more restrictive in terms of what you can do. For instance, the captive-related transactions is going to be much more difficult. So it took a little more time, but we were eventually able to enter into a more traditional recent transactions, and that's what generated the $400 million relief I talked about. We figured we'd get that done exactly when the timing was going to be, Jimmy, was uncertain, but we did complete it here early in the second quarter. In terms of how does it impact or did it impact my expectation, I just go back to what I said in the script. Over the long term, we expect 50%, 55% is well within our wheelhouse. But then this year, given the strong capital position, given the fact that we continue to generate strong amounts of capital continue -- given the fact that than annuity sales were down a little bit, given the fact that we did this reinsurance transaction, we fully expect to exceed that long-term guidance this year."

And so, I mean, back to the contract language, what's in the best interest based on the product that's being sold, what's in the best interest of the client. And on long-term contracts, upfront compensation may very well be the answer as to what the best interest is.

First quarter results were disappointing, as operating earnings fell short of our expectations. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our earnings appear to be temporary, and we anticipate a nice recovery in the second quarter. Randy will describe this in more detail. 
While earnings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong and resilient as we continue to grow book value per share and actively deploy capital. Our franchise also remains a competitive advantage. Product breadth and innovation, coupled with our distribution reach, gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities while also delivering on our strategic priorities, including shifting our new business mix towards products without long-term guarantees.
This quarter, some examples of this included: sales of life products without guarantees increased 13%; group sales grew 5%, marking our first year-over-year increase since 2013; RPS deposits of $1.8 billion increased 5%; and nearly 50% of our annuity sales did not have guaranteed living benefits. 
Before turning to business line results, let me provide a high-level view of how the final DOL rule seems to impact Lincoln's business model. In general, as we anticipated, the final rules mostly moved in a constructive direction. On the positive side, the rule clearly documents the use of commissions alongside fees as appropriate compensation. Specifically, the DOL agreed in the final rule that commissions can be more cost-effective for investors who do not trade frequently as would be the case with annuity purchasers
In its discussion of annuities, the DOL also emphasized that the BIC exemption is designed preserve commissions, allowing investors to choose the payment structure that works best for them. The inclusion of grandfathering address the concern of a major disruption related to a backward application of the new rules. The rule acknowledges the benefit of lifetime income guarantees, which significantly differentiates annuities from other financial products. The expansion of the education definition leaves our high-touch retirement business value proposition intact. 
Somewhat negative, but generally not expected to seriously impact Lincoln would be the inclusion of indexed annuities in the BIC will take some extra work in the independent channels where the compliance ecosystem is not as comprehensive as it is for registered products sold through broker-dealers. In the first quarter, only 3% of our total annuity sales are fixed indexed annuities sold through nonregistered insurance agents in the qualified space. Adding the Group Variable Annuity to the BIC may have eliminated a competitive advantage under the proposed rule, but we believe it leaves us in a competitively neutral position. 
Our distribution partner response so far is generally consistent in the expectation that they will use the BIC for commissions. It also may prove out that distribution partners will need to trim shelf space and focus on fewer higher-quality companies, which I believe would be an advantage to Lincoln over the long term. Our efforts are now turning to working with the DOL, our distribution partners and internally to be sure that an effective compliance system is developed to reduce the right of action risk that remains part of the rule. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. A 4% decrease in average account values and lower variable investment income resulted in annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, strong recovery in equity markets later in the quarter led to account balances ending the quarter flat with year-end, which positions us well for subsequent periods. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion, and net outflows were modest at just $35 million. Over the past year, net flows have added $1.3 billion to account balances. As I have noted in the past couple of quarters, market volatility has dampened consumer demand for equity-sensitive products, and there appears to be some regulatory impact as well. Higher persistency has helped net flows. Although sales are lower than last year, as we said we would, we used some of the capital that was to be allocated towards annuity sales to buy back stock at attractive levels. So while we have experienced lower sales recently, longer term, our consistent approach and commitment to the annuity business positions us well to grow this high-quality source of earnings as marketplace headwinds subside. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We recognize there will be a focus on our mortality experience in this quarter. While we typically expect higher claims in the first quarter, we also saw an unusual number of early duration claims. In terms of sales, total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $132 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year quarter. Importantly, our focus on selling more products without long-term guarantees continues to gain traction. As I noted upfront, sales of these products increased 13% and represented 71% of our total Life Insurance sales, up from 62% of our sales last year.
Included in these are many exciting product stories. For example, term sales increased to 32% as we continue to benefit for product enhancements made in the third quarter. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 20% as we were helped by our midyear product launch. Additionally, regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. 
MoneyGuard sales increased 5%, which is impressive coming off record annual sales in 2015. We continue to remain opportunistic with respect to executive benefit sales, which contributed $7 million to total life sales. Looking forward, our pipeline remains very strong, and given our product breadth and strength of our distribution, we remain optimistic about our new business opportunities. 
Turning to Group Protection. We are pleased with the year-over-year earnings increase, driven by the significant improvement in our nonmedical loss ratio, which continues to benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management processes. First quarter sales of $59 million increased 5% from the same period last year, which marked our first year-over-year sales increase since 2013. As our pricing actions have stabilized, the degree of market disruption has been reduced. As a result, we expect improvement in sales activity and growth to persist. As I noted last quarter, this would be important as we look to drive future margin improvement by growing premiums while sustaining pricing discipline. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings, deposits and net flows were generally consistent with our outlook. First quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were up 5% from a year ago. Recurring deposits increased 6% and benefited from both employee and employer contributions. First year sales grew by 3%; and notably, our pipeline continues to be very strong which should benefit sales in the second half of the year. Our focus on specific markets and our differentiated customer experience is working and help drive positive net flows for the retirement business, which marked the fourth time this has occurred in the past 5 quarters.
Over this period, flows have added more than $0.5 billion to RPS account balances. While we continue to anticipate lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows, we expect annual net flows to exceed 2015 levels. Confidence in our growth momentum is driven by our alignment with the fastest-growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace with a high-touch service model. 
Spending a minute on investment management. We put new money to work in the first quarter at an average yield of 4%, which was down 30 basis points from the fourth quarter. The decrease in new money rates was due to a drop in Treasury rates as we invested 210 basis points over the average 10-year Treasury in both periods. Our alternative investments generated an $8 million loss in the quarter. Headwinds from our hedge fund portfolio, which represents 1/3 of our alternatives carrying value and the impact of lower energy prices on our private equity investments, were the primary drivers of this result. Over the last 4 years, our alternatives portfolio, which is now $1.2 billion of assets, has averaged a 10% annual return, a level we expect to achieve over the long run. 
Let me also update you on our fixed income energy portfolio where we continue to proactively monitor and manage our credit exposure. Following nearly a $1 billion decrease in energy holdings in 2015, we trimmed almost $500 million in the first quarter and another $250 million in the second quarter. In total, this represents a 17% reduction in energy holdings over this period. Our sales targeted securities most likely to be at risk of credit loss in a sustained period of low energy prices.
In the quarter, we did experience some negative ratings migration from the energy sector. However, the RBC impact was manageable and downgrades have slowed. The increase in oil prices have helped reduce our energy net unrealized loss, which was $375 million at quarter end, an improvement of $100 million from year-end. Bottom line, we feel very comfortable with our energy exposure and the overall quality of our investment portfolio. 
Turning to distribution. The depth and breadth of our retail, wholesale and worksite teams continue to differentiate Lincoln. The strength of our distribution force has enabled the shift in sales mix to a point that now 75% of enterprise sales do not have long-term guarantees, up 65% -- up from 65% a year ago. While we continue to have success shifting sales to products about long-term guarantees, as I noted in the business sections, sales of our individual products were lower. This reflected the impact of market volatility on consumer demand, which keeps money on the sidelines, combined with some impact from regulatory uncertainty. That said, you have heard me say many times, distribution is a competitive advantage for Lincoln, and I expect Lincoln to once again differentiate itself as market headwinds subside and distributors adapt to regulatory changes. 
In closing, I'm looking beyond the first quarter as I anticipate items that impacted the quarter to abate or reverse, and I expect our earnings to return to levels you have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. Our strong franchise, balance sheet and capital position create a lot of flexibility and opportunity. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

As Dennis mentioned, there were several items that negatively impacted our results this quarter. While",1362,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $314 million or $1.25 per share for the first quarter, $0.10 below the prior year. As Dennis mentioned, there were several items that negatively impacted our results this quarter. While we do consider these items to be part of normal volatility, at this time, we do not expect them to reoccur in the second quarter. 
First, group results were negatively impacted by accelerated amortization of DAC, which were around $18 million or $0.07 a share of our typical quarterly run rate. I will provide more detail on this later, but we fully expect amortization to moderate.
Next, alternatives were below our expected results by $25 million, which negatively impacted the quarter by $0.10. While it is too early to comment on our expectations for the second quarter, the recent recovery in the broader equity and energy markets are likely to have a positive impact. The equity market recovery should also boost our fee-based earnings. First quarter results were impacted by decline in average account balances, but by the end of the quarter, account balances were largely unchanged from year-end. As a result, this should add roughly $0.05 to our quarterly run rate. 
Lastly, consistent with first quarter result the past few years, we experienced elevated mortality, which negatively impacted individual life earnings by $30 million or $0.12. We estimate that roughly 2/3 of this was the seasonally high mortality that we typically see in the first quarter. I will comment more in mortality in that life section of my comments. 
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased less than 1% in the quarter as another quarter of positive net flows was offset by decline in equity markets, resulting in a 2% decrease in average account values. G&A, net of capitalized expenses, decreased slightly and notably trailed revenue growth. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew more than 7% to $53.25, an all-time high.
Finally, our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, even with interest rates at or below levels we saw during the first quarter. This gives a significant financial flexibility, which we once again exhibited this quarter with $260 million of capital deployed to shareholders. Net income results for the quarter included an invested-related legal settlement, $27 million of variable annuity net derivative losses and a similar amount of general account investment losses. 
Now we'll turn to segment results, and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $218 million, a decline in average account values and lower variable investment income, which includes income from alternative investments and prepayments, were drivers of the 9% year-over-year decrease in earnings. Operating revenues declined 2% from the first quarter over 2015 after excluding an increase in fixed income annuity deposits.
Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled $1.3 billion. This 1% organic growth rate was more than offset by headwinds from equity markets. Return metrics remained strong, as ROE came in at 20%, consistent with our average return over the last decade. ROA decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year and stands at 74 basis points. Given the equity market recovery, we expect annuity earnings and returns to see a nice boost in subsequent quarters. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $31 million, down from $35 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in variable investment income. First quarter revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, consistent with the change in average account balances, as positive net flows of $415 million over the trailing 12 months were offset by unfavorable equity markets.
Although average account values declined, end-of-period balances totaled more than $54 billion, in line with the prior quarter and prior year. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 3 basis points versus the prior quarter, better than our expectation for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points annually in the retirement business. Our return on assets was 23 basis points for the first quarter. However, more normal variable investment income would produce an ROA at the low end of the 25 to 30 basis point range we have discussed in the past. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $75 million were down as a result of unfavorable mortality and $17 million of lower alternative investment income. This quarter, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million, and again, roughly 2/3 of this reflects typical seasonality. Included in this quarter's mortality result were an unusual number of early duration claims, which represented approximately $8 million, and explains why our mortality experience exceeded normal seasonality. To provide some context, during the first quarter, we had claims on 16 large policies that were underwritten within the past 2 years versus a quarterly average of 3 policies over the past couple of years. 
Turning quickly to the life earnings drivers. Average account values were up 3%, with average in-force face amount of 4%, both consistent with recent performance. Normalized spreads decreased 11 basis points, just above the top end of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. So the first quarter once again experienced typical seasonality. However, consistent with prior years, we do expect mortality to improve over the course of the year. 
Group Protection earnings of $5 million compared to a loss of $6 million in the prior year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. Importantly, we saw significant improvement in our nonmedical loss ratio, which came in at just under 70%, our best ratio since the fourth quarter of 2009 and an 850 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. This quarter's loss ratio clearly benefited from strong experience across all of our businesses. Notably, life and disability continue to benefit from our pricing actions, while the latter saw further improvement in claims management.
These positive earnings drivers were offset by a couple negative impacts from lower persistency, owing to our extensive repricing of policy renewals. Notably, nonmedical earned premiums declined 9%, and we experienced accelerated amortization of DAC. As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $18 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate. As the first quarter is our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period, but decreases in subsequent quarters. In fact, this is exactly what we saw last year as well, which gives us confidence that group's earnings power will continue to improve. 
Let me discuss liquidity, our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. Holding company cash ended the quarter at $539 million, above our target of $500 million. Statutory surplus stands at $8.4 billion, and we estimate our RBC ratio to be approximately 480%, slightly below year-end despite active capital management, and a roughly 10 point negative impact from ratings migration. Additionally, I would note that we executed on a reinsurance transaction in early April, which generated approximately $400 million of capital. This capital provides a buffer for uncertain macroenvironments, while also giving us incremental capital to deploy.
This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares, as we took advantage of our strong capital position, the decline in our share price and capital that was freed up owing to lower annuity sales. While I remain very comfortable of our long-term free cash flow outlook of 50% to 55% of operating earnings being available for buybacks and dividends, I do see upside to this number this year, given the strength of our capital position. As we've noted in the past, returning capital to shareholders remains a priority for Lincoln. As a result, we expect to go to the board in a few weeks to ask for increase in our share repurchase authorization, consistent with past practices. 
So wrapping things up, earnings were short of our expectations, but we see clear signs that our earnings power will recover in the very near term. As Dennis noted, our strong franchise gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, while the strength of our balance sheet and capital generation capabilities allows us to continue actively deploying capital. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

If you go back 4, 5 years ago, I'd agree with you that I would think of this business as roughly $135 million, $140 million a quarter business, so right in that $550 million range. If you think about what's gone on in the business then over the subsequent 5 years, what I would say is that the combined impact of spread compression, that's a real economic item, and the sector that we have done a significant number of reserve transactions, reserve financings over the course of the year, has pulled roughly $35 million to $40 million out of that number. So you start at $135 million, you'd come down that $35 million to $40 million. To that, we've added back, I would estimate, roughly $30 million, $35 million a quarter from the new business that we sold over that point in time. When all is said and done, where that leaves you, what would I say today, is roughly $125 million, or in that range, a quarter. So we're $140 million. We've pulled a significant amount of money out of the business due to the reserve financings. There has been some impact from spread compression. But we've added back a significant amount from new business. So that's what I'd see today, Jimmy."

If you remember, it was about 4 years ago,",350,"Yes, we are constantly working on optimizing the balance sheet. What I would say about the $400 million of capital that we generated through reinsurance transaction, it's related to our New York book of business. If you remember, it was about 4 years ago, the industry entered into an agreement with the NAIC on reserving for secondary guarantee. Well, at that time, 49 states signed onto that. New York, unfortunately, decided to go a different way and didn't adopt the agreed-upon approach. That created a significant amount of noneconomic reserves. If you remember, for us, we have been putting up $90 million of additional reserves a year over a 5-year period. We're in the fourth year of that, and for total of $450 million of additional reserves. When that happened, we set about immediately trying to figure out a way and figured there would be a way to manage in a more effective way those additional reserves we were putting up. You're working in New York, so you have to be a little bit more restrictive in terms of what you can do. For instance, a captive-related transaction is going to be much more difficult. So it took a little more time, but we were eventually able to enter into a more traditional reinsurance transaction, and that's what generated the $400 million of relief I talked about. We figured we were going to get that done. Exactly when the timing was going to be, Jimmy, was uncertain, but we did complete it here early in the second quarter. In terms of how does it impact or did it impact my expectation, I'd just go back to what I said in the script. Over the long term, we expect 50% to 55% is well within our wheelhouse. But then this year, given the strong capital position, given the fact that we continue to generate strong amounts of capital, continue -- given the fact that than annuity sales were down a little bit, given the fact that we did this reinsurance transaction, we fully expect to exceed that long-term guidance this year."

So they have a 1% annual fee. I think the breakeven point on a full upfront commission on annuities versus that 1% fee is in 4 or 5 years. And so it -- again, back to the contract language, what's in the best interest -- based on the product that's being sold, what's in the best interest of the client, and long-term contracts upfront compensation may very well be the answer as to what the best interest is.

There's a segment of the market that focuses on less liquidity so that surrender charges and commissions are higher. But then, that value proposition comes along with investing longer and presumably paying a higher crediting rate. Now we don't participate in that market, and so we don't pay -- we have more a liquid, lower-commission product, which is appropriate for our distribution channels and what's Lincoln view on consumer value is. So you're going to have to look at each situation like that.

First quarter results were disappointing, as operating earnings fell short of our expectations. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our earnings appear to be temporary, and we anticipate a nice recovery in the second quarter. Randy will describe this in more detail. 
While earnings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong and resilient as we continue to grow book value per share and actively deploy capital. Our franchise also remains a competitive advantage. Product breadth and innovation, coupled with our distribution reach, gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities while also delivering on our strategic priorities, including shifting our new business mix towards products without long-term guarantees.
This quarter, some examples of this included: sales of life products without guarantees increased 13%; group sales grew 5%, marking our first year-over-year increase since 2013; RPS deposits of $1.8 billion increased 5%; and nearly 50% of our annuity sales did not have guaranteed living benefits. 
Before turning to business line results, let me provide a high-level view of how the final DOL rule seems to impact Lincoln's business model. In general, as we anticipated, the final rules mostly moved in a constructive direction. On the positive side, the rule clearly documents the use of commissions alongside fees as appropriate compensation. Specifically, the DOL agreed in the final rule that commissions can be more cost-effective for investors who do not trade frequently as would be the case with annuity purchasers.
In its discussion of annuities, the DOL also emphasized that the BIC exemption is designed preserve commissions, allowing investors to choose the payment structure that works best for them. The inclusion of grandfathering address the concern of a major disruption related to a backward application of the new rules. The rule acknowledges the benefit of lifetime income guarantees, which significantly differentiates annuities from other financial products. The expansion of the education definition leaves our high-touch retirement business value proposition intact. 
Somewhat negative, but generally not expected to seriously impact Lincoln would be the inclusion of indexed annuities in the BIC will take some extra work in the independent channels where the compliance ecosystem is not as comprehensive as it is for registered products sold through broker-dealers. In the first quarter, only 3% of our total annuity sales are fixed indexed annuities sold through nonregistered insurance agents in the qualified space. Adding the Group Variable Annuity to the BIC may have eliminated a competitive advantage under the proposed rule, but we believe it leaves us in a competitively neutral position. 
Our distribution partner response so far is generally consistent in the expectation that they will use the BIC for commissions. It also may prove out that distribution partners will need to trim shelf space and focus on fewer higher-quality companies, which I believe would be an advantage to Lincoln over the long term. Our efforts are now turning to working with the DOL, our distribution partners and internally to be sure that an effective compliance system is developed to reduce the right of action risk that remains part of the rule. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. A 4% decrease in average account values and lower variable investment income resulted in annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, strong recovery in equity markets later in the quarter led to account balances ending the quarter flat with year-end, which positions us well for subsequent periods. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion, and net outflows were modest at just $35 million. Over the past year, net flows have added $1.3 billion to account balances. As I have noted in the past couple of quarters, market volatility has dampened consumer demand for equity-sensitive products, and there appears to be some regulatory impact as well. Higher persistency has helped net flows. Although sales are lower than last year, as we said we would, we used some of the capital that was to be allocated towards annuity sales to buy back stock at attractive levels. So while we have experienced lower sales recently, longer term, our consistent approach and commitment to the annuity business positions us well to grow this high-quality source of earnings as marketplace headwinds subside. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We recognize there will be a focus on our mortality experience in this quarter. While we typically expect higher claims in the first quarter, we also saw an unusual number of early duration claims. In terms of sales, total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $132 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year quarter. Importantly, our focus on selling more products without long-term guarantees continues to gain traction. As I noted upfront, sales of these products increased 13% and represented 71% of our total Life Insurance sales, up from 62% of our sales last year.
Included in this are many exciting product stories. For example, term sales increased to 32% as we continue to benefit for product enhancements made in the third quarter. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 20% as we were helped by our midyear product launch. Additionally, regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. 
MoneyGuard sales increased 5%, which is impressive coming off record annual sales in 2015. We continue to remain opportunistic with respect to executive benefit sales, which contributed $7 million to total life sales. Looking forward, our pipeline remains very strong, and given our product breadth and strength of our distribution, we remain optimistic about our new business opportunities. 
Turning to Group Protection. We are pleased with the year-over-year earnings increase, driven by the significant improvement in our nonmedical loss ratio, which continues to benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management processes. First quarter sales of $59 million increased 5% from the same period last year, which marked our first year-over-year sales increase since 2013. As our pricing actions have stabilized, the degree of market disruption has been reduced. As a result, we expect improvement in sales activity and growth to persist. As I noted last quarter, this would be important as we look to drive future margin improvement by growing premiums while sustaining pricing discipline. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings, deposits and net flows were generally consistent with our outlook. First quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were up 5% from a year ago. Recurring deposits increased 6% and benefited from both employee and employer contributions. First year sales grew by 3%; and notably, our pipeline continues to be very strong which should benefit sales in the second half of the year. Our focus on specific markets and our differentiated customer experience is working and help drive positive net flows for the retirement business, which marked the fourth time this has occurred in the past 5 quarters.
Over this period, flows have added more than $0.5 billion to RPS account balances. While we continue to anticipate lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows, we expect annual net flows to exceed 2015 levels. Confidence in our growth momentum is driven by our alignment with the fastest-growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace with a high-touch service model. 
Spending a minute on investment management. We put new money to work in the first quarter at an average yield of 4%, which was down 30 basis points from the fourth quarter. The decrease in new money rates was due to a drop in Treasury rates as we invested 210 basis points over the average 10-year Treasury in both periods. Our alternative investments generated an $8 million loss in the quarter. Headwinds from our hedge fund portfolio, which represents 1/3 of our alternatives carrying value and the impact of lower energy prices on our private equity investments, were the primary drivers of this result. Over the last 4 years, our alternatives portfolio, which is now $1.2 billion of assets, has averaged a 10% annual return, a level we expect to achieve over the long run. 
Let me also update you on our fixed income energy portfolio where we continue to proactively monitor and manage our credit exposure. Following nearly a $1 billion decrease in energy holdings in 2015, we trimmed almost $500 million in the first quarter and another $250 million in the second quarter. In total, this represents a 17% reduction in energy holdings over this period. Our sales targeted securities most likely to be at risk of credit loss in a sustained period of low energy prices.
In the quarter, we did experience some negative ratings migration from the energy sector. However, the RBC impact was manageable and downgrades have slowed. The increase in oil prices have helped reduce our energy net unrealized loss, which was $375 million at quarter end, an improvement of $100 million from year-end. Bottom line, we feel very comfortable with our energy exposure and the overall quality of our investment portfolio. 
Turning to distribution. The depth and breadth of our retail, wholesale and worksite teams continue to differentiate Lincoln. The strength of our distribution force has enabled the shift in sales mix to a point that now 75% of enterprise sales do not have long-term guarantees, up 65% -- up from 65% a year ago. While we continue to have success shifting sales to products without long-term guarantees, as I noted in the business sections, sales of our individual products were lower. This reflected the impact of market volatility on consumer demand, which keeps money on the sidelines, combined with some impact from regulatory uncertainty. That said, you have heard me say many times, distribution is a competitive advantage for Lincoln, and I expect Lincoln to once again differentiate itself as market headwinds subside and distributors adapt to regulatory changes. 
In closing, I'm looking beyond the first quarter as I anticipate items that impacted the quarter to abate or reverse, and I expect our earnings to return to levels you have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. Our strong franchise, balance sheet and capital position create a lot of flexibility and opportunity. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

First, group results were negatively impacted by accelerated amortization of DAC, which ran $18 million or $0.07 a share of our typical quarterly run rate. I will provide more detail on this later, but we fully expect amortization to moderate.
Next, alternatives were below our expected results by $25 million, which negatively impacted the quarter by $0.10. While it is too early to comment on our expectations for the second quarter, the recent recovery in the broader equity and energy markets are likely to have a positive impact. The equity market recovery should also boost our fee-based earnings. First quarter results were impacted by decline in average account balances, but by the end of the quarter, account balances were largely unchanged from year-end. As a result, this should add roughly $0.05 to our quarterly run rate. 
Lastly, consistent with first quarter results the past few years, we experienced elevated mortality, which negatively impacted individual life earnings by $30 million or $0.12. We estimate that roughly 2/3 of this was the seasonally high mortality that we typically see in the first quarter. I will comment more in mortality in that life section of my comments. 
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased less than 1% in the quarter as another quarter of positive net flows was offset by decline in equity markets, resulting in a 2% decrease in average account values. G&A, net of capitalized expenses, decreased slightly and notably trailed revenue growth. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew more than 7% to $53.25, an all-time high.
Finally, our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, even with interest rates at or below levels we saw during the first quarter. This gives a significant financial flexibility, which we once again exhibited this quarter with $260 million of capital deployed to shareholders. Net income results for the quarter included an invested-related legal settlement, $27 million of variable annuity net derivative losses and a similar amount of general account investment losses. 
Now we'll turn to segment results, and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $218 million, a decline in average account values and lower variable investment income, which includes income from alternative investments and prepayments, were drivers of the 9% year-over-year decrease in earnings. Operating revenues declined 2% from the first quarter over 2015 after excluding an increase in fixed income annuity deposits.
Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled $1.3 billion. This 1% organic growth rate was more than offset by headwinds from equity markets. Return metrics remained strong, as ROE came in at 20%, consistent with our average return over the last decade. ROA decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year and stands at 74 basis points. Given the equity market recovery, we expect annuity earnings and returns to see a nice boost in subsequent quarters. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $31 million, down from $35 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in variable investment income. First quarter revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, consistent with the change in average account balances, as positive net flows of $415 million over the trailing 12 months were offset by unfavorable equity markets.
Although average account values declined, end-of-period balances totaled more than $54 billion, in line with the prior quarter and prior year. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 3 basis points versus the prior quarter, better than our expectation for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points annually in the retirement business. Our return on assets was 23 basis points for the first quarter. However, more normal variable investment income would produce an ROA at the low end of the 25 to 30 basis point range we have discussed in the past. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $75 million were down as a result of unfavorable mortality and $17 million of lower alternative investment income. This quarter, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million, and again, roughly 2/3 of this reflects typical seasonality. Included in this quarter's mortality result were an unusual number of early duration claims, which represented approximately $8 million, and explains why our mortality experience exceeded normal seasonality. To provide some context, during the first quarter, we had claims on 16 large policies that were underwritten within the past 2 years versus a quarterly average of 3 policies over the past couple of years. 
Turning quickly to the life earnings drivers. Average account values were up 3%, with average in-force face amount up 4%, both consistent with recent performance. Normalized spreads decreased 11 basis points, just above the top end of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. So the first quarter once again experienced typical seasonality. However, consistent with prior years, we do expect mortality to improve over the course of the year. 
Group Protection earnings of $5 million compared to a loss of $6 million in the prior year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. Importantly, we saw significant improvement in our nonmedical loss ratio, which came in at just under 70%, our best ratio since the fourth quarter of 2009 and an 850 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. This quarter's loss ratio clearly benefited from strong experience across all of our businesses. Notably, life and disability continue to benefit from our pricing actions, while the latter saw further improvement in claims management.
These positive earnings drivers were offset by a couple negative impacts from lower persistency, owing to our extensive repricing of policy renewals. Notably, nonmedical earned premiums declined 9%, and we experienced accelerated amortization of DAC. As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $18 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate. As the first quarter is our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period, but decreases in subsequent quarters. In fact, this is exactly what we saw last year as well, which gives us confidence that group's earnings power will continue to improve. 
Let me discuss liquidity, our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. Holding company cash ended the quarter at $539 million, above our target of $500 million. Statutory surplus stands at $8.4 billion, and we estimate our RBC ratio to be approximately 480%, slightly below year-end despite active capital management, and a roughly 10 point negative impact from ratings migration. Additionally, I would note that we executed on a reinsurance transaction in early April, which generated approximately $400 million of capital. This capital provides a buffer for uncertain macroenvironments, while also giving us incremental capital to deploy.
This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares, as we took advantage of our strong capital position, the decline in our share price and capital that was freed up owing to lower annuity sales. While I remain very comfortable with our long-term free cash flow outlook of 50% to 55% of operating earnings being available for buybacks and dividends, I do see upside to this number this year, given the strength of our capital position. As we've noted in the past, returning capital to shareholders remains a priority for Lincoln. As a result, we expect to go to the board in a few weeks to ask for increase in our share repurchase authorization, consistent with past practices. 
So wrapping things up, earnings were short of our expectations, but we see clear signs that our earnings power will recover in the very near term. As Dennis noted, our strong franchise gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, while the strength of our balance sheet and capital generation capabilities allows us to continue actively deploying capital. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

When I think about the Life business, I tend to think about it over more extended period of time. If you go back 4, 5 years ago, I'd agree with you that I would think of this business as roughly $135 million, $140 million a quarter business, so right in that $550 million range. If you think about what's gone on in the business then over the subsequent 5 years, what I would say is that the combined impact of spread compression, that's a real economic item, and the fact that we have done a significant number of reserve transactions, reserve financings over the course of the year, has pulled roughly $35 million to $40 million out of that number. So you start at $135 million, you'd come down that $35 million to $40 million. To that, we've added back, I would estimate, roughly $30 million, $35 million a quarter from the new business that we sold over that point in time. When all is said and done, where that leaves you, what would I say today, is roughly $125 million, or in that range, a quarter. So we're $140 million. We've pulled a significant amount of money out of the business due to the reserve financings. There has been some impact from spread compression. But we've added back a significant amount from new business. So that's what I'd see today, Jimmy."

If you remember, it was about 4 years ago,",350,"Yes, we are constantly working on optimizing the balance sheet. What I would say about the $400 million of capital that we generated through reinsurance transaction, it's related to our New York book of business. If you remember, it was about 4 years ago, the industry entered into an agreement with the NAIC on reserving for secondary guarantee. Well, at that time, 49 states signed onto that. New York, unfortunately, decided to go a different way and didn't adopt the agreed-upon approach. That created a significant amount of noneconomic reserves. If you remember, for us, we have been putting up $90 million of additional reserves a year over a 5-year period. We're in the fourth year of that, and for total of $450 million of additional reserves. When that happened, we set about immediately trying to figure out a way and figured there would be a way to manage in a more effective way those additional reserves we were putting up. You're working in New York, so you have to be a little bit more restrictive in terms of what you can do. For instance, a captive-related transaction is going to be much more difficult. So it took a little more time, but we were eventually able to enter into a more traditional reinsurance transaction, and that's what generated the $400 million of relief I talked about. We figured we were going to get that done. Exactly when the timing was going to be, Jimmy, was uncertain, but we did complete it here early in the second quarter. In terms of how does it impact or did it impact my expectation, I'd just go back to what I said in the script. Over the long term, we expect 50% to 55% is well within our wheelhouse. But then this year, given the strong capital position, given the fact that we continue to generate strong amounts of capital, continue -- given the fact that than annuity sales were down a little bit, given the fact that we did this reinsurance transaction, we fully expect to exceed that long-term guidance this year."

I would say, as the proportion of business that is employee based becomes a bigger piece of the book that, that has a modestly lower loss ratio. So over time, you would expect that target to trend down a little bit. When you look up the quarter itself, we came at 69.6% for the quarter. It's really -- you start to try to split the -- split these things to a pretty much finer level than you truly can. But when I look at the actual experience in the quarter, there are 3 primary items that really drive loss ratios, if you're talking about disability insurance. You have incident rates, you have terminations and you have the average size claim that comes on the books. When I look at those 3 items and how they impacted the quarter, once again, you're starting to split these things pretty fine. But it's probably about 1 to 2 points better than we would've expected for the quarter. So that 69.6% had a little bit of favorability in it, but not too much."

But let me come back to the examples that we shared in our comment letters with the DOL, and take a look at the difference between an annual advisory fee, let's say, of 1%, which is not even available to smaller-sized customers; it would be 2% or more. So if you have a 1% annual fee. I think the breakeven point on a full upfront commission on annuities versus that 1% fee is in 4 or 5 years. And so it -- again, back to the contract language, what's in the best interest -- based on the product that's being sold, what's in the best interest of the client, and on long-term contracts upfront compensation may very well be the answer as to what the best interest is. Now broadly speaking, I think -- the financial services industry is moving toward, in total, more pressure on fees, more transparency, but I think that's an independent issue from the Department of Labor."

There's a segment of the market that focuses on less liquidity so that surrender charges and commissions are higher.

Now we don't participate in that market, and so we don't pay -- we have more a liquid, lower-commission product, which is appropriate for our distribution channels and what's Lincoln view on consumer value is.

While earnings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong and resilient as we continue to grow book value per share and actively deploy capital. Our franchise also remains a competitive advantage. Product breadth and innovation, coupled with our distribution reach, gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities while also delivering on our strategic priorities, including shifting our new business mix towards products without long-term guarantees.
This quarter, some examples of this included: sales of life products without guarantees increased 13%; group sales grew 5%, marking our first year-over-year increase since 2013; RPS deposits of $1.8 billion increased 5%; and nearly 50% of our annuity sales did not have guaranteed living benefits. 
Before turning to business line results, let me provide a high-level view of how the final DOL rule seems to impact Lincoln's business model. In general, as we anticipated, the final rules mostly moved in a constructive direction. On the positive side, the rule clearly documents the use of commissions alongside fees as appropriate compensation. Specifically, the DOL agreed in the final rule that commissions can be more cost-effective for investors who do not trade frequently as would be the case with annuity purchasers.
In its discussion of annuities, the DOL also emphasized that the BIC exemption is designed preserve commissions, allowing investors to choose the payment structure that works best for them. The inclusion of grandfathering address the concern of a major disruption related to a backward application of the new rules. The rule acknowledges the benefit of lifetime income guarantees, which significantly differentiates annuities from other financial products. The expansion of the education definition leaves our high-touch retirement business value proposition intact. 
Somewhat negative, but generally not expected to seriously impact Lincoln would be the inclusion of indexed annuities in the BIC will take some extra work in the independent channels where the compliance ecosystem is not as comprehensive as it is for registered products sold through broker-dealers. In the first quarter, only 3% of our total annuity sales are fixed indexed annuities sold through nonregistered insurance agents in the qualified space. Adding the Group Variable Annuity to the BIC may have eliminated a competitive advantage under the proposed rule, but we believe it leaves us in a competitively neutral position. 
Our distribution partner response so far is generally consistent in the expectation that they will use the BIC for commissions. It also may prove out that distribution partners will need to trim shelf space and focus on fewer higher-quality companies, which I believe would be an advantage to Lincoln over the long term. Our efforts are now turning to working with the DOL, our distribution partners and internally to be sure that an effective compliance system is developed to reduce the right of action risk that remains part of the rule. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. A 4% decrease in average account values and lower variable investment income resulted in annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, strong recovery in equity markets later in the quarter led to account balances ending the quarter flat with year-end, which positions us well for subsequent periods. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion, and net outflows were modest at just $35 million. Over the past year, net flows have added $1.3 billion to account balances. As I have noted in the past couple of quarters, market volatility has dampened consumer demand for equity-sensitive products, and there appears to be some regulatory impact as well. Higher persistency has helped net flows. Although sales are lower than last year, as we said we would, we used some of the capital that was to be allocated towards annuity sales to buy back stock at attractive levels. So while we have experienced lower sales recently, longer term, our consistent approach and commitment to the annuity business positions us well to grow this high-quality source of earnings as marketplace headwinds subside. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We recognize there will be a focus on our mortality experience in this quarter. While we typically expect higher claims in the first quarter, we also saw an unusual number of early duration claims. In terms of sales, total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $132 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year quarter. Importantly, our focus on selling more products without long-term guarantees continues to gain traction. As I noted upfront, sales of these products increased 13% and represented 71% of our total Life Insurance sales, up from 62% of our sales last year.
Included in this are many exciting product stories. For example, term sales increased to 32% as we continue to benefit for product enhancements made in the third quarter. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 20% as we were helped by our midyear product launch. Additionally, regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. 
MoneyGuard sales increased 5%, which is impressive coming off record annual sales in 2015. We continue to remain opportunistic with respect to executive benefit sales, which contributed $7 million to total life sales. Looking forward, our pipeline remains very strong, and given our product breadth and strength of our distribution, we remain optimistic about our new business opportunities. 
Turning to Group Protection. We are pleased with the year-over-year earnings increase, driven by the significant improvement in our nonmedical loss ratio, which continues to benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management processes. First quarter sales of $59 million increased 5% from the same period last year, which marked our first year-over-year sales increase since 2013. As our pricing actions have stabilized, the degree of market disruption has been reduced. As a result, we expect improvement in sales activity and growth to persist. As I noted last quarter, this would be important as we look to drive future margin improvement by growing premiums while sustaining pricing discipline. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings, deposits and net flows were generally consistent with our outlook. First quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were up 5% from a year ago. Recurring deposits increased 6% and benefited from both employee and employer contributions. First year sales grew by 3%; and notably, our pipeline continues to be very strong which should benefit sales in the second half of the year. Our focus on specific markets and our differentiated customer experience is working and help drive positive net flows for the retirement business, which marked the fourth time this has occurred in the past 5 quarters.
Over this period, flows have added more than $0.5 billion to RPS account balances. While we continue to anticipate lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows, we expect annual net flows to exceed 2015 levels. Confidence in our growth momentum is driven by our alignment with the fastest-growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace with a high-touch service model. 
Spending a minute on investment management. We put new money to work in the first quarter at an average yield of 4%, which was down 30 basis points from the fourth quarter. The decrease in new money rates was due to a drop in Treasury rates as we invested 210 basis points over the average 10-year Treasury in both periods. Our alternative investments generated an $8 million loss in the quarter. Headwinds from our hedge fund portfolio, which represents 1/3 of our alternatives carrying value and the impact of lower energy prices on our private equity investments, were the primary drivers of this result. Over the last 4 years, our alternatives portfolio, which is now $1.2 billion of assets, has averaged a 10% annual return, a level we expect to achieve over the long run. 
Let me also update you on our fixed income energy portfolio where we continue to proactively monitor and manage our credit exposure. Following nearly a $1 billion decrease in energy holdings in 2015, we trimmed almost $500 million in the first quarter and another $250 million in the second quarter. In total, this represents a 17% reduction in energy holdings over this period. Our sales targeted securities most likely to be at risk of credit loss in a sustained period of low energy prices.
In the quarter, we did experience some negative ratings migration from the energy sector. However, the RBC impact was manageable and downgrades have slowed. The increase in oil prices have helped reduce our energy net unrealized loss, which was $375 million at quarter end, an improvement of $100 million from year-end. Bottom line, we feel very comfortable with our energy exposure and the overall quality of our investment portfolio. 
Turning to distribution. The depth and breadth of our retail, wholesale and worksite teams continue to differentiate Lincoln. The strength of our distribution force has enabled the shift in sales mix to a point that now 75% of enterprise sales do not have long-term guarantees, up 65% -- up from 65% a year ago. While we continue to have success shifting sales to products without long-term guarantees, as I noted in the business sections, sales of our individual products were lower. This reflected the impact of market volatility on consumer demand, which keeps money on the sidelines, combined with some impact from regulatory uncertainty. That said, you have heard me say many times, distribution is a competitive advantage for Lincoln, and I expect Lincoln to once again differentiate itself as market headwinds subside and distributors adapt to regulatory changes. 
In closing, I'm looking beyond the first quarter as I anticipate items that impacted the quarter to abate or reverse, and I expect our earnings to return to levels you have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. Our strong franchise, balance sheet and capital position create a lot of flexibility and opportunity. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

As Dennis mentioned, there were several items that negatively impacted our results this quarter. While",1362,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $314 million or $1.25 per share for the first quarter, $0.10 below the prior year. As Dennis mentioned, there were several items that negatively impacted our results this quarter. While we do consider these items to be part of normal volatility, at this time, we do not expect them to reoccur in the second quarter. 
First, group results were negatively impacted by accelerated amortization of DAC, which ran $18 million or $0.07 a share of our typical quarterly run rate. I will provide more detail on this later, but we fully expect amortization to moderate.
Next, alternatives were below our expected results by $25 million, which negatively impacted the quarter by $0.10. While it is too early to comment on our expectations for the second quarter, the recent recovery in the broader equity and energy markets are likely to have a positive impact. The equity market recovery should also boost our fee-based earnings. First quarter results were impacted by decline in average account balances, but by the end of the quarter, account balances were largely unchanged from year-end. As a result, this should add roughly $0.05 to our quarterly run rate. 
Lastly, consistent with first quarter results the past few years, we experienced elevated mortality, which negatively impacted individual life earnings by $30 million or $0.12. We estimate that roughly 2/3 of this was the seasonally high mortality that we typically see in the first quarter. I will comment more in mortality in that life section of my comments. 
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased less than 1% in the quarter as another quarter of positive net flows was offset by decline in equity markets, resulting in a 2% decrease in average account values. G&A, net of capitalized expenses, decreased slightly and notably trailed revenue growth. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew more than 7% to $53.25, an all-time high.
Finally, our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, even with interest rates at or below levels we saw during the first quarter. This gives a significant financial flexibility, which we once again exhibited this quarter with $260 million of capital deployed to shareholders. Net income results for the quarter included an invested-related legal settlement, $27 million of variable annuity net derivative losses and a similar amount of general account investment losses. 
Now we'll turn to segment results, and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $218 million, a decline in average account values and lower variable investment income, which includes income from alternative investments and prepayments, were drivers of the 9% year-over-year decrease in earnings. Operating revenues declined 2% from the first quarter over 2015 after excluding an increase in fixed income annuity deposits.
Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled $1.3 billion. This 1% organic growth rate was more than offset by headwinds from equity markets. Return metrics remained strong, as ROE came in at 20%, consistent with our average return over the last decade. ROA decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year and stands at 74 basis points. Given the equity market recovery, we expect annuity earnings and returns to see a nice boost in subsequent quarters. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $31 million, down from $35 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in variable investment income. First quarter revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, consistent with the change in average account balances, as positive net flows of $415 million over the trailing 12 months were offset by unfavorable equity markets.
Although average account values declined, end-of-period balances totaled more than $54 billion, in line with the prior quarter and prior year. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 3 basis points versus the prior quarter, better than our expectation for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points annually in the retirement business. Our return on assets was 23 basis points for the first quarter. However, more normal variable investment income would produce an ROA at the low end of the 25 to 30 basis point range we have discussed in the past. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $75 million were down as a result of unfavorable mortality and $17 million of lower alternative investment income. This quarter, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million, and again, roughly 2/3 of this reflects typical seasonality. Included in this quarter's mortality result were an unusual number of early duration claims, which represented approximately $8 million, and explains why our mortality experience exceeded normal seasonality. To provide some context, during the first quarter, we had claims on 16 large policies that were underwritten within the past 2 years versus a quarterly average of 3 policies over the past couple of years. 
Turning quickly to the life earnings drivers. Average account values were up 3%, with average in-force face amount up 4%, both consistent with recent performance. Normalized spreads decreased 11 basis points, just above the top end of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. So the first quarter once again experienced typical seasonality. However, consistent with prior years, we do expect mortality to improve over the course of the year. 
Group Protection earnings of $5 million compared to a loss of $6 million in the prior year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. Importantly, we saw significant improvement in our nonmedical loss ratio, which came in at just under 70%, our best ratio since the fourth quarter of 2009 and an 850 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. This quarter's loss ratio clearly benefited from strong experience across all of our businesses. Notably, life and disability continue to benefit from our pricing actions, while the latter saw further improvement in claims management.
These positive earnings drivers were offset by a couple negative impacts from lower persistency, owing to our extensive repricing of policy renewals. Notably, nonmedical earned premiums declined 9%, and we experienced accelerated amortization of DAC. As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $18 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate. As the first quarter is our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period, but decreases in subsequent quarters. In fact, this is exactly what we saw last year as well, which gives us confidence that group's earnings power will continue to improve. 
Let me discuss liquidity, our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. Holding company cash ended the quarter at $539 million, above our target of $500 million. Statutory surplus stands at $8.4 billion, and we estimate our RBC ratio to be approximately 480%, slightly below year-end despite active capital management, and a roughly 10 point negative impact from ratings migration. Additionally, I would note that we executed on a reinsurance transaction in early April, which generated approximately $400 million of capital. This capital provides a buffer for uncertain macro environments, while also giving us incremental capital to deploy.
This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares, as we took advantage of our strong capital position, the decline in our share price and capital that was freed up owing to lower annuity sales. While I remain very comfortable with our long-term free cash flow outlook of 50% to 55% of operating earnings being available for buybacks and dividends, I do see upside to this number this year, given the strength of our capital position. As we've noted in the past, returning capital to shareholders remains a priority for Lincoln. As a result, we expect to go to the board in a few weeks to ask for increase in our share repurchase authorization, consistent with past practices. 
So wrapping things up, earnings were short of our expectations, but we see clear signs that our earnings power will recover in the very near term. As Dennis noted, our strong franchise gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, while the strength of our balance sheet and capital generation capabilities allows us to continue actively deploying capital. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

If you go back 4, 5 years ago, I'd agree with you that I would think of this business as roughly $135 million, $140 million a quarter business, so right in that $550 million range. If you think about what's gone on in the business then over the subsequent 5 years, what I would say is that the combined impact of spread compression, that's a real economic item, and the fact that we have done a significant number of reserve transactions, reserve financings over the course of the year, has pulled roughly $35 million to $40 million out of that number. So you start at $135 million, you'd come down that $35 million to $40 million. To that, we've added back, I would estimate, roughly $30 million, $35 million a quarter from the new business that we sold over that point in time. When all is said and done, where that leaves you, what would I say today, is roughly $125 million, or in that range, a quarter. So we're $140 million.

What I would say about the $400 million of capital that we generated through reinsurance transaction, it's related to our New York book of business. If you remember, it was about 4 years ago, the industry entered into an agreement with the NAIC on reserving for secondary guarantee. Well, at that time, 49 states signed onto that. New York, unfortunately, decided to go a different way and didn't adopt the agreed-upon approach. That created a significant amount of noneconomic reserves. If you remember, for us, we have been putting up $90 million of additional reserves a year over a 5-year period. We're in the fourth year of that, and for total of $450 million of additional reserves. When that happened, we set about immediately trying to figure out a way and figured there would be a way to manage in a more effective way those additional reserves we were putting up. You're working in New York, so you have to be a little bit more restrictive in terms of what you can do. For instance, a captive-related transaction is going to be much more difficult. So it took a little more time, but we were eventually able to enter into a more traditional reinsurance transaction, and that's what generated the $400 million of relief I talked about. We figured we were going to get that done. Exactly when the timing was going to be, Jimmy, was uncertain, but we did complete it here early in the second quarter. In terms of how does it impact or did it impact my expectation, I'd just go back to what I said in the script. Over the long term, we expect 50% to 55% is well within our wheelhouse. But then this year, given the strong capital position, given the fact that we continue to generate strong amounts of capital, continue -- given the fact that than annuity sales were down a little bit, given the fact that we did this reinsurance transaction, we fully expect to exceed that long-term guidance this year."

And so it -- again, back to the contract language, what's in the best interest -- based on the product that's being sold, what's in the best interest of the client, and on long-term contracts upfront compensation may very well be the answer as to what the best interest is.

As we anticipated, second quarter earnings showed a nice recovery following disappointing first quarter results as operating earnings per share increased 25% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, earnings",1759,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As we anticipated, second quarter earnings showed a nice recovery following disappointing first quarter results as operating earnings per share increased 25% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, earnings per share increased 7% as our diversified mix of businesses and sources of earnings coupled with capital management actions continue to support solid EPS growth. 
We covered much of our strategy at the June Investor Day, and I would just like to highlight a few points. First, despite persistently low interest rates, we continue to grow EPS and book value per share as we said we would. Randy will comment on income statement and balance sheet impact from all rates in his remarks. I would just note that we are raising prices on certain products as we proactively respond to lower interest rates consistent with prior years, and we see expense management as a key lever to sustain our targeted EPS growth. Importantly, we have a strong track record of controlling expenses and proved that once again this quarter. 
Next, we have a keen focus in allocating capital towards growth opportunities and attractive returns. That said, where external events are affecting sales levels or returns, we are okay with using the capital intended to support sales growth to buy back our undervalued shares. Lincoln's leading distribution organizations, combined with our manufacturing capabilities, continue to differentiate us from peers. We are driving sales growth right now in our individual Life Insurance and Group Protection businesses, while innovative product solutions across our Annuity and RPS businesses will help sales growth. I'll expand on these in a minute.  
Finally, as we have demonstrated for years, we have a quality balance sheet and generate a significant amount of free cash flow. This has allowed us to actively deploy capital to shareholders and it continued in the second quarter as we repurchased $275 million of stock. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. A 3% decrease in average account values resulted in annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, the recent recovery in equity markets led to earnings growth of 8% sequentially and positions us well for subsequent periods. Total annuity sales were $2 billion and net outflows, $452 [ph] million. As you have heard from us as well as other asset management companies, market volatility continues to dampen consumer demand for equity-sensitive products. VA sales are certainly in that camp, though I would note, our sales were largely unchanged compared to the first quarter. 
Our sales are lower than we'd like. We are still selling volumes that support our distribution value proposition and are not willing to take aggressive near-term actions to stimulate sales. In the interim, we are comfortable reallocating that capital to share buybacks. We are bringing to market several unique product solutions early next year, which capitalize on the growth trends and passive investments and fee-based compensation. These products will meaningfully enhance the value proposition and choice for guaranteed lifetime income, which is an essential solution for retirement savers. 
Our annuity business remains a high-quality source of earnings, and we have produced a long track record of success that is different from others. As we have said, this success is because we started the business the right way and have maintained our consistent and disciplined product pricing, end-to-end risk management and industry-leading distribution. We hope you walked away with those takeaways at our Investor Day as I continue to believe this business is underappreciated. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We generated strong earnings growth versus the prior year. In terms of sales, total individual Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $164 million, a 6% increase from the prior year quarter. 2/3 of our sales came from products without long-term guarantees, and our sales are well-diversified with all products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Executive benefit sales, which can be lumpy, contributed $9 million to total life sales this quarter, while the prior year benefited from one large case. 
As you know, we have done across the board product repricing over the past several years to reflect lower interest rates. As a result, many of our products are meeting targeted returns even with today's lower interest rates and flatter forward curve. Where we are not achieving acceptable returns, we will reprice. Bottom line, we are committed to maintaining our risk management and product pricing discipline to get appropriate returns on capital. When combined with actions focused on in-force profitability, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow our Life Insurance business. 
Turning to Group Protection. We are well on our way to restoring profitability and long-term growth potential of our group business. Our nonmedical loss ratio continues to improve as we benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements claims management functions. Sales momentum continues as sales increased 15%. This marks another quarter of sales growth as the market disruption from our aggressive renewal repricing strategy has clearly subsided. In addition, as our renewal price increases moderate, we are beginning to see an improvement in our renewal persistency. We expect premiums to stabilize in the back half of the year and premium growth to reemerge in 2017. I'm pleased to see the encouraging signs of growth while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. We have the right strategy, people and processes in place, and we are executing extremely well. As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. I am confident this will be achieved, providing a nice tailwind to earnings and further diversifying Lincoln's sources of earnings mix. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with both the prior year and the prior quarter and in line with expectations. Second quarter deposits of $1.7 billion were down 11% from a year ago, driven by a decline in mid-large market first year sales due to the timing of implementations. We have a strong pipeline and already committed new business scheduled for the second half of the year. This growth can be directly attributed to our focused strategy and investments in our digital and mobile customer experience, which is resonating in the marketplace. 
In the small market, first year sales were up 24% year-over-year, a result of distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity. Looking ahead, we expect this momentum to continue, aided by the recent launch of our enhanced small market directive products. 
Recurring deposits were also up 3% year-over-year, evidence that our high touch model continues to differentiate us and drive higher contributions and participation rates. Our overall sales momentum leads us to remain confident that 2016's net flows will exceed 2015 levels. 
Shifting to investment results. Disciplined ALM and risk management continue to drive our investment strategy. We put new money to work in the second quarter at an average yield of 3.8%, which was down 20 basis points from the first quarter. The decrease in new money rates was primarily due to a drop in treasury rates as we invested that 205 basis points over the average 10-year treasury, consistent with recent periods. The decline in interest rates also increased our net unrealized gain to $8.4 billion pretax, up from $5.5 billion in the first quarter. It is also worth noting that our energy portfolio, which has been an area of investor focus this year, swam to a net unrealized gain in the second quarter with values increasing by $600 million from the first quarter. Downgrades have also slowed, and as a result, our below investment-grade exposure decreased to 5.5%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first quarter. Lastly, the annualized return on our [indiscernible] investments was nearly 6% in the second quarter, a significant improvement from the first quarter. However, still below our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds help drive disappointed improvement. We expect further earnings growth over time as we achieve our targeted return, modestly increase our exposure to alternatives and shift the mix towards private equity. 
Turning to distribution, which as many of you recognize, truly differentiates Lincoln. Our wholesale, retail and work site distribution organizations have been instrumental in driving our strategies and delivering on our consistent market presence. The strength and stability of over 90,000 active producers creates opportunities that enables our ability to target the faster growing segments. During the quarter, we saw a strong producer growth across a number of our products, including MoneyGuard, fixed annuities, term and RPS, and more advisers are selling multiple products, underscoring how [indiscernible] distribution franchise in combination with a diverse product portfolio. We are executing on a diversification strategy at an enterprise level. No one product accounted for more than 14% of sales during the quarter and long-term guarantees sales were 73% of our total sales, up from 69% a year ago. And let me say that again. And non-long-term guarantees sales were 73% of our total sales, up from 69% a year ago. As manufacturing and distribution collaborate on existing new product innovations, I am confident that Lincoln will continue to differentiate itself in the marketplace. 
On the DOL. There's not much new to discuss since our investment day, but it is important to reemphasize that our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the BIC to serve retirement savers and offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is leading to greater interest in our fee-based annuity product offering by distribution partners and advisers. At Lincoln, we continue to take a leadership role in working with the DOL and our distribution partners to be sure we are prepared for when the first part of the rule goes live in April 2017. 
Lastly, as you recently saw, Mark Konen announced his decision to retire. I want to personally thank Mark for his partnership and leadership over the years and wish him the best in retirement. He has recruited a very strong management team, and by having Mark stay onboard through the end of February 2017, I am confident there will be a smooth transition. 
So in closing, I'm pleased that our earnings return to levels we have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, let me reiterate that I remain confident in our ability to generate top and bottom line growth and actively deploy capital. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,367984377,1024876,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $373 million or $1.56 per share for the second quarter, a 7% increase from the prior year. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our first quarter results, including accelerat",1477,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $373 million or $1.56 per share for the second quarter, a 7% increase from the prior year. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our first quarter results, including accelerated amortization of DAC in group, adverse mortality and individual life and weak fee-based earnings returned to expected levels. It is also worth noting that while alternative investment income improved significantly from the first quarter, returns were still below our expected results by roughly $7 million or $0.03 per share with $5 million of the shortfall hitting the life business. As an offset, expenses were favorable by a similar amount in the quarter primarily in other operations. 
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $54.67 [ph] as we continue to consistently compound book value in the high single-digit range. Operating ROE remains strong at 11.7%, unchanged from the prior year. Expense discipline beyond some of the favorability I noted upfront resulted in our expense ratio declining by 50 basis points. This reflects our ability to effectively manage the G&A in a period of slower revenue growth. We expect expenses to continue to be a good story. Net flows contributed $0.5 billion to account values. And with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we enter the third quarter with a modest tailwind. 
Finally, our balance sheet strength and capital generation enabled us to repurchase 275 million of stock this quarter, retiring 2.6% of our shares outstanding, the most since the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Net income results for the quarter included $47 million of realized losses related to investments, while our variable annuity hedge program was effective with a minimal breakage in what was a volatile quarter for the capital markets. 
Before shifting to segment highlights, I would like to comment on the current interest rate environment. The punch line is that we remain well positioned even as rates in the forward curve have moved lower. Let's start with talking about our statutory balance sheet, as that is what comes up most with investors. Recall at our June Investor Day, we know that we had sufficiency in our overall cash flow testing, including stretching the 10-year treasury down to 50 basis points forever. The one area we pointed to where there could be some temporary reserve strengthening is around certain secondary guarantee universal life sub tests. For instance, if the 10-year treasury stayed at 1%, that could require up to $350 million or 20 percentage points of RBC, a very manageable impact when you think about Lincoln having $8.7 billion of statutory capital and an RBC ratio of 500% at the end of the second quarter. 
Now thinking about the other 2 areas that lower rates impact life insurers, that being new business and spread compression. First, on the impact on new business returns. Most of our products continue to achieve our targeted returns, but as Dennis noted, we will make changes where necessary to achieve acceptable return. 
Next, on spread compression, which has been with us for a while now. We showed in Investor Day that spread compression is abating, even if we assume new money rates stayed at first quarter levels of 4%. We estimate that this would depress EPS growth by 2% to 3% versus 4% to 5% in prior years, but still enable us to achieve our target EPS growth rate of 8% to 10%. Given the decline in interest rates since our June Investor Day, we estimate that we are likely to be at or slightly above the top end of this 2% to 3% range, but expect that other levers such as capital and expense management can offset this impact. So bottom line, low rates are manageable and we are hopeful that peers begin to provide comparable disclosures so you all can better compare companies as we believe views on Lincoln are misaligned. 
Now turning to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $235 million compared to $255 million in the prior year quarter. Lower fee income from a 3% decline in average account values is the primary driver of the year-over-year decline. Operating revenues declined 1% from the second quarter of 2015. Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled nearly $0.5 billion, although this organic growth was more than offset by negative market performance. 
Return metrics continue to be strong as ROE came in at 21%, consistent with our long-term average, while the return on assets decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year, but did increase 3 basis points from the first quarter. It stands at 77 basis points.  
Finally, as I noted upfront, our variable annuity hedge program was effective in an extremely volatile quarter, particularly at the end of June, which further demonstrates the high quality of our annuity business. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $31 million, up $1 million from the prior year quarter. Second quarter revenue was flat year-over-year as with average account balances and return on assets. Net flows were modestly positive in the quarter. Nonetheless, our growth outlook remains positive for the second half of the year, which positions us well to increase account values.  Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed to 9 basis points versus the prior-year quarter, near the low end of our expectations. While retirement earnings will fight the headwinds of low interest rates, continued growth in net flows positions us well for long-term earnings growth. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $120 million increase 14% from last year as mortality returned to normal levels following elevated severity in the prior year quarter. As I noted upfront, alternative investment income was $5 million below our expected results for the life business. A full recovery in alternative income would have put life earnings right in line with $125 million quarterly run rate I mentioned on last quarter's conference call. 
Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 5 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our expectation. 
Quickly on life earnings drivers. Average account values increased 3% with total in-force face amount up 4%, consistent with recent performance and our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. So second quarter results on mortality recovered from the prior year and typical first quarter seasonality. While earnings are facing some spread compression, drivers continue to support long-term earnings growth. 
Group Protection earnings of $15 [ph] million were below the $19 [ph] million reported in the prior year quarter, but well above the $5 million reported in the first quarter as that amortization returned to more normal levels as expected. The decline in earnings versus the prior year is due to lower premiums in investment income. Loss ratios continue to benefit from our pricing and claims management actions. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 72.5% this quarter from 73.6% in prior quarter. The year-over-year improvement was driven by favorable loss ratios in all product lines, life, disability and dental. 
Nonmedical earned premiums declined by 11% year-over-year. Lower renewal persistency in sales owing to our repricing initiatives have clearly provided a headwind to growth. However, as Dennis mentioned, we expect premium growth to reemerge next year given positive leading indicators. Notably, sales increased 15% in the second quarter, marking our second straight quarter sales growth, while renewals persistency increased to 76%, a nearly 20 percentage point improvement from the first quarter. As a result, we are confident top line growth will provide the next lever for margin improvement. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. Our capital position remains very strong and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to allocate a significant amount of capital to shareholders. This quarter, we repurchased $275 million of Lincoln shares as we took advantage of our strong balance sheet and shares trading well below book value. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. As I briefly noted upfront, statutory surplus stands at $8.7 billion and their RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%, both very strong numbers and up from the first quarter due to the reinsurance transaction we executed in April. Holding company cash ended the quarter above our target of $500 million. 
So to conclude, we saw our earnings recover to more normal levels following depressed first quarter results, which led to 7% EPS growth compared to the prior year. Lower for longer interest rates are manageable even as the thought rate and the forward curve have moved lower. We are effectively managing G&A in a period of slower revenue growth to drive margin improvement and we remain disciplined yet opportunistic around share buybacks. And given our balance sheet strength, we expect to remain very active. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

I'd make this comment or this note. I think about share buybacks, I think it's best to start from the beginning. And what have we said all along here is that we would expect on an annual basis to distribute 50% to 55% of our operating earnings back to shareholders. That translates, if you do the math and you back up the fact that our dividends run about $250 million a year to roughly $125 million to $150 million a quarter. In addition, as we've talked about sales have come down a little bit, that gives us a little bit of flexibility to boost that number up. And then we can use the strength in our balance sheet to go even a little above that. You saw that this quarter was $275 million for the quarter and I expect that we continue to take that same sort of view as we look forward."

Part of the [indiscernible] speculation, but if you ask me, what do I think the #1 overhang in our stock is today, it is low interest rates, and investor's perception of our low interest rates impact Lincoln primarily around the balance sheet. And that's why we have focused so intently on trying to get the message out to investors how exactly we are impacted by low interest rates in our balance sheet. I reiterated it in my discussion today and we had a full discussion at our most recent Investor Day about the impacts. I think there is a perception among investors that the impacts are larger than we've shown, and so we continue to try to get them as a result. I think, that message would be enhanced if other companies were to have similar disclosures so that there was a full some understanding among investors across the industry. I think, anytime you're out there doing something on your own, some investors will have a tough time moving that way or agree with just 1 company's view of the world. So I think it's always helpful if you can have more companies, and that's why I say that. I think, you will continue to see that as interest rates stay low for a longer period of time.

And let me preface it by saying I'm not going to front run the process. There are lots of people at Lincoln working very hard on this process as we speak. I think, the results that come out of an unlocking are, once again, the same thing I said long for life question, they're very company specific. I think, the primary drivers of the results that come out of these unlocking processes, there are a number of them. But if you ask me to take a couple, I would say this. It has to do with the riskiness of the optionality of the products you have in your balance sheet and it has to do with appointment which you start from an assumption standpoint. When you look at Lincoln, so let's talk about the facts now. When you look at Lincoln, over the last decade, but I'll focus on the last 4 years because that's when we make a number of assumption changes and now I'm focusing on the annuity site. What you see is a very solid result. In fact, if you look at unlocking over the last 4 years in the annuity business, we have had -- our net unlocking impact has been a positive, a number in excess of $100 million. It had a low 1 year of negative 7 [ph] and a high year -- another year at $60 [ph] million, very consistent results. And then if you look inside of of that results, you'll see, there are a number of large assumption changes. We changed [indiscernible] significantly. We changed utilization significantly. But each and every year, there's been a consistent result, no big negatives along the way. That has to do once again, I think, with the fact that our products are designed very well and the people who design these products were very thoughtful when they were putting together the assumptions that we're going to use inside those products. We're not right on every assumption, but in the totality of assumptions affecting, they did a great job and you see that in the results. So that's how we've done. That's just reality, the facts. Now let's look forward. I believe it was -- Will had a good piece of his his presentation, where he focused on if you look at the key assumptions in the annuity business again and you look at what we would expect if you had to take rather dramatic changes in assumptions, what would the impact be? Let's take lapse rates. We have a very low lapse rate embedded in our models, 3.8%. Look, if we had to cut that number in half, the impact that we showed was $50 [ph] million. Once again, very small. The reality is, I think, we have an expectation of 3.8% in our model. Right now, experiences running at about 3.4%, so right in line with where we are. The other big assumption, utilization. If we needed to change our model to 100% effective utilization, complete in total effective utilization, that would be $160 million. Once again, relatively small number. Utilization, by the way, has been running spot on with what's in our model. And the third item is mortality. If mortality was to improve significantly, 20%, I think, is the number that we showed that would have a net impact of $90 million, a very -- mortality, in and of itself, is running in line with our expectations. So we've had great results in annuity business. We don't have any expectation of big negatives going forward based upon where we are today. That's the annuity story. I don't think the story would be any different if you went across our other businesses. For instance, in the life business, if you look at the unlocking results over the past 4 years, 6 years, 10 years, what you're going to see is a pattern of consistency. The life business over the last 4 years, I'll use that same period again, I think, the sum total of the results has been about a negative $100 million and that was all last year when we unlock -- when we lowered our long-term J curve assumption. So, Mike, I think we've had a great history of results. We fully expect to have good results going forward. I go into any unlocking process assuming that we're in a good place because that's been our history. But we'll see. Once again, there are a lot of people doing lots of work out there and I have no reason to have any bad expectations coming into any of this. Regardless of what other companies may be experiencing because it is very specific to each and every company."

And some of that reduction can come from volume, but sometimes, it has to come from corroborating expenses. So we start off by saying we can't have a budget that doesn't show an improvement in your expense ratio. That's an important ongoing management discipline. Now in addition to that, we are looking very hard at digital strategies to further drive down our core expenses. We're on the front end of that. I think, there's meaningful opportunity with process improvement, digitization. And again, we're in the front end of this and it will take time to size and execute. We're also looking at partnerships, where we can -- where others can do things more economically that we can. I think, there's opportunity there as well. What I've been saying internally, if you sort of look at 2 big issues, one is that the foreign digital companies are setting the standard for the relationship between companies and consumers' expectations about ease of doing business. We weren't born digital, but we're taking very decisive step to improve our customer experience. Along with that will come expense savings. Now the second big issue, as we all know and we've been spending time about it on it this morning, is that low interest rates hurt margins. And so you are compelled to have a very aggressive reaction to that and find ways to overcome it. So looking at expenses again, start with our core strengths, expenses aren't going to grow at a faster rate than revenues. And then were looking at additional things, digitization, partners who can do it less expensively, and those things to achieve earnings per share growth. Pretty excited about it actually."

This quarter, we saw significant recovery at 76%. I think, that's reflective of the fact that significant pricing actions that the group team is taking over the last few [ph] years have a little over moved for them. We're out of the significant price increases and you're starting to see that in broker behaviors. So persistency up significantly and we expect that to continue the trend up from where we are today. So when you factor in sales ready to grow again persistency getting back to normal levels, the math just works where the premium level we experience this quarter should be right around the trough and then you level up for a little bit and then you move into 2017, we'd expect that you start to see premiums grew a little bit.

The 1 subtest that becomes the item that generates the potential reserves is 8D. 8D is a test where the earned rate that you use is part of the calculation is defined by an index, an index that is established between July 1 and June 30 of the year preceding the end of the calendar year. So for the end of 2016, the rate has already been defined. It was finalized on June 30. I'm very confident and comfortable that, that index level, we're fine in 2016. As you move into 2017, you're in the middle of the thing that just started setting that index right now. On July 1, you'd be using that index. You'll develop the average index rate over the following 12 months and that's the rate we will use at the end of 2017. So that's mechanically how these things are calculated. I'd given you the potential size of the impacts. Very comfortable seeing if we can manage them, but I can't tell you what those facts are for some other companies. I don't know what their potential impacts are and I can't speak to the capacity to manage those impacts. But for Lincoln, that is how it works, and that is the story."

As we anticipated, second quarter earnings showed a nice recovery following disappointing first quarter results, as operating earnings per share increased 25% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, earnings",1756,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As we anticipated, second quarter earnings showed a nice recovery following disappointing first quarter results, as operating earnings per share increased 25% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, earnings per share increased 7% as our diversified mix of businesses and sources of earnings coupled with capital management actions continue to support solid EPS growth. 
We covered much of our strategy at the June Investor Day, and I would just like to highlight a few points. First, despite persistently low interest rates, we continued to grow EPS and book value per share as we said we would. Randy will comment on income statement and balance sheet impacts from all rates in his remarks. I would just note that we are raising prices on certain products as we proactively respond to lower interest rates consistent with prior years, and we see expense management as a key lever to sustain our targeted EPS growth. Importantly, we have a strong track record of controlling expenses and proved that once again this quarter. 
Next, we have a keen focus on allocating capital towards growth opportunities at attractive returns. That said, where external events are affecting sales levels or returns, we are okay with using the capital intended to support sales growth to buy back our undervalued shares. Lincoln's leading distribution organizations, combined with our manufacturing capabilities, continue to differentiate us from peers. We are driving sales growth right now in our individual life insurance and Group Protection businesses, while innovative product solutions across our annuity and RPS businesses will help sales growth. I'll expand on these in a minute.  
Finally, as we have demonstrated for years, we have a quality balance sheet and generate a significant amount of free cash flow. This has allowed us to actively deploy capital to shareholders, and it continued in the second quarter as we repurchased $275 million of stock. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with annuities. A 3% decrease in average account values resulted in annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, the recent recovery in equity markets led to earnings growth of 8% sequentially and positions us well for subsequent periods. Total annuity sales were $2 billion, and net outflows, $452 million. As you have heard from us as well as other asset management companies, market volatility continues to dampen consumer demand for equity-sensitive products. VA sales are certainly in that camp, though I would note, our sales were largely unchanged compared to the first quarter. 
While sales are lower than we'd like, we are still selling volumes that support our distribution value proposition and are not willing to take aggressive near-term actions to stimulate sales. In the interim, we are comfortable reallocating that capital to share buybacks. 
We are bringing to market several unique product solutions early next year, which capitalize on the growth trends in passive investments and fee-based compensation. These products will meaningfully enhance the value proposition and choice for guaranteed lifetime income, which is an essential solution for retirement savers. 
Our annuity business remains a high-quality source of earnings, and we have produced a long track record of success that is different from others. As we have said, this success is because we started the business the right way and have maintained our consistent and disciplined product pricing, end-to-end risk management and industry-leading distribution. We hope you walked away with those takeaways at our Investor Day, as I continue to believe this business is underappreciated. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We generated strong earnings growth versus the prior year. In terms of sales, total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $164 million, a 6% increase from the prior year quarter. 2/3 of our sales came from products without long-term guarantees, and our sales are well diversified, with all products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Executive Benefit sales, which can be lumpy, contributed $9 million to total life sales this quarter, while the prior year benefited from one large case. 
As you know, we have done across-the-board product repricing over the past several years to reflect lower interest rates. As a result, many of our products are meeting targeted returns, even with today's lower interest rates and flatter forward curve. Where we are not achieving acceptable returns, we will reprice. Bottom line, we are committed to maintaining our risk management and product-pricing discipline to get appropriate returns on capital. When combined with actions focused on in-force block [ph] profitability, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow our Life Insurance business. 
Turning to Group Protection. We are well on our way to restoring the profitability and long-term growth potential of our group business. Our nonmedical loss ratio continues to improve as we benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements to claims management functions. Sales momentum continues as sales increased 15%. This marks another quarter of sales growth, as the market disruption from our aggressive renewal repricing strategy has clearly subsided. 
In addition, as our renewal price increases moderate, we are beginning to see improvement in our renewal persistency. We expect premiums to stabilize in the back half of the year and premium growth to reemerge in 2017. I'm pleased to see the encouraging signs of growth while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. We have the right strategy, people and processes in place, and we are executing extremely well. 
As we have noticed -- noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. I am confident this will be achieved, providing a nice tailwind to earnings and further diversifying Lincoln's sources of earnings mix. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with both the prior year and the prior quarter and in line with expectations. Second quarter deposits of $1.7 billion were down 11% from a year ago, driven by a decline in mid-large market first-year sales due to the timing of implementations. We have a strong pipeline and already-committed new business scheduled for the second half of the year. This growth can be directly attributed to our focused strategy and investments in our digital and mobile customer experience, which is resonating in the marketplace. 
In the small market, first-year sales were up 24% year-over-year, a result of distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity. Looking ahead, we expect this momentum to continue, aided by the recent launch of our enhanced small-market-directed product.
Recurring deposits were also up 3% year-over-year, evidence that our high-touch model continues to differentiate us and drive higher contributions and participation rates. Our overall sales momentum leads us to remain confident that 2016's net flows will exceed 2015 levels.
Shifting to investment results. Disciplined ALM and risk management continue to drive our investment strategy. We put new money to work in the second quarter at an average yield of 3.8%, which was down 20 basis points from the first quarter. The decrease in new money rates was primarily due to a drop in treasury rates as we invested at 205 basis points over the average 10-year treasury, consistent with recent periods. The decline in interest rates also increased our net unrealized gain to $8.4 billion pretax, up from $5.5 billion in the first quarter. It is also worth noting that our energy portfolio, which has been an area of investor focus this year, swung to a net unrealized gain in the second quarter, with values increasing by $600 million from the first quarter. 
Downgrades have also slowed, and as a result, our below-investment-grade exposure decreased to 5.5%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first quarter. 
Lastly, the annualized return on our alternative investments was nearly 6% in the second quarter, a significant improvement from the first quarter; however, still below our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the sequential improvement. We expect further earnings growth over time as we achieve our targeted return, modestly increase our exposure to alternatives and shift the mix towards private equity. 
Turning to distribution, which, as many of you recognize, truly differentiates Lincoln. Our wholesale, retail and worksite distribution organizations have been instrumental in driving our strategies and delivering on our consistent market presence. The strength and stability of over 90,000 active producers creates opportunities and enables our ability to target the faster-growing segments. During the quarter, we saw a strong producer growth across a number of our products, including MoneyGuard, fixed annuity, term and RPS, and more advisers are selling multiple products, underscoring the power of our distribution franchise in combination with a diverse product portfolio. We are executing on a diversification strategy at an enterprise level. No one product accounted for more than 14% of sales during the quarter, and long-term guarantees sale were 73% of our total sales, up from 69% a year ago -- no, let me say that again, and non-long-term guarantee sales were 73% of our total sales, up from 69% a year ago. As manufacturing and distribution collaborate on existing new product innovations, I am confident that Lincoln will continue to differentiate itself in the marketplace. 
On the DOL. There's not much new to discuss since our investment day, but it is important to reemphasize that our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the BIC to serve retirement savers and offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is leading to greater interest in our fee-based annuity product offering by distribution partners and advisers. At Lincoln, we continue to take a leadership role in working with the DOL and our distribution partners to be sure we are prepared for when the first part of the rule goes live in April 2017. 
Lastly, as you recently saw, Mark Konen announced his decision to retire. I want to personally thank Mark for his partnership and leadership over the years and wish him the best in retirement. He has recruited a very strong management team, and by having Mark stay onboard through the end of February 2017, I am confident there will be a smooth transition. 
So in closing, I'm pleased that our earnings returned to levels you have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, let me reiterate that I remain confident in our ability to generate top and bottom line growth and actively deploy capital. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $373 million or $1.56 per share for the second quarter, a 7% increase from the prior year.

Last night, we reported income from operations of $373 million or $1.56 per share for the second quarter, a 7% increase from the prior year. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our first quarter results, including accelerated amortization of DAC in group, adverse mortality in individual life and weak fee-based earnings, returned to expected levels. It is also worth noting that while alternative investment income improved significantly from the first quarter, returns were still below our expected results by roughly $7 million or $0.03 per share, with $5 million of the shortfall hitting the life business. As an offset, expenses were favorable by a similar amount in the quarter, primarily in other operations. 
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $54.67 as we continue to consistently compound book value in the high single-digit range. Operating ROE remains strong at 11.7%, unchanged from the prior year. Expense discipline beyond some of the favorability I noted upfront resulted in our expense ratio declining by 50 basis points. This reflects our ability to effectively manage the G&A in a period of slower revenue growth. We expect expenses to continue to be a good story. Net flows contributed $0.5 billion to account values, and with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we enter the third quarter with a modest tailwind. 
Finally, our balance sheet strength and capital generation enabled us to repurchase $275 million of stock this quarter, retiring 2.6% of our shares outstanding, the most since the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Net income results for the quarter included $47 million of realized losses related to investments, while our variable annuity hedge program was effective, with a minimal breakage in what was a volatile quarter for the capital markets. 
Before shifting to segment highlights, I would like to comment on the current interest rate environment. The punch line is that we remain well positioned even as rates in the forward curve have moved lower. 
Let's start by talking about the balance sheet, because that is what comes up most with investors. Recall, at our June Investor Day, we noted we had sufficiency in our overall cash flow testing, including stretching the 10-year treasury down to 50 basis points forever. The one area we pointed to where there could be some temporary reserve strengthening is around certain secondary guarantee Universal life subtests. For instance, if the 10-year treasury stayed at 1%, that could require up to $350 million or 20 percentage points of RBC, a very manageable impact when you think about Lincoln having $8.7 billion of statutory capital and an RBC ratio of 500% at the end of the second quarter. 
Now thinking about the other 2 areas that lower rates impact life insurers, that being new business and spread compression. First, on the impact on new business returns. Most of our products continue to achieve our targeted returns, but as Dennis noted, we will make changes where necessary to achieve acceptable returns. 
Next, on spread compression, which has been with us for a while now. We showed in the Investor Day that spread compression is abating, even if we assume the new money rates stayed at first quarter levels of 4%. We estimate that this would depress EPS growth by 2% to 3% versus 4% to 5% in prior years but still enable us to achieve our target EPS growth rate of 8% to 10%. Given the decline in interest rates since our June Investor Day, we estimate that we are likely to be at or slightly above the top end of this 2% to 3% range, but expect that other levers such as capital and expense management can offset this impact. So bottom line, low rates are manageable, and we are hopeful that peers begin to provide comparable disclosures so you all can better compare companies, as we believe views on Lincoln are misaligned. 
Now turning to segment results, and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $235 million compared to $255 million in the prior year quarter. Lower fee income from a 3% decline in average account values is the primary driver of the year-over-year decline. Operating revenues declined 1% from the second quarter of 2015. Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled nearly $0.5 billion, however, this organic growth was more than offset by negative market performance. 
Return metrics continued to be strong as ROE came in at 21%, consistent with our long-term average, while return on assets decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year but did increase 3 basis points from the first quarter, stands at 77 basis points.  
Finally, as I noted upfront, our variable annuity hedge program was effective in an extremely volatile quarter, particularly at the end of June, which further demonstrates the high quality of our annuity business. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $31 million, up $1 million from the prior year quarter. Second quarter revenue was flat year-over-year, as was average account balances and return on assets. Net flows were modestly positive in the quarter. Nonetheless, our growth outlook remains positive for the second half of the year, which positions us well to increase account values.  Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 9 basis points versus the prior year quarter, near the low end of our expectation. While retirement earnings will fight the headwinds of low interest rates, continued growth in net flows positions us well for long-term earnings growth. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $120 million increased 14% from last year as mortality returned to normal levels following elevated severity in the prior year quarter. As I noted upfront, alternative investment income was $5 million below our expected results for the life business. A full recovery in alternative income would have put our life earnings right in line with the $125 million quarterly run rate I mentioned on last quarter's conference call. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 5 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our expectation. 
Quickly on life earnings drivers. Average account values increased 3%, with total in-force face amount up 4%, consistent with recent performance and our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. So second quarter results on mortality recovered from the prior year and typical first quarter seasonality. While earnings are facing some spread compression, drivers continue to support long-term earnings growth. 
Group Protection earnings of $15 million were below the $19 million reported in the prior year quarter, but well above the $5 million reported in the first quarter, as DAC amortization returned to more normal levels, as expected. The decline in earnings versus the prior year is due to lower premiums and investment income. Loss ratios continued to benefit from our pricing and claims management actions. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 72.5% this quarter from 73.6% in prior year quarter. The year-over-year improvement was driven by favorable loss ratios in all product lines: life, disability and dental. 
Nonmedical earned premiums declined by 11% year-over-year. Lower renewal persistency in sales owing to our repricing initiatives have clearly provided a headwind to growth. However, as Dennis mentioned, we expect premium growth to reemerge next year, given positive leading indicators. Notably, sales increased 15% in the second quarter, marking our second straight quarter of sales growth, while renewal persistency increased to 76%, a nearly 20 percentage point improvement from the first quarter. As a result, we are confident top line growth will provide the next lever for margin improvement. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. Our capital position remains very strong, and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to allocate a significant amount of capital to shareholders. This quarter, we repurchased $275 million of Lincoln shares as we took advantage of our strong balance sheet and shares trading well below book value. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. As I briefly noted upfront, statutory surplus stands at $8.7 billion, and our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%, both very strong numbers and up from the first quarter due to the reinsurance transaction we executed in April. Holding company cash ended the quarter above our target of $500 million. 
So to conclude, we saw our earnings power recover to more normal levels following depressed first quarter results, which led to 7% EPS growth compared to the prior year. Lower-for-longer interest rates are manageable even as the spot rate and the forward curve have moved lower. We are effectively managing G&A in a period of slower revenue growth to drive margin improvement, and we remain disciplined yet opportunistic around share buybacks. And given our balance sheet strength, we expect to remain very active. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

And so those are the kind of actions that we're taking, and we think that they will have a significant impact on sales as we get into 2017.

I'd make this comment or this note. I think about share buybacks, and I think that it's best to start from the beginning. And what have we said all along here is that we would expect, on an annual basis, to distribute 50% to 55% of our operating earnings back to shareholders. That translates, if you do the math and you back up the fact that our dividends run about $250 million a year, to roughly $125 million to $150 million a quarter. In addition, as we've talked about, sales have come down a little bit, and that gives us a little bit of flexibility to boost that number up. And then we can use the strength in our balance sheet to go even a little above that. You saw that this quarter was $275 million for the quarter, and I'd expect that we'd continue to take that same sort of view as we look forward."

We've increased our dividend significantly, reflective of our confidence. I would expect, obviously, it's a decision of the board, but that we would continue to increase that dividend.

Part of this, you have to give to speculation. But if you asked me what do I think the #1 overhang on our stock is today, it is low interest rates and investors' perception of how interest rates impact Lincoln primarily around the balance sheet. And that's why we have focused so intently on trying to get the message out to investors how exactly we are impacted by low interest rates in our balance sheet. I reiterated it in my discussion today, and we had a very fulsome discussion at our most recent Investor Day about the impacts. And I think there is a perception among investors that the impacts are larger than we've shown, and so we continue to try to get that message out there. I think that message would be enhanced if other companies were to have similar disclosures so that there was a more fulsome understanding among investors across the industry. I think, anytime you're out there doing something on your own, some investors will have a tough time moving that way or agreeing with just one company's view of the world. So I think it's always helpful if you can have more companies, and that's why I say that. I think you will continue to see that as interest rates stay low for a longer period of time. I think, we'll continue to see the companies expand the disclosures around this area, and I think it'll be beneficial."

There are lots of people at Lincoln working very hard on this process as we speak. I think the results that come out of an unlocking are, once again, the same thing I said for the last question, but they're very company-specific. I think the primary drivers of the results that come out of these unlocking processes, there are a number of them, but if you had asked me to pick a couple, I would say this. It has to do with the riskiness of the optionality of the products you have in your balance sheet and it has to do with the point at which you start from an assumption standpoint. When you look at Lincoln -- so let's talk about the facts now. When you look at Lincoln over the last decade, but I'll focus on the last 4 years because that's when we've made a number of assumption changes and now I'm focusing in on the annuities side, what you see is a very solid result. In fact, if you look at unlocking over the last 4 years in the annuity business, we have had -- our -- the net unlocking impact has been a positive, a number in excess of $100 million. It had a low 1 year of negative $7 million and a high year -- another year of $60 million, very consistent results. And then if you looked inside of that result, you would see that there were a number of large assumption changes. We changed lapses significantly. We changed utilization significantly. But each and every year, there's been a consistent result, no big negatives along the way. That has to do with -- once again, I think, with the fact that our products are designed very well and the people who design these products were very thoughtful when they were putting together the assumptions that we're going to use inside those products. They were not right on every assumption, but when -- in the totality of assumption-setting, they did a great job, and you see that in the results. So that's how we've done. That's just the reality of the facts. Now let's look forward. I believe it was Will who had a good piece of his presentation where he focused on, if you look at the key assumptions in the annuity business again and you look at what we would expect if you had to take rather dramatic changes in those assumptions, what would the impact be? Let's take lapse rates. We have a very low lapse rate embedded in our models, 3.8%. Look, if we had to cut that number in half, the impact that we showed was $50 million. Once again, very small. The reality is, I think, we have an expectation of 3.8% in our model. Right now, experiences have been running about 3.4%, so right -- sort of right in line with where we are. The other big assumption, utilization. If we needed to change our model to 100% effective utilization, complete in total effective utilization, that would be $160 million. Once again, a relatively small number. Utilization, by the way, has been running spot on with what's in our model. And the third item is mortality. If mortality was to improve significantly, 20%, I think is the number that we showed, that would have a net impact of $90 million. A very -- mortality, in and of itself, is running right in line with our expectations. So we've had great results in annuity business. We don't have any expectation of big negatives going forward based upon where we are today. That's the annuity story. I don't think the story would be any different if you went across our other businesses. For instance, in the life business, if you look at the unlocking results over the past 4 years, 6 years, 10 years, what you're going to see is a pattern of consistency. The life business over the last 4 years, I'll use that same period again, I think, the sum total of the results has been about a negative $100 million, and that was all last year when we unlocked -- when we lowered our long-term J curve assumption. So Mike, I think we've had a great history of results. We fully expect to have good results going forward. I go into any unlocking process assuming that we're in a good place because that's been our history. But we'll see. Once again, there are lots of people doing lots of work out there, so I have no reason to have any bad expectation coming into any of this, regardless of what other companies may be experiencing because it is very factor-specific [ph] to each and every company."

And some of that reduction can come from volume, but sometimes, it has to come from core operating expenses. So we start off by saying you can't have a budget that doesn't show an improvement in your expense ratio. That's an important ongoing management discipline. Now in addition to that, we are looking very hard at digital strategies to further drive down our core expenses. We're on the front end of that. I think there's meaningful opportunity with process improvement and digitization. And again, we're in the front end of this, and it will take time to size and execute. We're also looking at partnerships where we can -- where others can do things more economically than we can. I think there's opportunity there as well. What I've been saying internally, if you sort of look at 2 big issues, one is that those born digital companies are setting the standard for the relationship between companies' and consumers' expectations about ease of doing business. We weren't born digital, but we're taking very decisive steps to improve our customer experience. Along with that will come expense savings. The second big issue, as we all know and we've been spending time about it -- on it this morning, is that low interest rates hurt margins. And so you are compelled to have a very aggressive reaction to that and find ways to overcome it. So looking at expenses again, start with our core strength, expenses aren't going to grow at a faster rate than revenues. And then we're looking at additional things, digitization, partners who can do it less expensively and those things to achieve earnings per share growth. Pretty excited about it, actually."

This quarter, we saw significant recovery at 76%. I think that's reflective of the fact that significant pricing actions that the group team has taken over the last few years have -- a little removed for them. We're out of the significant price increases, and you're starting to see that in broker behaviors. So persistency up significantly, and we'd expect it to continue to trend up from where we are today. So when you factor in sales ready starting to grow again, persistency getting back to normal levels, the math just works where the premium level we experienced this quarter should be right around the trough, and then you level up for a little bit. And then as you move into 2017, we'd expect that you'd start to see premiums grow a little bit. Ultimately, we'd like to get premium growth back to that mid-single-digit area."

As I mentioned, for us, in the case of these subtests, you're talking about $350 million with a treasury -- 10-year treasury at 1%. That compares to a balance sheet that has a total capacity of $8.7 billion of capital, 500% RBC ratio. Now if the potential size of that impact was much bigger and the amount of capacity, the amount of cap that you have under your balance sheet [indiscernible] that impact was smaller, then you would have to think about where is that capital going to come from to maintain all of the other things I want to do as a company? The ratings, et cetera. So it's about the size of the potential impact compared to the -- your capacity to manage that impact. What I have said, I've given you the potential size of the impacts, and I've stated that our balance sheet is very strong, and we feel very comfortable saying that we have the capacity to manage those potential impacts of those subtests. Now specifically, what are these subtests? They have the generic names, HD and 8D. They are tests of particular books of business for us. The one subtest that becomes the item that generates the potential reserves is 8D. 8D is a test where the earned rate that you use as part of the calculation is defined by an index, an index that is established between July 1 and June 30 of the year preceding the end of the calendar year. So for the end of 2016, the rate has already been defined. It was finalized on June 30. I'm very confident and comfortable that, that index level, we're fine in 2016. As you move into 2017, you're in the middle of setting that -- or you just started setting that index right now. On July 1, you'd be using that index. You'll develop the average index rate over the following 12 months, and that's the rate we will use at the end of 2017. So that's mechanically how these things are calculated. Given you -- I've given you the potential size of the impacts, very comfortable saying we can manage them, but I can't tell you what those facts are for some other company. And I don't know what their potential impacts are and I can't speak to their capacity to manage those impacts. But for Lincoln, that is how it works, and that is the story."

As we anticipated, second quarter earnings showed a nice recovery following disappointing first quarter results, as operating earnings per share increased 25% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, earnings",1758,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As we anticipated, second quarter earnings showed a nice recovery following disappointing first quarter results, as operating earnings per share increased 25% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, earnings per share increased 7% as our diversified mix of businesses and sources of earnings coupled with capital management actions continue to support solid EPS growth. 
We covered much of our strategy at the June Investor Day, and I would just like to highlight a few points. First, despite persistently low interest rates, we continued to grow EPS and book value per share as we said we would. Randy will comment on income statement and balance sheet impacts from all rates in his remarks. I would just note that we are raising prices on certain products as we proactively respond to lower interest rates consistent with prior years, and we see expense management as a key lever to sustain our targeted EPS growth. Importantly, we have a strong track record of controlling expenses and proved that once again this quarter. 
Next, we have a keen focus on allocating capital towards growth opportunities at attractive returns. That said, where external events are affecting sales levels or returns, we are okay with using the capital intended to support sales growth to buy back our undervalued shares. Lincoln's leading distribution organizations, combined with our manufacturing capabilities, continue to differentiate us from peers. We are driving sales growth right now in our individual life insurance and Group Protection businesses, while innovative product solutions across our annuity and RPS businesses will help sales growth. I'll expand on these in a minute.  
Finally, as we have demonstrated for years, we have a quality balance sheet and generate a significant amount of free cash flow. This has allowed us to actively deploy capital to shareholders, and it continued in the second quarter as we repurchased $275 million of stock. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with annuities. A 3% decrease in average account values resulted in annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, the recent recovery in equity markets led to earnings growth of 8% sequentially and positions us well for subsequent periods. Total annuity sales were $2 billion, and net outflows, $452 million. As you have heard from us as well as other asset management companies, market volatility continues to dampen consumer demand for equity-sensitive products. VA sales are certainly in that camp, though, I would note, our sales were largely unchanged compared to the first quarter. 
While sales are lower than we'd like, we are still selling volumes that support our distribution value proposition and are not willing to take aggressive near-term actions to stimulate sales. In the interim, we are comfortable reallocating that capital to share buybacks. 
We are bringing to market several unique product solutions early next year which capitalize on the growth trends in passive investments and fee-based compensation. These products will meaningfully enhance the value proposition and choice for guaranteed lifetime income, which is an essential solution for retirement savers. 
Our annuity business remains a high-quality source of earnings, and we have produced a long track record of success that is different from others. As we have said, this success is because we started the business the right way and have maintained our consistent and disciplined product pricing, end-to-end risk management and industry-leading distribution. We hope you walked away with those takeaways at our Investor Day, as I continue to believe this business is underappreciated. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We generated strong earnings growth versus the prior year. In terms of sales, total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $164 million, a 6% increase from the prior year quarter. 2/3 of our sales came from products without long-term guarantees, and our sales are well diversified, with all products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Executive Benefit sales, which can be lumpy, contributed $9 million to total life sales this quarter, while the prior year benefited from one large case. 
As you know, we have done across-the-board product repricing over the past several years to reflect lower interest rates. As a result, many of our products are meeting targeted returns, even with today's lower interest rates and flatter forward curve. Where we are not achieving acceptable returns, we will reprice. Bottom line, we are committed to maintaining our risk management and product-pricing discipline to get appropriate returns on capital. When combined with actions focused on in-force block [ph] profitability, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow our Life Insurance business. 
Turning to Group Protection. We are well on our way to restoring the profitability and long-term growth potential of our group business. Our nonmedical loss ratio continues to improve as we benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements to claims management functions. Sales momentum continues as sales increased 15%. This marks another quarter of sales growth, as the market disruption from our aggressive renewal repricing strategy has clearly subsided. 
In addition, as our renewal price increases moderate, we are beginning to see improvement in our renewal persistency. We expect premiums to stabilize in the back half of the year and premium growth to reemerge in 2017. I'm pleased to see the encouraging signs of growth while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. We have the right strategy, people and processes in place, and we are executing extremely well. 
As we have noticed -- noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. I am confident this will be achieved, providing a nice tailwind to earnings and further diversifying Lincoln's sources of earnings mix. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with both the prior year and the prior quarter and in line with expectations. Second quarter deposits of $1.7 billion were down 11% from a year ago, driven by a decline in mid-large market first-year sales due to the timing of implementations. We have a strong pipeline and already-committed new business scheduled for the second half of the year. This growth can be directly attributed to our focused strategy and investments in our digital and mobile customer experience, which is resonating in the marketplace. 
In the small market, first-year sales were up 24% year-over-year, a result of distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity. Looking ahead, we expect this momentum to continue, aided by the recent launch of our enhanced small-market Director product.
Recurring deposits were also up 3% year-over-year, evidence that our high-touch model continues to differentiate us and drive higher contributions and participation rates. Our overall sales momentum leads us to remain confident that 2016's net flows will exceed 2015 levels.
Shifting to investment results. Disciplined ALM and risk management continue to drive our investment strategy. We put new money to work in the second quarter at an average yield of 3.8%, which was down 20 basis points from the first quarter. The decrease in new money rates was primarily due to a drop in treasury rates as we invested at 205 basis points over the average 10-year treasury, consistent with recent periods. The decline in interest rates also increased our net unrealized gain to $8.4 billion pretax, up from $5.5 billion in the first quarter. It is also worth noting that our energy portfolio, which has been an area of investor focus this year, swung to a net unrealized gain in the second quarter, with values increasing by $600 million from the first quarter. 
Downgrades have also slowed, and as a result, our below-investment-grade exposure decreased to 5.5%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first quarter. 
Lastly, the annualized return on our alternative investments was nearly 6% in the second quarter, a significant improvement from the first quarter; however, still below our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the sequential improvement. We expect further earnings growth over time as we achieve our targeted return, modestly increase our exposure to alternatives and shift the mix towards private equity. 
Turning to distribution, which, as many of you recognize, truly differentiates Lincoln. Our wholesale, retail and worksite distribution organizations have been instrumental in driving our strategies and delivering on our consistent market presence. The strength and stability of over 90,000 active producers creates opportunities and enables our ability to target the faster-growing segments. During the quarter, we saw a strong producer growth across a number of our products, including MoneyGuard, fixed annuity, term and RPS, and more advisers are selling multiple products, underscoring the power of our distribution franchise in combination with a diverse product portfolio. We are executing on a diversification strategy at an enterprise level. No one product accounted for more than 14% of sales during the quarter, and long-term guarantee sale were 73% of our total sales, up from 69% a year ago -- no, let me say that again, and non-long-term guarantee sales were 73% of our total sales, up from 69% a year ago. As manufacturing and distribution collaborate on existing new product innovations, I am confident that Lincoln will continue to differentiate itself in the marketplace. 
On the DOL. There's not much new to discuss since our investment day, but it is important to reemphasize that our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the BIC to serve retirement savers and offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is leading to greater interest in our fee-based annuity product offering by distribution partners and advisers. At Lincoln, we continue to take a leadership role in working with the DOL and our distribution partners to be sure we are prepared for when the first part of the rule goes live in April 2017. 
Lastly, as you recently saw, Mark Konen announced his decision to retire. I want to personally thank Mark for his partnership and leadership over the years and wish him the best in retirement. He has recruited a very strong management team, and by having Mark stay on board through the end of February 2017, I am confident there will be a smooth transition. 
So in closing, I'm pleased that our earnings returned to levels you have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, let me reiterate that I remain confident in our ability to generate top and bottom line growth and actively deploy capital. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $373 million or $1.56 per share for the second quarter, a 7% increase from the prior year.

Last night, we reported income from operations of $373 million or $1.56 per share for the second quarter, a 7% increase from the prior year. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our first quarter results, including accelerated amortization of DAC in group, adverse mortality in individual life and weak fee-based earnings, returned to expected levels. It is also worth noting that while alternative investment income improved significantly from the first quarter, returns were still below our expected results by roughly $7 million or $0.03 per share, with $5 million of the shortfall hitting the life business. As an offset, expenses were favorable by a similar amount in the quarter, primarily in other operations. 
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $54.67 as we continue to consistently compound book value in the high single-digit range. Operating ROE remains strong at 11.7%, unchanged from the prior year. Expense discipline beyond some of the favorability I noted upfront resulted in our expense ratio declining by 50 basis points. This reflects our ability to effectively manage the G&A in a period of slower revenue growth. We expect expenses to continue to be a good story. Net flows contributed $0.5 billion to account values, and with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we enter the third quarter with a modest tailwind. 
Finally, our balance sheet strength and capital generation enabled us to repurchase $275 million of stock this quarter, retiring 2.6% of our shares outstanding, the most since the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Net income results for the quarter included $47 million of realized losses related to investments, while our variable annuity hedge program was effective, with a minimal breakage in what was a volatile quarter for the capital markets. 
Before shifting to segment highlights, I would like to comment on the current interest rate environment. The punch line is that we remain well positioned even as rates in the forward curve have moved lower. 
Let's start by talking about the balance sheet, because that is what comes up most with investors. Recall, at our June Investor Day, we noted we had sufficiency in our overall cash flow testing, including stretching the 10-year treasury down to 50 basis points forever. The one area we pointed to where there could be some temporary reserve strengthening is around certain secondary guarantee Universal life subtests. For instance, if the 10-year treasury stayed at 1%, that could require up to $350 million or 20 percentage points of RBC, a very manageable impact when you think about Lincoln having $8.7 billion of statutory capital and an RBC ratio of 500% at the end of the second quarter. 
Now thinking about the other 2 areas that lower rates impact life insurers, that being new business and spread compression. First, on the impact on new business returns. Most of our products continue to achieve our targeted returns, but as Dennis noted, we will make changes where necessary to achieve acceptable returns. 
Next, on spread compression, which has been with us for a while now. We showed in the Investor Day that spread compression is abating, even if we assume the new money rates stayed at first quarter levels of 4%. We estimate that this would depress EPS growth by 2% to 3% versus 4% to 5% in prior years but still enable us to achieve our target EPS growth rate of 8% to 10%. Given the decline in interest rates since our June Investor Day, we estimate that we are likely to be at or slightly above the top end of this 2% to 3% range, but expect that other levers such as capital and expense management can offset this impact. So bottom line, low rates are manageable, and we are hopeful that peers begin to provide comparable disclosures so you all can better compare companies, as we believe views on Lincoln are misaligned. 
Now turning to segment results, and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $235 million compared to $255 million in the prior year quarter. Lower fee income from a 3% decline in average account values is the primary driver of the year-over-year decline. Operating revenues declined 1% from the second quarter of 2015. Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled nearly $0.5 billion, however, this organic growth was more than offset by negative market performance. 
Return metrics continued to be strong as ROE came in at 21%, consistent with our long-term average, while return on assets decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year but did increase 3 basis points from the first quarter, stands at 77 basis points.  
Finally, as I noted upfront, our variable annuity hedge program was effective in an extremely volatile quarter, particularly at the end of June, which further demonstrates the high quality of our annuity business. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $31 million, up $1 million from the prior year quarter. Second quarter revenue was flat year-over-year, as was average account balances and return on assets. Net flows were modestly positive in the quarter. Nonetheless, our growth outlook remains positive for the second half of the year, which positions us well to increase account values.  Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 9 basis points versus the prior year quarter, near the low end of our expectation. While retirement earnings will fight the headwinds of low interest rates, continued growth in net flows positions us well for long-term earnings growth. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $120 million increased 14% from last year as mortality returned to normal levels following elevated severity in the prior year quarter. As I noted upfront, alternative investment income was $5 million below our expected results for the life business. A full recovery in alternative income would have put our life earnings right in line with the $125 million quarterly run rate I mentioned on last quarter's conference call. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 5 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our expectation. 
Quickly on life earnings drivers. Average account values increased 3%, with total in-force face amount up 4%, consistent with recent performance and our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. So second quarter results on mortality recovered from the prior year and typical first quarter seasonality. While earnings are facing some spread compression, drivers continue to support long-term earnings growth. 
Group Protection earnings of $15 million were below the $19 million reported in the prior year quarter, but well above the $5 million reported in the first quarter, as DAC amortization returned to more normal levels, as expected. The decline in earnings versus the prior year is due to lower premiums and investment income. Loss ratios continued to benefit from our pricing and claims management actions. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 72.5% this quarter from 73.6% in prior year quarter. The year-over-year improvement was driven by favorable loss ratios in all product lines: life, disability and dental. 
Nonmedical earned premiums declined by 11% year-over-year. Lower renewal persistency in sales owing to our repricing initiatives have clearly provided a headwind to growth. However, as Dennis mentioned, we expect premium growth to reemerge next year, given positive leading indicators. Notably, sales increased 15% in the second quarter, marking our second straight quarter of sales growth, while renewal persistency increased to 76%, a nearly 20 percentage point improvement from the first quarter. As a result, we are confident top line growth will provide the next lever for margin improvement. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. Our capital position remains very strong, and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to allocate a significant amount of capital to shareholders. This quarter, we repurchased $275 million of Lincoln shares as we took advantage of our strong balance sheet and shares trading well below book value. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. As I briefly noted upfront, statutory surplus stands at $8.7 billion, and our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%, both very strong numbers and up from the first quarter due to the reinsurance transaction we executed in April. Holding company cash ended the quarter above our target of $500 million. 
So to conclude, we saw our earnings power recover to more normal levels following depressed first quarter results, which led to 7% EPS growth compared to the prior year. Lower-for-longer interest rates are manageable even as the spot rate and the forward curve have moved lower. We are effectively managing G&A in a period of slower revenue growth to drive margin improvement, and we remain disciplined yet opportunistic around share buybacks. And given our balance sheet strength, we expect to remain very active. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

The response to that, that I also mentioned in my remarks, is that we do want to create some innovative products, not products that necessarily have richer benefits. I think the whole industry would be reluctant to do that right now because low interest rates really limit your flexibility on that. But we see real growth opportunities in expanding our products that are sold with fees. We see real opportunities that's a consumer and an adviser preference. We also see opportunities to improve our offerings of asset investment options. We also see the opportunity to use digitization in making the sales process more easy and intuitive, products simpler.

I'd make this comment or this note. I think about share buybacks, and I think that it's best to start from the beginning. And what have we said all along here is that we would expect, on an annual basis, to distribute 50% to 55% of our operating earnings back to shareholders. That translates, if you do the math and you back up the fact that our dividends run about $250 million a year, to roughly $125 million to $150 million a quarter. In addition, as we've talked about, sales have come down a little bit, and that gives us a little bit of flexibility to boost that number up. And then we can use the strength in our balance sheet to go even a little above that. You saw that this quarter was $275 million for the quarter, and I'd expect that we'd continue to take that same sort of view as we look forward."

We've increased our dividend significantly, reflective of our confidence. I would expect, obviously, it's a decision of the board, but that we would continue to increase that dividend.

Part of this, you have to give to speculation. But if you asked me what do I think the #1 overhang on our stock is today, it is low interest rates and investors' perception of how interest rates impact Lincoln, primarily around the balance sheet. And that's why we have focused so intently on trying to get the message out to investors how exactly we are impacted by low interest rates in our balance sheet. I reiterated it in my discussion today, and we had a very fulsome discussion at our most recent Investor Day about the impacts. And I think there is a perception among investors that the impacts are larger than we've shown, and so we continue to try to get that message out there. I think that message would be enhanced if other companies were to have similar disclosures so that there was a more fulsome understanding among investors across the industry. I think anytime you're out there doing something on your own, some investors will have a tough time moving that way or agreeing with just one company's view of the world. So I think it's always helpful if you can have more companies, and that's why I say that. I think you will continue to see that as interest rates stay low for a longer period of time. I think we'll continue to see the companies expand the disclosures around this area, and I think it'll be beneficial."

There are lots of people at Lincoln working very hard on this process as we speak. I think the results that come out of an unlocking are, once again, the same thing I said for the last question, but they're very company-specific. I think the primary drivers of the results that come out of these unlocking processes, there are a number of them, but if you had asked me to pick a couple, I would say this. It has to do with the riskiness of the optionality of the products you have on your balance sheet and it has to do with the point at which you start from an assumption standpoint. When you look at Lincoln -- so let's talk about the facts now. When you look at Lincoln over the last decade, but I'll focus on the last 4 years, because that's when we've made a number of assumption changes and now I'm focusing in on the annuities side, what you see is a very solid result. In fact, if you look at unlocking over the last 4 years in the annuity business, we have had -- our -- the net unlocking impact has been a positive, a number in excess of $100 million. It had a low 1 year of negative $7 million and a high year -- another year of $60 million, very consistent results. And then if you looked inside of that result, you would see that there were a number of large assumption changes. We changed lapses significantly. We changed utilization significantly. But each and every year, there's been a consistent result, no big negatives along the way. That has to do, once again, I think, with the fact that our products are designed very well and the people who design these products were very thoughtful when they were putting together the assumptions that we were going to use inside those products. They were not right on every assumption, but when -- in the totality of assumption-setting, they did a great job, and you see that in the results. So that's how we've done. That's just the reality of the facts. Now let's look forward. I believe it was Will who had a good piece of his presentation where he focused on, if you look at the key assumptions in the annuity business again and you look at what we would expect if you had to take rather dramatic changes in those assumptions, what would the impact be? Let's take lapse rates. We have a very low lapse rate embedded in our models, 3.8%. Look, if we had to cut that number in half, the impact that we showed was $50 million. Once again, very small. The reality is, I think, we have an expectation of 3.8% in our model. Right now, experiences have been running about 3.4%, so right in line with where we are. The other big assumption, utilization. If we needed to change our model to 100% effective utilization, complete and total effective utilization, that would be $160 million. Once again, a relatively small number. Utilization, by the way, has been running spot on with what's in our model. And the third item is mortality. If mortality was to improve significantly, 20%, I think is the number that we showed, that would have a net impact of $90 million. A very -- mortality, in and of itself, is running right in line with our expectations. So we've had great results in annuity business. We don't have any expectation of big negatives going forward based upon where we are today. That's the annuity story. I don't think the story would be any different if you went across our other businesses. For instance, in the life business, if you look at the unlocking results over the past 4 years, 6 years, 10 years, what you're going to see is a pattern of consistency. The life business over the last 4 years, I'll use that same period again, I think, the sum total of the results has been about a negative $100 million, and that was all last year when we unlocked -- when we lowered our long-term J curve assumption. So, Mike, I think we've had a great history of results. We fully expect to have good results going forward. I go into any unlocking process assuming that we're in a good place because that's been our history. But we'll see. Once again, there are lots of people doing lots of work out there, so I have no reason to have any bad expectation coming into any of this, regardless of what other companies may be experiencing, because it is very fact-specific to each and every company."

And",328,"Yes, let me start with our sort of overarching expense management tactic or starting point, and that is we're very disciplined during the budgeting process that our expense growth in a budget is no -- is 1% to 2% less than that year's revenue growth. And some of that reduction can come from volume, but sometimes it has to come from core operating expenses. So we start off by saying you can't have a budget that doesn't show an improvement in your expense ratio. That's an important ongoing management discipline. Now in addition to that, we are looking very hard at digital strategies to further drive down our core expenses. We're on the front end of that. I think there's meaningful opportunity with process improvement and digitization. And again, we're in the front end of this, and it will take time to size and execute. We're also looking at partnerships where we can -- where others can do things more economically than we can. I think there's opportunity there as well. What I've been saying internally, if you sort of look at 2 big issues, one is that those born digital companies are setting the standard for the relationship between companies' and consumers' expectations about ease of doing business. We weren't born digital, but we're taking very decisive steps to improve our customer experience. Along with that will come expense savings. The second big issue, as we all know and we've been spending time about it -- on it this morning, is that low interest rates hurt margins. And so you are compelled to have a very aggressive reaction to that and find ways to overcome it. So looking at expenses again, start with our core strength of expenses aren't going to grow at a faster rate than revenues. And then we're looking at additional things, digitization, partners who can do it less expensively and those things to achieve earnings per share growth. Pretty excited about it, actually."

This quarter, we saw significant recovery at 76%. I think that's reflective of the fact that significant pricing actions that the group team has taken over the last few years have -- we're a little removed for them. We're out of the significant price increases, and you're starting to see that in broker behaviors. So persistency up significantly, and we'd expect it to continue to trend up from where we are today. So when you factor in sales starting to grow again, persistency getting back to normal levels, the math just works where the premium level we experienced this quarter should be right around the trough, and then you level up for a little bit. And then as you move into 2017, we'd expect that you'd start to see premiums grow a little bit. Ultimately, we'd like to get premium growth back to that mid-single-digit area."

And my question regarding this subtest is this: If the subtest essentially requires you to move capital within the Life Insurance company but doesn't require you to increase capital in the Life Insurance company -- and maybe my problem is that I don't fully understand or have an accurate understanding of how this subtest works, but if it is simply an intra-Life Insurance company capital allocation issue, why does it really -- why should it really matter to people looking at your financials?"

As I mentioned, for us, in the case of these subtests, you're talking about $350 million with a treasury -- a 10-year treasury at 1%. That compares to a balance sheet that has a total capacity of $8.7 billion of capital, 500% RBC ratio. Now if the potential size of that impact was much bigger and the amount of capacity, the amount of capital that you have on your balance sheet, was smaller, then you would have to think about where is that capital going to come from to maintain all of the other things I want to do with the company, the ratings, et cetera. So it's about the size of the potential impact compared to the -- your capacity to manage that impact. What I have said, I've given you the potential size of the impacts, and I've stated that our balance sheet is very strong, and we feel very comfortable saying that we have the capacity to manage those potential impacts of those subtests. Now specifically, what are these subtests? They have the generic names, HD and 8D. They are tests of particular books of business. For us, the one subtest that becomes the item that generates the potential reserves is 8D. 8D is a test where the earned rate that you use as part of the calculation is defined by an index, an index that is established between July 1 and June 30 of the year preceding the end of the calendar year. So for the end of 2016, the rate has already been defined. It was finalized on June 30. I'm very confident and comfortable that, that index level, we're fine in 2016. As you move into 2017, you're in the middle of setting that -- or you just started setting that index right now. July 1, you'd be using that index. You'll develop the average index rate over the following 12 months, and that's the rate we will use at the end of 2017. So that's mechanically how these things are calculated. Given you -- I've given you the potential size of the impacts, very comfortable saying we can manage them, but I can't tell you what those facts are for some other company, right? And I don't know what their potential impacts are and I can't speak to their capacity to manage those impacts. But for Lincoln, that is how it works, and that is the story."

Do it right upfront while the stock is at this price and get it done really fast. And then you have options if you want to go back in addition to that with some kind of a -- with a continuation of your daily program.

As we anticipated, second quarter earnings showed a nice recovery following disappointing first quarter results, as operating earnings per share increased 25% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, earnings",1758,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As we anticipated, second quarter earnings showed a nice recovery following disappointing first quarter results, as operating earnings per share increased 25% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, earnings per share increased 7% as our diversified mix of businesses and sources of earnings coupled with capital management actions continue to support solid EPS growth. 
We covered much of our strategy at the June Investor Day, and I would just like to highlight a few points. First, despite persistently low interest rates, we continued to grow EPS and book value per share as we said we would. Randy will comment on income statement and balance sheet impacts from all rates in his remarks. I would just note that we are raising prices on certain products as we proactively respond to lower interest rates consistent with prior years, and we see expense management as a key lever to sustain our targeted EPS growth. Importantly, we have a strong track record of controlling expenses and proved that once again this quarter. 
Next, we have a keen focus on allocating capital towards growth opportunities at attractive returns. That said, where external events are affecting sales levels or returns, we are okay with using the capital intended to support sales growth to buy back our undervalued shares. Lincoln's leading distribution organizations, combined with our manufacturing capabilities, continue to differentiate us from peers. We are driving sales growth right now in our individual life insurance and Group Protection businesses, while innovative product solutions across our annuity and RPS businesses will help sales growth. I'll expand on these in a minute. 
Finally, as we have demonstrated for years, we have a quality balance sheet and generate a significant amount of free cash flow. This has allowed us to actively deploy capital to shareholders, and it continued in the second quarter as we repurchased $275 million of stock. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with annuities. A 3% decrease in average account values resulted in annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, the recent recovery in equity markets led to earnings growth of 8% sequentially and positions us well for subsequent periods. Total annuity sales were $2 billion, and net outflows, $452 million. As you have heard from us as well as other asset management companies, market volatility continues to dampen consumer demand for equity-sensitive products. VA sales are certainly in that camp, though, I would note, our sales were largely unchanged compared to the first quarter. 
While sales are lower than we'd like, we are still selling volumes that support our distribution value proposition and are not willing to take aggressive near-term actions to stimulate sales. In the interim, we are comfortable reallocating that capital to share buybacks. 
We are bringing to market several unique product solutions early next year which capitalize on the growth trends in passive investments and fee-based compensation. These products will meaningfully enhance the value proposition and choice for guaranteed lifetime income, which is an essential solution for retirement savers. 
Our annuity business remains a high-quality source of earnings, and we have produced a long track record of success that is different from others. As we have said, this success is because we started the business the right way and have maintained our consistent and disciplined product pricing, end-to-end risk management and industry-leading distribution. We hope you walked away with those takeaways at our Investor Day, as I continue to believe this business is underappreciated. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We generated strong earnings growth versus the prior year. In terms of sales, total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $164 million, a 6% increase from the prior year quarter. 2/3 of our sales came from products without long-term guarantees, and our sales are well diversified, with all products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Executive Benefit sales, which can be lumpy, contributed $9 million to total life sales this quarter, while the prior year benefited from one large case. 
As you know, we have done across-the-board product repricing over the past several years to reflect lower interest rates. As a result, many of our products are meeting targeted returns, even with today's lower interest rates and flatter forward curve. Where we are not achieving acceptable returns, we will reprice. Bottom line, we are committed to maintaining our risk management and product-pricing discipline to get appropriate returns on capital. When combined with actions focused on in-force block [ph] profitability, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow our Life Insurance business. 
Turning to Group Protection. We are well on our way to restoring the profitability and long-term growth potential of our group business. Our nonmedical loss ratio continues to improve as we benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements to claims management functions. Sales momentum continues as sales increased 15%. This marks another quarter of sales growth, as the market disruption from our aggressive renewal repricing strategy has clearly subsided. 
In addition, as our renewal price increases moderate, we are beginning to see improvement in our renewal persistency. We expect premiums to stabilize in the back half of the year and premium growth to reemerge in 2017. I'm pleased to see the encouraging signs of growth while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. We have the right strategy, people and processes in place, and we are executing extremely well. 
As we have noticed -- noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. I am confident this will be achieved, providing a nice tailwind to earnings and further diversifying Lincoln's sources of earnings mix. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with both the prior year and the prior quarter and in line with expectations. Second quarter deposits of $1.7 billion were down 11% from a year ago, driven by a decline in mid-large market first-year sales due to the timing of implementations. We have a strong pipeline and already-committed new business scheduled for the second half of the year. This growth can be directly attributed to our focused strategy and investments in our digital and mobile customer experience, which is resonating in the marketplace. 
In the small market, first-year sales were up 24% year-over-year, a result of distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity. Looking ahead, we expect this momentum to continue, aided by the recent launch of our enhanced small-market Director product.
Recurring deposits were also up 3% year-over-year, evidence that our high-touch model continues to differentiate us and drive higher contributions and participation rates. Our overall sales momentum leads us to remain confident that 2016's net flows will exceed 2015 levels.
Shifting to investment results. Disciplined ALM and risk management continue to drive our investment strategy. We put new money to work in the second quarter at an average yield of 3.8%, which was down 20 basis points from the first quarter. The decrease in new money rates was primarily due to a drop in treasury rates as we invested at 205 basis points over the average 10-year treasury, consistent with recent periods. The decline in interest rates also increased our net unrealized gain to $8.4 billion pretax, up from $5.5 billion in the first quarter. It is also worth noting that our energy portfolio, which has been an area of investor focus this year, swung to a net unrealized gain in the second quarter, with values increasing by $600 million from the first quarter. 
Downgrades have also slowed, and as a result, our below-investment-grade exposure decreased to 5.5%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first quarter. 
Lastly, the annualized return on our alternative investments was nearly 6% in the second quarter, a significant improvement from the first quarter; however, still below our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the sequential improvement. We expect further earnings growth over time as we achieve our targeted return, modestly increase our exposure to alternatives and shift the mix towards private equity. 
Turning to distribution, which, as many of you recognize, truly differentiates Lincoln. Our wholesale, retail and worksite distribution organizations have been instrumental in driving our strategies and delivering on our consistent market presence. The strength and stability of over 90,000 active producers creates opportunities and enables our ability to target the faster-growing segments. During the quarter, we saw a strong producer growth across a number of our products, including MoneyGuard, fixed annuity, term and RPS, and more advisers are selling multiple products, underscoring the power of our distribution franchise in combination with a diverse product portfolio. We are executing on a diversification strategy at an enterprise level. No one product accounted for more than 14% of sales during the quarter, and long-term guarantee sale were 73% of our total sales, up from 69% a year ago -- no, let me say that again, and non-long-term guarantee sales were 73% of our total sales, up from 69% a year ago. As manufacturing and distribution collaborate on existing new product innovations, I am confident that Lincoln will continue to differentiate itself in the marketplace. 
On the DOL. There's not much new to discuss since our investment day, but it is important to reemphasize that our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the BIC to serve retirement savers and offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is leading to greater interest in our fee-based annuity product offering by distribution partners and advisers. At Lincoln, we continue to take a leadership role in working with the DOL and our distribution partners to be sure we are prepared for when the first part of the rule goes live in April 2017. 
Lastly, as you recently saw, Mark Konen announced his decision to retire. I want to personally thank Mark for his partnership and leadership over the years and wish him the best in retirement. He has recruited a very strong management team, and by having Mark stay on board through the end of February 2017, I am confident there will be a smooth transition. 
So in closing, I'm pleased that our earnings returned to levels you have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, let me reiterate that I remain confident in our ability to generate top and bottom line growth and actively deploy capital. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $373 million or $1.56 per share for the second quarter, a 7% increase from the prior year. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our first quarter results, including accelerated amortization of DAC in group, adverse mortality in individual life and weak fee-based earnings, returned to expected levels. It is also worth noting that while alternative investment income improved significantly from the first quarter, returns were still below our expected results by roughly $7 million or $0.03 per share, with $5 million of the shortfall hitting the life business. As an offset, expenses were favorable by a similar amount in the quarter, primarily in other operations. 
Now shifting to key performance metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $54.67 as we continue to consistently compound book value in the high single-digit range. Operating ROE remains strong at 11.7%, unchanged from the prior year. Expense discipline beyond some of the favorability I noted upfront resulted in our expense ratio declining by 50 basis points. This reflects our ability to effectively manage the G&A in a period of slower revenue growth. We expect expenses to continue to be a good story. Net flows contributed $0.5 billion to account values, and with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we enter the third quarter with a modest tailwind. 
Finally, our balance sheet strength and capital generation enabled us to repurchase $275 million of stock this quarter, retiring 2.6% of our shares outstanding, the most since the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Net income results for the quarter included $47 million of realized losses related to investments, while our variable annuity hedge program was effective, with a minimal breakage in what was a volatile quarter for the capital markets. 
Before shifting to segment highlights, I would like to comment on the current interest rate environment. The punch line is that we remain well positioned even as rates in the forward curve have moved lower. 
Let's start by talking about the balance sheet, because that is what comes up most with investors. Recall, at our June Investor Day, we noted we had sufficiency in our overall cash flow testing, including stretching the 10-year treasury down to 50 basis points forever. The one area we pointed to where there could be some temporary reserve strengthening is around certain secondary guarantee Universal life subtests. For instance, if the 10-year treasury stayed at 1%, that could require up to $350 million or 20 percentage points of RBC, a very manageable impact when you think about Lincoln having $8.7 billion of statutory capital and an RBC ratio of 500% at the end of the second quarter. 
Now thinking about the other 2 areas that lower rates impact life insurers, that being new business and spread compression. First, on the impact on new business returns. Most of our products continue to achieve our targeted returns, but as Dennis noted, we will make changes where necessary to achieve acceptable returns. 
Next, on spread compression, which has been with us for a while now. We showed in the Investor Day that spread compression is abating, even if we assume the new money rates stayed at first quarter levels of 4%. We estimate that this would depress EPS growth by 2% to 3% versus 4% to 5% in prior years but still enable us to achieve our target EPS growth rate of 8% to 10%. Given the decline in interest rates since our June Investor Day, we estimate that we are likely to be at or slightly above the top end of this 2% to 3% range, but expect that other levers such as capital and expense management can offset this impact. So bottom line, low rates are manageable, and we are hopeful that peers begin to provide comparable disclosures so you all can better compare companies, as we believe views on Lincoln are misaligned. 
Now turning to segment results, and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $235 million compared to $255 million in the prior year quarter. Lower fee income from a 3% decline in average account values is the primary driver of the year-over-year decline. Operating revenues declined 1% from the second quarter of 2015. Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled nearly $0.5 billion, however, this organic growth was more than offset by negative market performance. 
Return metrics continued to be strong as ROE came in at 21%, consistent with our long-term average, while return on assets decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year but did increase 3 basis points from the first quarter, stands at 77 basis points. 
Finally, as I noted upfront, our variable annuity hedge program was effective in an extremely volatile quarter, particularly at the end of June, which further demonstrates the high quality of our annuity business. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $31 million, up $1 million from the prior year quarter. Second quarter revenue was flat year-over-year, as was average account balances and return on assets. Net flows were modestly positive in the quarter. Nonetheless, our growth outlook remains positive for the second half of the year, which positions us well to increase account values. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 9 basis points versus the prior year quarter, near the low end of our expectation. While retirement earnings will fight the headwinds of low interest rates, continued growth in net flows positions us well for long-term earnings growth. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $120 million increased 14% from last year as mortality returned to normal levels following elevated severity in the prior year quarter. As I noted upfront, alternative investment income was $5 million below our expected results for the life business. A full recovery in alternative income would have put our life earnings right in line with the $125 million quarterly run rate I mentioned on last quarter's conference call. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 5 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our expectation. 
Quickly on life earnings drivers. Average account values increased 3%, with total in-force face amount up 4%, consistent with recent performance and our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. So second quarter results on mortality recovered from the prior year and typical first quarter seasonality. While earnings are facing some spread compression, drivers continue to support long-term earnings growth. 
Group Protection earnings of $15 million were below the $19 million reported in the prior year quarter, but well above the $5 million reported in the first quarter, as DAC amortization returned to more normal levels, as expected. The decline in earnings versus the prior year is due to lower premiums and investment income. Loss ratios continued to benefit from our pricing and claims management actions. Our nonmedical loss ratio improved to 72.5% this quarter from 73.6% in prior year quarter. The year-over-year improvement was driven by favorable loss ratios in all product lines: life, disability and dental. 
Nonmedical earned premiums declined by 11% year-over-year. Lower renewal persistency in sales owing to our repricing initiatives have clearly provided a headwind to growth. However, as Dennis mentioned, we expect premium growth to reemerge next year, given positive leading indicators. Notably, sales increased 15% in the second quarter, marking our second straight quarter of sales growth, while renewal persistency increased to 76%, a nearly 20 percentage point improvement from the first quarter. As a result, we are confident top line growth will provide the next lever for margin improvement. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. Our capital position remains very strong, and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to allocate a significant amount of capital to shareholders. This quarter, we repurchased $275 million of Lincoln shares as we took advantage of our strong balance sheet and shares trading well below book value. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. As I briefly noted upfront, statutory surplus stands at $8.7 billion, and our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%, both very strong numbers and up from the first quarter due to the reinsurance transaction we executed in April. Holding company cash ended the quarter above our target of $500 million. 
So to conclude, we saw our earnings power recover to more normal levels following depressed first quarter results, which led to 7% EPS growth compared to the prior year. Lower-for-longer interest rates are manageable even as the spot rate and the forward curve have moved lower. We are effectively managing G&A in a period of slower revenue growth to drive margin improvement, and we remain disciplined yet opportunistic around share buybacks. And given our balance sheet strength, we expect to remain very active. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

But we see real growth opportunities in expanding our products that are sold with fees. We see real opportunities that's a consumer and an adviser preference.

I'd make this comment or this note. I think about share buybacks, and I think that it's best to start from the beginning. And what have we said all along here is that we would expect, on an annual basis, to distribute 50% to 55% of our operating earnings back to shareholders. That translates, if you do the math and you back up the fact that our dividends run about $250 million a year, to roughly $125 million to $150 million a quarter. In addition, as we've talked about, sales have come down a little bit, and that gives us a little bit of flexibility to boost that number up. And then we can use the strength in our balance sheet to go even a little above that. You saw that this quarter was $275 million for the quarter, and I'd expect that we'd continue to take that same sort of view as we look forward."

We've increased our dividend significantly, reflective of our confidence. I would expect, obviously, it's a decision of the board, but that we would continue to increase that dividend.

Part of this, you have to give to speculation. But if you asked me what do I think the #1 overhang on our stock is today, it is low interest rates and investors' perception of how interest rates impact Lincoln, primarily around the balance sheet. And that's why we have focused so intently on trying to get the message out to investors how exactly we are impacted by low interest rates in our balance sheet. I reiterated it in my discussion today, and we had a very fulsome discussion at our most recent Investor Day about the impacts. And I think there is a perception among investors that the impacts are larger than we've shown, and so we continue to try to get that message out there. I think that message would be enhanced if other companies were to have similar disclosures so that there was a more fulsome understanding among investors across the industry. I think anytime you're out there doing something on your own, some investors will have a tough time moving that way or agreeing with just one company's view of the world. So I think it's always helpful if you can have more companies, and that's why I say that. I think you will continue to see that as interest rates stay low for a longer period of time. I think we'll continue to see the companies expand the disclosures around this area, and I think it'll be beneficial."

There are lots of people at Lincoln working very hard on this process as we speak. I think the results that come out of an unlocking are, once again, the same thing I said for the last question, but they're very company-specific. I think the primary drivers of the results that come out of these unlocking processes, there are a number of them, but if you had asked me to pick a couple, I would say this. It has to do with the riskiness of the optionality of the products you have on your balance sheet and it has to do with the point at which you start from an assumption standpoint. When you look at Lincoln -- so let's talk about the facts now. When you look at Lincoln over the last decade, but I'll focus on the last 4 years, because that's when we've made a number of assumption changes and now I'm focusing in on the annuities side, what you see is a very solid result. In fact, if you look at unlocking over the last 4 years in the annuity business, we have had -- our -- the net unlocking impact has been a positive, a number in excess of $100 million. It had a low 1 year of negative $7 million and a high year -- another year of $60 million, very consistent results. And then if you looked inside of that result, you would see that there were a number of large assumption changes. We changed lapses significantly. We changed utilization significantly. But each and every year, there's been a consistent result, no big negatives along the way. That has to do, once again, I think, with the fact that our products are designed very well and the people who design these products were very thoughtful when they were putting together the assumptions that we were going to use inside those products. They were not right on every assumption, but when -- in the totality of assumption-setting, they did a great job, and you see that in the results. So that's how we've done. That's just the reality of the facts. Now let's look forward. I believe it was Will who had a good piece of his presentation where he focused on, if you look at the key assumptions in the annuity business again and you look at what we would expect if you had to take rather dramatic changes in those assumptions, what would the impact be? Let's take lapse rates. We have a very low lapse rate embedded in our models, 3.8%. Look, if we had to cut that number in half, the impact that we showed was $50 million. Once again, very small. The reality is, I think, we have an expectation of 3.8% in our model. Right now, experiences have been running about 3.4%, so right in line with where we are. The other big assumption, utilization. If we needed to change our model to 100% effective utilization, complete and total effective utilization, that would be $160 million. Once again, a relatively small number. Utilization, by the way, has been running spot on with what's in our model. And the third item is mortality. If mortality was to improve significantly, 20%, I think is the number that we showed, that would have a net impact of $90 million. A very -- mortality, in and of itself, is running right in line with our expectations. So we've had great results in annuity business. We don't have any expectation of big negatives going forward based upon where we are today. That's the annuity story. I don't think the story would be any different if you went across our other businesses. For instance, in the life business, if you look at the unlocking results over the past 4 years, 6 years, 10 years, what you're going to see is a pattern of consistency. The life business over the last 4 years, I'll use that same period again, I think, the sum total of the results has been about a negative $100 million, and that was all last year when we unlocked -- when we lowered our long-term J curve assumption. So, Mike, I think we've had a great history of results. We fully expect to have good results going forward. I go into any unlocking process assuming that we're in a good place because that's been our history. But we'll see. Once again, there are lots of people doing lots of work out there, so I have no reason to have any bad expectation coming into any of this, regardless of what other companies may be experiencing, because it is very fact-specific to each and every company."

And",328,"Yes, let me start with our sort of overarching expense management tactic or starting point, and that is we're very disciplined during the budgeting process that our expense growth in a budget is no -- is 1% to 2% less than that year's revenue growth. And some of that reduction can come from volume, but sometimes it has to come from core operating expenses. So we start off by saying you can't have a budget that doesn't show an improvement in your expense ratio. That's an important ongoing management discipline. Now in addition to that, we are looking very hard at digital strategies to further drive down our core expenses. We're on the front end of that. I think there's meaningful opportunity with process improvement and digitization. And again, we're in the front end of this, and it will take time to size and execute. We're also looking at partnerships where we can -- where others can do things more economically than we can. I think there's opportunity there as well. What I've been saying internally, if you sort of look at 2 big issues, one is that those born digital companies are setting the standard for the relationship between companies' and consumers' expectations about ease of doing business. We weren't born digital, but we're taking very decisive steps to improve our customer experience. Along with that will come expense savings. The second big issue, as we all know and we've been spending time about it -- on it this morning, is that low interest rates hurt margins. And so you are compelled to have a very aggressive reaction to that and find ways to overcome it. So looking at expenses again, start with our core strength of expenses aren't going to grow at a faster rate than revenues. And then we're looking at additional things, digitization, partners who can do it less expensively and those things to achieve earnings per share growth. Pretty excited about it, actually."

This quarter, we saw significant recovery at 76%. I think that's reflective of the fact that significant pricing actions that the group team has taken over the last few years have -- we're a little removed for them. We're out of the significant price increases, and you're starting to see that in broker behaviors. So persistency up significantly, and we'd expect it to continue to trend up from where we are today. So when you factor in sales starting to grow again, persistency getting back to normal levels, the math just works where the premium level we experienced this quarter should be right around the trough, and then you level up for a little bit. And then as you move into 2017, we'd expect that you'd start to see premiums grow a little bit. Ultimately, we'd like to get premium growth back to that mid-single-digit area."

And I'm interested in this issue because, of course, it goes to the question that all investors have, which is whether these low rates are integrated [ph] if you look at the balance sheet issue or -- I'm sorry, an income statement issue or, in fact, a balance sheet issue. And my question regarding this subtest is this: If the subtest essentially requires you to move capital within the Life Insurance company but doesn't require you to increase capital in the Life Insurance company -- and maybe my problem is that I don't fully understand or have an accurate understanding of how this subtest works, but if it is simply an intra-Life Insurance company capital allocation issue, why does it really -- why should it really matter to people looking at your financials?"

As I mentioned, for us, in the case of these subtests, you're talking about $350 million with a treasury -- a 10-year treasury at 1%. That compares to a balance sheet that has a total capacity of $8.7 billion of capital, 500% RBC ratio. Now if the potential size of that impact was much bigger and the amount of capacity, the amount of capital that you have on your balance sheet, was smaller, then you would have to think about where is that capital going to come from to maintain all of the other things I want to do with the company, the ratings, et cetera. So it's about the size of the potential impact compared to the -- your capacity to manage that impact. What I have said, I've given you the potential size of the impacts, and I've stated that our balance sheet is very strong, and we feel very comfortable saying that we have the capacity to manage those potential impacts of those subtests. Now specifically, what are these subtests? They have the generic names, HD and 8D. They are tests of particular books of business. For us, the one subtest that becomes the item that generates the potential reserves is 8D. 8D is a test where the earned rate that you use as part of the calculation is defined by an index, an index that is established between July 1 and June 30 of the year preceding the end of the calendar year. So for the end of 2016, the rate has already been defined. It was finalized on June 30. I'm very confident and comfortable that, that index level, we're fine in 2016. As you move into 2017, you're in the middle of setting that -- or you just started setting that index right now. July 1, you'd be using that index. You'll develop the average index rate over the following 12 months, and that's the rate we will use at the end of 2017. So that's mechanically how these things are calculated. Given you -- I've given you the potential size of the impacts, very comfortable saying we can manage them, but I can't tell you what those facts are for some other company, right? And I don't know what their potential impacts are and I can't speak to their capacity to manage those impacts. But for Lincoln, that is how it works, and that is the story."

What I would suggest you consider, and you've never done this before, is doing an accelerated share repurchase program, where you call your investment banker, whoever it is that's representing you in the buyback, and you have an idea in your mind how much stock you might like to buy back for the third quarter. Do it right upfront while the stock is at this price and get it done really fast. And then you have options if you want to go back in addition to that with some kind of a -- with a continuation of your daily program.

Third quarter earnings were particularly strong as we reported record operating earnings and earnings per share. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% compared to the prior year. These were high-quality result as all 4 of our businesses produced solid earnings and our sources of earnings were well-balanced. 
Our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong, evidenced by nearly $9 billion of statutory capital and a 10% increase in our book value per share, excluding AOCI, to almost $57. During the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a modest impact on our financials. 
Given the strength of our balance sheet and our consistent capital generation, we returned more than $250 million to shareholders in the third quarter. In addition, we also announced last night that the Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
As we are all aware, the macro headwinds are dampening growth for the Life Insurance industry and we are certainly not immune to that. However, I am pleased that across the enterprise, we are successfully responding to these challenges with short-term actions, including disciplined expense management and incremental capital management to sustain our EPS growth. 
We also have additional actions underway to position us for the longer term, including pricing changes on both in force and where needed new business and enterprise-wide digitization initiatives that will significantly enhance our customer experience and provide efficiencies over time and an intense focus on product innovation, particularly in our annuity business to meet evolving consumer preferences and marketplace shifts. This strategy will once again rely on our core strengths, distribution and product development. We will update you on these initiatives as they evolve, but I'm excited that each will provide us an opportunity to sustain our strong track record of financial success. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. It was another solid earnings quarter for the annuity business, which highlights the ongoing underlying earnings power of our in force business, including another year of modest unlocking impacts. Our hedge program also had strong performance. 
Consistent with the past several quarters, new business continues to be affected by various market factors. As a result, industry sales are down roughly 30%, and our sales are down as well. We continue to believe uncertainty in the capital markets is a primary driver, but we see some additional factors including shifting consumer preferences towards passive investments and choice between fee and commission-based compensation. 
Notably, sales of passive investments and fee-based advice are not currently prevalent in the VA space. Short-term performance our risk managed funds in V-shaped markets and some impact from the DOL, which is difficult to quantify given similar declines in both qualified and nonqualified market. 
We have an active plan to boost sales grounded in our successful long-term strategy of both expanding and developing distribution coupled with product evolution. 
Let me highlight some aspects of this. First, beginning in the fourth quarter, we are improving our account value growth first value proposition by providing more choice and investment flexibility, which should offer better upside potential. Also, we are leveraging our unique eye for life solution, which is positioned very well in the nonqualified market to provide better income outcomes. We expect these refinements to draw new advisers and improve distribution effectiveness. 
Next, we see the movement towards fee-based products as a significant long-term growth opportunity as it expands our distribution reach into fee-based and registered investment advisers. There is a growing interest in fee-based annuity products and we will be refreshing our full suite of products to meet this demand and they will be ready in early 2017. 
We recently filed a VA product that creates a new product category, which is a no load and lower fee passive investment phase VA with a simplified guaranteed income story. We are partnering with one of the leading passive investment managers to capitalize on the movement towards passive investments. We expect a gradual roll out starting in first quarter and see a long runway for growth. 
Finally, as it relates to the DOL, we have seen a major distributor narrow its shelf space leaving us in place. We expect to benefit from this trend if it continues. 
As a result of these actions, we expect to see momentum in the fourth quarter and further sales gains throughout next year, recognizing there could be some disruption in the qualified market around DOL implementation. Ultimately, we expect to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. 
Of note, as we are building sales, we intend to buy back more stock to blunt the EPS impact of lower sales. So as we talked about at Investor Day, our annuity book has a solid earnings foundation and strong returns because we started this business prudently and smartly from the get-go. The actions I just described will allow us to navigate the changing dynamics in the marketplace and build on our successful track record. 
Turning to Life Insurance. Our earnings were robust and included mortality results that were in line with our third quarter expectations. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $193 million, a 12% increase from the prior year quarter as nearly all of our product lines generated solid growth. Included in our sales results are several noteworthy stories. Term sales, $31 million, or a post merger record and increased 55% as we continue to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. DOL sales increased 11% as our strong pipeline began to convert to sales following a slow start to the year. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 10% as regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. Lastly, MoneyGuard sales increased 8% as we are benefiting from continued market demand for linked benefit products. 
Our focus on sales is not just to grow but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. This quarter, we once again achieved these objectives with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15% and all individual Life products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees. Overall, our Life Insurance franchise continues to be strong as growth in key business drivers combined with pricing actions leave us optimistic about our ability to grow our Life business. 
Turning to Group Protection. This quarter reflects our continuing progress in improving profitability and the long-term growth potential of our Group business. Consistent with recent quarters, we continue to benefit from a favorable nonmedical loss ratio primarily attributable to our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management function. Although loss ratio results can fluctuate from 1 quarter to the next, we believe that our underlying experience trends are solid. 
As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. And we are clearly seeing signs of success as our premiums grew sequentially for the first time since 2014. We'll build on this growth moving forward and expect year-over-year premium growth to reemerge in 2017. 
Driving our encouraging top line momentum are improvements in sales and persistency. For the full year, our sales growth is solid, up 16%, off a low sales result in 2015, while our pricing remains a sound. Just as important, renewal persistency has been improving as needed price increases have moderated throughout 2016. Bottom line, I am pleased to see signs of growth reemerge while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters. Third quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were down 5% from a year ago due to timing of first-year sales in the mid-large market. That said, we have pointed to a strong sales pipeline, which we are seeing convert to new sales. As a result, first-year sales increased 41% sequentially. With several recent wins scheduled for fourth quarter implementation, we expect 2016's net flows to exceed 2015 levels. This quarter generated nearly $100 million of positive flows and we've had positive flows in 6 of the past 7 quarters. 
Our strong results and optimistic growth outlook are being driven by several positive factors, including distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity in the small market, the launch of our enhanced small-market director product, which is level fee and DOL ready, and lastly, investments in our digital and mobile customer experience that is resonating in the marketplace. To this point, since launching our new click to contribute functionality in June, we had seen 12,000 participants take action to each increase their contribution rates. These tangible outcomes combined with our alignment in the fastest-growing markets and our ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets through our high-touch service model give us a lot of positive momentum. 
Shifting to investment results. Our alternative investments had a solid quarter with a 12% annualized return, above our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the increase over the prior quarter. We expect to further increase our alternatives earnings over time as we continue to grow the portfolio through our long-term target of 1.5% of invested assets and further shift the mix towards private equity. 
In the third quarter, we put new money to work at an average yield of 3.6%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter. The decrease in new money rates was consistent with the drop in treasury rates as we invested approximately 200 basis points over the average 10-year treasury. 
Lastly, the investment portfolio remains high quality with below investment-grade assets representing just 5.4% of our fixed income portfolio. 
Before wrapping up, let me provide a few comments on the DOL as there have been a fair number of developments over the past few months. First, as we have noted, most of our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the best interest contract exemption to serve retirement savers and will offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is the decision we make with LFN [ph] and shared with our advisers early on. While some distributors have publicly announced their intentions, many had been slower to formally communicate their decisions. That said, if you listened to recent earnings calls, you will have heard a number of the large wirehouses imply the choice has always been fundamental to their firm's practice and they do not expect that to change. 
Let me provide some specifics on what we expect. Of our 10 largest VA partners, we believe 9 will use the best interest contract exemption for commissions. Also of note, 85% to 90% of the sales from our top VA partners will, our top 25 VA partners, will also allow commissions. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing significant interest in fee-based annuity product offerings with fee-based annuity currently representing a small portion of [indiscernible] sales, we see this as a big distribution growth opportunity. As I already mentioned, we're seeing some distribution partners narrow manufacturers and product offerings. We expect to benefit from this given our leading wholesaler force, the breadth of our customer solutions and our consistent market presence. In fact, we are already seeing early signs of this as a leading distributor announced that effective January 1, they will be paring down the number of products and manufacturers they offer. Proudly, we have more products retained on the shelf than any other manufacturer. Once again, proof that we will be well-positioned in a post DOL world. 
So in closing, I'm pleased with our record results, which include underlying EPS growth of 10%, consistent with the EPS growth targets we have provided. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, we are taking both short and long-term actions to manage them. Also, when I look around the industry, I continue to believe we have a clear and straightforward story. We are not in the crosshairs of dual regulation. We are not undertaking uncertain transformational changes. We are not distracted by precarious run-off businesses, while 100% -- our 100% domestic footprint better protects us from global macro uncertainty. Our business model is simple, manufacture only retail products, lead with distribution and product breadth target the fastest-growing segments with broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses. Most importantly, our business model has a track record of financial success and stability and we see opportunities to respond to market headwinds to drive further shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve as",1357,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. 
First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions. Following last year's lower end of our long-term [indiscernible] assumption by 50 basis points, this year's annual review had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a modest positive impact to operating earnings of $5 million or $0.02 per share. 
A few comments on this year's review process. Favorable items this year included variable annuity policyholder behavior and expenses. These items more than offset the impact of lower interest rates and a 30 basis point decrease in our separate account return assumption which now stands at 7.3%. It is also worth noting that we did not unlock a reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against weak equity markets. So the bottom line related to our annual review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying in the balance sheet continue to be sound [ph]. 
Outside of the annual assumption review, other notable items included a $0.02 benefit in Group Protection from a balance sheet review, that I will discuss later, and another $0.02 in other operations, largely from tax adjustments. One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics, and that is variable investment income was strong this quarter. Results were at $80 million after-tax and back or $0.08 per share ahead of our 5-year average for prepayment related income and are 10% return assumption on alternatives. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Booked value per share excluding AOCI now stands at $56.65, up 10% as we continue to consistently compound book value. Operating ROE was outstanding at 13.7%, while our ROE for the first 9 months ends just shy of 12%. Expense discipline contributed to G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declining by more than 2%, in line with our full year results. We continue to be pleased with our ability to effectively manage G&A in a period of slower growth for the Life Insurance industry. 
Consolidated net flows were positive. And with the end of period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we entered the fourth quarter with a slight tailwind. 
Our balance sheet and capital generation remain important sources of strength, and it enabled us to repurchase $200 million of stock this quarter. Lastly, net income for the quarter was $2 per share, exceeding operating EPS, driven by very strong performance from our variable annuity hedge program, which reported $82 million of realized gains. Net income results also included $28 million of realized losses related to investments. 
Now to business results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $240 million, down 2% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. Net unfavorable items this quarter totaled $10 million primarily related to lower [indiscernible] separate account assumptions as policyholder behavior assumptions, which have resulted in significant charges from many of our competitors, were once again favorable. 
Equity markets strength over the past year has more than offset the negative net flows that Dennis mentioned. As a result, end of period account balances increased 6%, which further improved our risk profile as our guaranteed living benefit net amount of risk as a percentage of account value is less than 1%. Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA of 77 basis points is consistent with recent periods while ROE came in at 21%, again an outstanding result. 
So the financial impact of changes to assumptions was minimal, another testament to our established a strong foundation in the annuity business. Earnings continue to be high quality. The business is well managed and we expect to build on our success in the future. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $167 million included net favorable items of $17 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings were consistent with the prior year period. Also included in the current quarter's results was $9 million of the favorable variable investment income I noted upfront and strong mortality experience which largely reflected typical third quarter seasonality. 
Spreads, excluding variable investment income came in at 131 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 7 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. 
Lastly, total in force face amount increased 5% with average account values up 4%. Both these measures are in line with recent performance and support our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. 
Group Protection earnings of $28 million were the highest quarterly earnings since 2009. Included in this quarter's result were net favorable items of $5 million from a review of disability reserves and DAC assumptions. Excluding this adjustment, our earnings increased 35% and our operating margin was 4.7%. Our nonmedical loss ratio, excluding the disability reserve refinements improved to 70.2% from 74.5% in the prior year quarter. This 400 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all product lines, life, disability and dental. 
As Dennis noted, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we are encouraged that nonmedical premiums grew compared to the second quarter. This marked the first sequential increase in premiums in 2 years. Given these successes, we expect our positive momentum to continue. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $32 million compared to $42 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by $2 million from our annual assumption review, while the prior year period benefited by $2 million. 
Spreads excluding variable investment income were 148 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 12 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point expectation. 
For the quarter, our ROA was 23 basis points, consistent with our year-to-date result. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows. When combined with positive changes in the equity markets over the past year, end of period account values increased 8% to $57 billion. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are positioned well to further increase account values and earnings in the Retirement business. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. As I noted upfront, our capital position remains very strong and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to remain one of the best capital return stories in the Life Insurance space. 
This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. And year-to-date, we have deployed 76% of our operating earnings towards buybacks and dividends, above our annual target of 50% to 55%. We expect remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by our announced 16% increase in our shareholder dividend. As we've noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. 
Our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up over $500 million from the prior year period, even after sending a little over $1 billion to the holding company. We also estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%. Lastly, our holding company cash ended the quarter at $546 million. 
So to conclude, we reported record operating earnings and EPS. Net income was also a record and exceeded operating income as the hedge program had an excellent quarter. We grew book value per share by 10%, and our ROE approached 14%. This year's annual review had a modest positive impact on our operating earnings. And enterprise expense discipline continues. At the business level, Annuities continues to report strong returns. Earnings in our Life business reflected strong mortality experience. RPS results were consistent with recent quarters. And Group Protection posted its best earnings quarter in 7 years. These solid results have drove consistently strong capital generation. And when you combine that with the strength of our balance sheet, it allows me to conclude my comments by stating that we expect to continue actively returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, I'll return the call back over to Chris."

We've, I guess, heard on the first 2 calls this morning, both Met and Pru, that they're may be -- or at least articulating a slightly different approach to the way they think about risk-based capital and capital supporting the VA blocks and really thinking about the targeted risk-based capital ratio of 400% for everything ex variable annuities and then thinking about variable annuity capital relative to a CTE-97 or 98 kind of levels. If we thought the same way or in a similar fashion for Lincoln, does it -- what kind of impact does that have? I think given the captive, your risk-based capital of about 500% is still something we can think about relative to that 400% longer-term. Is that reasonable?"

I think about how we develop capital that's appropriate for all of our businesses, I don't think about as any different business-to-business. Ultimately, we're looking at the stresses that can impact each and every business and that should ultimately drive the amount of capital that we put behind each of those businesses. In the case of the variable annuity business, we express that with the CTE measure and we talk about capitalizing that business to a CTE-98 measure. The stresses are going to be different in our Life business, for instance, where you're primary talking about credit stress. At our annuity business where once again we're talking about credit stress. So while these stresses or the potential impacts maybe different, the fundamental underlying approach for how we develop our capital is consistent across all of businesses. We then convey those approaches typically through an expression of an RBC percentage. As I mentioned, we were at 500% at the end of the quarter. As I've said in the past, we have a very strong balance sheet, but I would not anticipate taking some piece of that balance sheet and doing that outsized share buyback for instance in a particular quarter. I think we do have excess capital on our balance sheet if we wanted to do something like some M&A, probably in the range of $500 million to $750 million. But I don't think that when you take everything like ratings into account, that we would take a similar amount of capital and suddenly put that into buybacks. That being said, we continue to do a strong amount of buybacks each and every year and I'll point out that our shares went down nearly 8% year-over-year indicating that strong capital return story that we have then. So John, that's how I would think about capital that we used to support the business and how we ultimately express that as an RBC percentage."

When you look -- when you try to break that down into percentages, the actual expected for the quarter, John, came in at about 95%, 96%, I believe it was.

We had a good mortality quarter, which benefited us by roughly $15 million. I also mentioned that, additionally, we had about half of that $18 million of variable investment income, or $9 million, was located in Life line. So overall, it was a strong quarter that featured good mortality. I would also note that when we think about seasonality, we think about it being negative in the first quarter and then getting it back in the third and fourth quarter. So our base expectation as we go into fourth quarter is that mortality in terms of, once again, an average quarter would be a little better than that full year's average quarter. In terms of the Group business, $28 million of earnings, I'd noted that $5 million of earnings came from the review of reserves and DAC, so if you took that out, you get $23 million or a 4.7% margin. At the end of the day, Jimmy, it was a good quarter. If you go business by business and look at the loss ratios that we reported and if you adjusted those loss ratios for the reserve video, you would see that every line, life, disability and dental, improved from the prior year and improved from the preceding quarter. So it was undoubtedly a quarter consistent with what we've talked about, which is the repricing of this business has been done and is largely behind us and you're starting to see that feed through the results. When you look business by business, I would say it was our strongest quarter would have been in the life business. And when you look forward, I would -- I think if you look at the statutory, Jimmy, the loss ratio in the life business was 66%. I'd expect that to trend up a little over time and the adjusted loss ratio for the disability business would have been 74%. I expect that to trend down a little bit over time. When you wrap it altogether, we had an adjusted loss ratio of 70.2%. I'd put that on the good side of an expected quarter for this business. And I think you want to go back to the first quarter, I talked about a 1% to 2% sort of margin around the expected mean, and I think this quarter was on the good side of that expected mean."

What we know now and what I said during our remarks, which I know you've heard, but I'll repeat them, is that there's a big group of advisers that haven't been doing the VA business because the VA business didn't have more commission-based financial advisors and fee-based advisers. We think that's an opportunity for growth. I think there's a very significant population of financial advisers in the industry and Lincoln provides better fee-based product structure that they'll participate. So that's one direction. Is there going to be a significant shift from commissions in the traditional marketplace where it has been commissioned? Is there going to be a significant shift from commission -- excuse me, compensation to fee-based compensation? Again, I think we have to wait and see if that's going to take place. We're focused on, I think. All of our distribution partners are focused on what is in the best interest of both their clients in terms of type of fees or the type of compensation that they charge. And as we have talked about in numerous occasions for insurance contracts where the advice cycle is mostly upfront, it seems like commissions make the most sense both for the advisers that are providing the advice upfront and it's less expensive oftentimes for the client because there's not this ongoing management fee that is really in elongated insurance contracts, not as necessary, say for example when an advisor who was helping with asset mix on a daily or quarterly basis. So there are -- at fee-based, excuse me, and in the industry in general, the movement to passive investments has been pretty significant. Whether or not that continues, we'll have to see. But we want to be in a position to meet that need as well. So we'll have to see, but we think we're well-positioned no matter what direction the overall marketplace takes."

In general, I think were typically going to be supportive of changes that we see as improvements to how we account for our products. And undoubtedly, what the NAIC in conjunction with all of the [indiscernible] is working on is an improvement and how variable annuities are accounted both from a reserve and a capital standpoint. It's an improvement because it's moving from what I would describe as more of a book value approach to what I would describe as more of an economic value approach and that is a good change because that's how -- when we hedge the products, when we think about that risk. So we are supportive of what other alignment are doing. We believe we are well positioned. If you go piece by piece through the proposal, you're going to find some that are positives and some that are negatives relative to the current approach to reserving that the NAIC has. For instance, I think the linking the returns to the treasury [ph] rates will probably be a negative. But, on the other hand, hedge accounting for derivative assets is a definite positive. If you add all that together, we continue to believe we're well positioned. I think one other thing that leaves me feeling very good about how we're positioned for any changes that might come about is what you see with our policyholder behavior. As I mentioned in my script, you've seen very large charges across the industry from companies who've had to bring their policyholder behavior assumptions more in line with experience. You haven't seen that at Lincoln. In fact, if you look over the last 5 years, the sum total of impacts from unlocking our policyholder behavior assumptions is a positive. It's been a positive pretty much each and every year. So I think the fact that our assumptions are well linked to our actual experience and always have been puts us in a very good position when you think about what the NAIC is working on."

On the other hand, our grading period at 5 years is probably a little shorter than the average industry grading period. I think those 2 items from an economic standpoint probably offset each other. I would prefer, we would prefer right now, to be in the situation with a lower ultimate rate assumption because I think most evidence indicates that over the longer term, we should expect rates to be a little lower than they have historically.

Third quarter earnings were particularly strong as we reported record operating earnings and earnings per share. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% compared to the prior year. These were high-quality results as all 4 of our businesses produced solid earnings and our sources of earnings were well balanced. Our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong, evidenced by nearly $9 billion of statutory capital and a 10% increase in our book value per share, excluding AOCI, to almost $57. During the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a modest impact on our financials. Given the strength of our balance sheet and our consistent capital generation, we returned more than $250 million to shareholders in the third quarter. In addition, we also announced last night that the Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
As we are all aware, macro headwinds are dampening growth for the life insurance industry, and we're certainly not immune to that. However, I am pleased that across the enterprise, we are successfully responding to these challenges with short-term actions, including disciplined expense management and incremental capital management, to sustain our EPS growth. We also have additional actions underway to position us for the longer term, including pricing changes on both in-force and, where needed, new business and enterprise-wide digitization initiatives that will significantly enhance our customer experience and provide efficiencies over time and an intense focus on product innovation, particularly in our Annuity business, to meet evolving consumer preferences and marketplace shifts. This strategy will once again rely on our core strengths, distribution and product development. We will update you on these initiatives as they evolve, but I'm excited that each will provide us opportunity to sustain our strong track record of financial success. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. It was another solid earnings quarter for the Annuity business, which highlights the ongoing underlying earnings power of our in-force business, including another year of modest unlocking impacts. Our hedge program also had strong performance. Consistent with the past several quarters, new business continues to be affected by various market factors. As a result, industry sales are down roughly 30%, and our sales are down as well. We continue to believe uncertainty in the capital markets is a primary driver, but we see some additional factors, including shifting consumer preferences towards passive investments and choice between fee- and commission-based compensation. Notably, sales of passive investments and fee-based advice are not currently prevalent in the VA space, short-term performance of risk-managed funds in V-shaped markets and some impact from the DOL, which is difficult to quantify, given similar declines in both qualified and nonqualified markets. 
We have an active plan to boost sales, grounded in our successful long-term strategy of both expanding and developing distribution, coupled with product evolution. Let me highlight some aspects of this. First, beginning in the fourth quarter, we are improving our account value growth first value proposition by providing more choice and investment flexibility, which should offer better upside potential. Also, we are leveraging our unique i4LIFE solution, which is positioned very well in the nonqualified market to provide better income outcomes. We expect these refinements to draw new advisers and improve distribution effectiveness. 
Next, we see the movement towards fee-based products as a significant long-term growth opportunity as it expands our distribution reach into fee-based and registered investment advisers. There's a growing interest in fee-based annuity products. And we will be refreshing our full suite of products to meet this demand, and they will be ready in early 2017. We recently filed a VA product that creates a new product category, which is a no-load and lower-fee passive investment base VA with a simplified guaranteed income story. We are partnering with one of the leading passive investment managers to capitalize on the movement towards passive investments. We expect a gradual roll-up starting in the first quarter and see a long runway for growth. 
Finally, as it relates to the DOL, we have seen a major distributor narrow its shelf space, leaving us in place. We expect to benefit from this trend, if it continues. As a result of these actions, we expect to see momentum in the fourth quarter and further sales gains throughout next year, recognizing there could be some disruption in the qualified market around DOL implementation. Ultimately, we expect to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. 
Of note, as we are building sales, we intend to buy back more stock to blunt the EPS impact of lower sales. So as we talked about at Investor Day, our Annuity book has a solid earnings foundation and strong returns because we started this business prudently and smartly from the get-go. The actions I just described will allow us to navigate the changing dynamics in the marketplace and build on our successful track record. 
Turning to Life Insurance. Our earnings were robust and included mortality results that were in line with our third quarter expectations. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $193 million, a 12% increase from the prior year quarter as nearly all of our product lines generated solid growth. Included in our sales results are several noteworthy stories. Term sales of $31 million were a post merger record and increased 55% as we continue to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. DOL sales increased 11% as our strong pipeline began to convert to sales following a slow start to the year. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 10% as regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. Lastly, MoneyGuard sales increased 8% as we are benefiting from continued market demand for linked benefit products. 
Our focus on sales is not just to grow, but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. This quarter, we once again achieved these objectives with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15% and all individual Life products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees. Overall, our Life Insurance franchise continues to be strong as growth in key business drivers, combined with pricing actions, leave us optimistic about our ability to grow our Life business. 
Turning to Group Protection. This quarter reflects our continuing progress in improving profitability and the long-term growth potential of our Group business. Consistent with recent quarters, we continue to benefit from a favorable nonmedical loss ratio primarily attributable to our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management function. Although loss ratio results can fluctuate from one quarter to the next, we believe that our underlying experience trends are solid. 
As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we're clearly seeing signs of success as our premiums grew sequentially for the first time since 2014. We'll build on this growth moving forward and expect year-over-year premium growth to reemerge in 2017. Driving our encouraging top line momentum are improvements in sales and persistency. For the full year, our sales growth is solid, up 16% off a low sales result in 2015 while our pricing remained sound. Just as important, renewal persistency has been improving as needed price increases have moderated throughout 2016. Bottom line, I am pleased to see signs of growth reemerge while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters. Third quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were down 5% from a year ago due to timing of first-year sales in the mid/large market. That said, we have pointed to a strong sales pipeline, which we are seeing convert to new sales. As a result, first year sales increased 41% sequentially. With several recent wins scheduled for fourth quarter implementation, we expect 2016's net flows to exceed 2015 levels. This quarter generated nearly $100 million of positive flows and have had positive flows in 6 of the past 7 quarters. Our strong results and optimistic growth outlook are being driven by several positive factors, including: distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity in the small market; the launch of our enhanced small market director product, which is level fee and DOL ready; and lastly, investments in our digital and mobile customer experience that is resonating in the marketplace. To this point, since launching our new click-to-contribute functionality in June, we have seen 12,000 participants take action to each increase their contribution rates. These tangible outcomes, combined with our alignment to the fastest-growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets through our high-touch service model, give us a lot of positive momentum. 
Shifting to investment results. Our alternative investments had a solid quarter with a 12% annualized return, above our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the increase over the prior quarter. We expect to further increase our alternatives earnings over time as we continue to grow the portfolio to our long-term target of 1.5% of invested assets and further shift the mix towards private equity. In the third quarter, we put new money to work at an average yield of 3.6%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter. The decrease in new money rates was consistent with the drop in treasury rates as we invested approximately 200 basis points over the average 10-year treasury. Lastly, the investment portfolio remains high quality with below investment-grade assets representing just 5.4% of our fixed income portfolio. 
Before wrapping up, let me provide a few comments on the DOL as there have been a fair number of developments over the past few months. First, as we have noted, most of our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the Best Interest Contract Exemption to serve retirement savers and will offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is the decision we made with LFN and shared with our advisers early on. While some distributors have publicly announced their intentions, many have been slower to formally communicate their decisions. That said, if you listened to recent earnings calls, you would have heard a number of the large wire houses imply that choice has always been fundamental to their firm's practice and they do not expect that to change. Let me provide some specifics on what we expect. Of our 10 largest VA partners, we believe 9 will use the Best Interest Contract Exemption for commissions. Also of note, 85% to 90% of the sales from our top VA partners will -- our top 25 VA partners, will also allow commissions. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing significant interest in fee-based annuity product offerings with fee-based annuity currently representing a small portion of industry sales. We see this as a big distribution growth opportunity. As I already mentioned, we're seeing some distribution partners narrow manufacturers and product offerings. We expect to benefit from this, given our leading wholesaler force, the breadth of our customer solutions and our consistent market presence. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of this as a leading distributor announced that effective January 1, they will be paring down the number of products and manufacturers they offer. Proudly, we have more products retained on their shelf than any other manufacturer, once again proof that we will be well positioned in a post-DOL world. 
So in closing, I'm pleased with our record results, which include underlying EPS growth of 10%, consistent with the EPS growth targets we have provided. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, we are taking both short- and long-term actions to manage them. Also, when I look around the industry, I continue to believe we have a clear and straightforward story. We're not in the crosshairs of dual regulation. We are not undertaking uncertain transformational changes. We are not distracted by precarious run-off businesses while 100% -- our 100% domestic footprint better protects us from global macro uncertainty. Our business model is simple, manufacture only retail products, lead with distribution and product breadth, target the fastest-growing segments with the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses. Most importantly, our business model has a track record of financial success and stability, and we see opportunities to respond to market headwinds to drive further shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve as",1355,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. 
First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions. Following last year's lowering of our long-term earned rate assumption by 50 basis points, this year's annual review had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a modest positive impact to operating earnings of $5 million or $0.02 per share. 
A few comments on this year's review process. Favorable items this year included variable annuity policyholder behavior and expenses. These items more than offset the impact of lower interest rates and a 30 basis point decrease in our separate account return assumption, which now stands at 7.3%. It is also worth noting that we did not unlock a reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against weak equity markets. So the bottom line related to our annual review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying in our balance sheet continue to be sound. 
Outside of the annual assumption review, other notable items included a $0.02 benefit in Group Protection from a balance sheet review that I will discuss later and another $0.02 in other operations, largely from tax adjustments. One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics, and that is variable investment income was strong this quarter. Result's around $18 million after tax and back or $0.08 per share ahead of our 5-year average for prepayment-related income and are 10% return assumption on alternatives. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Booked value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $56.65, up 10% as we continue to consistently compound book value. Operating ROE was outstanding at 13.7% while our ROE for the first 9 months ends just shy of 12%. Expense discipline contributed to G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declining by more than 2%, in line with our full year results. We continue to be pleased with our ability to effectively manage G&A in a period of slower growth for the Life Insurance industry. Consolidated net flows were positive, and with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we entered the fourth quarter with a slight tailwind. Our balance sheet and capital generation remain important sources of strength, and it enabled us to repurchase $200 million of stock this quarter. Lastly, net income for the quarter was $2 per share, exceeding operating EPS, driven by very strong performance from our variable annuity hedge program, which reported $82 million of realized gains. Net income results also included $28 million of realized losses related to investments. 
Now to business results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $240 million, down 2% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. Net unfavorable items this quarter totaled $10 million, primarily related to lowering our separate account return assumption as policyholder behavior assumptions, which have resulted in significant charges from many of our competitors, were once again favorable. 
Equity market strength over the past year has more than offset the negative net flows that Dennis mentioned. As a result, end-of-period account balance has increased 6%, which further improved our risk profile as our guaranteed living benefit, net amount at risk as a percentage of account value, is less than 1%. Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA of 77 basis points is consistent with recent periods while ROE came in at 21%, again an outstanding result. So the financial impact of changes to assumptions was minimal, another testament to our established and strong foundation in the Annuity business. Earnings continue to be high quality. The business is well managed, and we expect to build on our success in the future. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $167 million included net favorable items of $17 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings were consistent with the prior year period. Also included in the current quarter's results was $9 million of the favorable variable investment income I noted upfront and strong mortality experience, which largely reflected typical third quarter seasonality. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, came in at 131 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 7 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. Lastly, total in-force face amount increased 5% with average account values up 4%. Both these measures are in line with recent performance and support our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. 
Group Protection earnings of $28 million marked the highest quarterly earnings since 2009. Included in this quarter's result were net favorable items of $5 million from a review of disability reserves and DAC assumptions. Excluding this adjustment, our earnings increased 35% and our operating margin was 4.7%. Our nonmedical loss ratio, excluding the disability reserve refinements, improved to 70.2% from 74.5% in the prior year quarter. This 400 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experienced in all product lines, life, disability and dental. As Dennis noted, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we are encouraged that nonmedical premiums grew compared to the second quarter. This marked the first sequential increase in premiums in 2 years. Given these successes, we expect our positive momentum to continue. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $32 million compared to $42 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by $2 million from our annual assumption review while the prior year period benefited by $2 million. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 148 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 12 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point expectation. For the quarter, our ROA was 23 basis points, consistent with our year-to-date result. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows. When combined with positive changes in the equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to $57 billion. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are positioned well to further increase account values and earnings in the Retirement business. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. As I noted upfront, our capital position remains very strong and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to remain one of the best capital return stories in the Life Insurance space. This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares, and year-to-date, we have deployed 76% of our operating earnings towards buybacks and dividends, above our annual target of 50% to 55%. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by our announced 16% increase in our shareholder dividend. As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up over $500 million from the prior year period even after sending a little over $1 billion to the holding company. We also estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%. Lastly, our holding company cash ended the quarter at $546 million. 
So to conclude, we reported record operating earnings and EPS. Net income was also a record and exceeded operating income as the hedge program had an excellent quarter. We grew book value per share by 10%, and our ROE approached 14%. This year's annual review had a modest positive impact on our operating earnings, and enterprise discipline -- enterprise expense discipline continues. At the business level, Annuities continues to report strong returns; earnings in our Life business reflected strong mortality experience; RPS results were consistent with recent quarters; and Group Protection posted its best earnings quarter in 7 years. These solid results have drove consistently strong capital generation. And when you combine that with the strength of our balance sheet, it allows me to conclude my comments by stating that we expect to continue actively returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

We've, I guess, heard in -- on the first 2 calls this morning, both MET and PRU, that they may be taking -- or maybe at least articulating a slightly different approach to the way they think about risk-based capital and capital supporting the VA blocks and really thinking about the targeted risk-based capital ratio of 400% for everything ex variable annuities and then thinking about variable annuity capital relative to a CTE97 or 98 kind of level. If we thought the same way or in a similar fashion for Lincoln, does it -- what kind of impact does that have? I think given the captive, your risk-based capital of about 500% is still something we can think about relative to that 400% longer term. Is that reasonable?"

Ultimately, w",342,"John, thanks for the question. That's a very broad question, so let me come at it this way. When I think about how we develop capital that's appropriate for all of our businesses, I don't think about it as any different business-to-business. Ultimately, we're looking at the stresses that can impact each and every business, and that should ultimately drive the amount of capital that we put behind each of those businesses. In the case of the variable annuity business, we express that with the CTE measure -- and we talk about capitalizing that business to a CTE-98 measure. The stresses are going to be different in our Life business, for instance, where you're primarily talking about credit stress; our Annuity business, where, once again, you're talking about credit stress. So while these stresses or the potential impacts may be different, the fundamental underlying approach for how we develop our capital is consistent across all of the businesses. We then convey those approaches typically through an expression of an RBC percentage. As I mentioned, we were at 500% at the end of the quarter. As I've said in the past, we have a very strong balance sheet, but I wouldn't anticipate taking some piece of that balance sheet and doing an outsized share buyback, for instance, in a particular quarter. I think we do have excess capital on our balance sheet if we wanted to do something like some M&A, probably in the range of $500 million to $750 million. But I don't think that when you take everything, like ratings, into account, that we would take a similar amount of capital and suddenly put that into buybacks. That being said, we continue to do a strong amount of buybacks each and every year, and I'd point out that our shares went down nearly 8% year-over-year indicating that strong capital return story that we have then. So John, that's how I would think about capital that we used to support the business and how we ultimately express that as an RBC percentage."

This quarter, we had roughly, in total, what I would say, is about $15 million of favorable mortality over a full year's average quarter with about 2/3 of that being normal seasonality and the other third being experienced better than that. When you look -- when you try to break that down into percentages, the actual expected for the quarter, John, came in about 95%, 96%, I believe it was. So a good quarter all around, a quarter that wasn't unexpected as we do talk about favorable seasonality in the quarter, but nonetheless, a very good quarter."

We had a good mortality quarter, which benefited us by roughly $15 million. I also mentioned that, additionally, we had about half of that $18 million of variable investment income. Or $9 million, was located in the Life line. So overall, it was a strong quarter that featured good mortality. I would also note that when we think about seasonality, we think about it being negative in the first quarter and then getting it back in the third and fourth quarter. So our base expectation, as we go into fourth quarter, is that mortality in terms of, once again, an average quarter would be a little better than that full year's average quarter. In terms of the Group business, $28 million of earnings, I'd noted that $5 million of earnings came from the review of reserves and DAC. So if you took that out, you'd be at $23 million or 4.7% margin. At the end of the day, Jimmy, it was a good quarter. If you go business by business and look at the loss ratios that we reported and if you adjusted the loss ratios for the reserve review, you would see that every line, life, disability and dental, improved from the prior year and improved from the preceding quarter. So it was undoubtedly a quarter consistent with what we've talked about, which is the repricing of this business has been done and is largely behind us and you're starting to see that feed through to the results. When you look business by business, I would say it was -- strongest quarter would've been in the life business. And when you look forward, I would -- I think if you look in the stats up, Jimmy, the loss ratio in the Life business was 66%. I'd expect that to trend up a little over time. And the adjusted loss ratio for the disability business would've been 74%. I'd expect that to trend down a little bit over time. When you wrap it altogether, we had an adjusted loss ratio of 70.2%. I'd put that on the good side of an expected quarter for this business. And I think I'm back -- if you went back to the first quarter, I talked about a 1% to 2% sort of margin around an expected mean, and I think that this quarter was on the good side of the -- of that expected mean."

What we know now and what I said during our remarks, which I know you heard but I'll repeat them, is that there's a big group of advisers that haven't been doing the VA business because the VA business didn't have -- had more commission-based financial advisers and fee-based advisers. We think that's an opportunity for growth. I think there's a very significant population of financial advisers, if the industry and Lincoln provides better fee-based product structures, that they'll participate. So that's one direction. The -- is there going to be a significant shift from commissions in the traditional marketplace where it has been commissions? Is there going to be a significant shift from commission -- excuse me, compensation to fee-based compensation? Again, I think we have to wait and see if that's going to take place. We're focused on -- I think all of our distribution partners are focused on what is in the best interest of both their clients -- in terms of the type of fees or the type of compensation that they charge. And as we have talked about on numerous occasions, for insurance contracts where the advice cycle is mostly upfront, it seems like commissions make the most sense, both for the advisers who's providing the advice upfront, and it's less expensive oftentimes for the client because there's not this ongoing management fee that's really in long-dated insurance contracts, not as necessary as, say for example, in -- with an adviser who's helping with asset mix on a daily or -- and quarterly basis. So there are -- and fee-based -- excuse me, and in the industry in general, the movement to passive investments is -- has been pretty significant. Whether or not that continues, we'll have to see. But we want to be in a position to meet that need as well. So we'll have to see, but we think we're well positioned no matter what direction the overall marketplace takes."

It's an improvement because it's moving from what I would describe as more of a book value approach to what I would describe as more of an economic value approach, and that is a good change because that's how we hedge the products when we think about that risk. So we are supportive of what Oliver Wyman is doing. We believe we are well positioned. If you go piece by piece through the proposal, you're going to find some that are positives and some that are negatives relative to the current approach to reserving that the NAIC has. For instance, I think the linking the returns to the riskier rates would probably be a negative. But on the other hand, hedge accounting for derivative assets is a definite positive. When you add them all together, we continue to believe we're well positioned. I think one other thing that leaves me feeling very good about how we're positioned for the -- any changes that might come about is what you see with our policyholder behavior. As I mentioned in my script, you've seen very large charges across the industry from companies who've had to bring their policyholder behavior assumptions more in line with experience. You haven't seen that at Lincoln. In fact, if you look over the last 5 years, the sum total of impacts from unlocking our policyholder behavior assumptions is a positive. It's been a positive pretty much each and every year. So I think the fact that our assumptions are well linked to our actual experience, and always have been, puts us in a very good position when you think about what the NAIC is working on."

I would say that the industry average is probably about 50 basis points higher than that. On the other hand, our grading period at 5 years is probably a little shorter than the average industry grading period. I think those 2 items from an economic standpoint probably offset each other. I would prefer -- we would prefer right now to be in a situation with the lower ultimate rate assumption, because I think most evidence indicates that, over the longer term, we should expect rates to be a little lower than they have historically.

Third quarter earnings were particularly strong as we reported record operating earnings and earnings per share. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% compared to the prior year. These were high-quality results as all 4 of our businesses produced solid earnings and our sources of earnings were well balanced. Our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong, evidenced by nearly $9 billion of statutory capital and a 10% increase in our book value per share, excluding AOCI, to almost $57. During the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a modest impact on our financials. Given the strength of our balance sheet and our consistent capital generation, we returned more than $250 million to shareholders in the third quarter. In addition, we also announced last night that the Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
As we are all aware, macro headwinds are dampening growth for the life insurance industry, and we're certainly not immune to that. However, I am pleased that across the enterprise, we are successfully responding to these challenges with short-term actions, including disciplined expense management and incremental capital management, to sustain our EPS growth. We also have additional actions underway to position us for the longer term, including pricing changes on both in-force and, where needed, new business and enterprise-wide digitization initiatives that will significantly enhance our customer experience and provide efficiencies over time and an intense focus on product innovation, particularly in our Annuity business, to meet evolving consumer preferences and marketplace shifts. This strategy will once again rely on our core strengths, distribution and product development. We will update you on these initiatives as they evolve, but I'm excited that each will provide us opportunity to sustain our strong track record of financial success. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. It was another solid earnings quarter for the Annuity business, which highlights the ongoing underlying earnings power of our in-force business, including another year of modest unlocking impacts. Our hedge program also had strong performance. Consistent with the past several quarters, new business continues to be affected by various market factors. As a result, industry sales are down roughly 30%, and our sales are down as well. We continue to believe uncertainty in the capital markets is a primary driver, but we see some additional factors, including shifting consumer preferences towards passive investments and choice between fee- and commission-based compensation. Notably, sales of passive investments and fee-based advice are not currently prevalent in the VA space, short-term performance of risk-managed funds in V-shaped markets and some impact from the DOL, which is difficult to quantify, given similar declines in both qualified and nonqualified markets. 
We have an active plan to boost sales, grounded in our successful long-term strategy of both expanding and developing distribution, coupled with product evolution. Let me highlight some aspects of this. First, beginning in the fourth quarter, we are improving our account value growth first value proposition by providing more choice and investment flexibility, which should offer better upside potential. Also, we are leveraging our unique i4LIFE solution, which is positioned very well in the nonqualified market to provide better income outcomes. We expect these refinements to draw new advisers and improve distribution effectiveness. 
Next, we see the movement towards fee-based products as a significant long-term growth opportunity as it expands our distribution reach into fee-based and registered investment advisers. There's a growing interest in fee-based annuity products. And we will be refreshing our full suite of products to meet this demand, and they will be ready in early 2017. We recently filed a VA product that creates a new product category, which is a no-load and lower-fee passive investment base VA with a simplified guaranteed income story. We are partnering with one of the leading passive investment managers to capitalize on the movement towards passive investments. We expect a gradual roll-up starting in the first quarter and see a long runway for growth. 
Finally, as it relates to the DOL, we have seen a major distributor narrow its shelf space, leaving us in place. We expect to benefit from this trend, if it continues. As a result of these actions, we expect to see momentum in the fourth quarter and further sales gains throughout next year, recognizing there could be some disruption in the qualified market around DOL implementation. Ultimately, we expect to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. 
Of note, as we are building sales, we intend to buy back more stock to blunt the EPS impact of lower sales. So as we talked about at Investor Day, our Annuity book has a solid earnings foundation and strong returns because we started this business prudently and smartly from the get-go. The actions I just described will allow us to navigate the changing dynamics in the marketplace and build on our successful track record. 
Turning to Life Insurance. Our earnings were robust and included mortality results that were in line with our third quarter expectations. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $193 million, a 12% increase from the prior year quarter as nearly all of our product lines generated solid growth. Included in our sales results are several noteworthy stories. Term sales of $31 million were a post merger record and increased 55% as we continue to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. DOL sales increased 11% as our strong pipeline began to convert to sales following a slow start to the year. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 10% as regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. Lastly, MoneyGuard sales increased 8% as we are benefiting from continued market demand for linked benefit products. 
Our focus on sales is not just to grow, but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. This quarter, we once again achieved these objectives with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15% and all individual Life products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees. Overall, our Life Insurance franchise continues to be strong as growth in key business drivers, combined with pricing actions, leave us optimistic about our ability to grow our Life business. 
Turning to Group Protection. This quarter reflects our continuing progress in improving profitability and the long-term growth potential of our Group business. Consistent with recent quarters, we continue to benefit from a favorable nonmedical loss ratio primarily attributable to our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management function. Although loss ratio results can fluctuate from one quarter to the next, we believe that our underlying experience trends are solid. 
As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we're clearly seeing signs of success as our premiums grew sequentially for the first time since 2014. We'll build on this growth moving forward and expect year-over-year premium growth to reemerge in 2017. Driving our encouraging top line momentum are improvements in sales and persistency. For the full year, our sales growth is solid, up 16% off a low sales result in 2015 while our pricing remained sound. Just as important, renewal persistency has been improving as needed price increases have moderated throughout 2016. Bottom line, I am pleased to see signs of growth reemerge while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters. Third quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were down 5% from a year ago due to timing of first-year sales in the mid/large market. That said, we have pointed to a strong sales pipeline, which we are seeing convert to new sales. As a result, first year sales increased 41% sequentially. With several recent wins scheduled for fourth quarter implementation, we expect 2016's net flows to exceed 2015 levels. This quarter generated nearly $100 million of positive flows and have had positive flows in 6 of the past 7 quarters. Our strong results and optimistic growth outlook are being driven by several positive factors, including: distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity in the small market; the launch of our enhanced small market director product, which is level fee and DOL ready; and lastly, investments in our digital and mobile customer experience that is resonating in the marketplace. To this point, since launching our new click-to-contribute functionality in June, we have seen 12,000 participants take action to each increase their contribution rates. These tangible outcomes, combined with our alignment to the fastest-growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets through our high-touch service model, give us a lot of positive momentum. 
Shifting to investment results. Our alternative investments had a solid quarter with a 12% annualized return, above our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the increase over the prior quarter. We expect to further increase our alternatives earnings over time as we continue to grow the portfolio to our long-term target of 1.5% of invested assets and further shift the mix towards private equity. In the third quarter, we put new money to work at an average yield of 3.6%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter. The decrease in new money rates was consistent with the drop in treasury rates as we invested approximately 200 basis points over the average 10-year treasury. Lastly, the investment portfolio remains high quality with below investment-grade assets representing just 5.4% of our fixed income portfolio. 
Before wrapping up, let me provide a few comments on the DOL as there have been a fair number of developments over the past few months. First, as we have noted, most of our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the Best Interest Contract Exemption to serve retirement savers and will offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is the decision we made with LFN and shared with our advisers early on. While some distributors have publicly announced their intentions, many have been slower to formally communicate their decisions. That said, if you listened to recent earnings calls, you would have heard a number of the large wire houses imply that choice has always been fundamental to their firm's practice and they do not expect that to change. Let me provide some specifics on what we expect. Of our 10 largest VA partners, we believe 9 will use the Best Interest Contract Exemption for commissions. Also of note, 85% to 90% of the sales from our top VA partners will -- our top 25 VA partners, will also allow commissions. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing significant interest in fee-based annuity product offerings with fee-based annuity currently representing a small portion of industry sales. We see this as a big distribution growth opportunity. As I already mentioned, we're seeing some distribution partners narrow manufacturers and product offerings. We expect to benefit from this, given our leading wholesaler force, the breadth of our customer solutions and our consistent market presence. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of this as a leading distributor announced that effective January 1, they will be paring down the number of products and manufacturers they offer. Proudly, we have more products retained on their shelf than any other manufacturer, once again proof that we will be well positioned in a post-DOL world. 
So in closing, I'm pleased with our record results, which include underlying EPS growth of 10%, consistent with the EPS growth targets we have provided. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, we are taking both short- and long-term actions to manage them. Also, when I look around the industry, I continue to believe we have a clear and straightforward story. We're not in the crosshairs of dual regulation. We are not undertaking uncertain transformational changes. We are not distracted by precarious run-off businesses while 100% -- our 100% domestic footprint better protects us from global macro uncertainty. Our business model is simple, manufacture only retail products, lead with distribution and product breadth, target the fastest-growing segments with the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses. Most importantly, our business model has a track record of financial success and stability, and we see opportunities to respond to market headwinds to drive further shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,402248314,1072344,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve as",1355,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. 
First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions. Following last year's lowering of our long-term earned rate assumption by 50 basis points, this year's annual review had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a modest positive impact to operating earnings of $5 million or $0.02 per share. 
A few comments on this year's review process. Favorable items this year included variable annuity policyholder behavior and expenses. These items more than offset the impact of lower interest rates and a 30 basis point decrease in our separate account return assumption, which now stands at 7.3%. It is also worth noting that we did not unlock a reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against weak equity markets. So the bottom line related to our annual review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying in our balance sheet continue to be sound. 
Outside of the annual assumption review, other notable items included a $0.02 benefit in Group Protection from a balance sheet review that I will discuss later and another $0.02 in other operations, largely from tax adjustments. One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics, and that is variable investment income was strong this quarter. Result's around $18 million after tax and back or $0.08 per share ahead of our 5-year average for prepayment-related income and are 10% return assumption on alternatives. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Booked value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $56.65, up 10% as we continue to consistently compound book value. Operating ROE was outstanding at 13.7% while our ROE for the first 9 months ends just shy of 12%. Expense discipline contributed to G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declining by more than 2%, in line with our full year results. We continue to be pleased with our ability to effectively manage G&A in a period of slower growth for the Life Insurance industry. Consolidated net flows were positive, and with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we entered the fourth quarter with a slight tailwind. Our balance sheet and capital generation remain important sources of strength, and it enabled us to repurchase $200 million of stock this quarter. Lastly, net income for the quarter was $2 per share, exceeding operating EPS, driven by very strong performance from our variable annuity hedge program, which reported $82 million of realized gains. Net income results also included $28 million of realized losses related to investments. 
Now to business results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $240 million, down 2% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. Net unfavorable items this quarter totaled $10 million, primarily related to lowering our separate account return assumption as policyholder behavior assumptions, which have resulted in significant charges from many of our competitors, were once again favorable. 
Equity market strength over the past year has more than offset the negative net flows that Dennis mentioned. As a result, end-of-period account balance has increased 6%, which further improved our risk profile as our guaranteed living benefit, net amount at risk as a percentage of account value, is less than 1%. Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA of 77 basis points is consistent with recent periods while ROE came in at 21%, again an outstanding result. So the financial impact of changes to assumptions was minimal, another testament to our established and strong foundation in the Annuity business. Earnings continue to be high quality. The business is well managed, and we expect to build on our success in the future. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $167 million included net favorable items of $17 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings were consistent with the prior year period. Also included in the current quarter's results was $9 million of the favorable variable investment income I noted upfront and strong mortality experience, which largely reflected typical third quarter seasonality. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, came in at 131 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 7 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. Lastly, total in-force face amount increased 5% with average account values up 4%. Both these measures are in line with recent performance and support our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. 
Group Protection earnings of $28 million marked the highest quarterly earnings since 2009. Included in this quarter's result were net favorable items of $5 million from a review of disability reserves and DAC assumptions. Excluding this adjustment, our earnings increased 35% and our operating margin was 4.7%. Our nonmedical loss ratio, excluding the disability reserve refinements, improved to 70.2% from 74.5% in the prior year quarter. This 400 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experienced in all product lines, life, disability and dental. As Dennis noted, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we are encouraged that nonmedical premiums grew compared to the second quarter. This marked the first sequential increase in premiums in 2 years. Given these successes, we expect our positive momentum to continue. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $32 million compared to $42 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by $2 million from our annual assumption review while the prior year period benefited by $2 million. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 148 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 12 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point expectation. For the quarter, our ROA was 23 basis points, consistent with our year-to-date result. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows. When combined with positive changes in the equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to $57 billion. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are positioned well to further increase account values and earnings in the Retirement business. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. As I noted upfront, our capital position remains very strong and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to remain one of the best capital return stories in the Life Insurance space. This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares, and year-to-date, we have deployed 76% of our operating earnings towards buybacks and dividends, above our annual target of 50% to 55%. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by our announced 16% increase in our shareholder dividend. As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up over $500 million from the prior year period even after sending a little over $1 billion to the holding company. We also estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%. Lastly, our holding company cash ended the quarter at $546 million. 
So to conclude, we reported record operating earnings and EPS. Net income was also a record and exceeded operating income as the hedge program had an excellent quarter. We grew book value per share by 10%, and our ROE approached 14%. This year's annual review had a modest positive impact on our operating earnings, and enterprise discipline -- enterprise expense discipline continues. At the business level, Annuities continues to report strong returns; earnings in our Life business reflected strong mortality experience; RPS results were consistent with recent quarters; and Group Protection posted its best earnings quarter in 7 years. These solid results have drove consistently strong capital generation. And when you combine that with the strength of our balance sheet, it allows me to conclude my comments by stating that we expect to continue actively returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

We've, I guess, heard in -- on the first 2 calls this morning, both MET and PRU, that they may be taking -- or maybe at least articulating a slightly different approach to the way they think about risk-based capital and capital supporting the VA blocks and really thinking about the targeted risk-based capital ratio of 400% for everything ex variable annuities and then thinking about variable annuity capital relative to a CTE97 or 98 kind of level. If we thought the same way or in a similar fashion for Lincoln, does it -- what kind of impact does that have? I think given the captive, your risk-based capital of about 500% is still something we can think about relative to that 400% longer term. Is that reasonable?"

Ultimately, w",342,"John, thanks for the question. That's a very broad question, so let me come at it this way. When I think about how we develop capital that's appropriate for all of our businesses, I don't think about it as any different business-to-business. Ultimately, we're looking at the stresses that can impact each and every business, and that should ultimately drive the amount of capital that we put behind each of those businesses. In the case of the variable annuity business, we express that with the CTE measure -- and we talk about capitalizing that business to a CTE-98 measure. The stresses are going to be different in our Life business, for instance, where you're primarily talking about credit stress; our Annuity business, where, once again, you're talking about credit stress. So while these stresses or the potential impacts may be different, the fundamental underlying approach for how we develop our capital is consistent across all of the businesses. We then convey those approaches typically through an expression of an RBC percentage. As I mentioned, we were at 500% at the end of the quarter. As I've said in the past, we have a very strong balance sheet, but I wouldn't anticipate taking some piece of that balance sheet and doing an outsized share buyback, for instance, in a particular quarter. I think we do have excess capital on our balance sheet if we wanted to do something like some M&A, probably in the range of $500 million to $750 million. But I don't think that when you take everything, like ratings, into account, that we would take a similar amount of capital and suddenly put that into buybacks. That being said, we continue to do a strong amount of buybacks each and every year, and I'd point out that our shares went down nearly 8% year-over-year indicating that strong capital return story that we have then. So John, that's how I would think about capital that we used to support the business and how we ultimately express that as an RBC percentage."

When you look -- when you try to break that down into percentages, the actual expected for the quarter, John, came in about 95%, 96%, I believe it was.

We had a good mortality quarter, which benefited us by roughly $15 million. I also mentioned that, additionally, we had about half of that $18 million of variable investment income. Or $9 million, was located in the Life line. So overall, it was a strong quarter that featured good mortality. I would also note that when we think about seasonality, we think about it being negative in the first quarter and then getting it back in the third and fourth quarter. So our base expectation, as we go into fourth quarter, is that mortality in terms of, once again, an average quarter would be a little better than that full year's average quarter. In terms of the Group business, $28 million of earnings, I'd noted that $5 million of earnings came from the review of reserves and DAC. So if you took that out, you'd be at $23 million or 4.7% margin. At the end of the day, Jimmy, it was a good quarter. If you go business by business and look at the loss ratios that we reported and if you adjusted the loss ratios for the reserve review, you would see that every line, life, disability and dental, improved from the prior year and improved from the preceding quarter. So it was undoubtedly a quarter consistent with what we've talked about, which is the repricing of this business has been done and is largely behind us and you're starting to see that feed through to the results. When you look business by business, I would say it was -- strongest quarter would've been in the life business. And when you look forward, I would -- I think if you look in the stats up, Jimmy, the loss ratio in the Life business was 66%. I'd expect that to trend up a little over time. And the adjusted loss ratio for the disability business would've been 74%. I'd expect that to trend down a little bit over time. When you wrap it altogether, we had an adjusted loss ratio of 70.2%. I'd put that on the good side of an expected quarter for this business. And I think I'm back -- if you went back to the first quarter, I talked about a 1% to 2% sort of margin around an expected mean, and I think that this quarter was on the good side of the -- of that expected mean."

What we know now and what I said during our remarks, which I know you heard but I'll repeat them, is that there's a big group of advisers that haven't been doing the VA business because the VA business didn't have -- had more commission-based financial advisers and fee-based advisers. We think that's an opportunity for growth. I think there's a very significant population of financial advisers, if the industry and Lincoln provides better fee-based product structures, that they'll participate. So that's one direction. The -- is there going to be a significant shift from commissions in the traditional marketplace where it has been commissions? Is there going to be a significant shift from commission -- excuse me, compensation to fee-based compensation? Again, I think we have to wait and see if that's going to take place. We're focused on -- I think all of our distribution partners are focused on what is in the best interest of both their clients -- in terms of the type of fees or the type of compensation that they charge. And as we have talked about on numerous occasions, for insurance contracts where the advice cycle is mostly upfront, it seems like commissions make the most sense, both for the advisers who's providing the advice upfront, and it's less expensive oftentimes for the client because there's not this ongoing management fee that's really in long-dated insurance contracts, not as necessary as, say for example, in -- with an adviser who's helping with asset mix on a daily or -- and quarterly basis. So there are -- and fee-based -- excuse me, and in the industry in general, the movement to passive investments is -- has been pretty significant. Whether or not that continues, we'll have to see. But we want to be in a position to meet that need as well. So we'll have to see, but we think we're well positioned no matter what direction the overall marketplace takes."

In general, I think we're typically going to be supportive of changes that we see as improvements to how we account for our products. And undoubtedly, what the NAIC, in conjunction with Oliver Wyman is working on, is an improvement in how variable annuities are accounted for, both from a reserve and a capital standpoint. It's an improvement because it's moving from what I would describe as more of a book value approach to what I would describe as more of an economic value approach, and that is a good change because that's how we hedge the products when we think about that risk. So we are supportive of what Oliver Wyman is doing. We believe we are well positioned. If you go piece by piece through the proposal, you're going to find some that are positives and some that are negatives relative to the current approach to reserving that the NAIC has. For instance, I think the linking the returns to the riskier rates would probably be a negative. But on the other hand, hedge accounting for derivative assets is a definite positive. When you add them all together, we continue to believe we're well positioned. I think one other thing that leaves me feeling very good about how we're positioned for the -- any changes that might come about is what you see with our policyholder behavior. As I mentioned in my script, you've seen very large charges across the industry from companies who've had to bring their policyholder behavior assumptions more in line with experience. You haven't seen that at Lincoln. In fact, if you look over the last 5 years, the sum total of impacts from unlocking our policyholder behavior assumptions is a positive. It's been a positive pretty much each and every year. So I think the fact that our assumptions are well linked to our actual experience, and always have been, puts us in a very good position when you think about what the NAIC is working on."

Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Third quarter earnings were particularly strong as we reported record operating earnings and earnings per share. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% compared to the prior year. These were high-quality results as all 4 of our businesses produced solid earnings and our sources of earnings were well balanced. Our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong, evidenced by nearly $9 billion of statutory capital and a 10% increase in our book value per share, excluding AOCI, to almost $57. During the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a modest impact on our financials. Given the strength of our balance sheet and our consistent capital generation, we returned more than $250 million to shareholders in the third quarter. In addition, we also announced last night that the Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
As we are all aware, macro headwinds are dampening growth for the life insurance industry, and we're certainly not immune to that. However, I am pleased that across the enterprise, we are successfully responding to these challenges with short-term actions, including disciplined expense management and incremental capital management, to sustain our EPS growth. We also have additional actions underway to position us for the longer term, including pricing changes on both in-force and, where needed, new business and enterprise-wide digitization initiatives that will significantly enhance our customer experience and provide efficiencies over time and an intense focus on product innovation, particularly in our Annuity business, to meet evolving consumer preferences and marketplace shifts. This strategy will once again rely on our core strengths, distribution and product development. We will update you on these initiatives as they evolve, but I'm excited that each will provide us opportunity to sustain our strong track record of financial success. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. It was another solid earnings quarter for the Annuity business, which highlights the ongoing underlying earnings power of our in-force business, including another year of modest unlocking impacts. Our hedge program also had strong performance. Consistent with the past several quarters, new business continues to be affected by various market factors. As a result, industry sales are down roughly 30%, and our sales are down as well. We continue to believe uncertainty in the capital markets is a primary driver, but we see some additional factors, including shifting consumer preferences towards passive investments and choice between fee- and commission-based compensation. Notably, sales of passive investments and fee-based advice are not currently prevalent in the VA space, short-term performance of risk-managed funds in V-shaped markets and some impact from the DOL, which is difficult to quantify, given similar declines in both qualified and nonqualified markets. 
We have an active plan to boost sales, grounded in our successful long-term strategy of both expanding and developing distribution, coupled with product evolution. Let me highlight some aspects of this. First, beginning in the fourth quarter, we are improving our account value growth first value proposition by providing more choice and investment flexibility, which should offer better upside potential. Also, we are leveraging our unique i4LIFE solution, which is positioned very well in the nonqualified market to provide better income outcomes. We expect these refinements to draw new advisers and improve distribution effectiveness. 
Next, we see the movement towards fee-based products as a significant long-term growth opportunity as it expands our distribution reach into fee-based and registered investment advisers. There's a growing interest in fee-based annuity products. And we will be refreshing our full suite of products to meet this demand, and they will be ready in early 2017. We recently filed a VA product that creates a new product category, which is a no-load and lower-fee passive investment base VA with a simplified guaranteed income story. We are partnering with one of the leading passive investment managers to capitalize on the movement towards passive investments. We expect a gradual roll-out starting in the first quarter and see a long runway for growth. 
Finally, as it relates to the DOL, we have seen a major distributor narrow its shelf space, leaving us in place. We expect to benefit from this trend, if it continues. As a result of these actions, we expect to see momentum in the fourth quarter and further sales gains throughout next year, recognizing there could be some disruption in the qualified market around DOL implementation. Ultimately, we expect to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. 
Of note, as we are building sales, we intend to buy back more stock to blunt the EPS impact of lower sales. So as we talked about at Investor Day, our Annuity book has a solid earnings foundation and strong returns because we started this business prudently and smartly from the get-go. The actions I just described will allow us to navigate the changing dynamics in the marketplace and build on our successful track record. 
Turning to Life Insurance. Our earnings were robust and included mortality results that were in line with our third quarter expectations. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $193 million, a 12% increase from the prior year quarter as nearly all of our product lines generated solid growth. Included in our sales results are several noteworthy stories. Term sales of $31 million were a post merger record and increased 55% as we continue to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. DOL sales increased 11% as our strong pipeline began to convert to sales following a slow start to the year. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 10% as regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. Lastly, MoneyGuard sales increased 8% as we are benefiting from continued market demand for linked benefit products. 
Our focus on sales is not just to grow, but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. This quarter, we once again achieved these objectives with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15% and all individual Life products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees. Overall, our Life Insurance franchise continues to be strong as growth in key business drivers, combined with pricing actions, leave us optimistic about our ability to grow our Life business. 
Turning to Group Protection. This quarter reflects our continuing progress in improving profitability and the long-term growth potential of our Group business. Consistent with recent quarters, we continue to benefit from a favorable nonmedical loss ratio primarily attributable to our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management function. Although loss ratio results can fluctuate from one quarter to the next, we believe that our underlying experience trends are solid. 
As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we're clearly seeing signs of success as our premiums grew sequentially for the first time since 2014. We'll build on this growth moving forward and expect year-over-year premium growth to reemerge in 2017. Driving our encouraging top line momentum are improvements in sales and persistency. For the full year, our sales growth is solid, up 16% off a low sales result in 2015 while our pricing remained sound. Just as important, renewal persistency has been improving as needed price increases have moderated throughout 2016. Bottom line, I am pleased to see signs of growth reemerge while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters. Third quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were down 5% from a year ago due to timing of first-year sales in the mid/large market. That said, we have pointed to a strong sales pipeline, which we are seeing convert to new sales. As a result, first year sales increased 41% sequentially. With several recent wins scheduled for fourth quarter implementation, we expect 2016's net flows to exceed 2015 levels. This quarter generated nearly $100 million of positive flows and have had positive flows in 6 of the past 7 quarters. Our strong results and optimistic growth outlook are being driven by several positive factors, including: distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity in the small market; the launch of our enhanced small market director product, which is level fee and DOL ready; and lastly, investments in our digital and mobile customer experience that is resonating in the marketplace. To this point, since launching our new click-to-contribute functionality in June, we have seen 12,000 participants take action to each increase their contribution rates. These tangible outcomes, combined with our alignment to the fastest-growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets through our high-touch service model, give us a lot of positive momentum. 
Shifting to investment results. Our alternative investments had a solid quarter with a 12% annualized return, above our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the increase over the prior quarter. We expect to further increase our alternatives earnings over time as we continue to grow the portfolio to our long-term target of 1.5% of invested assets and further shift the mix towards private equity. In the third quarter, we put new money to work at an average yield of 3.6%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter. The decrease in new money rates was consistent with the drop in treasury rates as we invested approximately 200 basis points over the average 10-year treasury. Lastly, the investment portfolio remains high quality with below investment-grade assets representing just 5.4% of our fixed income portfolio. 
Before wrapping up, let me provide a few comments on the DOL as there have been a fair number of developments over the past few months. First, as we have noted, most of our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the Best Interest Contract Exemption to serve retirement savers and will offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is the decision we made with LFN and shared with our advisers early on. While some distributors have publicly announced their intentions, many have been slower to formally communicate their decisions. That said, if you listened to recent earnings calls, you would have heard a number of the large wire houses imply that choice has always been fundamental to their firm's practice and they do not expect that to change. Let me provide some specifics on what we expect. Of our 10 largest VA partners, we believe 9 will use the Best Interest Contract Exemption for commissions. Also of note, 85% to 90% of the sales from our top VA partners will -- our top 25 VA partners, will also allow commissions. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing significant interest in fee-based annuity product offerings with fee-based annuity currently representing a small portion of industry sales. We see this as a big distribution growth opportunity. As I already mentioned, we're seeing some distribution partners narrow manufacturers and product offerings. We expect to benefit from this, given our leading wholesaler force, the breadth of our customer solutions and our consistent market presence. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of this as a leading distributor announced that effective January 1, they will be paring down the number of products and manufacturers they offer. Proudly, we have more products retained on their shelf than any other manufacturer, once again proof that we will be well positioned in a post-DOL world. 
So in closing, I'm pleased with our record results, which include underlying EPS growth of 10%, consistent with the EPS growth targets we have provided. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, we are taking both short- and long-term actions to manage them. Also, when I look around the industry, I continue to believe we have a clear and straightforward story. We're not in the crosshairs of dual regulation. We are not undertaking uncertain transformational changes. We are not distracted by precarious run-off businesses while 100% -- our 100% domestic footprint better protects us from global macro uncertainty. Our business model is simple, manufacture only retail products, lead with distribution and product breadth, target the fastest-growing segments of the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses. Most importantly, our business model has a track record of financial success and stability, and we see opportunities to respond to market headwinds to drive further shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. 
First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions. Following last year's lowering of our long-term earned rate assumption by 50 basis points, this year's annual review had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a modest positive impact to operating earnings of $5 million or $0.02 per share. 
A few comments on this year's review process. Favorable items this year included variable annuity policyholder behavior and expenses. These items more than offset the impact of lower interest rates and a 30 basis point decrease in our separate account return assumption, which now stands at 7.3%. It is also worth noting that we did not unlock a reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against weak equity markets. So the bottom line related to our annual review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying in our balance sheet continue to be sound. 
Outside of the annual assumption review, other notable items included a $0.02 benefit in Group Protection from a balance sheet review that I will discuss later and another $0.02 in other operations, largely from tax adjustments. One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics, and that is variable investment income was strong this quarter. Results ran $18 million after tax and back or $0.08 per share ahead of our 5-year average for prepayment-related income and our 10% return assumption on alternatives. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Booked value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $56.65, up 10% as we continue to consistently compound book value. Operating ROE was outstanding at 13.7% while our ROE for the first 9 months ends just shy of 12%. Expense discipline contributed to G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declining by more than 2%, in line with our full year results. We continue to be pleased with our ability to effectively manage G&A in a period of slower growth for the Life Insurance industry. Consolidated net flows were positive, and with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we entered the fourth quarter with a slight tailwind. Our balance sheet and capital generation remain important sources of strength, and it enabled us to repurchase $200 million of stock this quarter. Lastly, net income for the quarter was $2 per share, exceeding operating EPS, driven by very strong performance from our variable annuity hedge program, which reported $82 million of realized gains. Net income results also included $28 million of realized losses related to investments. 
Now to business results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $240 million, down 2% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. Net unfavorable items this quarter totaled $10 million, primarily related to lowering our separate account return assumption as policyholder behavior assumptions, which have resulted in significant charges for many of our competitors, were once again favorable. 
Equity market strength over the past year has more than offset the negative net flows that Dennis mentioned. As a result, end-of-period account balance has increased 6%, which further improved our risk profile as our guaranteed living benefit, net amount at risk as a percentage of account value, is less than 1%. Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA of 77 basis points is consistent with recent periods while ROE came in at 21%, again an outstanding result. So the financial impact of changes to assumptions was minimal, another testament to our established and strong foundation in the Annuity business. Earnings continue to be high quality. The business is well managed, and we expect to build on our success in the future. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $167 million included net favorable items of $17 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings were consistent with the prior year period. Also included in the current quarter's results was $9 million of the favorable variable investment income I noted upfront and strong mortality experience, which largely reflected typical third quarter seasonality. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, came in at 131 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 7 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. Lastly, total in-force face amount increased 5% with average account values up 4%. Both these measures are in line with recent performance and support our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. 
Group Protection earnings of $28 million marked the highest quarterly earnings since 2009. Included in this quarter's result were net favorable items of $5 million from a review of disability reserves and DAC assumptions. Excluding this adjustment, our earnings increased 35% and our operating margin was 4.7%. Our nonmedical loss ratio, excluding the disability reserve refinements, improved to 70.2% from 74.5% in the prior year quarter. This 400 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all product lines, life, disability and dental. As Dennis noted, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we are encouraged that nonmedical premiums grew compared to the second quarter. This marked the first sequential increase in premiums in 2 years. Given these successes, we expect our positive momentum to continue. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $32 million compared to $42million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by $2 million from our annual assumption review while the prior year period benefited by $2 million. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 148 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 12 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point expectation. For the quarter, our ROA was 23 basis points, consistent with our year-to-date result. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows. When combined with positive changes in the equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to $57 billion. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are positioned well to further increase account values and earnings in the Retirement business. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. As I noted upfront, our capital position remains very strong and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to remain one of the best capital return stories in the Life Insurance space. This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares, and year-to-date, we have deployed 76% of our operating earnings towards buybacks and dividends, above our annual target of 50% to 55%. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by our announced 16% increase in our shareholder dividend. As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up over $500 million from the prior year period even after sending a little over $1 billion to the holding company. We also estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%. Lastly, our holding company cash ended the quarter at $546 million. 
So to conclude, we reported record operating earnings and EPS. Net income was also a record and exceeded operating income as the hedge program had an excellent quarter. We grew book value per share by 10%, and our ROE approached 14%. This year's annual review had a modest positive impact on our operating earnings, and enterprise discipline -- enterprise expense discipline continues. At the business level, Annuities continues to report strong returns; earnings in our Life business reflected strong mortality experience; RPS results were consistent with recent quarters; and Group Protection posted its best earnings quarter in 7 years. These solid results have drove consistently strong capital generation. And when you combine that with the strength of our balance sheet, it allows me to conclude my comments by stating that we expect to continue actively returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

The first question I have is around risk-based capital and just capital supporting the variable annuity business. We've, I guess, heard in -- on the first 2 calls this morning, both MET and PRU, that they may be taking -- or maybe at least articulating a slightly different approach to the way they think about risk-based capital and capital supporting the VA blocks and really thinking about the targeted risk-based capital ratio of 400% for everything ex variable annuities and then thinking about variable annuity capital relative to a CTE97 or 98 kind of level. If we thought the same way or in a similar fashion for Lincoln, does it -- what kind of impact does that have?

In the case of the variable annuity business, we express that with a CTE measure -- and we talk about capitalizing that business to a CTE-98 measure. The stresses are going to be different in a Life business, for instance, where you're primarily talking about credit stress, or in Annuity business, where, once again, you're talking about credit stress. So while these stresses or the potential impacts may be different, the fundamental underlying approach for how we develop our capital is consistent across all of the businesses. We then convey those approaches typically through an expression of an RBC percentage. As I mentioned, we were at 500% at the end of the quarter. As I've said in the past, we have a very strong balance sheet, but I wouldn't anticipate taking some piece of that balance sheet and doing an outsized share buyback, for instance, in a particular quarter. I think we do have excess capital on our balance sheet if we wanted to do something like some M&A, probably in the range of $500 million to $750 million. But I don't think that when you take everything, like ratings, into account, that we would take a similar amount of capital and suddenly put that into buybacks. That being said, we continue to do a strong amount of buybacks each and every year, and I'd point out that our shares went down nearly 8% year-over-year indicating that strong capital return story that we have been. So John, that's how I would think about capital that we used to support the business and how we ultimately express that as an RBC percentage."

Yes. No, I appreciate that, Randy. That's very helpful. And then my second question, unrelated to the first, is if we think about mortality results in the Life Insurance segment, seasonally, 3Q tends to be more favorable than the other 3 quarters of the year. Just reflecting upon that relative to a more -- a typical seasonal strong 3Q, how would you characterize this quarter's results? And could you remind us how to think about the contribution in 3Q relative to the other -- to the rest of the year?"

Sure. I think the third Q was the better twin of the first quarter, only with a little different numbers in terms of the mix. If you remember, in the first quarter, I talked about $30 million of negative mortality experience with roughly 2/3 of that being expected seasonality and then the other 1/3 being over and above that. This quarter, we had roughly, in total, what I would say, is about $15 million of favorable mortality over a full year's average quarter with about 2/3 of that being normal seasonality and the other third being experienced better than that. When you look -- if you try to break that down into percentages, the actual expected for the quarter, John, came in about 95%, 96%, I believe it was. So a good quarter all around, a quarter that wasn't unexpected as we do talk about favorable seasonality in the quarter, but nonetheless, a very good quarter."

Well, you asked about 2 businesses, and I just addressed the Life question. We had a good mortality quarter, which benefited us by roughly $15 million. I also mentioned that, additionally, we had about half of that $18 million of variable investment income, Or $9 million was located in the Life line. So overall, it was a strong quarter that featured good mortality. I would also note that when we think about seasonality, we think about it being negative in the first quarter and then getting it back in the third and fourth quarter. So our base expectation, as we go into fourth quarter, is that mortality in terms of, once again, an average quarter would be a little better than that full year's average quarter. In terms of the Group business, $28 million of earnings, I'd noted that $5 million of earnings came from the review of reserves and DAC. So if you took that out, you'd get $23 million or a 4.7% margin. At the end of the day, Jimmy, it was a good quarter. If you go business by business and look at the loss ratios that we reported and if you adjusted those loss ratios for the reserve review, you would see that every line, life, disability and dental, improved from the prior year and improved from the preceding quarter. So it was undoubtedly a quarter consistent with what we've talked about, which is the repricing of this business has been done and is largely behind us, and you're starting to see that feed through to the results. When you look business by business, I would say it was -- a strongest quarter would've been in the life business. And when you look forward, I would -- I think if you look in the stats up, Jimmy, the loss ratio in the Life business was 66%. I'd expect that to trend up a little over time. And the adjusted loss ratio for the disability business would've been 74%. I'd expect that to trend down a little bit over time. When you wrap it altogether, we had an adjusted loss ratio of 70.2%. I'd put that on the good side of an expected quarter for this business. And I think I'm back -- if you went back to the first quarter, I talked about a 1% to 2% sort of margin around an expected mean, and I think that this quarter was on the good side of the -- of that expected mean."

That's a good question, and I think a lot of that answer remains to be seen. What we know now and what I said during our remarks, which I know you heard but I'll repeat them, is that there's a big group of advisers that haven't been doing the VA business because the VA business didn't have -- had more commission-based financial advisers and fee-based advisers. We think that's an opportunity for growth. I think there's a very significant population of financial advisers, if the industry and Lincoln provides better fee-based product structures, that they'll participate. So that's one direction. The -- is there going to be a significant shift from commissions in the traditional marketplace where it has been commissions? Is there going to be a significant shift from commission -- excuse me, compensation to fee-based compensation? Again, I think we have to wait and see if that's going to take place. We're focused on -- I think all of our distribution partners are focused on what is in the best interest of both their clients -- in terms of the type of fees or the type of compensation that they charge. And as we have talked about on numerous occasions, for insurance contracts where the advice cycle is mostly upfront, it seems like commissions make the most sense, both for the adviser who's providing the advice upfront, and it's less expensive oftentimes for the client because there's not this ongoing management fee that's really in long-dated insurance contracts, not as necessary as, say for example, in -- with an adviser who's helping with asset mix on a daily or -- and quarterly basis. So there are -- and fee-based -- excuse me, and in the industry in general, the movement to passive investments is -- has been pretty significant. Whether or not that continues, we'll have to see. But we want to be in a position to meet that need as well. So we'll have to see, but we think we're well positioned no matter what direction the overall marketplace takes."

Tom, there hasn't been a lot of change since the last time we talked about this. Yes, we do feel well positioned. In general, I think we're typically going to be supportive of changes that we see as improvements to how we account for our products. And undoubtedly, what the NAIC, in conjunction with Oliver Wyman is working on, is an improvement in how variable annuities are accounted for, both from a reserve and a capital standpoint. It's an improvement because it's moving from what I would describe as more of a book value approach to what I would describe as more of an economic value approach, and that is a good change because that's how we hedge the products when we think about that risk. So we are supportive of what Oliver Wyman is doing. We believe we are well positioned. If you go piece by piece through the proposal, you're going to find some that are positives and some that are negatives relative to the current approach to reserving that the NAIC has. For instance, I think the linking the returns to the risk-free rates would probably be a negative. But on the other hand, hedge accounting for derivative assets is a definite positive. When you add them all together, we continue to believe we're well positioned. I think one other thing that leaves me feeling very good about how we're positioned for the -- any changes that might come about is what you see with our policyholder behavior. As I mentioned in my script, you've seen very large charges across the industry from companies who've had to bring their policyholder behavior assumptions more in line with experience. You haven't seen that at Lincoln. In fact, if you look over the last 5 years, the sum total of impacts from unlocking our policyholder behavior assumptions is a positive. It's been a positive pretty much each and every year. So I think the fact that our assumptions are well linked to our actual experience, and always have been, puts us in a very good position when you think about what the NAIC is working on."

I'd like to follow up on Tom's question around DOL and Annuity sales in another way.

Yes, I think most people generally have talked about the 10-year risk-free rate and how that translates into a longer-term earned rate. For us, the underlying 10-year treasury assumption is 3.75%. When I look around, and I do have access to some surveys and others' information around the industry, I would say that, that number is, in general, at the lower end of industry assumptions. I would say that the industry average is probably about 50 basis points higher than that. On the other hand, our grading period at 5 years is probably a little shorter than the average industry grading period. I think those 2 items from an economic standpoint probably offset each other. I would prefer -- we would prefer right now to be in a situation with the lower ultimate rate assumption, because I think most evidence indicates that, over the longer term, we should expect rates to be a little lower than they have historically. And we also happen to think that whatever the ultimate resolution on rates is going to be, it's going to be known inside of 5 years. We will understand that rates are going to move higher. Or in the next 5 years, we will understand that we should lower the assumption again."

Humphrey, that's a good question, and let me talk about the design of products generally and let me put it into 3 categories. One, if you will, you have the investment engine, and that means do you have asset allocation funds or do you have risk management -- risk managed funds or individual securities or individual mutual funds. So we make adjustments in all of the engine, if you will, of -- that drives outcomes. The next block that you have is how does the roll-up feature work for guaranteed living benefits. And as you know, most everyone on the phone knows, oftentimes, the market is up 5% roll-up for income purposes. And then on the back end, you have the third important piece, which is what's the identified payout, how can that identified payout be adjusted. So when looking at your questions, I can tell you that in terms of the risk managed bonds, we did build a product that doesn't rely on them but we've also had to look carefully at those other 2 buckets so that when you step back and ask is it a good consumer value and does it fit into our risk tolerances, the answer is yes on both."

Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Third quarter earnings were particularly strong as we reported record operating earnings and earnings per share. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% compared to the prior year. These were high-quality results as all 4 of our businesses produced solid earnings and our sources of earnings were well balanced. Our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong, evidenced by nearly $9 billion of statutory capital and a 10% increase in our book value per share, excluding AOCI, to almost $57. During the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a modest impact on our financials. Given the strength of our balance sheet and our consistent capital generation, we returned more than $250 million to shareholders in the third quarter. In addition, we also announced last night that the Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
As we are all aware, macro headwinds are dampening growth for the life insurance industry, and we're certainly not immune to that. However, I am pleased that across the enterprise, we are successfully responding to these challenges with short-term actions, including disciplined expense management and incremental capital management, to sustain our EPS growth. We also have additional actions underway to position us for the longer term, including pricing changes on both in-force and, where needed, new business and enterprise-wide digitization initiatives that will significantly enhance our customer experience and provide efficiencies over time and an intense focus on product innovation, particularly in our Annuity business, to meet evolving consumer preferences and marketplace shifts. This strategy will once again rely on our core strengths, distribution and product development. We will update you on these initiatives as they evolve, but I'm excited that each will provide us opportunity to sustain our strong track record of financial success. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. It was another solid earnings quarter for the Annuity business, which highlights the ongoing underlying earnings power of our in-force business, including another year of modest unlocking impacts. Our hedge program also had strong performance. Consistent with the past several quarters, new business continues to be affected by various market factors. As a result, industry sales are down roughly 30%, and our sales are down as well. We continue to believe uncertainty in the capital markets is a primary driver, but we see some additional factors, including shifting consumer preferences towards passive investments and choice between fee- and commission-based compensation. Notably, sales of passive investments and fee-based advice are not currently prevalent in the VA space, short-term performance of risk-managed funds in V-shaped markets and some impact from the DOL, which is difficult to quantify, given similar declines in both qualified and nonqualified markets. 
We have an active plan to boost sales, grounded in our successful long-term strategy of both expanding and developing distribution, coupled with product evolution. Let me highlight some aspects of this. First, beginning in the fourth quarter, we are improving our account value growth first value proposition by providing more choice and investment flexibility, which should offer better upside potential. Also, we are leveraging our unique i4LIFE solution, which is positioned very well in the nonqualified market to provide better income outcomes. We expect these refinements to draw new advisers and improve distribution effectiveness. 
Next, we see the movement towards fee-based products as a significant long-term growth opportunity as it expands our distribution reach into fee-based and registered investment advisers. There's a growing interest in fee-based annuity products. And we will be refreshing our full suite of products to meet this demand, and they will be ready in early 2017. We recently filed a VA product that creates a new product category, which is a no-load and lower-fee passive investment base VA with a simplified guaranteed income story. We are partnering with one of the leading passive investment managers to capitalize on the movement towards passive investments. We expect a gradual roll-out starting in the first quarter and see a long runway for growth. 
Finally, as it relates to the DOL, we have seen a major distributor narrow its shelf space, leaving us in place. We expect to benefit from this trend, if it continues. As a result of these actions, we expect to see momentum in the fourth quarter and further sales gains throughout next year, recognizing there could be some disruption in the qualified market around DOL implementation. Ultimately, we expect to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. 
Of note, as we are building sales, we intend to buy back more stock to blunt the EPS impact of lower sales. So as we talked about at Investor Day, our Annuity book has a solid earnings foundation and strong returns because we started this business prudently and smartly from the get-go. The actions I just described will allow us to navigate the changing dynamics in the marketplace and build on our successful track record. 
Turning to Life Insurance. Our earnings were robust and included mortality results that were in line with our third quarter expectations. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $193 million, a 12% increase from the prior year quarter as nearly all of our product lines generated solid growth. Included in our sales results are several noteworthy stories. Term sales of $31 million were a post merger record and increased 55% as we continue to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. DOL sales increased 11% as our strong pipeline began to convert to sales following a slow start to the year. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 10% as regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. Lastly, MoneyGuard sales increased 8% as we are benefiting from continued market demand for linked benefit products. 
Our focus on sales is not just to grow, but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. This quarter, we once again achieved these objectives with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15% and all individual Life products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees. Overall, our Life Insurance franchise continues to be strong as growth in key business drivers, combined with pricing actions, leave us optimistic about our ability to grow our Life business. 
Turning to Group Protection. This quarter reflects our continuing progress in improving profitability and the long-term growth potential of our Group business. Consistent with recent quarters, we continue to benefit from a favorable nonmedical loss ratio primarily attributable to our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management function. Although loss ratio results can fluctuate from one quarter to the next, we believe that our underlying experience trends are solid. 
As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we're clearly seeing signs of success as our premiums grew sequentially for the first time since 2014. We'll build on this growth moving forward and expect year-over-year premium growth to reemerge in 2017. Driving our encouraging top line momentum are improvements in sales and persistency. For the full year, our sales growth is solid, up 16% off a low sales result in 2015 while our pricing remained sound. Just as important, renewal persistency has been improving as needed price increases have moderated throughout 2016. Bottom line, I am pleased to see signs of growth reemerge while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters. Third quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were down 5% from a year ago due to timing of first-year sales in the mid/large market. That said, we have pointed to a strong sales pipeline, which we are seeing convert to new sales. As a result, first year sales increased 41% sequentially. With several recent wins scheduled for fourth quarter implementation, we expect 2016's net flows to exceed 2015 levels. This quarter generated nearly $100 million of positive flows and have had positive flows in 6 of the past 7 quarters. Our strong results and optimistic growth outlook are being driven by several positive factors, including: distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity in the small market; the launch of our enhanced small market director product, which is level fee and DOL ready; and lastly, investments in our digital and mobile customer experience that is resonating in the marketplace. To this point, since launching our new click-to-contribute functionality in June, we have seen 12,000 participants take action to each increase their contribution rates. These tangible outcomes, combined with our alignment to the fastest-growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets through our high-touch service model, give us a lot of positive momentum. 
Shifting to investment results. Our alternative investments had a solid quarter with a 12% annualized return, above our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the increase over the prior quarter. We expect to further increase our alternatives earnings over time as we continue to grow the portfolio to our long-term target of 1.5% of invested assets and further shift the mix towards private equity. In the third quarter, we put new money to work at an average yield of 3.6%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter. The decrease in new money rates was consistent with the drop in treasury rates as we invested approximately 200 basis points over the average 10-year treasury. Lastly, the investment portfolio remains high quality with below investment-grade assets representing just 5.4% of our fixed income portfolio. 
Before wrapping up, let me provide a few comments on the DOL as there have been a fair number of developments over the past few months. First, as we have noted, most of our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the Best Interest Contract Exemption to serve retirement savers and will offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is the decision we made with LFN and shared with our advisers early on. While some distributors have publicly announced their intentions, many have been slower to formally communicate their decisions. That said, if you listened to recent earnings calls, you would have heard a number of the large wire houses imply that choice has always been fundamental to their firm's practice and they do not expect that to change. Let me provide some specifics on what we expect. Of our 10 largest VA partners, we believe 9 will use the Best Interest Contract Exemption for commissions. Also of note, 85% to 90% of the sales from our top VA partners will -- our top 25 VA partners, will also allow commissions. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing significant interest in fee-based annuity product offerings with fee-based annuity currently representing a small portion of industry sales. We see this as a big distribution growth opportunity. As I already mentioned, we're seeing some distribution partners narrow manufacturers and product offerings. We expect to benefit from this, given our leading wholesaler force, the breadth of our customer solutions and our consistent market presence. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of this as a leading distributor announced that effective January 1, they will be paring down the number of products and manufacturers they offer. Proudly, we have more products retained on their shelf than any other manufacturer, once again proof that we will be well positioned in a post-DOL world. 
So in closing, I'm pleased with our record results, which include underlying EPS growth of 10%, consistent with the EPS growth targets we have provided. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, we are taking both short- and long-term actions to manage them. Also, when I look around the industry, I continue to believe we have a clear and straightforward story. We're not in the crosshairs of dual regulation. We are not undertaking uncertain transformational changes. We are not distracted by precarious run-off businesses while 100% -- our 100% domestic footprint better protects us from global macro uncertainty. Our business model is simple, manufacture only retail products, lead with distribution and product breadth, target the fastest-growing segments of the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses. Most importantly, our business model has a track record of financial success and stability, and we see opportunities to respond to market headwinds to drive further shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. 
First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions. Following last year's lowering of our long-term earned rate assumption by 50 basis points, this year's annual review had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a modest positive impact to operating earnings of $5 million or $0.02 per share. 
A few comments on this year's review process. Favorable items this year included variable annuity policyholder behavior and expenses. These items more than offset the impact of lower interest rates and a 30 basis point decrease in our separate account return assumption, which now stands at 7.3%. It is also worth noting that we did not unlock a reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against weak equity markets. So the bottom line related to our annual review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying in our balance sheet continue to be sound. 
Outside of the annual assumption review, other notable items included a $0.02 benefit in Group Protection from a balance sheet review that I will discuss later and another $0.02 in other operations, largely from tax adjustments. One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics, and that is variable investment income was strong this quarter. Results ran $18 million after tax and back or $0.08 per share ahead of our 5-year average for prepayment-related income and our 10% return assumption on alternatives. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Booked value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $56.65, up 10% as we continue to consistently compound book value. Operating ROE was outstanding at 13.7% while our ROE for the first 9 months ends just shy of 12%. Expense discipline contributed to G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declining by more than 2%, in line with our full year results. We continue to be pleased with our ability to effectively manage G&A in a period of slower growth for the Life Insurance industry. Consolidated net flows were positive, and with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we entered the fourth quarter with a slight tailwind. Our balance sheet and capital generation remain important sources of strength, and it enabled us to repurchase $200 million of stock this quarter. Lastly, net income for the quarter was $2 per share, exceeding operating EPS, driven by very strong performance from our variable annuity hedge program, which reported $82 million of realized gains. Net income results also included $28 million of realized losses related to investments. 
Now to business results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $240 million, down 2% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. Net unfavorable items this quarter totaled $10 million, primarily related to lowering our separate account return assumption as policyholder behavior assumptions, which have resulted in significant charges for many of our competitors, were once again favorable. 
Equity market strength over the past year has more than offset the negative net flows that Dennis mentioned. As a result, end-of-period account balance has increased 6%, which further improved our risk profile as our guaranteed living benefit, net amount at risk as a percentage of account value, is less than 1%. Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA of 77 basis points is consistent with recent periods while ROE came in at 21%, again an outstanding result. So the financial impact of changes to assumptions was minimal, another testament to our established and strong foundation in the Annuity business. Earnings continue to be high quality. The business is well managed, and we expect to build on our success in the future. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $167 million included net favorable items of $17 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings were consistent with the prior year period. Also included in the current quarter's results was $9 million of the favorable variable investment income I noted upfront and strong mortality experience, which largely reflected typical third quarter seasonality. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, came in at 131 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 7 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. Lastly, total in-force face amount increased 5% with average account values up 4%. Both these measures are in line with recent performance and support our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. 
Group Protection earnings of $28 million marked the highest quarterly earnings since 2009. Included in this quarter's result were net favorable items of $5 million from a review of disability reserves and DAC assumptions. Excluding this adjustment, our earnings increased 35% and our operating margin was 4.7%. Our nonmedical loss ratio, excluding the disability reserve refinements, improved to 70.2% from 74.5% in the prior year quarter. This 400 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all product lines, life, disability and dental. As Dennis noted, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we are encouraged that nonmedical premiums grew compared to the second quarter. This marked the first sequential increase in premiums in 2 years. Given these successes, we expect our positive momentum to continue. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $32 million compared to $42million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by $2 million from our annual assumption review while the prior year period benefited by $2 million. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 148 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 12 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point expectation. For the quarter, our ROA was 23 basis points, consistent with our year-to-date result. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows. When combined with positive changes in the equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to $57 billion. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are positioned well to further increase account values and earnings in the Retirement business. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. As I noted upfront, our capital position remains very strong and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to remain one of the best capital return stories in the Life Insurance space. This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares, and year-to-date, we have deployed 76% of our operating earnings towards buybacks and dividends, above our annual target of 50% to 55%. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by our announced 16% increase in our shareholder dividend. As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up over $500 million from the prior year period even after sending a little over $1 billion to the holding company. We also estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%. Lastly, our holding company cash ended the quarter at $546 million. 
So to conclude, we reported record operating earnings and EPS. Net income was also a record and exceeded operating income as the hedge program had an excellent quarter. We grew book value per share by 10%, and our ROE approached 14%. This year's annual review had a modest positive impact on our operating earnings, and enterprise discipline -- enterprise expense discipline continues. At the business level, Annuities continues to report strong returns; earnings in our Life business reflected strong mortality experience; RPS results were consistent with recent quarters; and Group Protection posted its best earnings quarter in 7 years. These solid results have drove consistently strong capital generation. And when you combine that with the strength of our balance sheet, it allows me to conclude my comments by stating that we expect to continue actively returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

The first question I have is around risk-based capital and just capital supporting the variable annuity business. We've, I guess, heard in -- on the first 2 calls this morning, both MET and PRU, that they may be taking -- or maybe at least articulating a slightly different approach to the way they think about risk-based capital and capital supporting the VA blocks and really thinking about the targeted risk-based capital ratio of 400% for everything ex variable annuities and then thinking about variable annuity capital relative to a CTE97 or 98 kind of level. If we thought the same way or in a similar fashion for Lincoln, does it -- what kind of impact does that have? I think given the captive, your risk-based capital of about 500% is still something we can think about relative to that 400% longer term. Is that reasonable?"

John, thanks for the question. That's a very broad question, so let me come at it this way. When I think about how we develop capital that's appropriate for all of our businesses, I don't think about it as any different business-to-business. Ultimately, we're looking at the stresses that can impact each and every business, and that should ultimately drive the amount of capital that we put behind each of those businesses. In the case of the variable annuity business, we express that with a CTE measure -- and we talk about capitalizing that business to a CTE-98 measure. The stresses are going to be different in a Life business, for instance, where you're primarily talking about credit stress, or in Annuity business, where, once again, you're talking about credit stress. So while these stresses or the potential impacts may be different, the fundamental underlying approach for how we develop our capital is consistent across all of the businesses. We then convey those approaches typically through an expression of an RBC percentage. As I mentioned, we were at 500% at the end of the quarter. As I've said in the past, we have a very strong balance sheet, but I wouldn't anticipate taking some piece of that balance sheet and doing an outsized share buyback, for instance, in a particular quarter. I think we do have excess capital on our balance sheet if we wanted to do something like some M&A, probably in the range of $500 million to $750 million. But I don't think that when you take everything, like ratings, into account, that we would take a similar amount of capital and suddenly put that into buybacks. That being said, we continue to do a strong amount of buybacks each and every year, and I'd point out that our shares went down nearly 8% year-over-year indicating that strong capital return story that we have been. So John, that's how I would think about capital that we used to support the business and how we ultimately express that as an RBC percentage."

Yes. No, I appreciate that, Randy. That's very helpful.

Sure. I think the third Q was the better twin of the first quarter, only with a little different numbers in terms of the mix. If you remember, in the first quarter, I talked about $30 million of negative mortality experience with roughly 2/3 of that being expected seasonality and then the other 1/3 being over and above that. This quarter, we had roughly, in total, what I would say, is about $15 million of favorable mortality over a full year's average quarter with about 2/3 of that being normal seasonality and the other third being experienced better than that. When you look -- if you try to break that down into percentages, the actual expected for the quarter, John, came in about 95%, 96%, I believe it was. So a good quarter all around, a quarter that wasn't unexpected as we do talk about favorable seasonality in the quarter, but nonetheless, a very good quarter."

Well, you asked about 2 businesses, and I just addressed the Life question. We had a good mortality quarter, which benefited us by roughly $15 million. I also mentioned that, additionally, we had about half of that $18 million of variable investment income, Or $9 million was located in the Life line. So overall, it was a strong quarter that featured good mortality. I would also note that when we think about seasonality, we think about it being negative in the first quarter and then getting it back in the third and fourth quarter. So our base expectation, as we go into fourth quarter, is that mortality in terms of, once again, an average quarter would be a little better than that full year's average quarter. In terms of the Group business, $28 million of earnings, I'd noted that $5 million of earnings came from the review of reserves and DAC. So if you took that out, you'd get $23 million or a 4.7% margin. At the end of the day, Jimmy, it was a good quarter. If you go business by business and look at the loss ratios that we reported and if you adjusted those loss ratios for the reserve review, you would see that every line, life, disability and dental, improved from the prior year and improved from the preceding quarter. So it was undoubtedly a quarter consistent with what we've talked about, which is the repricing of this business has been done and is largely behind us, and you're starting to see that feed through to the results. When you look business by business, I would say it was -- a strongest quarter would've been in the life business. And when you look forward, I would -- I think if you look in the stats up, Jimmy, the loss ratio in the Life business was 66%. I'd expect that to trend up a little over time. And the adjusted loss ratio for the disability business would've been 74%. I'd expect that to trend down a little bit over time. When you wrap it altogether, we had an adjusted loss ratio of 70.2%. I'd put that on the good side of an expected quarter for this business. And I think I'm back -- if you went back to the first quarter, I talked about a 1% to 2% sort of margin around an expected mean, and I think that this quarter was on the good side of the -- of that expected mean."

That's a good question, and I think a lot of that answer remains to be seen. What we know now and what I said during our remarks, which I know you heard but I'll repeat them, is that there's a big group of advisers that haven't been doing the VA business because the VA business didn't have -- had more commission-based financial advisers and fee-based advisers. We think that's an opportunity for growth. I think there's a very significant population of financial advisers, if the industry and Lincoln provides better fee-based product structures, that they'll participate. So that's one direction. The -- is there going to be a significant shift from commissions in the traditional marketplace where it has been commissions? Is there going to be a significant shift from commission -- excuse me, compensation to fee-based compensation? Again, I think we have to wait and see if that's going to take place. We're focused on -- I think all of our distribution partners are focused on what is in the best interest of both their clients -- in terms of the type of fees or the type of compensation that they charge. And as we have talked about on numerous occasions, for insurance contracts where the advice cycle is mostly upfront, it seems like commissions make the most sense, both for the adviser who's providing the advice upfront, and it's less expensive oftentimes for the client because there's not this ongoing management fee that's really in long-dated insurance contracts, not as necessary as, say for example, in -- with an adviser who's helping with asset mix on a daily or -- and quarterly basis. So there are -- and fee-based -- excuse me, and in the industry in general, the movement to passive investments is -- has been pretty significant. Whether or not that continues, we'll have to see. But we want to be in a position to meet that need as well. So we'll have to see, but we think we're well positioned no matter what direction the overall marketplace takes."

Tom, there hasn't been a lot of change since the last time we talked about this. Yes, we do feel well positioned. In general, I think we're typically going to be supportive of changes that we see as improvements to how we account for our products. And undoubtedly, what the NAIC, in conjunction with Oliver Wyman is working on, is an improvement in how variable annuities are accounted for, both from a reserve and a capital standpoint. It's an improvement because it's moving from what I would describe as more of a book value approach to what I would describe as more of an economic value approach, and that is a good change because that's how we hedge the products when we think about that risk. So we are supportive of what Oliver Wyman is doing. We believe we are well positioned. If you go piece by piece through the proposal, you're going to find some that are positives and some that are negatives relative to the current approach to reserving that the NAIC has. For instance, I think the linking the returns to the risk-free rates would probably be a negative. But on the other hand, hedge accounting for derivative assets is a definite positive. When you add them all together, we continue to believe we're well positioned. I think one other thing that leaves me feeling very good about how we're positioned for the -- any changes that might come about is what you see with our policyholder behavior. As I mentioned in my script, you've seen very large charges across the industry from companies who've had to bring their policyholder behavior assumptions more in line with experience. You haven't seen that at Lincoln. In fact, if you look over the last 5 years, the sum total of impacts from unlocking our policyholder behavior assumptions is a positive. It's been a positive pretty much each and every year. So I think the fact that our assumptions are well linked to our actual experience, and always have been, puts us in a very good position when you think about what the NAIC is working on."

I'd like to follow up on Tom's question around DOL and Annuity sales in another way. Dennis and Randy, for the last couple of years, you've been saying that if Annuity sales fell because of changes in how the products sold due to DOL, you would use the capital that was backing those Annuities and buy back more stock. I mean, we're kind of essentially there now, at least in order of magnitude versus what I was thinking. It came a little earlier. I was thinking the fall would come into this in '17. So I'm just wondering, Randy, if the stat surplus in RBC that you referenced earlier, if that's benefited at all from the lower capital strain from lower Annuity sales."

So if you look at what we've done year-to-date, we were -- we have returned 76% of operating earnings to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. That compares to a guidance of 50% to 55%. If you use the central point of that guidance, you're talking -- and you develop how much additional buybacks over our guidance that would be, what you will see is that there's probably, or about, $75 million in there related to lower variable annuity sales, and I would expect that to continue should Annuity sales remain below our longer-term expectations. As Dennis mentioned, we will be working aggressively to get back to a positive flow situation. But we have been and we will continue to do what we have said, which is put that capital to work through share buybacks."

What's the customer's investment ideas coming back to or preferences, I should say, coming back to passive? At the moment, a lot of active investment moving to passive. We're just trying all the time to be responsive to major trends in the industry. I think this particular product is exciting, has a lot of technology associated with it that makes it easier for the customer to understand the product and where it might fit into its -- the customer's overall portfolio of investments.

Yes, I think most people generally have talked about the 10-year risk-free rate and how that translates into a longer-term earned rate. For us, the underlying 10-year treasury assumption is 3.75%. When I look around, and I do have access to some surveys and others' information around the industry, I would say that, that number is, in general, at the lower end of industry assumptions. I would say that the industry average is probably about 50 basis points higher than that. On the other hand, our grading period at 5 years is probably a little shorter than the average industry grading period. I think those 2 items from an economic standpoint probably offset each other. I would prefer -- we would prefer right now to be in a situation with the lower ultimate rate assumption, because I think most evidence indicates that, over the longer term, we should expect rates to be a little lower than they have historically. And we also happen to think that whatever the ultimate resolution on rates is going to be, it's going to be known inside of 5 years. We will understand that rates are going to move higher. Or in the next 5 years, we will understand that we should lower the assumption again."

Humphrey, that's a good question, and let me talk about the design of products generally and let me put it into 3 categories. One, if you will, you have the investment engine, and that means do you have asset allocation funds or do you have risk management -- risk managed funds or individual securities or individual mutual funds. So we make adjustments in all of the engine, if you will, of -- that drives outcomes. The next block that you have is how does the roll-up feature work for guaranteed living benefits. And as you know, most everyone on the phone knows, oftentimes, the market is up 5% roll-up for income purposes. And then on the back end, you have the third important piece, which is what's the identified payout, how can that identified payout be adjusted. So when looking at your questions, I can tell you that in terms of the risk managed bonds, we did build a product that doesn't rely on them but we've also had to look carefully at those other 2 buckets so that when you step back and ask is it a good consumer value and does it fit into our risk tolerances, the answer is yes on both."

Third quarter earnings were particularly strong as we reported record operating earnings and earnings per share. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% compared to the prior year. These were high-quality results as all 4 of our businesses produced solid earnings and our sources of earnings were well balanced. Our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong, evidenced by nearly $9 billion of statutory capital and a 10% increase in our book value per share, excluding AOCI, to almost $57. During the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a modest impact on our financials. Given the strength of our balance sheet and our consistent capital generation, we returned more than $250 million to shareholders in the third quarter. In addition, we also announced last night that the Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend. 
As we are all aware, macro headwinds are dampening growth for the life insurance industry, and we're certainly not immune to that. However, I am pleased that across the enterprise, we are successfully responding to these challenges with short-term actions, including disciplined expense management and incremental capital management, to sustain our EPS growth. We also have additional actions underway to position us for the longer term, including pricing changes on both in-force and, where needed, new business and enterprise-wide digitization initiatives that will significantly enhance our customer experience and provide efficiencies over time and an intense focus on product innovation, particularly in our Annuity business, to meet evolving consumer preferences and marketplace shifts. This strategy will once again rely on our core strengths, distribution and product development. We will update you on these initiatives as they evolve, but I'm excited that each will provide us opportunity to sustain our strong track record of financial success. 
Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. It was another solid earnings quarter for the Annuity business, which highlights the ongoing underlying earnings power of our in-force business, including another year of modest unlocking impacts. Our hedge program also had strong performance. Consistent with the past several quarters, new business continues to be affected by various market factors. As a result, industry sales are down roughly 30%, and our sales are down as well. We continue to believe uncertainty in the capital markets is a primary driver, but we see some additional factors, including shifting consumer preferences towards passive investments and choice between fee- and commission-based compensation. Notably, sales of passive investments and fee-based advice are not currently prevalent in the VA space, short-term performance of risk-managed funds in V-shaped markets and some impact from the DOL, which is difficult to quantify, given similar declines in both qualified and nonqualified markets. 
We have an active plan to boost sales, grounded in our successful long-term strategy of both expanding and developing distribution, coupled with product evolution. Let me highlight some aspects of this. First, beginning in the fourth quarter, we are improving our account value growth first value proposition by providing more choice and investment flexibility, which should offer better upside potential. Also, we are leveraging our unique i4LIFE solution, which is positioned very well in the nonqualified market to provide better income outcomes. We expect these refinements to draw new advisers and improve distribution effectiveness. 
Next, we see the movement towards fee-based products as a significant long-term growth opportunity as it expands our distribution reach into fee-based and registered investment advisers. There's a growing interest in fee-based annuity products. And we will be refreshing our full suite of products to meet this demand, and they will be ready in early 2017. We recently filed a VA product that creates a new product category, which is a no-load and lower-fee passive investment base VA with a simplified guaranteed income story. We are partnering with one of the leading passive investment managers to capitalize on the movement towards passive investments. We expect a gradual roll-out starting in the first quarter and see a long runway for growth. 
Finally, as it relates to the DOL, we have seen a major distributor narrow its shelf space, leaving us in place. We expect to benefit from this trend, if it continues. As a result of these actions, we expect to see momentum in the fourth quarter and further sales gains throughout next year, recognizing there could be some disruption in the qualified market around DOL implementation. Ultimately, we expect to return to full year positive net flows in 2018. 
Of note, as we are building sales, we intend to buy back more stock to blunt the EPS impact of lower sales. So as we talked about at Investor Day, our Annuity book has a solid earnings foundation and strong returns because we started this business prudently and smartly from the get-go. The actions I just described will allow us to navigate the changing dynamics in the marketplace and build on our successful track record. 
Turning to Life Insurance. Our earnings were robust and included mortality results that were in line with our third quarter expectations. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $193 million, a 12% increase from the prior year quarter as nearly all of our product lines generated solid growth. Included in our sales results are several noteworthy stories. Term sales of $31 million were a post merger record and increased 55% as we continue to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. DOL sales increased 11% as our strong pipeline began to convert to sales following a slow start to the year. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 10% as regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. Lastly, MoneyGuard sales increased 8% as we are benefiting from continued market demand for linked benefit products. 
Our focus on sales is not just to grow, but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. This quarter, we once again achieved these objectives with expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15% and all individual Life products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees. Overall, our Life Insurance franchise continues to be strong as growth in key business drivers, combined with pricing actions, leave us optimistic about our ability to grow our Life business. 
Turning to Group Protection. This quarter reflects our continuing progress in improving profitability and the long-term growth potential of our Group business. Consistent with recent quarters, we continue to benefit from a favorable nonmedical loss ratio primarily attributable to our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management function. Although loss ratio results can fluctuate from one quarter to the next, we believe that our underlying experience trends are solid. 
As we have noted recently, top line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we're clearly seeing signs of success as our premiums grew sequentially for the first time since 2014. We'll build on this growth moving forward and expect year-over-year premium growth to reemerge in 2017. Driving our encouraging top line momentum are improvements in sales and persistency. For the full year, our sales growth is solid, up 16% off a low sales result in 2015 while our pricing remained sound. Just as important, renewal persistency has been improving as needed price increases have moderated throughout 2016. Bottom line, I am pleased to see signs of growth reemerge while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. 
In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters. Third quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were down 5% from a year ago due to timing of first-year sales in the mid/large market. That said, we have pointed to a strong sales pipeline, which we are seeing convert to new sales. As a result, first year sales increased 41% sequentially. With several recent wins scheduled for fourth quarter implementation, we expect 2016's net flows to exceed 2015 levels. This quarter generated nearly $100 million of positive flows and have had positive flows in 6 of the past 7 quarters. Our strong results and optimistic growth outlook are being driven by several positive factors, including: distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity in the small market; the launch of our enhanced small market director product, which is level fee and DOL ready; and lastly, investments in our digital and mobile customer experience that is resonating in the marketplace. To this point, since launching our new click-to-contribute functionality in June, we have seen 12,000 participants take action to each increase their contribution rates. These tangible outcomes, combined with our alignment to the fastest-growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets through our high-touch service model, give us a lot of positive momentum. 
Shifting to investment results. Our alternative investments had a solid quarter with a 12% annualized return, above our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the increase over the prior quarter. We expect to further increase our alternatives earnings over time as we continue to grow the portfolio to our long-term target of 1.5% of invested assets and further shift the mix towards private equity. In the third quarter, we put new money to work at an average yield of 3.6%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter. The decrease in new money rates was consistent with the drop in treasury rates as we invested approximately 200 basis points over the average 10-year treasury. Lastly, the investment portfolio remains high quality with below investment-grade assets representing just 5.4% of our fixed income portfolio. 
Before wrapping up, let me provide a few comments on the DOL as there have been a fair number of developments over the past few months. First, as we have noted, most of our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the Best Interest Contract Exemption to serve retirement savers and will offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is the decision we made with LFN and shared with our advisers early on. While some distributors have publicly announced their intentions, many have been slower to formally communicate their decisions. That said, if you listened to recent earnings calls, you would have heard a number of the large wire houses imply that choice has always been fundamental to their firm's practice and they do not expect that to change. Let me provide some specifics on what we expect. Of our 10 largest VA partners, we believe 9 will use the Best Interest Contract Exemption for commissions. Also of note, 85% to 90% of the sales from our top VA partners will -- our top 25 VA partners, will also allow commissions. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing significant interest in fee-based annuity product offerings with fee-based annuity currently representing a small portion of industry sales. We see this as a big distribution growth opportunity. As I already mentioned, we're seeing some distribution partners narrow manufacturers and product offerings. We expect to benefit from this, given our leading wholesaler force, the breadth of our customer solutions and our consistent market presence. In fact, we're already seeing early signs of this as a leading distributor announced that effective January 1, they will be paring down the number of products and manufacturers they offer. Proudly, we have more products retained on their shelf than any other manufacturer, once again proof that we will be well positioned in a post-DOL world. 
So in closing, I'm pleased with our record results, which include underlying EPS growth of 10%, consistent with the EPS growth targets we have provided. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, we are taking both short- and long-term actions to manage them. Also, when I look around the industry, I continue to believe we have a clear and straightforward story. We're not in the crosshairs of dual regulation. We are not undertaking uncertain transformational changes. We are not distracted by precarious run-off businesses while 100% -- our 100% domestic footprint better protects us from global macro uncertainty. Our business model is simple, manufacture only retail products, lead with distribution and product breadth, target the fastest-growing segments of the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses. Most importantly, our business model has a track record of financial success and stability, and we see opportunities to respond to market headwinds to drive further shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,402248314,1074703,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve as",1354,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year. 
First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions. Following last year's lowering of our long-term earned rate assumption by 50 basis points, this year's annual review had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a modest positive impact to operating earnings of $5 million or $0.02 per share. 
A few comments on this year's review process. Favorable items this year included variable annuity policyholder behavior and expenses. These items more than offset the impact of lower interest rates and a 30 basis point decrease in our separate account return assumption, which now stands at 7.3%. It is also worth noting that we did not unlock a reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against weak equity markets. So the bottom line related to our annual review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlying in our balance sheet continue to be sound. 
Outside of the annual assumption review, other notable items included a $0.02 benefit in Group Protection from a balance sheet review that I will discuss later and another $0.02 in other operations, largely from tax adjustments. One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics, and that is variable investment income was strong this quarter. Results ran $18 million after tax and back or $0.08 per share ahead of our 5-year average for prepayment-related income and our 10% return assumption on alternatives. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Booked value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $56.65, up 10% as we continue to consistently compound book value. Operating ROE was outstanding at 13.7% while our ROE for the first 9 months ends just shy of 12%. Expense discipline contributed to G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized declining by more than 2%, in line with our full year results. We continue to be pleased with our ability to effectively manage G&A in a period of slower growth for the Life Insurance industry. Consolidated net flows were positive, and with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we entered the fourth quarter with a slight tailwind. Our balance sheet and capital generation remain important sources of strength, and it enabled us to repurchase $200 million of stock this quarter. Lastly, net income for the quarter was $2 per share, exceeding operating EPS, driven by very strong performance from our variable annuity hedge program, which reported $82 million of realized gains. Net income results also included $28 million of realized losses related to investments. 
Now to business results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $240 million, down 2% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. Net unfavorable items this quarter totaled $10 million, primarily related to lowering our separate account return assumption as policyholder behavior assumptions, which have resulted in significant charges for many of our competitors, were once again favorable. 
Equity market strength over the past year has more than offset the negative net flows that Dennis mentioned. As a result, end-of-period account balance has increased 6%, which further improved our risk profile as our guaranteed living benefit, net amount at risk as a percentage of account value, is less than 1%. Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA of 77 basis points is consistent with recent periods while ROE came in at 21%, again an outstanding result. So the financial impact of changes to assumptions was minimal, another testament to our established and strong foundation in the Annuity business. Earnings continue to be high quality. The business is well managed, and we expect to build on our success in the future. 
Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $167 million included net favorable items of $17 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings were consistent with the prior year period. Also included in the current quarter's results was $9 million of the favorable variable investment income I noted upfront and strong mortality experience, which largely reflected typical third quarter seasonality. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, came in at 131 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 7 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. Lastly, total in-force face amount increased 5% with average account values up 4%. Both these measures are in line with recent performance and support our mid-single-digit organic growth expectations. 
Group Protection earnings of $28 million marked the highest quarterly earnings since 2009. Included in this quarter's result were net favorable items of $5 million from a review of disability reserves and DAC assumptions. Excluding this adjustment, our earnings increased 35% and our operating margin was 4.7%. Our nonmedical loss ratio, excluding the disability reserve refinements, improved to 70.2% from 74.5% in the prior year quarter. This 400 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all product lines, life, disability and dental. As Dennis noted, top line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story, and we are encouraged that nonmedical premiums grew compared to the second quarter. This marked the first sequential increase in premiums in 2 years. Given these successes, we expect our positive momentum to continue. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $32 million compared to $42million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by $2 million from our annual assumption review while the prior year period benefited by $2 million. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 148 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 12 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point expectation. For the quarter, our ROA was 23 basis points, consistent with our year-to-date result. Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows. When combined with positive changes in the equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to $57 billion. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are positioned well to further increase account values and earnings in the Retirement business. 
Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. As I noted upfront, our capital position remains very strong and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to remain one of the best capital return stories in the Life Insurance space. This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares, and year-to-date, we have deployed 76% of our operating earnings towards buybacks and dividends, above our annual target of 50% to 55%. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by our announced 16% increase in our shareholder dividend. As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up over $500 million from the prior year period even after sending a little over $1 billion to the holding company. We also estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%. Lastly, our holding company cash ended the quarter at $546 million. 
So to conclude, we reported record operating earnings and EPS. Net income was also a record and exceeded operating income as the hedge program had an excellent quarter. We grew book value per share by 10%, and our ROE approached 14%. This year's annual review had a modest positive impact on our operating earnings, and enterprise discipline -- enterprise expense discipline continues. At the business level, Annuities continues to report strong returns; earnings in our Life business reflected strong mortality experience; RPS results were consistent with recent quarters; and Group Protection posted its best earnings quarter in 7 years. These solid results have drove consistently strong capital generation. And when you combine that with the strength of our balance sheet, it allows me to conclude my comments by stating that we expect to continue actively returning capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris."

We've, I guess, heard in -- on the first 2 calls this morning, both MET and PRU, that they may be taking -- or maybe at least articulating a slightly different approach to the way they think about risk-based capital and capital supporting the VA blocks and really thinking about the targeted risk-based capital ratio of 400% for everything ex variable annuities and then thinking about variable annuity capital relative to a CTE97 or 98 kind of level. If we thought the same way or in a similar fashion for Lincoln, does it -- what kind of impact does that have? I think given the captive, your risk-based capital of about 500% is still something we can think about relative to that 400% longer term. Is that reasonable?"

Ultimately, w",343,"John, thanks for the question. That's a very broad question, so let me come at it this way. When I think about how we develop capital that's appropriate for all of our businesses, I don't think about it as any different business-to-business. Ultimately, we're looking at the stresses that can impact each and every business, and that should ultimately drive the amount of capital that we put behind each of those businesses. In the case of the variable annuity business, we express that with a CTE measure -- and we talk about capitalizing that business to a CTE-98 measure. The stresses are going to be different in a Life business, for instance, where you're primarily talking about credit stress, or in Annuity business, where, once again, you're talking about credit stress. So while these stresses or the potential impacts may be different, the fundamental underlying approach for how we develop our capital is consistent across all of the businesses. We then convey those approaches typically through an expression of an RBC percentage. As I mentioned, we were at 500% at the end of the quarter. As I've said in the past, we have a very strong balance sheet, but I wouldn't anticipate taking some piece of that balance sheet and doing an outsized share buyback, for instance, in a particular quarter. I think we do have excess capital on our balance sheet if we wanted to do something like some M&A, probably in the range of $500 million to $750 million. But I don't think that when you take everything, like ratings, into account, that we would take a similar amount of capital and suddenly put that into buybacks. That being said, we continue to do a strong amount of buybacks each and every year, and I'd point out that our shares went down nearly 8% year-over-year indicating that strong capital return story that we have been. So John, that's how I would think about capital that we used to support the business and how we ultimately express that as an RBC percentage."

This quarter, we had roughly, in total, what I would say, is about $15 million of favorable mortality over a full year's average quarter with about 2/3 of that being normal seasonality and the other third being experienced better than that. When you look -- if you try to break that down into percentages, the actual expected for the quarter, John, came in about 95%, 96%, I believe it was.

We had a good mortality quarter, which benefited us by roughly $15 million. I also mentioned that, additionally, we had about half of that $18 million of variable investment income, Or $9 million was located in the Life line. So overall, it was a strong quarter that featured good mortality. I would also note that when we think about seasonality, we think about it being negative in the first quarter and then getting it back in the third and fourth quarter. So our base expectation, as we go into fourth quarter, is that mortality in terms of, once again, an average quarter would be a little better than that full year's average quarter. In terms of the Group business, $28 million of earnings, I'd noted that $5 million of earnings came from the review of reserves and DAC. So if you took that out, you'd get $23 million or a 4.7% margin. At the end of the day, Jimmy, it was a good quarter. If you go business by business and look at the loss ratios that we reported and if you adjusted those loss ratios for the reserve review, you would see that every line, life, disability and dental, improved from the prior year and improved from the preceding quarter. So it was undoubtedly a quarter consistent with what we've talked about, which is the repricing of this business has been done and is largely behind us, and you're starting to see that feed through to the results. When you look business by business, I would say it was -- a strongest quarter would've been in the life business. And when you look forward, I would -- I think if you look in the stats up, Jimmy, the loss ratio in the Life business was 66%. I'd expect that to trend up a little over time. And the adjusted loss ratio for the disability business would've been 74%. I'd expect that to trend down a little bit over time. When you wrap it altogether, we had an adjusted loss ratio of 70.2%. I'd put that on the good side of an expected quarter for this business. And I think I'm back -- if you went back to the first quarter, I talked about a 1% to 2% sort of margin around an expected mean, and I think that this quarter was on the good side of the -- of that expected mean."

What we know now and what I said during our remarks, which I know you heard but I'll repeat them, is that there's a big group of advisers that haven't been doing the VA business because the VA business didn't have -- had more commission-based financial advisers and fee-based advisers. We think that's an opportunity for growth. I think there's a very significant population of financial advisers, if the industry and Lincoln provides better fee-based product structures, that they'll participate. So that's one direction. The -- is there going to be a significant shift from commissions in the traditional marketplace where it has been commissions? Is there going to be a significant shift from commission -- excuse me, compensation to fee-based compensation? Again, I think we have to wait and see if that's going to take place. We're focused on -- I think all of our distribution partners are focused on what is in the best interest of both their clients -- in terms of the type of fees or the type of compensation that they charge. And as we have talked about on numerous occasions, for insurance contracts where the advice cycle is mostly upfront, it seems like commissions make the most sense, both for the adviser who's providing the advice upfront, and it's less expensive oftentimes for the client because there's not this ongoing management fee that's really in long-dated insurance contracts, not as necessary as, say for example, in -- with an adviser who's helping with asset mix on a daily or -- and quarterly basis. So there are -- and fee-based -- excuse me, and in the industry in general, the movement to passive investments is -- has been pretty significant. Whether or not that continues, we'll have to see. But we want to be in a position to meet that need as well. So we'll have to see, but we think we're well positioned no matter what direction the overall marketplace takes."

In general, I think we're typically going to be supportive of changes that we see as improvements to how we account for our products. And undoubtedly, what the NAIC, in conjunction with Oliver Wyman is working on, is an improvement in how variable annuities are accounted for, both from a reserve and a capital standpoint. It's an improvement because it's moving from what I would describe as more of a book value approach to what I would describe as more of an economic value approach, and that is a good change because that's how we hedge the products when we think about that risk. So we are supportive of what Oliver Wyman is doing. We believe we are well positioned. If you go piece by piece through the proposal, you're going to find some that are positives and some that are negatives relative to the current approach to reserving that the NAIC has. For instance, I think the linking the returns to the risk-free rates would probably be a negative. But on the other hand, hedge accounting for derivative assets is a definite positive. When you add them all together, we continue to believe we're well positioned. I think one other thing that leaves me feeling very good about how we're positioned for the -- any changes that might come about is what you see with our policyholder behavior. As I mentioned in my script, you've seen very large charges across the industry from companies who've had to bring their policyholder behavior assumptions more in line with experience. You haven't seen that at Lincoln. In fact, if you look over the last 5 years, the sum total of impacts from unlocking our policyholder behavior assumptions is a positive. It's been a positive pretty much each and every year. So I think the fact that our assumptions are well linked to our actual experience, and always have been, puts us in a very good position when you think about what the NAIC is working on."
