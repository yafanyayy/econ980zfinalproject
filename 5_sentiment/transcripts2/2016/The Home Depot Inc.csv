We also recorded the highest net earnings in company history. In fiscal 2015, earnings per share grew 15.9% to $5.46. Sales for the fourth quarter were $21 billion, up 9.5% from last year. Comp sales were up 7.1% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 8.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.17 in the fourth quarter. Our strong sales performance was driven by a continued moderate housing recovery, exciting merchandising events, solid execution and a benefit from favorable weather. We continue to see broad-based growth across the store and our geographies. All 3 of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps in the fourth quarter, led by our Southern division, which posted low double-digit comps, while our Northern and Western divisions recorded high single-digit comps. In all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw a mid-single to low double-digit comps in the quarter. 
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 49 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted high single-digit comps in local currency for a total of 17 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Canada ended the year with sales over $7 billion in local currency, reinforcing our position as the #1 home improvement retailer in Canada. I would like to congratulate Jeff Kinard, who was recently promoted to President of Home Depot Canada. Jeff is a 19-year Home Depot veteran with strong operational and merchandising experience, which has allowed him to be instrumental in our success in Canada. 
While there were strength in seasonal holiday decor, Gift Center and Black Friday events, core categories were also a strong contributor to our performance. Both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. As Ted will detail, all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both Pro and DIY categories, with Pro outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. You will recall during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Interline Brands, a leading national distributor of maintenance repair and operations or MRO products. We told you that in the second 90 days of integration would be about building out specific business cases. We are moving forward on a number of exciting sales-driving initiatives that have been identified through this process. For example, we will soon begin offering our exclusive paint brands to Interline's multifamily operators. We have a good sense of what we need to accomplish over the next 18 to 24 months in order to fully realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total Pro opportunity. The retail environment is evolving and the blending of the digital and physical worlds remain a common theme. We are responsive to these trends, building out our interconnected capabilities and investing in content, site improvement and improved mobile experiences to solve for a frictionless customer experience. We continue to see healthy sales from our digital business while also seeing year-over-year improvement in customer satisfaction scores. For the year, our online business grew by approximately $1 billion, a growth rate of over 25% versus the prior year. A significant portion of this online growth leverages the physical store assets that we have as over 40% of our online orders are picked up in stores. This is a testament to the power of our interconnected strategy. 
At our December investor conference, we highlighted our plans to further optimize our supply chain to what we call Supply Chain Synchronization or Project Sync. We have been piloting Project Sync in Houston for some time and have now begun to roll out in a few other regions. Though it is early days, we have seen benefit in transportation savings, inventory turn and a reduction in product lead times. We appreciate the efforts of our cross functional teams internally, as well as the increased collaboration with our external partners as all parties involved are working together to develop and adopt engineered flow schedules that serve as the foundation of Project Sync. 
Turning to the macro environment, while 2016 consensus U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated, we continue to see positive signs in the housing data, with home price appreciation, housing turnover and household formation being the key drivers of growth for our business. We expect 2016 comp growth of approximately 4.5%. Carol will take you through the details, but currency headwinds could result in lower total company comp growth. Therefore, we expect total company comp growth of approximately 3.7% to 4.5% and corresponding diluted earnings per share of $6.12 to $6.18. 
Today, our board announced a 17% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.69 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders. We will invest to sustain and grow our business and return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
The power of The Home Depot begins with our company's strong culture and commitment to our values. I want to thank our Associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers; and I'd also like to congratulate Amory Campbell, who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President of U.S. stores. With more than 30 years with the company, Amory brings a deep understanding of Home Depot's operations, culture and customers to the role.  Based on this quarter's results, 100% of our stores qualified for Successring, our profit-sharing program for our hourly Associates. This is our largest second half payout to date and we look forward to continuing this momentum in 2016. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw strength across our entire store, as well as continued growth in our online business. Sales of miter weather and great events including the strong Black Friday and Gift Center. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, appliances, tools, building materials had double-digit comps in the quarter. Lighting, plumbing, hardware and indoor garden were above the company average and decor was in line with the company average. Outdoor garden, millwork, lumber, kitchen and bath, paint, electrical and flooring posted mid-single-digit positive comps.  Pro heavy category saw significant growth during the quarter as we saw double-digit comps in siding, pneumatics, circuit protection, sensing, fasteners and exterior doors. A recent assortment update in roofing continues to drive excellent results, as we saw double-digit comps in roofing in the fourth quarter. And we continue to see strength in core maintenance and repair categories with double-digit comps in pumps, security lighting, water heaters, electrical tools, construction adhesives, ladders and cox. Cleaning, bath, fixtures,  door locks and pipe and fittings also had comps above the company average. We believe that more favorable weather trends in the quarter aided sales growth by approximately $100 million. Our customers took advantage of the milder weather and were able to complete more outdoor projects. For example, we saw double-digit comp sales in pressure washers, hard scapes, mowers, outdoor power, concrete and pressure-treated decking. Black Friday, Gift Center and storage events provided great values and were well-received by our customers. Our strong black Friday helped drive double-digit comps in categories like portable power and appliances. Our Gift Center performed extremely well and we saw double-digit comps in tool storage, power tool accessories and hand tools. In addition, our Associates rallied behind our decorative holiday offering, resulting in comps above the company average. In the fourth quarter, total comp transactions grew by 5%, and for the year, we set a new transaction record with over $1.5 billion total transactions. In the quarter, comp ticket increased 2%. Our comp ticket increase reflects about 22 basis points of contraction due to commodity price deflation in products such as lumber and copper. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.8% for the fourth quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 11.9% in the fourth quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, roofing and special order kitchens. Big-ticket was also driven by several installation service categories such as roofing, sheds and countertops. 
Now let me turn our attention to the first quarter. In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we will be resetting our door lock assortment in the first quarter. Using assortment planning tools, we were able to more effectively cluster our door lock assortment around styles, finishes and brands. In addition, we have a new merchandising approach that highlights our brands and their complete collections. Our reset will include great innovative products such as this laid connect and Quikset 915 electronic locks. For our Pro customer, we are introducing new and exclusive products from Milwaukee, DEWALT, RYOBI and RIDGID, all leaders in professional tools. The new Milwaukee MAT with one key is a revolutionary technology that provides users the ability to control tool settings, track the location of their tools and manage their tool and equipment inventory with their wireless devices. This innovative technology gives our Pro customers the trusted power of the Milwaukee brand with added benefits to make them more productive. Among big-box retailers, the Milwaukee MAT with one Key Can only be found at Home Depot. 
In addition to great new products, we are gearing up for the spring selling season. We are excited about our exclusive offers from Webber, Nexgrill and Kitchenaid and a large assortment online offers numerous options from infrared gas grills to smokers. Our patio assortment continues to expand, including new dining set designs from Hampton Bay and an enhanced offering of patio accessories. For the gardener, we are excited about our expanded selection of exclusive organics from Doctor Earth and Black Magic. Our spring Black Friday event will once again offer amazing values for our customers. The stores will be loaded with exciting products and exclusives on items like live goods, grills and outdoor power equipment. We're looking forward to a great spring season. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the fourth quarter, sales were $21 billion, a 9.5% decrease [ph] from last year. Comp sales were positive of 7.1% for the quarter, with comps of 6.3% in November, 8.6% in December and 6.7% in January. A continuing strength in the U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps in the quarter by approximately $350 million or 1.8%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 8.9% for the quarter, with comps of 8.1% in November, 10.6% in December and 8.2% in January. For the year, our sales increased 6.4% to $88.5 billion and total company comp sales were positive 5.6%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.1%. During the year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales growth by approximately $1.4 billion or 1.6%. 
Our gross margin was 34.1% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 24 basis points from last year and in line with our plan. The change in gross margin was driven primarily by the following factors: First, we experienced 15 basis points of gross margin expansion due to productivity within our supply chain and lower fuel costs. Second, we had 26 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline Brands. And third, we had 13 basis points of gross margin contraction due to a change in the mix of products sold, including a higher penetration of lower margin product category like appliances. For the year we experienced 6 basis points of gross margin expansion. 
In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 96 basis points from last year to 22%. Our operating expenses were $90 million over our plan. We had some unexpected expenses associated with store maintenance, snow removal and our data breach. Further, given our sales outperformance to plan, we increased our accrual for management bonus and Success Sharing. For fiscal 2015, our operating expense as a percent of sales was 20.9%, a decrease of 65 basis points from fiscal 2014. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 12.1%, and for the year was 13.3%. In the fourth quarter, interest and other expense was $236 million, an increase of $138 million from last year. The year-over-year increase reflects 2 items. First, last year we recorded a $111 million pretax gain on the sale of HD supply common stock that did not repeat this year. And second, interest expense was $29 million higher than last year due primarily to higher long-term debt balances. Our income tax provision rate for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 was 36.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.17, an increase of 11.4% from last year. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $5.46, an increase of 15.9% compared to fiscal 2014. 
Now moving to some additional highlights, during the fourth quarter, we opened 1 new store in Mexico, bringing in our total store count at the end of the year to 2,274 stores. At the end of the year, selling square footage was 237 million Up slightly from last year, and sales per-square foot increased 5.2% to $371. At the end of the year, inventory was $11.8 billion, up $730 million from a year ago. On a currency neutral basis, inventory dollars grew by $872 million. Inventory turns were 4.9x, up from 4.7x last year. Payables grew $758 million from last year. On a currency neutral basis, payables were up $834 million. 
Moving on to capital allocation, in 2015, we generated approximately $9.4 billion of cash from operations and used that cash as well as proceeds from $4 billion of incremental long-term debt issuances to invest in our business, to repurchase our shares and pay dividends to our shareholders. During the year, we invested approximately $3.2 billion back into the business through capital expenditures and the acquisition of Interline Brands. Further we repurchased $7 billion or approximately $59 million of our outstanding shares, including $2 billion or 16.2 million shares in the fourth quarter. Finally, we paid $3 billion in dividends. Our capital allocation philosophy supports our commitment to deliver high returns on invested capital. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt equity for the trailing fourth quarter, return on invested capital was 28%, 310 basis points higher than at the end of fiscal year 2014. One more comment on capital allocation: for this month, we refinanced approximately $3 billion of our long-term debt that is coming due in March 2016. 
This morning, we issued a press release with our guidance for fiscal 2016. I want to take a few comments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP of fiscal 2016 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2015. As we look to 2015 [ph] we are projecting total company comps of approximately 4.5%. Our comp forecast is based on U.S. GDP growth estimate of 2.1% plus continued recovery in the housing market. With the benefit of 5 new stores and a full year of sales from Interline Brands, we project total sales growth of approximately 6%. Our 2016 sales forecast is based on 2015 average U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates. The U.S. dollar is currently stronger than the average exchange rate. As a result, we are providing a range of sales, comp sales and diluted earnings per share growth to reflect the difference between 2015 average exchange rates and current exchange rates. If currency exchange rates remain where they are today, this would cause a negative impact to fiscal 2016 [ph] net sales growth of approximately $800 million, dropping our projected total sales growth rate from 6% to 5.1% and our projected comp sales growth from 4.5% to 3.7%. As we discussed during our December investor conference, we are planning our gross margin rate to remain flat to what we reported in fiscal 2015. We don't expect our gross margin rate to be materially impacted by exchange rates. 
On a currency-neutral basis, we are forecasting our expenses to grow at approximately 40% of the rate of our sales growth rate, less than what we experienced in fiscal 2015, as we had $128 million of net bridge-related expenses in fiscal 2015 that should not repeat in 2016. For the year, we project that our operating margin will grow by approximately 70 basis points. We don't expect our operating margin to be materially impacted by exchange rates. For the year, we anticipate our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. We expect our diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 13% to $6.18, but if exchange rates remain where they are today, our projected diluted earnings per share would be approximately $6.12.  Our earnings per share guidance includes our plan to repurchase approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares during the year, using excess cash. 
For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $10 billion. Our 2016 capital spending plan is approximately $1.64 billion, a 9% increase from what we spent in fiscal 2015 in support of our strategic initiatives and to maintain our aging store base. We'll also use our cash to repurchase $5 billion of shares and pay $3.4 billion of dividends. As Craig mentioned, we just announced a 17% increase in our quarterly dividend, which equates to an annual dividend of $2.76 in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% [ph]. Our commitment to shareholder returns continues to be a hallmark of The Home Depot. 
So we thank you for your participation in today's call, and, Nicole, we are now ready for questions."

First, what I'm going to do is walk you from what we exited in the U.S. a comp of 7.1% to the guidance of 4.5%. That's a 260 basis point delta. And the drivers of that are threefold. First, it starts with GDP. We're using GDP growth forecast of 2.1%. GDP in the United States in 2015 was 2.4%. So there's 30 basis points coming off the top because it's slower GDP. Secondly, on home prices, we anticipate home prices to be up next year, 3.5%. That's good. It's down from the growth that we experienced in 2015 of 5.4%. So that's another 30 basis points of growth coming off the top. And then there's 20 basis points of market share coming off because we don't feel market share into our growth forecast. So that gives you 4.5% comps estimate for 2016. A few other housing numbers since you asked. I gave you the home price estimate that you were thinking. We anticipate housing turnover to be up 4.4% of units. Household formation to be up considerably. We're forecasting 1.9  million household forms, that's a lot unless 1.3 billion households. The other thing we're really getting understanding is the impact of the age of the housing stock. As you know, 65% of the homes in the United States are older than 30 years and there's external research that shows spending on older homes is higher. [indiscernible] would suggest something like 7.5% higher, our own internal research suggests it's 8% higher. So the aging housing starts bodes very well for us. If we can take back to their last mild recession, I'm talking about but take you back to the last mild recession of 2001, housing start was a lot younger 15 years ago. So this is a good historic growth."

Comp sales were up 7.1% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 8.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.17 in the fourth quarter. Our strong sales performance was driven by a continued moderate housing recovery, exciting merchandising events, solid execution and a benefit from favorable weather.

All 3 of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps in the fourth quarter, led by our Southern division, which posted low double-digit comps, while our Northern and Western divisions recorded high single-digit comps.

Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 49 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted high single-digit comps in local currency for a total of 17 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Canada ended the year with sales over $7 billion in local currency, reinforcing our position as the #1 home improvement retailer in Canada. I would like to congratulate Jeff Kinard, who was recently promoted to President of Home Depot Canada. Jeff is a 19-year Home Depot veteran with strong operational and merchandising experience, which has allowed him to be instrumental in our success in Canada.
While there was strength in seasonal holiday decor, Gift Center and Black Friday events. Core categories were also a strong contributor to our performance. Both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. As Ted will detail, all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both Pro and DIY categories, with Pro outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. You will recall during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Interline Brands, a leading national distributor of maintenance repair and operations or MRO products. We told you that in the second 90 days of integration would be about building out specific business cases. We are moving forward on a number of exciting sales-driving initiatives that have been identified through this process. For example, we will soon begin offering our exclusive paint brands to Interline's multi-family operators. We have a good sense of what we need to accomplish over the next 18 to 24 months in order to fully realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total Pro opportunity.
The retail environment is evolving and the blending of the digital and physical worlds remain a common theme. We are responsive to these trends, building out our interconnected capabilities and investing in content, site improvement and improved mobile experiences to solve for a frictionless customer experience. We continue to see healthy sales from our digital business while also seeing year-over-year improvement in customer satisfaction scores.
For the year, our online business grew by approximately $1 billion, a growth rate of over 25% versus the prior year. A significant portion of this online growth leverages the physical store assets that we have as over 40% of our online orders are picked up in stores. This is a testament to the power of our interconnected strategy.
At our December investor conference, we highlighted our plans to further optimize our supply chain to what we call Supply Chain Synchronization or Project Sync. We have been piloting Project Sync in Houston for some time and have now begun to roll out in a few other regions. Though it is early days, we have seen benefit in transportation savings, inventory turn and a reduction in product lead times. We appreciate the efforts of our cross functional teams internally, as well as the increased collaboration with our external partners as all parties involved are working together to develop and adopt engineered flow schedules that serve as the foundation of Project Sync.
Turning to the macro environment, while 2016 consensus U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated, we continue to see positive signs in the housing data, with home price appreciation, housing turnover and household formation being the key drivers of growth for our business. We expect 2016 comp growth of approximately 4.5%. Carol will take you through the details, but currency headwinds could result in lower total company comp growth. Therefore, we expect total company comp growth of approximately 3.7% to 4.5% and corresponding diluted earnings per share of $6.12 to $6.18.
Today, our board announced a 17% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.69 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders. We will invest to sustain and grow our business and return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
The power of The Home Depot begins with our company's strong culture and commitment to our values. I want to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers; and I'd also like to congratulate Amory Campbell, who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President of U.S. stores. With more than 30 years with the company, Amory brings a deep understanding of Home Depot's operations, culture and customers to the role.  Based on this quarter's results, 100% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. This is our largest second-half payout to date and we look forward to continuing this momentum in 2016.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw strength across the entire store, as well as continued growth in our online business. Sales were hitted [ph] by milder weather and great events, including the strong Black Friday and Gift Center. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, appliances, tools, building materials had double-digit comps in the quarter. Lighting, plumbing, hardware and indoor garden were above the company average and decor was in line with the company average. Outdoor garden, millwork, lumber, kitchen and bath, paint, electrical and flooring posted mid-single-digit positive comps.  Pro heavy category saw significant growth during the quarter as we saw double-digit comps in siding, pneumatics, circuit protection, sensing, fasteners and exterior doors. A recent assortment update in roofing continues to drive excellent results, as we saw double-digit comps in roofing in the fourth quarter. And we continue to see strength in core maintenance and repair categories with double-digit comps in pumps, security lighting, water heaters, electrical tools, construction adhesives, ladders and [indiscernible]. Cleaning, bath, fixtures, door locks and pipe and fittings also had comps above the company average. We believe that more favorable weather trends in the quarter aided sales growth by approximately $100 million. Our customers took advantage of the milder weather and were able to complete more outdoor projects. For example, we saw double-digit comp sales in pressure washers, hard scapes, mowers, outdoor power, concrete and pressure-treated decking. Black Friday, Gift Center and storage events provided great values and were well-received by our customers. Our strong black Friday helped to drive double-digit comps in categories like portable power and appliances. Our Gift Center performed extremely well and we saw double-digit comps in tool storage, power tool accessories and hand tools. In addition, our associates rallied behind our decorative holiday offering, resulting in comps above the company average. In the fourth quarter, total comp transactions grew by 5%, and for the year, we set a new transaction record with over $1.5 billion total transactions. In the quarter, comp ticket increased 2%. Our comp ticket increase reflects about 32 basis points of contraction due to commodity price deflation in products such as lumber and copper. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.8% for the fourth quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 11.9% in the fourth quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, roofing and special order kitchens. Big-ticket was also driven by several installation service categories such as roofing, sheds and countertops.
Now let me turn our attention to the first quarter. In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we will be resetting our door lock assortment in the first quarter. Using our assortment planning tools, we were able to more effectively cluster our door lock assortment around styles, finishes and brands. In addition, we have a new merchandising approach that highlights our brands and their complete collections. Our [indiscernible] include great innovative products such as the Schlage Connect and Kwikset 915 electronic locks. For our Pro customer, we are introducing new and exclusive products from Milwaukee, DEWALT, RYOBI and RIDGID, all leaders in professional tools. The new Milwaukee M18 FUEL with ONE KEY is a revolutionary technology that provides users the ability to control tool settings, track the location of their tools and manage their tool and equipment inventory with their wireless devices. This innovative technology gives our Pro customers the trusted power of the Milwaukee brand with added benefits to make them more productive. Among big-box retailers, the Milwaukee M18 FUEL with ONE KEY can only be found at the Home Depot. 
In addition to great new products, we are gearing up for the spring selling season. We are excited about our exclusive grill offers from Weber, Nexgrill and KitchenAid and our large assortment online offers numerous options from infrared gas grills to smokers. Our patio assortment continues to expand, including new dining set designs from Hampton Bay and an enhanced offering of patio accessories.
For the gardener, we are excited about our expanded selection of exclusive organics from Dr. Earth and Black Magic. Our spring Black Friday event will once again offer amazing values for our customers. The stores will be loaded with exciting products and exclusives on items like live goods, grills and outdoor power equipment. We're looking forward to a great spring season.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the fourth quarter, sales were $21 billion, a 9.5% increase from last year. Comp sales were positive 7.1% for the quarter, with comps of 6.3% in November, 8.6% in December and 6.7% in January. A continuing st",1258,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, sales were $21 billion, a 9.5% increase from last year. Comp sales were positive 7.1% for the quarter, with comps of 6.3% in November, 8.6% in December and 6.7% in January. A continuing strength in the U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps in the quarter by approximately $350 million or 1.8%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 8.9% for the quarter, with comps of 8.1% in November, 10.6% in December and 8.2% in January.
For the year, our sales increased 6.4% to $88.5 billion and total company comp sales were positive 5.6%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.1%. During the year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales growth by approximately $1.4 billion or 1.6%.
Our gross margin was 34.1% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 24 basis points from last year and in line with our plan. The change in gross margin was driven primarily by the following factors: first, we experienced 15 basis points of gross margin expansion due to productivity within our supply chain and lower fuel costs; second, we had 26 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline Brands; and third, we had 13 basis points of gross margin contraction due to a change in the mix of products sold, including a higher penetration of lower margin product category like appliances. For the year we experienced 6 basis points of gross margin expansion.
In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 96 basis points from last year to 22%. Our operating expenses were $90 million over our plan. We had some unexpected expenses associated with store maintenance, snow removal and our data breach. Further, given our sales outperformance to plan, we increased our accrual for management bonus and Success Sharing. For fiscal 2015, our operating expense as a percent of sales was 20.9%, a decrease of 65 basis points from fiscal 2014. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 12.1%, and for the year was 13.3%. In the fourth quarter, interest and other expense was $236 million, an increase of $138 million from last year. The year-over-year increase reflects 2 items: first, last year we recorded a $111 million pretax gain on the sale of HD supply common stock that did not repeat this year; and second, interest expense was $29 million higher than last year due primarily to higher long-term debt balances.
Our income tax provision rate for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 was 36.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.17, an increase of 11.4% from last year. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $5.46, an increase of 15.9% compared to fiscal 2014.
Now moving to some additional highlights, during the fourth quarter, we opened 1 new store in Mexico, bringing our total store count at the end of the year to 2,274 stores. At the end of the year, selling square footage was 237 million Up slightly from last year, and sales per-square foot increased 5.2% to $371. At the end of the year, inventory was $11.8 billion, up $730 million from a year ago. On a currency neutral basis, inventory dollars grew by $872 million. Inventory turns were 4.9x, up from 4.7x last year. Payables grew $758 million from last year. On a currency neutral basis, payables were up $834 million.
Moving on to capital allocation, in 2015, we generated approximately $9.4 billion of cash from operations and used that cash as well as proceeds from $4 billion of incremental long-term debt issuances to invest in our business, to repurchase our shares and pay dividends to our shareholders. During the year, we invested approximately $3.2 billion back into the business through capital expenditures and the acquisition of Interline Brands. Further we repurchased $7 billion or approximately $59 million of our outstanding shares, including $2 billion or 16.2 million shares in the fourth quarter. Finally, we paid $3 billion in dividends. Our capital allocation philosophy supports our commitment to deliver high returns on invested capital. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing fourth quarter, return on invested capital was 28%, 310 basis points higher than at the end of fiscal 2014. One more comment on capital allocation: for this month, we refinanced approximately $3 billion of our long-term debt that is coming due in March 2016.
This morning, we issued a press release with our guidance for fiscal 2016. I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP for fiscal 2016 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2015. As we look to 2016, we are projecting total company comps of approximately 4.5%. Our comp forecast is based on U.S. GDP growth estimates of 2.1% plus continued recovery in the housing markets. With the benefit of 5 new stores and a full year of sales from Interline Brands, we project total sales growth of approximately 6%. Our 2016 sales forecast is based on 2015 average U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates. The U.S. dollar is currently stronger than the average exchange rate. As a result, we are providing a range of sales, comp sales and diluted earnings per share growth to reflect the difference between 2015 average exchange rates and current exchange rates. If currency exchange rates remain where they are today, this would cause a negative impact to fiscal 2016 net sales growth of approximately $800 million, dropping our projected total sales growth rate from 6% to 5.1% and our projected comp sales growth from 4.5% to 3.7%. As we discussed during our December investor conference, we are planning our gross margin rate to remain flat to what we reported in fiscal 2015. We don't expect our gross margin rate to be materially impacted by exchange rates.
On a currency-neutral basis, we are forecasting our expenses to grow at approximately 40% of the rate of our sales growth rate, less than what we experienced in fiscal 2015, as we had $128 million of net bridge-related expenses in fiscal 2015 that should not repeat in 2016.
For the year, we project that our operating margin will grow by approximately 70 basis points. We don't expect our operating margin to be materially impacted by exchange rates. For the year, we anticipate our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. We expect our diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 13% to $6.18, but if exchange rates remain where they are today, our projected diluted earnings per share would be approximately $6.12.  Our earnings per share guidance include our plans to repurchase approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares during the year, using excess cash.
For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $10 billion. Our 2016 capital spending plan is approximately $1.64 billion, a 9% increase from what we spent in fiscal 2015 in support of our strategic initiatives and to maintain our aging store base. We'll also use our cash to repurchase $5 billion of shares and pay $3.4 billion of dividends. As Craig mentioned, we just announced a 17% increase in our quarterly dividend, which equates to an annual dividend of $2.76 in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%. Our commitment to shareholder returns continues to be a hallmark of The Home Depot.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call, and, Nicole, we are now ready for questions."

First, what I'm going to do is walk you from what we exited in the U.S. a comp of 7.1% to the guidance of 4.5%. That's a 260 basis point delta. And the drivers of that are threefold. First, it starts with GDP. We're using GDP growth forecast of 2.1%. GDP in the United States in 2015 was 2.4%. So there's 30 basis points coming off the top because it's slower GDP. Secondly, on home prices, we anticipate home prices to be up next year, 3.5%. That's good. It's down from the growth that we experienced in 2015 of 5.4%. So that's another 30 basis points of growth coming off the top. And then there's 200 basis points of market share coming off because we just don't feel market share into our growth forecast. So that gives you 4.5% comp estimate for 2016. A few other housing numbers since you asked. I gave you the home price estimate that you were [indiscernible]. We anticipate housing turnover to be up 4.4% of units. Household formation to be up considerably. We're forecasting 1.9  million household forms, that's a lot, lists here with about 1.3 billion households. The other thing that we're really spending time, trying to get a better understanding is the impact of the age of the housing stock. As you know, 65% of the homes in the United States are older than 30 years and there's external research that shows that spending on older homes is higher. John Brown [ph] would suggest something like 7.5% higher, our own internal research suggests it's 8% higher. So the aging housing stocks bodes very well for us. And if we could take it back to the last mild recession, I'm talking a lot here, I apologize. But if you take it back to the last mild recession of 2001, I mean the housing stock was a lot younger 15 years ago. So this is a good new story for us."

We also recorded the highest net earnings in company history. In fiscal 2015, earnings per share grew 15.9% to $5.46. Sales for the fourth quarter were $21 billion, up 9.5% from last year. Comp sales were up 7.1% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 8.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.17 in the fourth quarter. Our strong sales performance was driven by a continued moderate housing recovery, exciting merchandising events, solid execution and a benefit from favorable weather. We continue to see broad-based growth across the store and our geographies. All 3 of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps in the fourth quarter, led by our Southern division, which posted low double-digit comps, while our Northern and Western divisions recorded high single-digit comps. In all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw a mid-single to low double-digit comps in the quarter. 
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 49 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted high single-digit comps in local currency for a total of 17 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Canada ended the year with sales over $7 billion in local currency, reinforcing our position as the #1 home improvement retailer in Canada. I would like to congratulate Jeff Kinnaird, who was recently promoted to President of Home Depot Canada. Jeff is a 19-year Home Depot veteran with strong operational and merchandising experience, which has allowed him to be instrumental in our success in Canada.
While there was strength in seasonal holiday decor, Gift Center and Black Friday events, core categories were also a strong contributor to our performance. Both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. As Ted will detail, all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both Pro and DIY categories, with Pro outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. You will recall during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Interline Brands, a leading national distributor of maintenance repair and operations or MRO products. We told you that in the second 90 days of integration would be about building out specific business cases. We are moving forward on a number of exciting sales-driving initiatives that have been identified through this process. For example, we will soon begin offering our exclusive paint brands to Interline's multi-family operators. We have a good sense of what we need to accomplish over the next 18 to 24 months in order to fully realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total Pro opportunity.
The retail environment is evolving and the blending of the digital and physical worlds remain a common theme. We are responsive to these trends, building out our interconnected capabilities and investing in content, site improvement and improved mobile experiences to solve for a frictionless customer experience. We continue to see healthy sales from our digital business while also seeing year-over-year improvement in customer satisfaction scores.
For the year, our online business grew by approximately $1 billion, a growth rate of over 25% versus the prior year. A significant portion of this online growth leverages the physical store assets that we have as over 40% of our online orders are picked up in stores. This is a testament to the power of our interconnected strategy.
At our December investor conference, we highlighted our plans to further optimize our supply chain to what we call Supply Chain Synchronization or Project Sync. We have been piloting Project Sync in Houston for some time and have now begun to roll out in a few other regions. Though it is early days, we have seen benefit in transportation savings, inventory turn and a reduction in product lead times. We appreciate the efforts of our cross functional teams internally, as well as the increased collaboration with our external partners as all parties involved are working together to develop and adopt engineered flow schedules that serve as the foundation of Project Sync.
Turning to the macro environment, while 2016 consensus U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated, we continue to see positive signs in the housing data, with home price appreciation, housing turnover and household formation being the key drivers of growth for our business. We expect 2016 comp growth of approximately 4.5%. Carol will take you through the details, but currency headwinds could result in lower total company comp growth. Therefore, we expect total company comp growth of approximately 3.7% to 4.5% and corresponding diluted earnings per share of $6.12 to $6.18.
Today, our board announced a 17% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.69 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders. We will invest to sustain and grow our business and return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
The power of The Home Depot begins with our company's strong culture and commitment to our values. I want to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers; and I'd also like to congratulate Ann-Marie Campbell, who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President of U.S. stores. With more than 30 years with the company, Ann-Marie brings a deep understanding of Home Depot's operations, culture and customers to the role. Based on this quarter's results, 100% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. This is our largest second-half payout to date and we look forward to continuing this momentum in 2016.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw strength across the entire store, as well as continued growth in our online business. Sales were aided by milder weather and great events, including the strong Black Friday and Gift Center. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, appliances, tools, building materials had double-digit comps in the quarter. Lighting, plumbing, hardware and indoor garden were above the company average and decor was in line with the company average. Outdoor garden, millwork, lumber, kitchen and bath, paint, electrical and flooring posted mid-single-digit positive comps. Pro heavy categories saw significant growth during the quarter as we saw double-digit comps in siding, pneumatics, circuit protection, fencing, fasteners and exterior doors. Our recent assortment update in roofing continues to drive excellent results, as we saw double-digit comps in roofing in the fourth quarter. And we continue to see strength in core maintenance and repair categories with double-digit comps in pumps, security lighting, water heaters, electrical tools, construction adhesives, ladders and caulks. Cleaning, bath fixtures, door locks and pipe and fittings also had comps above the company average. We believe that more favorable weather trends in the quarter aided sales growth by approximately $100 million. Our customers took advantage of the milder weather and were able to complete more outdoor projects. For example, we saw double-digit comp sales in pressure washers, hard scapes, mowers, outdoor power, concrete and pressure-treated decking. Black Friday, Gift Center and storage events provided great values and were well-received by our customers. Our strong black Friday helped drive double-digit comps in categories like portable power and appliances. Our Gift Center performed extremely well and we saw double-digit comps in tool storage, power tool accessories and hand tools. In addition, our associates rallied behind our decorative holiday offering, resulting in comps above the company average. In the fourth quarter, total comp transactions grew by 5%, and for the year, we set a new transaction record with over $1.5 billion total transactions. In the quarter, comp ticket increased 2%. Our comp ticket increase reflects about 32 basis points of contraction due to commodity price deflation in products such as lumber and copper. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.8% for the fourth quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.9% in the fourth quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, roofing and special order kitchens. Big-ticket was also driven by several installation service categories such as roofing, sheds and countertops.
Now let me turn our attention to the first quarter. In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we will be resetting our door lock assortment in the first quarter. Using our assortment planning tools, we were able to more effectively cluster our door lock assortment around styles, finishes and brands. In addition, we have a new merchandising approach that highlights our brands and their complete collections. Our reset will include great innovative products such as the Schlage Connect and Kwikset 915 electronic locks. For our Pro customer, we are introducing new and exclusive products from Milwaukee, DEWALT, RYOBI and RIDGID, all leaders in professional tools. The new Milwaukee M18 FUEL with ONE KEY is a revolutionary technology that provides users the ability to control tool settings, track the location of their tools and manage their tool and equipment inventory with their wireless devices. This innovative technology gives our Pro customers the trusted power of the Milwaukee brand with added benefits to make them more productive. Among big-box retailers, the Milwaukee M18 FUEL with ONE KEY can only be found at the Home Depot. 
In addition to great new products, we are gearing up for the spring selling season. We are excited about our exclusive grill offers from Weber, Nexgrill and KitchenAid and our large assortment online offers numerous options from infrared gas grills to smokers. Our patio assortment continues to expand, including new dining set designs from Hampton Bay and an enhanced offering of patio accessories.
For the gardener, we are excited about our expanded selection of exclusive organics from Dr. Earth and Black Magic. Our spring Black Friday event will once again offer amazing values for our customers. The stores will be loaded with exciting products and exclusives on items like live goods, grills and outdoor power equipment. We're looking forward to a great spring season.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

A continuing st",1258,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, sales were $21 billion, a 9.5% increase from last year. Comp sales were positive 7.1% for the quarter, with comps of 6.3% in November, 8.6% in December and 6.7% in January. A continuing strength in the U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps in the quarter by approximately $350 million or 1.8%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 8.9% for the quarter, with comps of 8.1% in November, 10.6% in December and 8.2% in January.
For the year, our sales increased 6.4% to $88.5 billion and total company comp sales were positive 5.6%. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.1%. During the year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales growth by approximately $1.4 billion or 1.6%.
Our gross margin was 34.1% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 24 basis points from last year and in line with our plan. The change in gross margin was driven primarily by the following factors: first, we experienced 15 basis points of gross margin expansion due to productivity within our supply chain and lower fuel costs; second, we had 26 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline Brands; and third, we had 13 basis points of gross margin contraction due to a change in the mix of products sold, including a higher penetration of lower margin product category like appliances. For the year we experienced 6 basis points of gross margin expansion.
In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 96 basis points from last year to 22%. Our operating expenses were $90 million over our plan. We had some unexpected expenses associated with store maintenance, snow removal and our data breach. Further, given our sales outperformance to plan, we increased our accrual for management bonus and Success Sharing. For fiscal 2015, our operating expense as a percent of sales was 20.9%, a decrease of 65 basis points from fiscal 2014. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 12.1%, and for the year was 13.3%. In the fourth quarter, interest and other expense was $236 million, an increase of $138 million from last year. The year-over-year increase reflects 2 items: first, last year we recorded a $111 million pretax gain on the sale of HD supply common stock that did not repeat this year; and second, interest expense was $29 million higher than last year due primarily to higher long-term debt balances.
Our income tax provision rate for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 was 36.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.17, an increase of 11.4% from last year. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $5.46, an increase of 15.9% compared to fiscal 2014.
Now moving to some additional highlights, during the fourth quarter, we opened 1 new store in Mexico, bringing our total store count at the end of the year to 2,274 stores. At the end of the year, selling square footage was 237 million, up slightly from last year, and sales per-square foot increased 5.2% to $371. At the end of the year, inventory was $11.8 billion, up $730 million from a year ago. On a currency neutral basis, inventory dollars grew by $872 million. Inventory turns were 4.9x, up from 4.7x last year. Payables grew $758 million from last year. On a currency neutral basis, payables were up $834 million.
Moving on to capital allocation, in 2015, we generated approximately $9.4 billion of cash from operations and used that cash as well as proceeds from $4 billion of incremental long-term debt issuances to invest in our business, to repurchase our shares and pay dividends to our shareholders. During the year, we invested approximately $3.2 billion back into the business through capital expenditures and the acquisition of Interline Brands. Further we repurchased $7 billion or approximately $59 million of our outstanding shares, including $2 billion or 16.2 million shares in the fourth quarter. Finally, we paid $3 billion in dividends. Our capital allocation philosophy supports our commitment to deliver high returns on invested capital. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 28%, 310 basis points higher than at the end of fiscal 2014. One more comment on capital allocation: for this month, we refinanced approximately $3 billion of our long-term debt that is coming due in March 2016.
This morning, we issued a press release with our guidance for fiscal 2016. I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP so fiscal 2016 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2015. As we look to 2016, we are projecting total company comps of approximately 4.5%. Our comp forecast is based on U.S. GDP growth estimates of 2.1% plus continued recovery in the housing markets. With the benefit of 5 new stores and a full year of sales from Interline Brands, we project total sales growth of approximately 6%. Our 2016 sales forecast is based on 2015 average U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates. The U.S. dollar is currently stronger than the average exchange rate. As a result, we are providing a range of sales, comp sales and diluted earnings per share growth to reflect the difference between 2015 average exchange rates and current exchange rates. If currency exchange rates remain where they are today, this would cause a negative impact to fiscal 2016 net sales growth of approximately $800 million, dropping our projected total sales growth rate from 6% to 5.1% and our projected comp sales growth from 4.5% to 3.7%. As we discussed during our December investor conference, we are planning our gross margin rate to remain flat to what we reported in fiscal 2015. We don't expect our gross margin rate to be materially impacted by exchange rates.
On a currency-neutral basis, we are forecasting our expenses to grow at approximately 40% of the rate of our sales growth rate, less than what we experienced in fiscal 2015, as we had $128 million of net bridge-related expenses in fiscal 2015 that should not repeat in 2016.
For the year, we project that our operating margin will grow by approximately 70 basis points. We don't expect our operating margin to be materially impacted by exchange rates. For the year, we anticipate our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. We expect our diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 13% to $6.18, but if exchange rates remain where they are today, our projected diluted earnings per share would be approximately $6.12.  Our earnings per share guidance includes our plans to repurchase approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares during the year, using excess cash.
For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $10 billion. Our 2016 capital spending plan is approximately $1.64 billion, a 9% increase from what we spent in fiscal 2015 in support of our strategic initiatives and to maintain our aging store base. We'll also use our cash to repurchase $5 billion of shares and pay $3.4 billion of dividends. As Craig mentioned, we just announced a 17% increase in our quarterly dividend, which equates to an annual dividend of $2.76 in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%. Our commitment to shareholder returns continues to be a hallmark of The Home Depot.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call, and, Nicole, we are now ready for questions."

The back half will be up year-on-year because we'll be anniversary-ing Interline and we'll see the benefits of productivity. We've talked to you in the past of our ongoing efforts to drive productivity within our cost of goods. We have a cost out team that we set up several years ago that works directly with Ted and the merchants to drive productivity and first costs, which is our largest costs forward. You've seen us drive an incredible productivity in our supply chain. For the year, we had 20 basis points of expansion coming off of supply chain. This productivity that we're driving through our business allows us to invest in lower margin categories on not only Interline, but lower margin categories like appliances and other categories that haven't fully recovered since the downturn.

First, what I'm going to do is walk you from what we exited in the U.S. a comp of 7.1% to the guidance of 4.5%. That's a 260 basis point delta. And the drivers of that are threefold. First, it starts with GDP. We're using GDP growth forecast of 2.1%. GDP in the United States in 2015 was 2.4%. So there's 30 basis points coming off the top because it's slower GDP. Secondly, on home prices, we anticipate home prices to be up next year, 3.5%. That's good. It's down from the growth that we experienced in 2015 of 5.4%. So that's another 30 basis points of growth coming off the top. And then there's 200 basis points of market share coming off because we just don't build market share into our growth forecast. So that gives you 4.5% comp estimate for 2016. A few other housing numbers since you asked. I gave you the home price estimate that we're using. We anticipate housing turnover to be up 4.4% of units. Household formation to be up considerably. We're forecasting 1.9 million households form. That's a lot; last year was about 1.3 billion households. The other thing that we're really spending time trying to get a better understanding is the impact of the age of the housing stock. As you know, 65% of the homes in the United States are older than 30 years and there's external research that shows that spending on older homes is higher. John Burns would suggest it's something like 7.5% higher; our own internal research suggests it's 8% higher. So the aging housing stock bodes very well for us. And if we could take it back to the last mild recession, I'm talking a lot here and I apologize. But if you take it back to the last mild recession of 2001, I mean the housing stock was a lot younger 15 years ago. So this is a good new story for us."

Sales for the first quarter were $22.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.44 in the first",890,"Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $22.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.44 in the first quarter. 
We are pleased with the start of the year. In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the first quarter, led by our Southern division, and all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single to low double-digit comps in the quarter. Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it the 50th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted mid-single-digit comps in local currency for a total of 18 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. 
While weather had somewhat of a positive impact on our business and certainly drove variability and demand, the first quarter was not an early spring story. It was an execution in the core store story. We continue to see broad-based growth across our stores as both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. As Ted will detail, our customers continue to respond positively to our deep assortment of trusted brands as we are the product authority for both our Pro and DIY customers. 
The Interline integration is progressing nicely. We continue to move forward on a number of exciting sales-driving initiatives, and we have outlined a path to truly realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total Pro opportunity over the next 18 to 24 months. We also continued to believe that blending the physical and digital channels into a seamless customer experience, which we call interconnected retail, provides a unique opportunity for us to expose the power of The Home Depot. This has been and will continue to be one of the central tenets of the company's strategy, and we will remain committed to the investments in our interconnected capabilities. For the quarter, online traffic growth was double digits and our online sales grew 21.5%. Investing in interconnected capabilities goes beyond our dot-com business as we are also continuing to further invest to more effectively meet customers' demands for increased fulfillment options. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system, is on track to be fully deployed in our U.S. stores before year-end. Following behind COM rollout is the implementation of BOPUS or Buy Online, Deliver From Store. In certain markets where BOPUS has been introduced, the demand has been much stronger than we anticipated. This is a good problem to have, but it's a challenging delivery capacity which we're working to address. We still expect BOPUS to be fully rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. For the spring season, we are focused on further connecting our in-store and online experiences. We offered a more expanded assortment of spring seasonal products online. We also leveraged our digital assets to more effectively target customers with a personalized message pertaining to relevant products and special buys. Additionally, we use digital media to highlight local in-store assortments to drive footsteps to our stores. To ensure our stores were properly staffed for the busy spring selling season, we hired over 80,000 associates to meet the demand of these increased footsteps. 
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain. The flexibility and nimbleness of our supply chain was especially evident in the quarter as we navigated spiky demand without sacrificing in-stock levels. We continue to see dividends from investments made in our supply chain, in our in-stocks, inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and customers. Our BOSS via RDC capability, which enables us to fulfill buy online ship to store orders through our RDC network leverages both our inventory and our fulfillment channels. The cost savings of this initiative have been above our expectations, and both our ship times and customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. We have made great strides with our supply chain over the past several years and we continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. While Sync is in its early days of a multi-year rollout, we are pleased with our initial results. 
Though it's early in the year, our view of the macroenvironment remains strong. We believe that housing data indicates continued tailwinds for our business. As Carol will detail, because of our outperformance in the first quarter versus our plan, we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2016 sales growth of approximately 6.3% and diluted earnings per share of $6.27. 
Today, we have over 400,000 associates, and I want to close by thanking them for their hard work and dedication to our customers. In addition to serving our customers in our stores through Team Depot, our associate-led volunteer sales force, our associates donated their personal time to complete more than 1,000 projects and service to our local communities over the past 12 months. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

And a seasonally warm February was followed by a more normal but weather March and April. While weather positively impacted our sales performance in first quarter, spring has not yet arrived in many of our markets. 
In the first quarter, total comp transactions grew by 4% while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Over average ticket increase was somewhat impacted by commodity price deflation, mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately 15 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 2.7% first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 9.5% in the first quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, roofing, sheds and windows, all of which had double-digit comps.  The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were appliances, tools, building materials, lumber, lighting, hardware, millwork and decor. Electrical, paint, flooring, indoor garden, kitchen and bath, plumbing and outdoor garden had positive comps but were below the company average. Pro-heavy categories continue to show great strength as we saw double-digit comps in fencing, pressure-treated decking, boards, fasteners, doors and conduit. In addition, the core of the store continued to perform well and we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories across the country. Tool storage, commercial/industrial lighting, portable power, power tool accessories, hand tools and wiring devices had double-digit comps in the quarter. The core categories, including garage organization, laminate flooring, landscape lighting, vinyl plank and wood flooring had comps above the company average. 
Our store Associates did a great job executing our eighth Spring Black Friday event and creating excitement in our stores. In particular, special buys around appliances, outdoor power and hard scapes were well-received by our customers resulting in double-digit comps in those categories. As Craig mentioned, The Home Depot is the product authority for both our professional and DIY customers. We have the deepest assortment of the leading programs in the marketplace. Many of these brands are billion-dollar categories for us. Our Pros recognize our brand advantage and Pro sales outpaced the company average in the first quarter. 
We continue to use detailed analytics to help us balance the art and science of retail. In marketing, we maintain our best-in-class creative and we are also optimizing our ad effectiveness with targeted  digital marketing. We remain focused on leveraging customer data to build the right message at the right time to the right customer. As we have made strategic moves away from print and mass marketing to more targeted digital marketing, we have seen great results. Since 2010, our return on advertising spend has nearly doubled. 
Now let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We continue to be the leader in the marketplace for innovation and value that save our customers both time and money. To maintain the momentum in our double-digit comp in pneumatics category, we are introducing the new Milwaukee Pneumatic FrameMaker, which is the latest addition to the M18 FUEL lineup. This high-powered nailer delivers fasteners much faster than competing battery-powered nailers, saving our pros time on the job site. And new from DEWALT is the 20-volt max brushless finish nailer. This compact and lightweight finish nailer has innovative features including depth adjustments and multi functional LED lights to illuminate workpieces. These are great examples of innovative and exclusive products from trusted, best-in-class programs.  For our DIY customers, we are excited about the new and exclusive launch of Outlasts cross laminated flooring. This easy to install laminate is what a resistant and uses build protectant for technology proprietary coating that prevents what are from seeping to the floor. Outlasts plus flooring allows customers to install laminate flooring in high-traffic and water-prone areas such as kitchens, bathrooms and mudrooms. In addition to all the great new products, we are excited about our upcoming events. Our Thrill Of the Grill, Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events are right around the corner, and we have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys to help our customers enjoy this outdoor season to the fullest. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negative",820,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $22.8 billion, a 9% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales, as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $196 million or 0.9%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 6.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 10.2% in February, 6.7% in March, and 4.3% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 11.8% in February, 7.7% in March and 4.6% in April. We estimate weather-driven demand to positively impacted our U.S. sales growth by approximately $250 million. The variability in our comp sales performance during the quarter was due in large part to weather and to the timing of Easter this year versus last year. 
Our total company gross margin was 34.2% for the quarter, a decrease of 13 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors. First, as expected, we had 25 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 122 basis points to 20.7%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth along with great expense control. For the year, we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 35% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.5%, an increase of 109 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the first quarter was $237 million, up $44 million from last year due primarily to higher long-term debt balances. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.5% compared to 34.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Recall that the effective tax rate in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by the settlement of a tax audit. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%.  Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.44, an increase of 19% from last year. 
Now moving to some additional highlights, during the first quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and we ended the quarter with a store count of 2,275 and selling square footage of 237 million. Total sales per-square foot for the first quarter were $377, up 6.5% from last year. Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, inventory was $13.2 billion, up $913 million from last year, reflecting both the impact of Interline and the seasonality of our business. Inventory turns were 4.8x, up 1/10 from the first quarter of last year. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.45 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion. On the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 29.2%, 300 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 
Now turning our attention to the full year, while U.S. GDP forecast had pulled back slightly since we built our 2016 sales plan, we continue to see strength in the housing market, with home price appreciation, housing turnover and household formation trending where we thought they would. Sales in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, not just because of favorable weather, but because of higher demand for many of our core product categories. While we ordinarily don't raise our sales growth guidance so early in the year, we're going to roll forward some of our first quarter outperformance given the underlying strength of the business. Further, the U.S. dollar has weakened such that the current spot rate of exchange is now in line with the FX rates we used to build our plan. Because of this, we are going to a single point estimate instead of a range for our 2016 guidance. From the high end of the guidance range we provided in February, today, we are raising our sales and earnings per share growth guidance. We now expect our 2016 sales to grow by approximately 6.3%, with comps of approximately 4.9%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 14.8% to $6.27. 
We thank you for your participation in today's call, and Derek, we are now ready for questions."

Sales for the first quarter were $22.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.4%.

Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.44 in the first quarter. 
We are pleased with the start of the year. In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the first quarter, led by our Southern division, and all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single to low double-digit comps in the quarter. Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it the 50th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted mid-single-digit comps in local currency for a total of 18 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. 
While weather had somewhat of a positive impact on our business and certainly drove variability and demand, the first quarter was not an early spring story. It was an execution in the core store story. We continue to see broad-based growth across our stores as both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. As Ted will detail, our customers continue to respond positively to our deep assortment of trusted brands as we are the product authority for both our Pro and DIY customers. 
The Interline integration is progressing nicely. We continue to move forward on a number of exciting sales-driving initiatives and we have outlined a path to truly realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total Pro opportunity over the next 18 to 24 months. We also continue to believe that blending the physical and digital channels into a seamless customer experience, which we call interconnected retail, provides a unique opportunity for us to expose the power of The Home Depot. This has been, and will continue to be, one of the central tenets of our company strategy and we will remain committed to the investments in our interconnected capabilities. 
For the quarter, online traffic growth was double digits and our online sales grew 21.5%. Investing in interconnected capabilities goes beyond our dot-com business as we are also continuing to further invest to more effectively meet customers' demands for increased fulfillment options. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system, is on track to be fully deployed in our U.S. stores before year-end. 
Following behind the COM rollout is the implementation of BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store. In certain markets where BODFS has been introduced, the demand has been much stronger than we anticipated. This is a good problem to have, but it is challenging delivery capacity which we're working to address. We still expect BODFS to be fully rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. 
For the spring season, we are focused on further connecting our in-store and online experiences. We offered a more expanded assortment of spring seasonal products online. We also leveraged our digital assets to more effectively target customers with a personalized message pertaining to relevant products and special buys. Additionally, we use digital media to highlight local in-store assortments to drive footsteps to our stores. To ensure our stores were properly staffed for the busy spring selling season, we hired over 80,000 associates to meet the demand of these increased footsteps. 
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain. The flexibility and nimbleness of our supply chain was especially evident in the quarter as we navigated spiky demand without sacrificing in-stock levels. We continue to see dividends from investments made in our supply chain, in our in-stocks, inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and customers. 
Our BOSS via RDC capability, which enables us to fulfill Buy Online, Ship to Store orders through our RDC network leverages both our inventory and our fulfillment channels. The cost savings of this initiative have been above our expectations, and both our ship times and customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. We have made great strides with our supply chain over the past several years and we continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. While Sync is in its early days of a multi-year rollout, we are pleased with our initial results. 
Though it is early in the year, our view of the macroenvironment remains consistent. We believe that housing data indicates continued tailwinds for our business. As Carol will detail, because of our outperformance in the first quarter versus our plan, we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2016 sales growth of approximately 6.3% and diluted earnings per share of $6.27. 
Today, we have over 400,000 associates, and I want to close by thanking them for their hard work and dedication to our customers. In addition to serving our customers in our stores through Team Depot, our associate-led volunteer force, our associates donated their personal time to complete more than 1,000 projects and service to our local communities over the past 12 months. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We had a strong first quarter driven by continued strength across the store, particularly with our Pro customer. An unseasonably warm February was followed by a more normal weather March and April. While weather",724,"Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter driven by continued strength across the store, particularly with our Pro customer. An unseasonably warm February was followed by a more normal weather March and April. While weather positively impacted our sales performance in the first quarter, spring has not yet arrived in many of our markets. 
In the first quarter, total comp transactions grew by 4% while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Our average ticket increase was somewhat impacted by commodity price deflation, mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately 15 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 2.7% first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 9.5% in the first quarter. 
The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, roofing, sheds and windows, all of which had double-digit comps. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were appliances, tools, building materials, lumber, lighting, hardware, millwork and decor. Electrical, paint, flooring, indoor garden, kitchen and bath, plumbing and outdoor garden had positive comps but were below the company average. 
Pro-heavy categories continue to show great strength as we saw double-digit comps in fencing, pressure-treated decking, boards, fasteners, doors and conduit. In addition, the core of the store continue to perform well and we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories across the country. Tool storage, commercial/industrial lighting, portable power, power tool accessories, hand tools and wiring devices had double-digit comps in the quarter. The core categories, including garage organization, laminate flooring, landscape lighting, vinyl plank and wood flooring had comps above the company average. 
Our store associates did a great job executing our eighth annual Spring Black Friday event and creating excitement in our stores. In particular, special buys around appliances, outdoor power and hard scapes were well-received by our customers resulting in double-digit comps in those categories. As Craig mentioned, The Home Depot is the product authority for both our professional and DIY customers. We have the deepest assortment of the leading programs in the marketplace. Many of these brands are billion-dollar categories for us. Our Pros recognize our brand advantage and Pro sales outpaced the company average in the first quarter. 
We continue to use detailed analytics to help us balance the art and science of retail. In marketing, we maintain our best-in-class creative and we are also optimizing our ad effectiveness with targeted  digital marketing. We remain focused on leveraging customer data to build the right message at the right time to the right customer. As we have made strategic moves away from print and mass marketing to more targeted digital marketing, we have seen great results. Since 2010, our return on advertising spend has nearly doubled. 
Now let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We continue to be the leader in the marketplace for innovation and value that save our customers both time and money. To maintain the momentum in our double-digit comp in pneumatics category, we are introducing the new Milwaukee pneumatic frame nailer, which is the latest addition to the M18 FUEL lineup. This high-powered nailer delivers fasteners much faster than competing battery-powered nailers, saving our pros time on the job site. 
And new from DEWALT is the 20-Volt Max Brushless Finish Nailer. This compact and lightweight finish nailer has innovative features including depth adjustments and multifunctional LED lights to illuminate workpieces. These are great examples of innovative and exclusive products from trusted, best-in-class programs.  
For our DIY customers, we are excited about the new, exclusive launch of Pergo Outlast+ Laminate Flooring. This easy to install laminate is water resistant and uses SpillProtect24 technology, a proprietary coating that prevents water from seeping into the floor. Outlast+ Flooring allows customers to install laminate flooring in high-traffic and water-prone areas such as kitchens, bathrooms and mudrooms. 
In addition to all the great new products, we are excited about our upcoming events. Our Thrill Of the Grill, Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events are right around the corner and we have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys to help our customers enjoy this outdoor season to the fullest. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the first quarter, sales were $22.8 billion, a 9% increase from last year driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $196 million or 0.9%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 6.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 10.2% in February, 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 11.8% in February, 7.7% in March and 4.6% in April. We estimate weather-driven demand that positively impacted our U.S. sales growth by approximately $250 million. The variability in our comp sales performance during the quarter was due in large part to weather and to the timing of Easter this year versus last year. 
Our total company gross margin was 34.2% for the quarter, a decrease of 13 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 25 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. 
In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 122 basis points to 20.7%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth along with great expense control. For the year, we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 35% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.5%, an increase of 109 basis points from last year. 
Interest and other expense for the first quarter was $237 million, up $44 million from last year due primarily to higher long-term debt balances. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.5% compared to 34.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Recall that the effective tax rate in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by the settlement of a tax audit. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.44, an increase of 19% from last year. 
Now moving to some additional highlights. During the first quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and we ended the quarter with a store count of 2,275 and selling square footage of 237 million. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $377, up 6.5% from last year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $13.2 billion up $913 million from last year reflecting both the impact of Interline and the seasonality of our business. Inventory turns were 4.8x, up 1/10 from the first quarter of last year. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.45 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 29.2%, 300 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 
Now turning our attention to the full year, while U.S. GDP forecast had pulled back slightly since we built our 2016 sales plan, we continue to see strength in the housing market, with home price appreciation, housing turnover and household formation trending where we thought they would. Sales in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, not just because of favorable weather, but because of higher demand for many of our core product categories. While we ordinarily don't raise our sales growth guidance so early in the year, we're going to roll forward some of our first quarter outperformance given the underlying strength of the business. 
Further, the U.S. dollar has weakened such that the current spot rate of exchange is now in line with the FX rates we used to build our plan. Because of this, we are going to a single point estimate instead of a range for our 2016 guidance. From the high end of the guidance range we provided in February, today, we are raising our sales and earnings per share growth guidance. We now expect our 2016 sales to grow by approximately 6.3%, with comps of approximately 4.9%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 14.8% to $6.27. 
We thank you for your participation in today's call, and Derek, we are now ready for questions."

Sales for the first quarter were $22.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.44 in the first",893,"Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $22.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.44 in the first quarter. 
We were pleased with the start of the year. In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the first quarter, led by our Southern division, and all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single to low double-digit comps in the quarter. Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it the 50th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted mid-single-digit comps in local currency for a total of 18 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. 
While weather had somewhat of a positive impact on our business and certainly drove variability and demand, the first quarter was not an early spring story. It was an execution in the core of the store story. We continue to see broad-based growth across our store as both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. As Ted will detail, our customers continue to respond positively to our deep assortment of trusted brands as we are the product authority for both our Pro and DIY customers. 
The Interline integration is progressing nicely. We continue to move forward on a number of exciting sales-driving initiatives and we have outlined a path to truly realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total Pro opportunity over the next 18 to 24 months. We also continue to believe that blending the physical and digital channels into a seamless customer experience, which we call interconnected retail, provides a unique opportunity for us to expose the power of The Home Depot. This has been, and will continue to be, one of the central tenets of our company strategy and we will remain committed to the investments in our interconnected capabilities. 
For the quarter, online traffic growth was double digits and our online sales grew 21.5%. Investing in interconnected capabilities goes beyond our dot-com business as we are also continuing to further invest to more effectively meet customers' demands for increased fulfillment options. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system, is on track to be fully deployed in our U.S. stores before year-end. 
Following behind the COM rollout is the implementation of BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store. In certain markets where BODFS has been introduced, the demand has been much stronger than we anticipated. This is a good problem to have, but it is challenging delivery capacity which we're working to address. We still expect BODFS to be fully rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. 
For the spring season, we are focused on further connecting our in-store and online experiences. We offered a more expanded assortment of spring seasonal products online. We also leveraged our digital assets to more effectively target customers with a personalized message pertaining to relevant products and special buys. Additionally, we use digital media to highlight local in-store assortments to drive footsteps to our stores. To ensure our stores were properly staffed for the busy spring selling season, we hired over 80,000 associates to meet the demand of these increased footsteps. 
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain. The flexibility and nimbleness of our supply chain was especially evident in the quarter as we navigated spiky demand without sacrificing in-stock levels. We continue to see dividends from investments made in our supply chain, in our in-stocks, inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and customers. 
Our BOSS via RDC capability, which enables us to fulfill Buy Online, Ship to Store orders through our RDC network leverages both our inventory and our fulfillment channels. The cost savings of this initiative have been above our expectations, and both our ship times and customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. We have made great strides with our supply chain over the past several years and we continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. While Sync is in its early days of a multi-year rollout, we are pleased with our initial results. 
Though it is early in the year, our view of the macroenvironment remains consistent. We believe that housing data indicates continued tailwinds for our business. As Carol will detail, because of our outperformance in the first quarter versus our plan, we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2016 sales growth of approximately 6.3% and diluted earnings per share of $6.27. 
Today, we have over 400,000 associates, and I want to close by thanking them for their hard work and dedication to our customers. In addition to serving our customers in our stores through Team Depot, our associate-led volunteer force, our associates donated their personal time to complete more than 1,000 projects and service to our local communities over the past 12 months. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We had a strong first quarter driven by continued strength across the store, particularly with our Pro customer. An unseasonably warm February was followed by a more normal weather March and April. While weather",723,"Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter driven by continued strength across the store, particularly with our Pro customer. An unseasonably warm February was followed by a more normal weather March and April. While weather positively impacted our sales performance in the first quarter, spring has not yet arrived in many of our markets. 
In the first quarter, total comp transactions grew by 4% while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Our average ticket increase was somewhat impacted by commodity price deflation, mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately 15 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 2.7% first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 9.5% in the first quarter. 
The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, roofing, sheds and windows, all of which had double-digit comps. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were appliances, tools, building materials, lumber, lighting, hardware, millwork and decor. Electrical, paint, flooring, indoor garden, kitchen and bath, plumbing and outdoor garden had positive comps but were below the company average. 
Pro-heavy categories continue to show great strength as we saw double-digit comps in fencing, pressure-treated decking, boards, fasteners, doors and conduit. In addition, the core of the store continue to perform well and we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories across the country. Tool storage, commercial/industrial lighting, portable power, power tool accessories, hand tools and wiring devices had double-digit comps in the quarter. The core categories, including garage organization, laminate flooring, landscape lighting, vinyl plank and wood flooring had comps above the company average. 
Our store associates did a great job executing our eighth annual Spring Black Friday event and creating excitement in our stores. In particular, special buys around appliances, outdoor power and hardscapes were well-received by our customers resulting in double-digit comps in those categories. As Craig mentioned, The Home Depot is the product authority for both our professional and DIY customers. We have the deepest assortment of the leading programs in the marketplace. Many of these brands are billion-dollar categories for us. Our Pros recognize our brand advantage and Pro sales outpaced the company average in the first quarter. 
We continue to use detailed analytics to help us balance the art and science of retail. In marketing, we maintain our best-in-class creative and we are also optimizing our ad effectiveness with targeted  digital marketing. We remain focused on leveraging customer data to build the right message at the right time to the right customer. As we have made strategic moves away from print and mass marketing to more targeted digital marketing, we have seen great results. Since 2010, our return on advertising spend has nearly doubled. 
Now let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We continue to be the leader in the marketplace for innovation and value that save our customers both time and money. To maintain the momentum in our double-digit comp in pneumatics category, we are introducing the new Milwaukee pneumatic framing nailer, which is the latest addition to the M18 FUEL lineup. This high-powered nailer delivers fasteners much faster than competing battery-powered nailers, saving our pros time on the job site. 
And new from DEWALT is the 20-Volt Max Brushless Finish Nailer. This compact and lightweight finish nailer has innovative features including depth adjustments and multifunctional LED lights to illuminate workpieces. These are great examples of innovative and exclusive products from trusted, best-in-class programs.  
For our DIY customers, we are excited about the new, exclusive launch of Pergo Outlast+ Laminate Flooring. This easy to install laminate is water resistant and uses SpillProtect24 technology, a proprietary coating that prevents water from seeping into the floor. Outlast+ Flooring allows customers to install laminate flooring in high-traffic and water-prone areas such as kitchens, bathrooms and mudrooms. 
In addition to all the great new products, we are excited about our upcoming events. Our Thrill Of the Grill, Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events are right around the corner and we have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys to help our customers enjoy this outdoor season to the fullest. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the first quarter, sales were $22.8 billion, a 9% increase from last year driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $196 million or 0.9%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 6.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 10.2% in February, 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 11.8% in February, 7.7% in March and 4.6% in April. We estimate weather-driven demand positively impacted our U.S. sales growth by approximately $250 million. The variability in our comp sales performance during the quarter was due in large part to weather and to the timing of Easter this year versus last year. 
Our total company gross margin was 34.2% for the quarter, a decrease of 13 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 25 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. 
In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 122 basis points to 20.7%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth along with great expense control. For the year, we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 35% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.5%, an increase of 109 basis points from last year. 
Interest and other expense for the first quarter was $237 million, up $44 million from last year due primarily to higher long-term debt balances. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.5% compared to 34.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Recall that the effective tax rate in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by the settlement of a tax audit. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.44, an increase of 19% from last year. 
Now moving to some additional highlights. During the first quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and we ended the quarter with a store count of 2,275 and selling square footage of 237 million. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $377, up 6.5% from last year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $13.2 billion, up $913 million from last year reflecting both the impact of Interline and the seasonality of our business. Inventory turns were 4.8x, up 1/10 from the first quarter of last year. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.45 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 29.2%, 300 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 
Now turning our attention to the full year, while U.S. GDP forecasts had pulled back slightly since we built our 2016 sales plan, we continue to see strength in the housing market, with home price appreciation, housing turnover and household formation trending where we thought they would. Sales in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, not just because of favorable weather, but because of higher demand for many of our core product categories. While we ordinarily don't raise our sales growth guidance so early in the year, we're going to roll forward some of our first quarter outperformance given the underlying strength of the business. 
Further, the U.S. dollar has weakened such that the current spot rate of exchange is now in line with the FX rates we used to build our plans. Because of this, we are going to a single point estimate instead of a range for our 2016 guidance. From the high end of the guidance range we provided in February, today, we are raising our sales and earnings per share growth guidance. We now expect our 2016 sales to grow by approximately 6.3%, with comps of approximately 4.9%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 14.8% to $6.27. 
We thank you for your participation in today's call, and Derek, we are now ready for questions."

But it sounds like you think some of the housing trends are favorable, and we agree with that. One thing I think you look at as an important metric, and we agree again, is that -- is home price appreciation. But home prices are now pretty close to where they were in 2006 if we think about as the peak year. So do you think -- how do you think about that? Are we concerned that there would be less home price appreciation and then therefore less of a driver to your business?"

Sales for the first quarter were $22.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.44 in the first",893,"Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $22.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.44 in the first quarter. 
We were pleased with the start of the year. In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the first quarter, led by our Southern division, and all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single to low double-digit comps in the quarter. Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it the 50th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted mid-single-digit comps in local currency for a total of 18 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. 
While weather had somewhat of a positive impact on our business and certainly drove variability and demand, the first quarter was not an early spring story. It was an execution in the core of the store story. We continue to see broad-based growth across our store as both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro outpacing our DIY business in the U.S. As Ted will detail, our customers continue to respond positively to our deep assortment of trusted brands as we are the product authority for both our Pro and DIY customers. 
The Interline integration is progressing nicely. We continue to move forward on a number of exciting sales-driving initiatives and we have outlined a path to truly realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total Pro opportunity over the next 18 to 24 months. We also continue to believe that blending the physical and digital channels into a seamless customer experience, which we call interconnected retail, provides a unique opportunity for us to expose the power of The Home Depot. This has been, and will continue to be, one of the central tenets of our company strategy and we will remain committed to the investments in our interconnected capabilities. 
For the quarter, online traffic growth was double digits and our online sales grew 21.5%. Investing in interconnected capabilities goes beyond our dot-com business as we are also continuing to further invest to more effectively meet customers' demands for increased fulfillment options. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system, is on track to be fully deployed in our U.S. stores before year-end. 
Following behind the COM rollout is the implementation of BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store. In certain markets where BODFS has been introduced, the demand has been much stronger than we anticipated. This is a good problem to have, but it is challenging delivery capacity which we're working to address. We still expect BODFS to be fully rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. 
For the spring season, we are focused on further connecting our in-store and online experiences. We offered a more expanded assortment of spring seasonal products online. We also leveraged our digital assets to more effectively target customers with a personalized message pertaining to relevant products and special buys. Additionally, we use digital media to highlight local in-store assortments to drive footsteps to our stores. To ensure our stores were properly staffed for the busy spring selling season, we hired over 80,000 associates to meet the demand of these increased footsteps. 
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain. The flexibility and nimbleness of our supply chain was especially evident in the quarter as we navigated spiky demand without sacrificing in-stock levels. We continue to see dividends from investments made in our supply chain, in our in-stocks, inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and customers. 
Our BOSS via RDC capability, which enables us to fulfill Buy Online, Ship to Store orders through our RDC network leverages both our inventory and our fulfillment channels. The cost savings of this initiative have been above our expectations, and both our ship times and customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. We have made great strides with our supply chain over the past several years and we continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. While Sync is in its early days of a multi-year rollout, we are pleased with our initial results. 
Though it is early in the year, our view of the macroenvironment remains consistent. We believe that housing data indicates continued tailwinds for our business. As Carol will detail, because of our outperformance in the first quarter versus our plan, we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2016 sales growth of approximately 6.3% and diluted earnings per share of $6.27. 
Today, we have over 400,000 associates, and I want to close by thanking them for their hard work and dedication to our customers. In addition to serving our customers in our stores through Team Depot, our associate-led volunteer force, our associates donated their personal time to complete more than 1,000 projects and service to our local communities over the past 12 months. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We had a strong first quarter driven by continued strength across the store, particularly with our Pro customer. An unseasonably warm February was followed by a more normal weather March and April. While weather",723,"Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter driven by continued strength across the store, particularly with our Pro customer. An unseasonably warm February was followed by a more normal weather March and April. While weather positively impacted our sales performance in the first quarter, spring has not yet arrived in many of our markets. 
In the first quarter, total comp transactions grew by 4% while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Our average ticket increase was somewhat impacted by commodity price deflation, mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately 15 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 2.7% first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 9.5% in the first quarter. 
The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, roofing, sheds and windows, all of which had double-digit comps. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were appliances, tools, building materials, lumber, lighting, hardware, millwork and decor. Electrical, paint, flooring, indoor garden, kitchen and bath, plumbing and outdoor garden had positive comps but were below the company average. 
Pro-heavy categories continue to show great strength as we saw double-digit comps in fencing, pressure-treated decking, boards, fasteners, doors and conduit. In addition, the core of the store continue to perform well and we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories across the country. Tool storage, commercial/industrial lighting, portable power, power tool accessories, hand tools and wiring devices had double-digit comps in the quarter. The core categories, including garage organization, laminate flooring, landscape lighting, vinyl plank and wood flooring had comps above the company average. 
Our store associates did a great job executing our eighth annual Spring Black Friday event and creating excitement in our stores. In particular, special buys around appliances, outdoor power and hardscapes were well-received by our customers resulting in double-digit comps in those categories. As Craig mentioned, The Home Depot is the product authority for both our professional and DIY customers. We have the deepest assortment of the leading programs in the marketplace. Many of these brands are billion-dollar categories for us. Our Pros recognize our brand advantage and Pro sales outpaced the company average in the first quarter. 
We continue to use detailed analytics to help us balance the art and science of retail. In marketing, we maintain our best-in-class creative and we are also optimizing our ad effectiveness with targeted digital marketing. We remain focused on leveraging customer data to build the right message at the right time to the right customer. As we have made strategic moves away from print and mass marketing to more targeted digital marketing, we have seen great results. Since 2010, our return on advertising spend has nearly doubled. 
Now let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We continue to be the leader in the marketplace for innovation and value that save our customers both time and money. To maintain the momentum in our double-digit comp in pneumatics category, we are introducing the new Milwaukee pneumatic framing nailer, which is the latest addition to the M18 FUEL lineup. This high-powered nailer delivers fasteners much faster than competing battery-powered nailers, saving our pros time on the job site. 
And new from DEWALT is the 20-Volt Max Brushless Finish Nailer. This compact and lightweight finish nailer has innovative features including depth adjustments and multifunctional LED lights to illuminate workpieces. These are great examples of innovative and exclusive products from trusted, best-in-class programs. 
For our DIY customers, we are excited about the new, exclusive launch of Pergo Outlast+ Laminate Flooring. This easy to install laminate is water resistant and uses SpillProtect24 technology, a proprietary coating that prevents water from seeping into the floor. Outlast+ Flooring allows customers to install laminate flooring in high-traffic and water-prone areas such as kitchens, bathrooms and mudrooms. 
In addition to all the great new products, we are excited about our upcoming events. Our Thrill Of the Grill, Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events are right around the corner and we have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys to help our customers enjoy this outdoor season to the fullest. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the first quarter, sales were $22.8 billion, a 9% increase from last year driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $196 million or 0.9%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 6.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 10.2% in February, 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 11.8% in February, 7.7% in March and 4.6% in April. We estimate weather-driven demand positively impacted our U.S. sales growth by approximately $250 million. The variability in our comp sales performance during the quarter was due in large part to weather and to the timing of Easter this year versus last year. 
Our total company gross margin was 34.2% for the quarter, a decrease of 13 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 25 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. 
In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 122 basis points to 20.7%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth along with great expense control. For the year, we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 35% of our sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.5%, an increase of 109 basis points from last year. 
Interest and other expense for the first quarter was $237 million, up $44 million from last year due primarily to higher long-term debt balances. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.5% compared to 34.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Recall that the effective tax rate in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by the settlement of a tax audit. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.44, an increase of 19% from last year. 
Now moving to some additional highlights. During the first quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and we ended the quarter with a store count of 2,275 and selling square footage of 237 million. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $377, up 6.5% from last year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $13.2 billion, up $913 million from last year reflecting both the impact of Interline and the seasonality of our business. Inventory turns were 4.8x, up 1/10 from the first quarter of last year. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.45 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 29.2%, 300 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 
Now turning our attention to the full year, while U.S. GDP forecasts had pulled back slightly since we built our 2016 sales plan, we continue to see strength in the housing market, with home price appreciation, housing turnover and household formation trending where we thought they would. Sales in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, not just because of favorable weather, but because of higher demand for many of our core product categories. While we ordinarily don't raise our sales growth guidance so early in the year, we're going to roll forward some of our first quarter outperformance given the underlying strength of the business. 
Further, the U.S. dollar has weakened such that the current spot rate of exchange is now in line with the FX rates we used to build our plans. Because of this, we are going to a single point estimate instead of a range for our 2016 guidance. From the high end of the guidance range we provided in February, today, we are raising our sales and earnings per share growth guidance. We now expect our 2016 sales to grow by approximately 6.3%, with comps of approximately 4.9%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 14.8% to $6.27.

Sales for the second quarter were $26.5 billion, up 6.6% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.7% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.4%. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.97 in the second quarter, up 13.9% versus last year. In the U.S, all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the second quarter, led by our Western division. And all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single to double-digit comps in the quarter. 
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 51 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth.
Our Canadian business also posted positive comps in local currency for a total of 19 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. We continue to see broad-based growth across our stores as both ticket and transactions grew. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro sales outpacing our DIY business in the U.S.
The Interline integration is progressing as we continue to deliver on the acquisitions of value drivers. We have been piloting our first business use case, offering Interline's catalog products to Pro's shopping Home Depot stores. We are pleased with the traction we've seen in this pilot, although it is still early days. We continue to work towards leveraging Interline's capabilities to expand our share of wallet with our current customers, as well as gain new customers. 
Our online business had sales growth of approximately 19% versus last year and represented a 5.6% of total sales. As Ted will detail, we continue to leverage our merchandising tools to refine
product offerings across channels based on customer preferences. Our goal is to provide our customers with the convenient and fulfillment options they desire.
We continue to build out capabilities to improve the overall customer experience. For example, in recent months, we began implementing our dynamic ETA feature for online purchases. Dynamic ETA provides a delivery date based on the customer's location. In the past, we issued a generic delivery window estimate, which allowed for extra time or cushion for the delivery commitment to customers. 
As we've begun to implement the dynamic ETA, our promised delivery date to customers is earlier and more accurately estimated. As a result, we're seeing an increased conversion in customer satisfaction.
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain as the dividends from investments made over the past several years yield a positive impact on our inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and customers. As you know, we see our supply chain transformation as an ongoing work in progress and continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. Sync is in the early stages of a multiyear rollout.
We are investing to more effectively meet our customer's demands. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system, is now fully deployed in all U.S. stores. The next phase of COM is to optimize and fine-tune this new system. Following behind COM is the rollout of BODFS or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, which we expect to be completed by the end of the fiscal year.
While we had a strong quarter, as you have heard, we are instituting a high degree of change across many areas of the business. With this amount of change, there will be learnings and opportunities to refine the process along the way. In the quarter, we identified several opportunities for improvement, particularly around inventory management and freight handling, which we're working to address.
Turning to the macro environment. We continue to see positive signs in the housing data, which we believe serve as a tailwind for our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing the earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect our outperformance this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. A successful spring season depends on the hard work and dedication of the 400,000 plus associates we have served in our customers today. I want to close by thanking them.
Based on the first half results, almost 100% of our stores qualified for Succession Airing, our profit sharing program for our Alley associates. We're very proud with their efforts. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

Core maintenance and repair categories, as well as many Pro heavy categories, continue to have solid performance in the quarter. 
Our growth in the quarter was balanced. Total comp transactions grew by 2.2% for the quarter, while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Ticket growth was driven by an increase in items per basket as project business continue to show strength. Our average ticket was also positively impacted from slight commodity price inflation, mainly for building materials and lumbar.
The total impact of ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 18 basis points. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact to our average ticket growth of approximately 69 basis points. Focusing on big-ticket sales in the second quarter, transactions per tickets over $900 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 8.1%. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were age back, appliances and roofing. 
All merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. Tools, lumber, plumbing, decor, indoor garden, building materials and lighting were above the company's average comp. Hardware, outdoor garden, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical, paint and flooring were positive, but below the company average.
As Craig mentioned, we continue to see notable strength with our Pro customers. Pro sales grew faster than the company comp, led by our high spend Pro customers. This continued strength led to comps above the company average in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, power tools, power tool accessories, wiring devices and interior doors. 
We saw continued strength in the core of the store as our customers undertook various projects. For example, landscape lighting, vinyl flooring, pressure organization, including pet [indiscernible] strong in the quarter. Light spread and record-setting Eatmon quarter drove strong performance in HVAC, air-conditioning, fans and air circulation. Sales were also strong in categories like irrigation and watering, still double-digit comps.
Our store associates did an exceptional job executing our summer events and creating excitement in our stores. Our Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events provided excellent value to strong demand from our customers. These events helped drive robust comps in appliances, tools storage, outdoor power and grails.
In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we continually leverage our merchandising tools to fine-tune our online and in-store assortments. One specific example of this with our patio offering. We found that many customers want to come into our stores to purchase and pick up their patio sets. We altered our assortment with certain patio sets back into the store. This strategic move was well-received by our customers, leading to record sales and sell-through in our stores. 
Our online business have strong growth in the quarter with double-digit traffic growth and improvement in conversion. Our interconnected retail initiatives continue to evolve to meet the changing demands of our customers. Mobile and tablet are over 50% of our traffic and are important tools that our customers use to engage with our products, our stores and our associates.
We are enhancing the functionality mobile with features like larger and clearer product images, live mobile chat and a simplified checkout experience. As evidence of the success of our interconnected strategy, approximately 42% of our online orders are now leveraging our store footprint for fulfillment and nearly 90% of our online product returns are processed through the convenience of our stores.
Now let's turn our attention to the third quarter. Our focus on innovation is a key part of our strategy. For our Pro customers, we will be introducing the DEWALT flexible system in our stores this fall. This DEWALT system uses the innovative flexible battery which identifies various types of DEWALT tools and adjust voltage to provide the appropriate level of power needed. These products provide corded performance without the cord. And innovative brushless motors increase tool runtime and durability, saving our Pros time and money on their job sites. Among big-box retailers, the DEWALT flexible system can only be found at The Home Depot. 
As smart devices continue to resonate with customers, we're excited about expanding smart technology with the new RYOBI garage door opener. This innovative system connects with any smart device and allows our customers to operate their garage door remotely, talk in the phone or play music through an embedded Bluetooth speaker or park with these using the laser park assist detachment. The new exclusive RYOBI garage door opener can only be found at The Home Depot.
The fall season and cooler temperatures are just around the corner, and we have an incredible lineup all great values and special buys for our customers during our Labor Day, fall cleanup and Halloween harvest events. 
With the Halloween harvest season, we have a tremendous amount of new seasonal products, like the exclusive animated window projector kit, which allows our customers to easily decorate their windows with animated digital holiday clips. This is the first digital decoration in the marketplace and it is exclusive to The Home Depot.
Our exciting third quarter events, along with outstanding execution of stores, will position us for success in the third quarter. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

Before I review our results, I'd like to remind you that our net earnings for the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax net expense of $92 million related to our 2014 data breach and a $144 million pretax gain on sa",927,"Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to remind you that our net earnings for the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax net expense of $92 million related to our 2014 data breach and a $144 million pretax gain on sale of HD Supply common stock. 
When added together, these 2 items contributed $0.02 of diluted earnings per share last year that did not repeat this year. So with that, let's get started. 
In the second quarter, sales were $26.5 billion, a 6.6% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales, as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $181 million or 0.7%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 4.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.3% in May, 7.5% in June and 4.5% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 3% in May, 8.4% in June and 5% in July.
Our monthly comp sales were a bit distorted by the timing of Memorial Day. Last year, Memorial Day sales were included in our May results and this year, they were included in our June results. Adjusting for this timing shift, our U.S. comps would have been 4.3% in May, 7% in June and 5% in July.
Our total company growth margin was 33.7% for the quarter, an increase of 3 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors. First, as expected, we had 22 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impacts of Interline. Second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity and by lower fuel costs.
And finally, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion due primarily to reaching higher co-op and rebate tiers in certain category classes, which lowered our cost. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the second quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales, decreased by 78 basis points to 18.2%. As I mentioned, our expenses in 2015 included $92 million of net data breach-related expenses that did not repeat in 2016.
In the quarter, we were pleased with our expense performance as total expenses were under our plan. Due to our continued focus on expense control, we now believe that our fiscal 2016 expenses will grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.5%, an increase of 81 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $228 million, up $144 million from last year, reflecting last year's pretax gain on sale of HD supply common stock that did not repeat this year. 
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 37% compared to 37.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%.
Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.97, an increase of 13.9% from last year. Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end the quarter, inventory was $12.3 billion, up $464 million from last year, due primarily to the impact of Interline. Inventory turns were 5.2x, up 1/10 from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year, accounts payable increased by $778 million to $8.3 billion, reflecting the timing of purchases and the impact of Interline. 
In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion for approximately 9.46 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 29%, 400 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Now turning our attention to the full year. Recent GDP growth estimate suggest a slowdown in the U.S. economy from what we expected, but we are encouraged by the strength of our core business as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.
Based on our first half performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out at the end of our first quarter. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Implied with this guidance is a comp for the second half of fiscal 2016 of approximately 4.3%. This is not a reflection of a sequential slowdown in sales, but rather a reflection of year-over-year performance.
On a 2-year stock basis, we expect our comps in the back half the year to be about the same as what we reported for the first half of the year. While we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance, we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year principally because of better expense control and therefore, more operating leverage than we anticipated at the end the first quarter. For earnings per share, remember that we guide out of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.6% to $6.31. 
So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And Shelon, we are now ready for questions."

Now if I could zoom out a little bit and talk about our private label program in total, we actually saw a decline in penetration year-on-year of about 30 basis points, taking our penetration down to just under 23%. The decline was attributed to a decline in the consumer card. And when we peel back the layers of the onion to say, well, what's happening with the consumer card? We see a few things. Last year, we had a few promotional events that we did not repeat in this or. So that impacted the penetration. And then we see increasing competition coming from bank cards. In fact, I received one just at my home this week from VISA that's offering differed financing. So this increased competition out there. Then finally, and interestingly, we're seeing a robust penetration increase in PIN debit. PIN debit of over 100 basis points year-on-year is now the third-largest form of tender inside our company.

As we expected, as we know anniversary the Interline acquisition, moving into the third quarter, our expense growth factor is going to come more in line with what we expected.

Sales for the second quarter were $26.5 billion, up 6.6% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.7% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.4%.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.97 in the second quarter, up 13.9% versus last year. In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the second quarter, led by our Western division. And all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single to double-digit comps in the quarter.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 51 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted positive comps in local currency for a total of 19 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth.
We continue to see broad-based growth across our stores as both ticket and transactions grew. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro sales outpacing our DIY business in the U.S.
The Interline integration is progressing as we continue to deliver on the acquisition's value drivers. We have been piloting our first business use case, offering Interline's catalog products to Pro's shopping Home Depot stores. We are pleased with the traction that we've seen in this pilot, although it is still early days. We continue to work towards leveraging Interline's capabilities to expand our share of wallet with our current customers as well as gain new customers.
Our online business had sales growth of approximately 19% versus last year and represented a 5.6% of total sales. As Ted will detail, we continue to leverage our merchandising tools to refine
product offerings across channels based on customer preferences. Our goal is to provide our customers with the convenient and fulfillment options they desire.
We continue to build out capabilities to improve the overall customer experience. For example, in recent months, we began implementing our dynamic ETA feature for online purchases. Dynamic ETA provides a delivery date based on the customer's location. In the past, we issued a generic delivery window estimate which allowed for extra time or cushion for the delivery commitment to customers. As we've begun to implement the dynamic ETA, our promised delivery date to customers is earlier and more accurately estimated. As a result, we're seeing an increased conversion in customer satisfaction.
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain as the dividends from investments made over the past several years yield a positive impact on our inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and customers. As you know, we see our supply chain transformation as an ongoing work in progress and continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. Sync is in the early stages of a multi-year rollout.
We are investing to more effectively meet our customers' demands. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system, is now fully deployed in all U.S. stores. The next phase of COM is to optimize and fine-tune this new system. Following behind COM is the rollout of BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, which we expect to be completed by the end of the fiscal year.
While we had a strong quarter, as you have heard, we are instituting a high degree of change across many areas of the business. With this amount of change, there will be learnings and opportunities to refine the process along the way. In the quarter, we identified several opportunities for improvement, particularly around inventory management and freight handling, which we're working to address.
Turning to the macro environment. We continue to see positive signs in the housing data, which we believe serve as a tailwind for our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect our outperformance this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. A successful spring season depends on the hard work and dedication of the 400,000 plus associates we have serving our customers today. I want to close by thanking them.
Based on the first half results, almost 100% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our [indiscernible] associates. We're very proud of their efforts. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We are pleased with our results in the second quarter. Core maintenance and repair categories as well as many Pro heavy categories continued to have solid performance in the quarter.
Our growth in the quarter was balanced. Total comp transactions grew by 2.2% for the quarter, while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Ticket growth was driven by an increase in the items per basket as project business continued to show strength. Our average ticket was also positively impacted from slight commodity price inflation, mainly for building materials and lumber. The total impact of ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 18 basis points. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact to our average ticket growth of approximately 69 basis points. Focusing on big-ticket sales in the second quarter, transactions for tickets over $900, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 8.1%. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were HVAC, appliances and roofing.
All merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. Tools, lumber, plumbing, decor, indoor garden, building materials and lighting were above the company's average comp. Hardware, outdoor garden, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical, paint and flooring were positive, but below the company average.
As Craig mentioned, we continued to see notable strength with our Pro customers. Pro sales grew faster than the company comp, led by our high-spend Pro customers. This continued strength led to comps above the company average in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, power tools, power tool accessories, wiring devices and interior doors.
We saw continued strength in the core of the store as our customers undertook various projects. For example, landscape lighting and in vinyl flooring, laundry organization, and cleaning had strong [indiscernible] in the quarter. Light spread in record-setting heat in the quarter drove strong performance in HVAC, air-conditioning, fans and air circulation. Sales were also strong in categories like irrigation and watering, still in the double-digit comps.
Our store associates did an exceptional job executing our summer events and creating excitement in our stores. Our Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events provided excellent value and we saw strong demand from our customers. These events helped drive robust comps in appliances, tool storage, outdoor power and grills.
In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we continually leverage our merchandising tools to fine-tune our online and in-store assortments. One specific example of this is with our patio offering. We found that many customers want to come into our stores to purchase and pick up their patio sets. We altered our assortment with certain patio sets back into the store. This strategic move was well-received by our customers, leading to record sales and sell-through in our stores.
Our online business had strong growth in the quarter with double-digit traffic growth and improvement in conversion. Our interconnected retail initiatives continued to evolve to meet the changing demands of our customers. Mobile and tablet are over 50% of our traffic and are important tools that our customers use to engage with our products, our stores and our associates.
We are enhancing the functionality mobile with features like larger and clear product images, live mobile chat and a simplified checkout experience. As evidence of the success of our interconnected strategy, approximately 42% of our online orders are now leveraging our store footprint for fulfillment and nearly 90% of our online product returns are processed through the convenience of our stores.
Now let's turn our attention to the third quarter. Our focus on innovation is a key part of our strategy. For our Pro customers, we will be introducing the DEWALT flexible system in our stores this fall. This DEWALT system uses the innovative flexible battery which identifies various types of DEWALT tools and adjusts voltage to provide the appropriate level of power needed. These products provide corded performance without the cord. And the innovative brushless motors increase tool runtime and durability, saving our Pros time and money on their job sites. Among big-box retailers, the DEWALT flexible system can only be found at The Home Depot.
As smart devices continue to resonate with customers, we're excited about expanding smart technology with the new RYOBI garage door opener. This innovative system connects with any smart device and allows our customers to operate their garage door remotely, talk in the phone or play music through an embedded Bluetooth speaker or park with ease using the laser park-assist attachment. The new exclusive RYOBI garage door opener can only be found at The Home Depot.
The fall season and cooler temperatures are just around the corner, and we have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys for our customers during our Labor Day, fall cleanup and Halloween harvest events.
With the Halloween harvest season, we have a tremendous amount of new seasonal products, like the exclusive animated window projector kit, which allows our customers to easily decorate their windows with animated digital holiday clips. This is the first digital decoration in the marketplace and it is exclusive to The Home Depot.
Our exciting third quarter events, along with outstanding execution of stores, will position us for success in the third quarter.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

Before I review our results, I'd like to remind you that our net earnings for the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax net expense of $92 million related to our 2014 data breach and a $144 million pretax gain on sale of HD Supply common stock. When added together, these 2 items contributed $0.02 of diluted earnings per share last year that did not repeat this year. So with that, let's get started.
In the second quarter, sales were $26.5 billion, a 6.6% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $181 million or 0.7%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 4.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.3% in May, 7.5% in June and 4.5% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 3% in May, 8.4% in June and 5% in July.
Our monthly comp sales were a bit distorted by the timing of Memorial Day. Last year, Memorial Day sales were included in our May results and this year, they were included in our June results. Adjusting for this timing shift, our U.S. comps would have been 4.3% in May, 7% in June and 5% in July.
Our total company growth margin was 33.7% for the quarter, an increase of 3 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 22 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline; second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity and by lower fuel costs; and finally, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion due primarily to reaching higher co-op and rebate tiers in certain category classes, which lowered our cost. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the second quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales, decreased by 78 basis points to 18.2%. As I mentioned, our expenses in 2015 included $92 million of net data breach-related expenses that did not repeat in 2016.
In the quarter, we were pleased with our expense performance as total expenses were under our plan. Due to our continued focus on expense control, we now believe that our fiscal 2016 expenses will grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.5%, an increase of 81 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $228 million, up $144 million from last year, reflecting last year's pretax gain on sale of HD supply common stock that did not repeat this year.
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 37% compared to 37.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%.
Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.97, an increase of 13.9% from last year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end the quarter, inventory was $12.3 billion, up $464 million from last year, due primarily to the impact of Interline. Inventory turns were 5.2x, up 1/10 from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year, accounts payable increased by $778 million to $8.3 billion, reflecting the timing of purchases and the impact of Interline.
In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.46 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 29%, 400 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
Now turning our attention to the full year. Recent GDP growth estimate suggest a slowdown in the U.S. economy from what we expected, but we are encouraged by the strength of our core business as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.
Based on our first half performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out at the end of our first quarter. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Implied with this guidance is a comp for the second half of fiscal 2016 of approximately 4.3%. This is not a reflection of a sequential slowdown in sales, but rather a reflection of year-over-year performance.
On a 2-year stock basis, we expect our comps in the back half the year to be about the same as what we reported for the first half of the year. While we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance, we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year principally because of better expense control and, therefore, more operating leverage than we anticipated at the end of the first quarter. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.6% to $6.31.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And Shelon, we are now ready for questions."

Now if I could zoom out a little bit and talk about our private label program in total, we actually saw a decline in penetration year-on-year of about 30 basis points, taking our penetration down to just under 23%. The decline was attributed to a decline in the consumer card. And when we peel back the layers of the onion to say, ""Well, what's happening with the consumer card?"" We see a few things. Last year, we had a few promotional events that we did not repeat this year. So that impacted the penetration. And then we see increasing competition coming from bank cards. In fact, I received one just at my home this week from VISA that's offering differed financing. So there is increased competition out there. And then finally, and interestingly, we're seeing a robust penetration increase in PIN debit. PIN debit of over 100 basis points year-on-year is now the third-largest form of tender inside our company. So the first largest is the bank card, the second largest is the private label card and the third largest is PIN debit."

We called out the impact on our gross margin. It did have a dilutive impact on our gross margin, which we more than made up for with productivity and supply chain and vendor co-op and rebate. And then it does add more variability and expenses. So if you look at our expense growth factor for the quarter, backing out Interline, it was a little higher than 60%, as we expected. As we know anniversary the Interline acquisition moving into the third quarter, our expense growth factor is going to come more in line with what we expected. And in fact, our expenses are under such good control, we were under our expense plan for the second quarter. We're taking our expense growth factor down from the year.

Sales for the second quarter were $26.5 billion, up 6.6% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.7% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.4%.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.97 in the second quarter, up 13.9% versus last year. In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the second quarter, led by our Western division. And all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single to double-digit comps in the quarter.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 51 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted positive comps in local currency for a total of 19 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth.
We continue to see broad-based growth across our stores as both ticket and transactions grew. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro sales outpacing our DIY business in the U.S.
The Interline integration is progressing as we continue to deliver on the acquisition's value drivers. We have been piloting our first business use case, offering Interline's catalog of products to Pro's shopping Home Depot stores. We are pleased with the traction that we've seen in this pilot, although it is still early days. We continue to work towards leveraging Interline's capabilities to expand our share of wallet with our current customers as well as gain new customers.
Our online business had sales growth of approximately 19% versus last year and represented 5.6% of total sales. As Ted will detail, we continue to leverage our merchandising tools to refine
product offerings across channels based on customer preferences. Our goal is to provide our customers with the convenient and fulfillment options they desire.
We continue to build out capabilities to improve the overall customer experience. For example, in recent months, we began implementing our dynamic ETA feature for online purchases. Dynamic ETA provides a delivery date based on the customer's location. In the past, we issued a generic delivery window estimate which allowed for extra time or cushion for the delivery commitment to customers. As we've begun to implement the dynamic ETA, our promised delivery date to customers is earlier and more accurately estimated. As a result, we're seeing an increased conversion in customer satisfaction.
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain as the dividends from investments made over the past several years yield a positive impact on our inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and customers. As you know, we see our supply chain transformation as an ongoing work in progress and continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. Sync is in the early stages of a multi-year rollout.
We are investing to more effectively meet our customers' demands. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system, is now fully deployed in all U.S. stores. The next phase of COM is to optimize and fine-tune this new system. Following behind COM is the rollout of BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, which we expect to be completed by the end of the fiscal year.
While we had a strong quarter, as you have heard, we are instituting a high degree of change across many areas of the business. With this amount of change, there will be learnings and opportunities to refine the process along the way. In the quarter, we identified several opportunities for improvement, particularly around inventory management and freight handling, which we're working to address.
Turning to the macro environment. We continue to see positive signs in the housing data, which we believe serve as a tailwind for our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect our out performance this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. A successful spring season depends on the hard work and dedication of the 400,000 plus associates we have serving our customers today. I want to close by thanking them.
Based on the first half results, almost 100% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our [indiscernible] associates. We're very proud of their efforts. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We were pleased with our results in the second quarter. Core maintenance and repair categories as well as many Pro heavy categories continued to have solid performance in the quarter.
Our growth in the quarter was balanced. Total comp transactions grew by 2.2% for the quarter, while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Ticket growth was driven by an increase in the items per basket, as project business continued to show strength. Our average ticket was also positively impacted from slight commodity price inflation, mainly for building materials and lumber. The total impact of ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 18 basis points. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact to our average ticket growth of approximately 69 basis points. Focusing on big-ticket sales in the second quarter, transactions for tickets over $900; representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 8.1%. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were HVAC, appliances and roofing.
All merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. Tools, lumber, plumbing, decor, indoor garden, building materials and lighting were above the company's average comp. Hardware, outdoor garden, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical, paint and flooring were positive, but below the company average.
As Craig mentioned, we continued to see notable strength with our Pro customers. Pro sales grew faster than the company comp, led by our high-spend Pro customers. This continued strength led to comps above the company average in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, power tools, power tool accessories, wiring devices and interior doors.
We saw continued strength in the core of the store as our customers undertook various projects. For example, landscape lighting and in vinyl flooring, [indiscernible] organization, and cleaning had strong comps in the quarter. Wide spread and record-setting heat in the quarter drove strong performance in HVAC, air-conditioning, fans and air circulation. Sales were also strong in categories like irrigation and watering, which delivered double-digit comps.
Our store associates did an exceptional job executing our summer events and creating excitement in our stores. Our Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events provided excellent value and we saw strong demand from our customers. These events helped drive robust comps in appliances, tool storage, outdoor power and grills.
In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we continually leverage our merchandising tools to fine-tune our online and in-store assortments. One specific example of this is with our patio offering. We found that many customers want to come into our stores to purchase and pick up their patio sets. We altered our assortment and put certain patio sets back into the stores. This strategic move was well-received by our customers, leading to record sales and sell-through in our stores.
Our online business had strong growth in the quarter with double-digit traffic growth and improvement in conversion. Our interconnected retail initiatives continued to evolve to meet the changing demands of our customers. Mobile and tablet are over 50% of our traffic and are important tools that our customers use to engage with our products, our stores and our associates.
We are enhancing the functionality of mobile with features like larger and clear product images, live mobile chat and a simplified checkout experience. As evidence of the success of our interconnected strategy, approximately 42% of our online orders are now leveraging our store footprint for fulfillment and nearly 90% of our online product returns are processed through the convenience of our stores.
Now let's turn our attention to the third quarter. Our focus on innovation is a key part of our strategy. For our Pro customers, we will be introducing the DEWALT flexible system in our stores this fall. This DEWALT system uses the innovative flexible battery which identifies various types of DEWALT tools and adjusts voltage to provide the appropriate level of power needed. These products provide corded performance without the cord. And the innovative brushless motors increase tool run-time and durability, saving our Pros time and money on their job sites. Among big-box retailers, the DEWALT FLEXVOLT® system can only be found at The Home Depot.
As smart devices continue to resonate with customers, we're excited about expanding smart technology with the new RYOBI garage door opener. This innovative system connects with any smart device and allows our customers to operate their garage door remotely, talk on the phone or play music through an embedded Bluetooth speaker or park with ease using the laser park-assist attachment. The new exclusive RYOBI garage door opener can only be found at The Home Depot.
The fall season and cooler temperatures are just around the corner, and we have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys for our customers during our Labor Day, fall cleanup and Halloween harvest events.
With the Halloween harvest season, we have a tremendous amount of new seasonal products, like the exclusive animated window projector kit, which allows our customers to easily decorate their windows with animated digital holiday clips. This is the first digital decoration in the marketplace and it is exclusive to The Home Depot.
Our exciting third quarter events, along with outstanding execution in stores, will position us for success in the third quarter.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the second quarter, sales were $26.5 billion, a 6.6% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $181 million or 0.7%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 4.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.3% in May, 7.5% in June and 4.5% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 3% in May, 8.4% in June and 5% in July.
Our monthly comp sales were a bit distorted by the timing of Memorial Day. Last year, Memorial Day sales were included in our May results and this year, they were included in our June results. Adjusting for this timing shift, our U.S. comps would have been 4.3% in May, 7% in June and 5% in July.
Our total company gross margin was 33.7% for the quarter, an increase of 3 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 22 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline; second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity and by lower fuel costs; and finally, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion due primarily to reaching higher co-op and rebate tiers in certain category classes, which lowered our cost. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the second quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales, decreased by 78 basis points to 18.2%. As I mentioned, our expenses in 2015 included $92 million of net data breach-related expenses that did not repeat in 2016.
In the quarter, we were pleased with our expense performance as total expenses were under our plan. Due to our continued focus on expense control, we now believe that our fiscal 2016 expenses will grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.5%, an increase of 81 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $228 million, up $144 million from last year, reflecting last year's pretax gain on sale of HD supply common stock that did not repeat this year.
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 37% compared to 37.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%.
Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.97, an increase of 13.9% from last year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end the quarter, inventory was $12.3 billion, up $464 million from last year, due primarily to the impact of Interline. Inventory turns were 5.2x, up 1/10 from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year, accounts payable increased by $778 million to $8.3 billion, reflecting the timing of purchases and the impact of Interline.
In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.46 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 29%, 400 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
Now turning our attention to the full year. Recent GDP growth estimates suggest a slowdown in the U.S. economy from what we expected, but we are encouraged by the strength of our core business as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.
Based on our first half performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out at the end of our first quarter. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Implied with this guidance is a comp for the second half of fiscal 2016 of approximately 4.3%. This is not a reflection of a sequential slowdown in sales, but rather a reflection of year-over-year performance.
On a 2-year stack basis, we expect our comps in the back half the year to be about the same as what we reported for the first half of the year. While we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance, we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year principally because of better expense control and, therefore, more operating leverage than we anticipated at the end of the first quarter. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.6% to $6.31.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And Shelon, we are now ready for questions."

Now if I could zoom out a little bit and talk about our private label program in total, we actually saw a decline in penetration year-on-year of about 30 basis points, taking our penetration down to just under 23%. The decline was attributed to a decline in the consumer card. And when we peel back the layers of the onion to say, ""Well, what's happening with the consumer card?"" We see a few things. Last year, we had a few promotional events that we did not repeat this year. So that impacted the penetration. And then we see increasing competition coming from bank cards. In fact, I received one just at my home this week from VISA that's offering differed financing. So there is increased competition out there. And then finally, and interestingly, we're seeing a robust penetration increase in PIN debit. PIN debit, up over 100 basis points year-on-year, is now the third-largest form of tender inside our company. So the first largest is the bank card, the second largest is the private label card and the third largest is PIN debit."

Sales for the second quarter were $26.5 billion, up 6.6% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.7% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.4%.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.97 in the second quarter, up 13.9% versus last year. In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the second quarter, led by our Western division. And all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single to double-digit comps in the quarter.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 51 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted positive comps in local currency for a total of 19 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth.
We continue to see broad-based growth across our stores as both ticket and transactions grew. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro sales outpacing our DIY business in the U.S.
The Interline integration is progressing as we continue to deliver on the acquisition's value drivers. We have been piloting our first business use case, offering Interline's catalog of products to Pro's shopping Home Depot stores. We are pleased with the traction that we've seen in this pilot, although it is still early days. We continue to work towards leveraging Interline's capabilities to expand our share of wallet with our current customers as well as gain new customers.
Our online business had sales growth of approximately 19% versus last year and represented 5.6% of total sales. As Ted will detail, we continue to leverage our merchandising tools to refine
product offerings across channels based on customer preferences. Our goal is to provide our customers with the convenient and fulfillment options they desire.
We continue to build out capabilities to improve the overall customer experience. For example, in recent months, we began implementing our dynamic ETA feature for online purchases. Dynamic ETA provides a delivery date based on the customer's location. In the past, we issued a generic delivery window estimate which allowed for extra time or cushion for the delivery commitment to customers. As we've begun to implement the dynamic ETA, our promised delivery date to customers is earlier and more accurately estimated. As a result, we're seeing an increased conversion in customer satisfaction.
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain as the dividends from investments made over the past several years yield a positive impact on our inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and customers. As you know, we see our supply chain transformation as an ongoing work in progress and continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. Sync is in the early stages of a multi-year rollout.
We are investing to more effectively meet our customers' demands. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system, is now fully deployed in all U.S. stores. The next phase of COM is to optimize and fine-tune this new system. Following behind COM is the rollout of BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, which we expect to be completed by the end of the fiscal year.
While we had a strong quarter, as you have heard, we are instituting a high degree of change across many areas of the business. With this amount of change, there will be learnings and opportunities to refine the process along the way. In the quarter, we identified several opportunities for improvement, particularly around inventory management and freight handling, which we're working to address.
Turning to the macro environment. We continue to see positive signs in the housing data, which we believe serve as a tailwind for our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect our out performance this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. A successful spring season depends on the hard work and dedication of the 400,000 plus associates we have serving our customers today. I want to close by thanking them.
Based on the first half results, almost 100% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our [indiscernible] associates. We're very proud of their efforts. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We were pleased with our results in the second quarter. Core maintenance and repair categories as well as many Pro heavy categories continued to have solid performance in the quarter.
Our growth in the quarter was balanced. Total comp transactions grew by 2.2% for the quarter, while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Ticket growth was driven by an increase in the items per basket, as project business continued to show strength. Our average ticket was also positively impacted from slight commodity price inflation, mainly for building materials and lumber. The total impact of ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 18 basis points. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact to our average ticket growth of approximately 69 basis points. Focusing on big-ticket sales in the second quarter, transactions for tickets over $900; representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 8.1%. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were HVAC, appliances and roofing.
All merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. Tools, lumber, plumbing, decor, indoor garden, building materials and lighting were above the company's average comp. Hardware, outdoor garden, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical, paint and flooring were positive, but below the company average.
As Craig mentioned, we continued to see notable strength with our Pro customers. Pro sales grew faster than the company comp, led by our high-spend Pro customers. This continued strength led to comps above the company average in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, power tools, power tool accessories, wiring devices and interior doors.
We saw continued strength in the core of the store as our customers undertook various projects. For example, landscape lighting and in vinyl flooring, [indiscernible] organization, and cleaning had strong comps in the quarter. Wide spread and record-setting heat in the quarter drove strong performance in HVAC, air-conditioning, fans and air circulation. Sales were also strong in categories like irrigation and watering, which delivered double-digit comps.
Our store associates did an exceptional job executing our summer events and creating excitement in our stores. Our Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events provided excellent value and we saw strong demand from our customers. These events helped drive robust comps in appliances, tool storage, outdoor power and grills.
In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we continually leverage our merchandising tools to fine-tune our online and in-store assortments. One specific example of this is with our patio offering. We found that many customers want to come into our stores to purchase and pick up their patio sets. We altered our assortment and put certain patio sets back into the stores. This strategic move was well-received by our customers, leading to record sales and sell-through in our stores.
Our online business had strong growth in the quarter with double-digit traffic growth and improvement in conversion. Our interconnected retail initiatives continued to evolve to meet the changing demands of our customers. Mobile and tablet are over 50% of our traffic and are important tools that our customers use to engage with our products, our stores and our associates.
We are enhancing the functionality of mobile with features like larger and clear product images, live mobile chat and a simplified checkout experience. As evidence of the success of our interconnected strategy, approximately 42% of our online orders are now leveraging our store footprint for fulfillment and nearly 90% of our online product returns are processed through the convenience of our stores.
Now let's turn our attention to the third quarter. Our focus on innovation is a key part of our strategy. For our Pro customers, we will be introducing the DEWALT flexible system in our stores this fall. This DEWALT system uses the innovative flexible battery which identifies various types of DEWALT tools and adjusts voltage to provide the appropriate level of power needed. These products provide corded performance without the cord. And the innovative brushless motors increase tool run-time and durability, saving our Pros time and money on their job sites. Among big-box retailers, the DEWALT FLEXVOLT® system can only be found at The Home Depot.
As smart devices continue to resonate with customers, we're excited about expanding smart technology with the new RYOBI garage door opener. This innovative system connects with any smart device and allows our customers to operate their garage door remotely, talk on the phone or play music through an embedded Bluetooth speaker or park with ease using the laser park-assist attachment. The new exclusive RYOBI garage door opener can only be found at The Home Depot.
The fall season and cooler temperatures are just around the corner, and we have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys for our customers during our Labor Day, fall cleanup and Halloween harvest events.
With the Halloween harvest season, we have a tremendous amount of new seasonal products, like the exclusive animated window projector kit, which allows our customers to easily decorate their windows with animated digital holiday clips. This is the first digital decoration in the marketplace and it is exclusive to The Home Depot.
Our exciting third quarter events, along with outstanding execution in stores, will position us for success in the third quarter.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

Before I review our results, I'd like to remind you that our net earnings for the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax net expense of $92 million related to our 2014 data breach and a $144 million pretax gain on sa",928,"Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to remind you that our net earnings for the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax net expense of $92 million related to our 2014 data breach and a $144 million pretax gain on sale of HD Supply common stock. When added together, these 2 items contributed $0.02 of diluted earnings per share last year that did not repeat this year. So with that, let's get started.
In the second quarter, sales were $26.5 billion, a 6.6% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $181 million or 0.7%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 4.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.3% in May, 7.5% in June and 4.5% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 3% in May, 8.4% in June and 5% in July.
Our monthly comp sales were a bit distorted by the timing of Memorial Day. Last year, Memorial Day sales were included in our May results and this year, they were included in our June results. Adjusting for this timing shift, our U.S. comps would have been 4.3% in May, 7% in June and 5% in July.
Our total company gross margin was 33.7% for the quarter, an increase of 3 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 22 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline; second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity and by lower fuel costs; and finally, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion due primarily to reaching higher co-op and rebate tiers in certain category classes, which lowered our cost. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the second quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales, decreased by 78 basis points to 18.2%. As I mentioned, our expenses in 2015 included $92 million of net data breach-related expenses that did not repeat in 2016.
In the quarter, we were pleased with our expense performance as total expenses were under our plan. Due to our continued focus on expense control, we now believe that our fiscal 2016 expenses will grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.5%, an increase of 81 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $228 million, up $144 million from last year, reflecting last year's pretax gain on sale of HD supply common stock that did not repeat this year.
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 37% compared to 37.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%.
Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.97, an increase of 13.9% from last year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end the quarter, inventory was $12.3 billion, up $464 million from last year, due primarily to the impact of Interline. Inventory turns were 5.2x, up 1/10 from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year, accounts payable increased by $778 million to $8.3 billion, reflecting the timing of purchases and the impact of Interline.
In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.46 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 29%, 400 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
Now turning our attention to the full year. Recent GDP growth estimates suggest a slowdown in the U.S. economy from what we expected, but we are encouraged by the strength of our core business as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.
Based on our first half performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out at the end of our first quarter. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Implied with this guidance is a comp for the second half of fiscal 2016 of approximately 4.3%. This is not a reflection of a sequential slowdown in sales, but rather a reflection of year-over-year performance.
On a 2-year stack basis, we expect our comps in the back half the year to be about the same as what we reported for the first half of the year. While we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance, we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year principally because of better expense control and, therefore, more operating leverage than we anticipated at the end of the first quarter. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.6% to $6.31.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And Shelon, we are now ready for questions."

Now if I could zoom out a little bit and talk about our private label program in total, we actually saw a decline in penetration year-on-year of about 30 basis points, taking our penetration down to just under 23%. The decline was attributed to a decline in the consumer card. And when we peel back the layers of the onion to say, ""Well, what's happening with the consumer card?"" We see a few things. Last year, we had a few promotional events that we did not repeat this year. So that impacted the penetration. And then we see increasing competition coming from bank cards. In fact, I received one just at my home this week from VISA that's offering differed financing. So there is increased competition out there. And then finally, and interestingly, we're seeing a robust penetration increase in PIN debit. PIN debit, up over 100 basis points year-on-year, is now the third-largest form of tender inside our company. So the first largest is the bank card, the second largest is the private label card and the third largest is PIN debit."

We called out the impact on our gross margin; it did have a dilutive impact on our gross margin; which we more than made up for with productivity and supply chain and vendor co-op and rebate.

At the beginning of the year, we said it would be about 40% of our sales growth. We now think it's about 32% of our sales growth."

And with that cost out, our people costs aren't going to be as high as we anticipated. That benefit will flow through into 2017, which is a good new story. And there are other examples of that. I won't bore you with all those examples. But there are other examples of where our team continues to go after large purchasing contracts to drive productivity and make sure that the experience is the one that we want to deliver."

Sales for the third quarter were $23.2 billion, up 6.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 5.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.9%. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 in the third quarter, up 18.5% versus last year. In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the third quarter, led by our Southern division. All our regions positively comped except one region in the region in the North. In New England, we had a small negative comp due primarily to a state sales tax holiday in fiscal 2015 that did not repeat in 2016.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico and Canada reported positive comps in local currency, marking 52 and 20 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth, respectively.
As Ted will detail, we saw balanced growth from both ticket and transactions. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY customers with Pro sales growing faster than DIY sales in the quarter. Our Pro business continues to be driven by a strong offering of brands that Pros demand, consistent product innovation as well as enhanced delivery and credit offerings to help them more efficiently manage their business. 
In the third quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Interline and are proud of the team's efforts in the first year. The Interline integration continues to progress as we work to execute against the business use cases to leverage Interline's capabilities. We're excited about the opportunity Interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with customers.
We continue to see double-digit sales growth from our online business. This quarter, online sales grew over 17% and represented 5.6% of overall sales. Over 40% of our online orders are picked up in the store, which we view as a positive sign of our physical store's continued relevance with our customers. This quarter, we rolled out a complete homedepot.com redesign. Content was enhanced to display in full screen, optimizing our desktop and tablet displays for customers.
You will recall during last year's third quarter, we opened and began shipping from our third direct fulfillment center, or DFC, in the U.S. With this distribution infrastructure in place, we have been better able to serve the needs of our online customers faster and more directly. We are still sorting the appropriate products to house in our 3 DFCs, but we've been able to reduce delivery cost and improve overall customer experience.
We continue to invest in our supply chain transformation by optimizing our network through initiatives like supply chain Sync. This quarter, we began the rollout of Sync to our Northern division, and we continue to onboard new suppliers in the Southern and Western divisions. As you know, this is a multi-year, multiphase endeavor, but we are pleased with our progress thus far.
Changing customer expectations are requiring that we simplify our operations in order to improve productivity and at the same time, reinvest in the customer experience. Our efforts to drive operational excellence in freight handling in the stores are doing just that. Reducing in both time footsteps needed to move freight end to end or from truck to shelf will enable us to reallocate associate time to enhance the customer experience. 
One way we're reinvesting in the customer experience is through initiatives like COM and BODFS. As you will recall, COM is our new customer order management system that was fully deployed last quarter in all U.S. stores. And BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver from Store, remains on track to be rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. 
In the 1,600 plus stores where we had BODFS, our on-time delivery service is now exceeding our target, and we have seen double-digit increase in the number of deliveries. We are pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced delivery option.
Turning to the macro environment. We believe home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the aging housing stock in the U.S. continue to support growth in our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales growth and lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year. 
Let me close by thanking our 400,000 plus associates for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our customers. I'd like to give a special thanks to all the associates and suppliers who have worked to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. They have worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by these storms. Service to our communities is a core part of The Home Depot culture, and we're very proud of their efforts. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw strength across the store, balance between the Pro and DIY customers as well as the continued growth in our online business. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. 
Lumber, tools, outdoor garden, indoor garden, lighting, decor and flooring were above the company's average comp. Plumbing, hardware, building materials, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical and paint were positive but below the company average. We continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter. Total comp transactions increased 2.4% while comp average ticket grew 3.1%. Our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity price inflation, mainly from lumber and building materials.
The total impacted ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 35 basis points. In addition, our average ticket growth was negatively impacted by approximately 33 basis points primarily due to weaker Mexican peso. Looking at big-ticket sales in the third quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.3%. Drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, flooring and roofing. 
Once again, we saw strong outperformance in many Pro-heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company's average comp. This led to strong comps in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, plywood, pressure-treated decking and interior doors. At the same time, we also saw strength with the DIY customer as they undertook various projects around the house. This project business drove strong comps and special are the carpet, tool storage, laminate flooring and vanities. 
Weather remained favorable throughout the quarter and extended the outdoor project selling season. By leveraging forecast analytics, strong supplier collaboration and our flexible supply chain, we were able to meet customer demand throughout the prolonged selling season. Categories such as lawn mowers, seed, planters, fertilizers and soils and mulch posted comps above the company average.
As Craig mentioned, our vendor partners, supply chain and internal teams rally to support our customers impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. Through strong collaboration, we were able to get product to our communities in their time of need. We estimate the impact of storm-related sales in the quarter to be approximately $100 million.
During the quarter, we held our annual Halloween Harvest and Labor Day events. These events were a huge success and increased both foot traffic in our stores and volume online. We experienced robust costs in decorative holiday, appliances and power tools. 
Turning to our interconnected business. We made significant changes to our online experiences in the third quarter. We rolled out an updated HD.com site and redesigned our app, both without interruption. The update includes an expanded buy box, which now makes it easier for our customers to select their preferred fulfillment option at check out, whether that be delivered to home or pick up in store. These changes have already yielded positive results as we have seen improvements in overall site performance.
Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter.
Product innovation remains a key part of our strategy. Adding to our broad line of professional grade power tools, we are excited to introduce 2 new breakthroughs. From Milwaukee, we are launching a 9-amp power lithium battery. This battery pack delivers up to 5x the runtime, 35% more power and runs 60% cooler than standard lithium battery packs, saving customers valuable time and money. The new battery is fully compatible with more than 100 Milwaukee M18 tools and provides the next big step toward complete quoted replacement. This new and advanced battery is a big box exclusive to The Home Depot.
From Makita, we're excited to announce the new subcompact drill and impact driver. This revolutionary new tools are the smallest Pro tools in the market delivering 18 volt power. The electronically controlled brushless motor in these products enables them to run cooler and more efficiently while, at the same time, matching the torque and RPM needed to meet the demands of the Pro customers. These products are another big box exclusive to The Home Depot.

Versus last year, foreign currency rates, primarily a w",722,"Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $23.2 billion, a 6.1% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, foreign currency rates, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $76 million or 0.35%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.8% in August, 6.5% in September and 6.1% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.2% in August, 6.9% in September and 6.5% in October.
One last comment on comps. While we are on a path to fully integrate Interline brands, we aren't at a point where it makes sense to include its results in our comps and operational sales metrics. When the business becomes more integrated, we will include Interline's results in our operational metrics.
Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 6 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors. First, as expected, we had 24 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain driven primarily by increased productivity. And finally, we had 17 basis points of gross margin expansion arising from a change in the mix of products sold and improvement in inventory shrinkage.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the third quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales, decreased by 62 basis points to 20.4%. In the quarter, we had some expenses that we did not planned for, including $23 million of legal expenses related to our 2014 data breach and approximately $15 million of storm-related cleanup expenses. Even with this unplanned expense pressure, we delivered total expenses under our plan.
For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rates. Our operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, an increase of 68 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $236 million, down $4 million from last year. 
In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.2%. For 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 36.7%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.60, an increase of 18.5% from last year. 
Now turning by $818 million into $8.1 billion. In the third quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 16.4 million shares of outstanding stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to approximately $4.6 billion. Additionally, during the quarter, we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $2 billion of incremental long-term debt, including a $1 billion tranche with a record-setting 40-year maturity carrying a coupon of 3.5%.
We will use the proceeds of this debt issuance to repurchase outstanding shares, bringing our targeted fiscal 216 share repurchases to $7 billion. Accordingly, we expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital of 29.1%, 280 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
Moving to our guidance. We remain encouraged by the strength of our core business. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects modest GDP growth, continued benefit from U.S. housing market and candidly, some market share gains. 
While we have tough fourth quarter comparisons, as Ted described, we planned for them. Today, we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Note that our sales forecast assumes foreign currency exchange rate as of the end of our fiscal third quarter.
For earnings per share, we've tightened up our tax provision an outstanding share forecast and are lifting our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.9% to $6.33. 
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And Katharine, we are now ready for questions."

And when you step away from the downturn in the mid-2000s, the previous downturn was 2001, and we saw a decline in average ticket that was a little bit of a leading indicator. Now you have to be careful because ticket can be affected by things like weather. So when you have big-ticket sales, for example, in the first and second quarter on things like tractors, weather can impact that. So we do watch ticket carefully. We balance that with transactions.

Last year, we had outperformance of bonus. We had some store cleanup costs. Those items will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year, so expect a good flow-through. Longer-term, as we've talked about, and we talked about this at the beginning of the year, because of items like rising people costs -- and we're not alone.

Since 2011, homeowners have seen a 95% increase in their home equity. That's come about because of rising prices as well as if you have a mortgage, you've been making mortgage payments since 2011. So homeowners really do view their home as an investment and not an expense. So the question is, ""Okay, great. Well, what does it mean for 2017 and beyond?"" While we see home prices have recovered in certain parts of the country, there are other parts of the country where we are still double-digit down from peak. Those areas include Chicago and Atlanta. So in terms of where we are for the cycle, you can't look at the averages because the averages will kill you. You have to look at the market.

Sales for the third quarter were $23.2 billion, up 6.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 5.5% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 in the third quarter, up 18.5% versus last year. 
In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the third quarter, led by our Southern division. All our regions positively comped except one region in the North. In New England, we had a small negative comp, due primarily to a state sales tax holiday in fiscal 2015 that did not repeat in 2016.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico and Canada reported positive comps in local currency, marking 52 and 20 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth, respectively. 
As Ted will detail, we saw balanced growth from both ticket and transactions. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY customers, with Pro sales growing faster than DIY sales in the quarter. Our Pro business continues to be driven by a strong offering of brands that Pros demand, consistent product innovation as well as enhanced delivery and credit offerings to help them more efficiently manage their business. 
In the third quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Interline and are proud of the team's efforts in the first year. The Interline integration continues to progress as we work to execute against the business use cases to leverage Interline's capabilities. We're excited about the opportunity Interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with customers.
We continue to see double-digit sales growth from our online business. This quarter, online sales grew over 17% and represented 5.6% of overall sales. Over 40% of our online orders are picked up in the store, which we view as a positive sign of our physical store's continued relevance with our customers. 
This quarter, we rolled out a complete homedepot.com redesign. Content was enhanced to display in full screen, optimizing our desktop and tablet displays for customers. You'll recall during last year's third quarter, we opened and began shipping from our third direct fulfillment center, or DFC, in the U.S. With this distribution infrastructure in place, we have been better able to serve the needs of our online customers faster and more directly. We are still sorting the appropriate products to house in our 3 DFCs, but we've been able to reduce delivery cross and improve overall customer experience. 
We continue to invest in our supply chain transformation by optimizing our network through initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. This quarter, we began the rollout of Sync to our Northern division, and we continue to onboard new suppliers in the Southern and Western divisions.
As you know, this is a multiyear, multiphased endeavor, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. Changing customer expectations are requiring that we simplify our operations in order to improve productivity and at the same time, reinvest in the customer experience. Our efforts to drive operational excellence in freight handling in the stores are doing just that. Reducing both time and footsteps needed to move freight end to end or from truck to shelf will enable us to reallocate associate time to enhance the customer experience. 
One way we're reinvesting in the customer experience is through initiatives like COM and BODFS. As you will recall, COM is our new customer order management system that was fully deployed last quarter in all U.S. stores. And BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, remains on track to be rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. In the 1,600-plus stores where we had BODFS, our on-time delivery service is now exceeding our target, and we have seen double-digit increase in the number of deliveries. We are pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced delivery option.
Turning to the macro environment. We believe home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the aging housing stock in the U.S. continue to support growth in our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales growth and lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year. 
Let me close by thanking our 400,000-plus associates for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our customers. I'd like to give a special thanks to all the associates and suppliers who have worked to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. They have worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by these storms. Service to our communities is a core part of The Home Depot culture, and we're very proud of their efforts. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw strength across the store, balance between the Pro and DIY customer as well as continued growth in our online business. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. 
Lumber, tools, outdoor garden, indoor garden, lighting, decor and flooring were above the company's average comp. Plumbing, hardware, building materials, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical and paint were positive but below the company average. We continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter. Total comp transactions increased 2.4%, while comp average ticket grew 3.1%. Our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity price inflation, mainly from lumber and building materials.
The total impacted ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 35 basis points. In addition, our average ticket growth was negatively impacted by approximately 33 basis points, primarily due to a weaker Mexican peso. 
Looking at big-ticket sales in the third quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.3%. Drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, flooring and roofing. 
Once again, we saw strong outperformance in many Pro-heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company's average comp. This led to strong comps in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, plywood, pressure-treated decking and interior doors. At the same time, we also saw strength with the DIY customer as they undertook various projects around the house. This project business drove strong comps, and special are the carpet, tool storage, laminate flooring and vanities. 
Weather remained favorable throughout the quarter and extended the outdoor project selling season. By leveraging forecast analytics, strong supplier collaboration and our flexible supply chain, we were able to meet customer demand throughout the prolonged selling season. Categories such as lawn mowers, seed, planters, fertilizers and soils and mulch posted comps above the company average.
As Craig mentioned, our vendor partners, supply chain and internal teams rallied to support our customers impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. Through strong collaboration, we were able to get product to our communities in their time of need. We estimate the impact of storm-related sales in the quarter to be approximately $100 million.
During the quarter, we held our annual Halloween, harvest and Labor Day events. These events were a huge success and increased both foot traffic in our stores and volume online. We experienced robust comps in decorative holiday, appliances and power tools. 
Turning to our interconnected business. We made significant changes to our online experiences in the third quarter. We rolled out an updated hd.com site and redesigned our app, both without interruption. The update includes an expanded buy box, which now makes it easier for our customers to select their preferred fulfillment option at check out, whether that be delivered to home or picked up in store. These changes have already yielded positive results as we have seen improvements in overall site performance.
Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Product innovation remains a key part of our strategy. Adding to our broad line of professional-grade power tools, we are excited to introduce 2 new breakthroughs. From Milwaukee, we are launching a 9-amp power lithium battery. This battery pack delivers up to 5x the run time, 35% more power and runs 60% cooler than standard lithium battery packs, saving customers valuable time and money. The new battery is fully compatible with more than 100 Milwaukee M18 tools and provides the next big step toward complete [indiscernible] replacement. This new and advanced battery is a big box exclusive to The Home Depot.
From Makita, we're excited to announce the new subcompact drill and impact driver. These revolutionary new tools are the smallest Pro tools in the market delivering 18-volt power. The electronically controlled brushless motor in these products enables them to run cooler and more efficiently while, at the same time, matching the torque and RPM needed to meet the demands of the Pro customer. These products are another big box exclusive to The Home Depot.
The winter season and cooler temperatures are rapidly approaching, and we have a great lineup of excellent values and special buys for our customers during our Black Friday, holiday and gift center events. One product to look for this holiday season is the exciting new Star Shower Motion Laser Light. This new and improved laser light projector not only projects thousands of green and red stars for a festive display in the front of the home, but it also turns into a motion laser light show at the press of a button. This product is a channel exclusive to The Home Depot. Our upcoming events, new product launches and outstanding execution by our associates will help drive a great holiday season. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the third quarter, sales were $23.2 billion, a 6.1% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, foreign currency rates, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $76 million or 0.35%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.8% in August, 6.5% in September and 6.1% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.2% in August, 6.9% in September and 6.5% in October.
One last comment on comps. While we are on a path to fully integrate Interline Brands, we aren't at a point where it makes sense to include its results in our comps and operational sales metrics. When the business becomes more integrated, we will include Interline's results in our operational metrics.
Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 6 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 24 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline; second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity; and finally, we had 17 basis points of gross margin expansion arising from a change in the mix of products sold and improvement in inventory shrinkage.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 62 basis points to 20.4%. In the quarter, we had some expenses that we did not plan for, including $23 million of legal expenses related to our 2014 data breach and approximately $15 million of storm-related cleanup expenses. Even with this unplanned expense pressure, we delivered total expenses under our plan.
For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, an increase of 68 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $236 million, down $4 million from last year. 
In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.2%. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 36.7%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.60, an increase of 18.5% from last year. 
Now turning by [ph] $818 million to $8.1 billion. In the third quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 16.4 million shares of outstanding stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to approximately $4.6 billion. Additionally, during the quarter, we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $2 billion of incremental long-term debt, including a $1 billion tranche with a record-setting 40-year maturity carrying a coupon of 3.5%.
We will use the proceeds of this debt issuance to repurchase outstanding shares, bringing our targeted fiscal 2016 share repurchases to $7 billion. Accordingly, we expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital of 29.1%, 280 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
Moving to our guidance. We remain encouraged by the strength of our core business. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects modest GDP growth; continued benefit from U.S. housing market; and candidly, some market share gains. 
While we have tough fourth quarter comparisons, as Ted described, we plan for them. Today, we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Note that our sales forecast assumes foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter.
For earnings per share, we've tightened up our tax provision and outstanding share forecast and are lifting our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.9% to $6.33. 
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And Katharine, we are now ready for questions."

And when you step away from the downturn in the mid-2000s, the previous downturn was 2001, and we saw a decline in average ticket that was a little bit of a leading indicator. Now you have to be careful because ticket can be affected by things like weather. So when you have big-ticket sales, for example, in the first and second quarter on things like tractors, weather can impact that. So we do watch ticket carefully. We balance that with transactions.

Since 2011, homeowners have seen a 95% increase in their home equity. That's come about because of rising prices as well as if you have a mortgage, you've been making mortgage payments since 2011. So homeowners really do view their home as an investment and not an expense. So the question is, ""Okay, great. Well, what does it mean for 2017 and beyond?"" While we see home prices have recovered in certain parts of the country, there are other parts of the country where we are still double-digit down from peak. Those areas include Chicago and Atlanta. So in terms of where we are for the cycle, you can't look at the averages because the averages will kill you. You have to look at the market. And when you look at the market, we see real opportunity for continued improvement. There's a really interesting statistics that comes out of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, and they call it the leading indicator of remodeling activity. And this leading indicator of remodeling activity suggests continued growth throughout the fourth quarter, throughout 2017. They don't produce the report past 2017, but their work suggests we will continue to grow."

Sales for the third quarter were $23.2 billion, up 6.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 5.5% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 in the third quarter, up 18.5% versus last year. 
In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the third quarter, led by our Southern division. All our regions positively comped except one region in the North. In New England, we had a small negative comp, due primarily to a state sales tax holiday in fiscal 2015 that did not repeat in 2016.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico and Canada reported positive comps in local currency, marking 52 and 20 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth, respectively. 
As Ted will detail, we saw balanced growth from both ticket and transactions. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY customers, with Pro sales growing faster than DIY sales in the quarter. Our Pro business continues to be driven by a strong offering of brands that Pros demand, consistent product innovation as well as enhanced delivery and credit offerings to help them more efficiently manage their business. 
In the third quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Interline and are proud of the team's efforts in the first year. The Interline integration continues to progress as we work to execute against the business use cases to leverage Interline's capabilities. We're excited about the opportunity Interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with customers.
We continue to see double-digit sales growth from our online business. This quarter, online sales grew over 17% and represented 5.6% of overall sales. Over 40% of our online orders are picked up in the store, which we view as a positive sign of our physical store's continued relevance with our customers. 
This quarter, we rolled out a complete homedepot.com redesign. Content was enhanced to display in full screen, optimizing our desktop and tablet displays for customers. You will recall during last year's third quarter, we opened and began shipping from our third direct fulfillment center, or DFC, in the U.S. With this distribution infrastructure in place, we have been better able to serve the needs of our online customers faster and more directly. We are still assorting the appropriate products to house in our 3 DFCs, but we've been able to reduce delivery cost and improve overall customer experience. 
We continue to invest in our supply chain transformation by optimizing our network through initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. This quarter, we began the rollout of Sync to our Northern division, and we continue to onboard new suppliers in the Southern and Western divisions.
As you know, this is a multiyear, multiphased endeavor, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. Changing customer expectations are requiring that we simplify our operations in order to improve productivity and at the same time, reinvest in the customer experience. Our efforts to drive operational excellence in freight handling in the stores are doing just that. Reducing both time and footsteps needed to move freight end to end or from truck to shelf will enable us to reallocate associate time to enhance the customer experience. 
One way we're reinvesting in the customer experience is through initiatives like COM and BODFS. As you will recall, COM is our new customer order management system that was fully deployed last quarter in all U.S. stores. And BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, remains on track to be rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. In the 1,600-plus stores where we have BODFS, our on-time delivery service is now exceeding our target, and we have seen double-digit increase in the number of deliveries. We are pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced delivery option.
Turning to the macro environment. We believe home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the aging housing stock in the U.S. continue to support growth in our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales growth and lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year. 
Let me close by thanking our 400,000-plus associates for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our customers. I'd like to give a special thanks to all the associates and suppliers who have worked to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. They have worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by these storms. Service to our communities is a core part of The Home Depot culture, and we're very proud of their efforts. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw strength across the store, balanced between the Pro and DIY customer as well as continued growth in our online business. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. 
Lumber, tools, outdoor garden, indoor garden, lighting, decor and flooring were above the company's average comp. Plumbing, hardware, building materials, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical and paint were positive but below the company average. We continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter. Total comp transactions increased 2.4%, while comp average ticket grew 3.1%. Our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity price inflation, mainly from lumber and building materials.
The total impacted ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 35 basis points. In addition, our average ticket growth was negatively impacted by approximately 33 basis points, primarily due to a weaker Mexican peso. 
Looking at big-ticket sales in the third quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.3%. Drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, flooring and roofing. 
Once again, we saw strong outperformance in many Pro-heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company's average comp. This led to strong comps in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, plywood, pressure-treated decking and interior doors. At the same time, we also saw strength with the DIY customer as they undertook various projects around the house. This project business drove strong comps in special [ph] are the carpet, tool storage, laminate flooring and vanities. 
Weather remained favorable throughout the quarter and extended the outdoor project selling season. By leveraging forecast analytics, strong supplier collaboration and our flexible supply chain, we were able to meet customer demand throughout the prolonged selling season. Categories such as lawn mowers, seed, planters, fertilizers and soils and mulch posted comps above the company average.
As Craig mentioned, our vendor partners, supply chain and internal teams rallied to support our customers impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. Through strong collaboration, we were able to get product to our communities in their time of need. We estimate the impact of storm-related sales in the quarter to be approximately $100 million.
During the quarter, we held our annual Halloween, harvest and Labor Day events. These events were a huge success and increased both foot traffic in our stores and volume online. We experienced robust comps in decorative holiday, appliances and power tools. 
Turning to our interconnected business. We made significant changes to our online experiences in the third quarter. We rolled out an updated hd.com site and redesigned our app, both without interruption. The update includes an expanded buy box, which now makes it easier for our customers to select their preferred fulfillment option at check out, whether that be delivered to home or picked up in store. These changes have already yielded positive results as we have seen improvements in overall site performance.
Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Product innovation remains a key part of our strategy. Adding to our broad line of professional-grade power tools, we are excited to introduce 2 new breakthroughs. From Milwaukee, we are launching a 9-amp hour lithium battery. This battery pack delivers up to 5x the run time, 35% more power and runs 60% cooler than standard lithium battery packs, saving customers valuable time and money. The new battery is fully compatible with more than 100 Milwaukee M18 tools and provides the next big step toward complete [indiscernible] replacement. This new and advanced battery is a big box exclusive to The Home Depot.
From Makita, we're excited to announce the new subcompact drill and impact driver. These revolutionary new tools are the smallest Pro tools in the market delivering 18-volt power. The electronically controlled brushless motor in these products enables them to run cooler and more efficiently while, at the same time, matching the torque and RPMs needed to meet the demands of the Pro customer. These products are another big box exclusive to The Home Depot.
The winter season and cooler temperatures are rapidly approaching, and we have a great lineup of excellent values and special buys for our customers during our Black Friday, holiday and gift center events. One product to look for this holiday season is the exciting new Star Shower Motion Laser Light. This new and improved laser light projector not only projects thousands of green and red stars for a festive display in the front of the home, but it also turns into a motion laser light show at the press of a button. This product is a channel exclusive to The Home Depot. Our upcoming events, new product launches and outstanding execution by our associates will help drive a great holiday season. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the third quarter, sales were $23.2 billion, a 6.1% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, foreign currency rates, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $76 million or 0.35%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were a positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.8% in August, 6.5% in September and 6.1% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.2% in August, 6.9% in September and 6.5% in October.
One last comment on comps. While we are on a path to fully integrate Interline Brands, we aren't at a point where it makes sense to include its results in our comps and operational sales metrics. When the business becomes more integrated, we will include Interline's results in our operational metrics.
Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 6 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 24 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline; second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity; and finally, we had 17 basis points of gross margin expansion arising from a change in the mix of products sold and improvement in inventory shrinkage.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 62 basis points to 20.4%. In the quarter, we had some expenses that we did not plan for, including $23 million of legal expenses related to our 2014 data breach and approximately $15 million of storm-related cleanup expenses. Even with this unplanned expense pressure, we delivered total expenses under our plan.
For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, an increase of 68 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $236 million, down $4 million from last year. 
In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.2%. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 36.7%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.60, an increase of 18.5% from last year. 
Now turning [Audio Gap] by [ph] $818 million to $8.1 billion. In the third quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 16.4 million shares of outstanding stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to approximately $4.6 billion. Additionally, during the quarter, we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $2 billion of incremental long-term debt, including a $1 billion tranche with a record-setting 40-year maturity carrying a coupon of 3.5%.
We will use the proceeds of this debt issuance to repurchase outstanding shares, bringing our targeted fiscal 2016 share repurchases to $7 billion. Accordingly, we expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital of 29.1%, 280 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
Moving to our guidance. We remain encouraged by the strength of our core business. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects modest GDP growth; continued benefits from U.S. housing markets; and candidly, some market share gains. 
While we have tough fourth quarter comparisons, as Ted described, we plan for them. Today, we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Note that our sales forecast assumes foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter.
For earnings per share, we've tightened up our tax provision and outstanding share forecast and are lifting our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.9% to $6.33. 
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And Katherine, we are now ready for questions."

And when you step away from the downturn in the mid-2000s, the previous downturn was 2001, and we saw a decline in average ticket that was a little bit of a leading indicator. Now you have to be careful because ticket can be affected by things like weather. So when you have big-ticket sales, for example, in the first and second quarter on things like tractors, weather can impact that. So we do watch ticket carefully. We balance that with transactions. What we're seeing in the business right now, we like a lot. We see a nice balance between ticket and transactions."

Since 2011, homeowners have seen a 95% increase in their home equity. That's come about because of rising prices as well as if you have a mortgage, you've been making mortgage payments since 2011. So homeowners really do view their home as an investment and not an expense. So the question is, ""Okay, great. Well, what does it mean for 2017 and beyond?"" While we see home prices have recovered in certain parts of the country, there are other parts of the country where we are still double-digit down from peak. Those areas include Chicago and Atlanta. So in terms of where we are for the cycle, you can't look at the averages because the averages will kill you. You have to look at the markets. And when you look at the markets, we see real opportunity for continued improvement. There's a really interesting statistic that comes out of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, and they call it the leading indicator of remodeling activity. And this leading indicator of remodeling activity suggests continued growth throughout the fourth quarter, throughout 2017.

Clearly, we've seen pressure there that we haven't seen in the balance of the country.

All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY customers, with Pro sales growing faster than DIY sales in the quarter. Our Pro business continues to be driven by a strong offering of brands that Pros demand, consistent product innovation as well as enhanced delivery and credit offerings to help them more efficiently manage their business. 
In the third quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Interline and are proud of the team's efforts in the first year. The Interline integration continues to progress as we work to execute against the business use cases to leverage Interline's capabilities. We're excited about the opportunity Interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with customers.
We continue to see double-digit sales growth from our online business. This quarter, online sales grew over 17% and represented 5.6% of overall sales. Over 40% of our online orders are picked up in the store, which we view as a positive sign of our physical store's continued relevance with our customers. 
This quarter, we rolled out a complete homedepot.com redesign. Content was enhanced to display in full screen, optimizing our desktop and tablet displays for customers. You will recall during last year's third quarter, we opened and began shipping from our third direct fulfillment center, or DFC, in the U.S. With this distribution infrastructure in place, we have been better able to serve the needs of our online customers faster and more directly. We are still assorting the appropriate products to house in our 3 DFCs, but we've been able to reduce delivery cost and improve overall customer experience. 
We continue to invest in our supply chain transformation by optimizing our network through initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. This quarter, we began the rollout of Sync to our Northern division, and we continue to onboard new suppliers in the Southern and Western divisions.
As you know, this is a multiyear, multiphased endeavor, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. Changing customer expectations are requiring that we simplify our operations in order to improve productivity and at the same time, reinvest in the customer experience. Our efforts to drive operational excellence in freight handling in the stores are doing just that. Reducing both time and footsteps needed to move freight end to end or from truck to shelf will enable us to reallocate associate time to enhance the customer experience. 
One way we're reinvesting in the customer experience is through initiatives like COM and BODFS. As you will recall, COM is our new customer order management system that was fully deployed last quarter in all U.S. stores. And BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, remains on track to be rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. In the 1,600-plus stores where we have BODFS, our on-time delivery service is now exceeding our target, and we have seen double-digit increase in the number of deliveries. We are pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced delivery option.
Turning to the macro environment. We believe home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the aging housing stock in the U.S. continue to support growth in our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales growth and lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year. 
Let me close by thanking our 400,000-plus associates for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our customers. I'd like to give a special thanks to all the associates and suppliers who have worked to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. They have worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by these storms. Service to our communities is a core part of The Home Depot culture, and we're very proud of their efforts. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw strength across the store, balanced between the Pro and DIY customer as well as continued growth in our online business. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. 
Lumber, tools, outdoor garden, indoor garden, lighting, decor and flooring were above the company's average comp. Plumbing, hardware, building materials, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical and paint were positive but below the company average. We continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter. Total comp transactions increased 2.4%, while comp average ticket grew 3.1%. Our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity price inflation, mainly from lumber and building materials.
The total impacted ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 35 basis points. In addition, our average ticket growth was negatively impacted by approximately 33 basis points, primarily due to a weaker Mexican peso. 
Looking at big-ticket sales in the third quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.3%. Drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, flooring and roofing. 
Once again, we saw strong outperformance in many Pro-heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company's average comp. This led to strong comps in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, plywood, pressure-treated decking and interior doors. At the same time, we also saw strength with the DIY customer as they undertook various projects around the house. This project business drove strong comps in special [ph] are the carpet, tool storage, laminate flooring and vanities. 
Weather remained favorable throughout the quarter and extended the outdoor project selling season. By leveraging forecast analytics, strong supplier collaboration and our flexible supply chain, we were able to meet customer demand throughout the prolonged selling season. Categories such as lawn mowers, seed, planters, fertilizers and soils and mulch posted comps above the company average.
As Craig mentioned, our vendor partners, supply chain and internal teams rallied to support our customers impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. Through strong collaboration, we were able to get product to our communities in their time of need. We estimate the impact of storm-related sales in the quarter to be approximately $100 million.
During the quarter, we held our annual Halloween, harvest and Labor Day events. These events were a huge success and increased both foot traffic in our stores and volume online. We experienced robust comps in decorative holiday, appliances and power tools. 
Turning to our interconnected business. We made significant changes to our online experiences in the third quarter. We rolled out an updated hd.com site and redesigned our app, both without interruption. The update includes an expanded buy box, which now makes it easier for our customers to select their preferred fulfillment option at check out, whether that be delivered to home or picked up in store. These changes have already yielded positive results as we have seen improvements in overall site performance.
Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Product innovation remains a key part of our strategy. Adding to our broad line of professional-grade power tools, we are excited to introduce 2 new breakthroughs. From Milwaukee, we are launching a 9-amp hour lithium battery. This battery pack delivers up to 5x the run time, 35% more power and runs 60% cooler than standard lithium battery packs, saving customers valuable time and money. The new battery is fully compatible with more than 100 Milwaukee M18 tools and provides the next big step toward complete [indiscernible] replacement. This new and advanced battery is a big box exclusive to The Home Depot.
From Makita, we're excited to announce the new subcompact drill and impact driver. These revolutionary new tools are the smallest Pro tools in the market delivering 18-volt power. The electronically controlled brushless motor in these products enables them to run cooler and more efficiently while, at the same time, matching the torque and RPMs needed to meet the demands of the Pro customer. These products are another big box exclusive to The Home Depot.
The winter season and cooler temperatures are rapidly approaching, and we have a great lineup of excellent values and special buys for our customers during our Black Friday, holiday and gift center events. One product to look for this holiday season is the exciting new Star Shower Motion Laser Light. This new and improved laser light projector not only projects thousands of green and red stars for a festive display in the front of the home, but it also turns into a motion laser light show at the press of a button. This product is a channel exclusive to The Home Depot. Our upcoming events, new product launches and outstanding execution by our associates will help drive a great holiday season. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the third quarter, sales were $23.2 billion, a 6.1% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, foreign currency rates, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $76 million or 0.35%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were a positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.8% in August, 6.5% in September and 6.1% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.2% in August, 6.9% in September and 6.5% in October.
One last comment on comps. While we are on a path to fully integrate Interline Brands, we aren't at a point where it makes sense to include its results in our comps and operational sales metrics. When the business becomes more integrated, we will include Interline's results in our operational metrics.
Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 6 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 24 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline; second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity; and finally, we had 17 basis points of gross margin expansion arising from a change in the mix of products sold and improvement in inventory shrinkage.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 62 basis points to 20.4%. In the quarter, we had some expenses that we did not plan for, including $23 million of legal expenses related to our 2014 data breach and approximately $15 million of storm-related cleanup expenses. Even with this unplanned expense pressure, we delivered total expenses under our plan.
For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, an increase of 68 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $236 million, down $4 million from last year. 
In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.2%. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 36.7%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.60, an increase of 18.5% from last year. 
Now turning [Audio Gap] by [ph] $818 million to $8.1 billion. In the third quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 16.4 million shares of outstanding stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to approximately $4.6 billion. Additionally, during the quarter, we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $2 billion of incremental long-term debt, including a $1 billion tranche with a record-setting 40-year maturity carrying a coupon of 3.5%.
We will use the proceeds of this debt issuance to repurchase outstanding shares, bringing our targeted fiscal 2016 share repurchases to $7 billion. Accordingly, we expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital of 29.1%, 280 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
Moving to our guidance. We remain encouraged by the strength of our core business. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects modest GDP growth; continued benefits from U.S. housing markets; and candidly, some market share gains. 
While we have tough fourth quarter comparisons, as Ted described, we plan for them. Today, we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Note that our sales forecast assumes foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter.
For earnings per share, we've tightened up our tax provision and outstanding share forecast and are lifting our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.9% to $6.33. 
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And Katherine, we are now ready for questions."

And when you step away from the downturn in the mid-2000s, the previous downturn was 2001, and we saw a decline in average ticket that was a little bit of a leading indicator. Now you have to be careful because ticket can be affected by things like weather. So when you have big-ticket sales, for example, in the first and second quarter on things like tractors, weather can impact that. So we do watch ticket carefully. We balance that with transactions.

Since 2011, homeowners have seen a 95% increase in their home equity. That's come about because of rising prices as well as if you have a mortgage, you've been making mortgage payments since 2011. So homeowners really do view their home as an investment and not an expense. So the question is, ""Okay, great. Well, what does it mean for 2017 and beyond?"" While we see home prices have recovered in certain parts of the country, there are other parts of the country where we are still double-digit down from peak. Those areas include Chicago and Atlanta. So in terms of where we are for the cycle, you can't look at the averages because the averages will kill you. You have to look at the markets. And when you look at the markets, we see real opportunity for continued improvement.

Sales for the second quarter were $26.5 billion, up 6.6% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.7% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.4%.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.97 in the second quarter, up 13.9% versus last year. In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the second quarter, led by our Western division. And all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single to double-digit comps in the quarter.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 51 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our Canadian business also posted positive comps in local currency for a total of 19 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth.
We continue to see broad-based growth across our stores as both ticket and transactions grew. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY categories with Pro sales outpacing our DIY business in the U.S.
The Interline integration is progressing as we continue to deliver on the acquisition's value drivers. We have been piloting our first business use case, offering Interline's catalog of products to Pro's shopping Home Depot stores. We are pleased with the traction that we've seen in this pilot, although it is still early days. We continue to work towards leveraging Interline's capabilities to expand our share of wallet with our current customers as well as gain new customers.
Our online business had sales growth of approximately 19% versus last year and represented 5.6% of total sales. As Ted will detail, we continue to leverage our merchandising tools to refine
product offerings across channels based on customer preferences. Our goal is to provide our customers with the convenient and fulfillment options they desire.
We continue to build out capabilities to improve the overall customer experience. For example, in recent months, we began implementing our dynamic ETA feature for online purchases. Dynamic ETA provides a delivery date based on the customer's location. In the past, we issued a generic delivery window estimate which allowed for extra time or cushion for the delivery commitment to customers. As we've begun to implement the dynamic ETA, our promised delivery date to customers is earlier and more accurately estimated. As a result, we're seeing an increased conversion in customer satisfaction.
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain as the dividends from investments made over the past several years yield a positive impact on our inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and customers. As you know, we see our supply chain transformation as an ongoing work in progress and continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. Sync is in the early stages of a multi-year rollout.
We are investing to more effectively meet our customers' demands. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management system, is now fully deployed in all U.S. stores. The next phase of COM is to optimize and fine-tune this new system. Following behind COM is the rollout of BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, which we expect to be completed by the end of the fiscal year.
While we had a strong quarter, as you have heard, we are instituting a high degree of change across many areas of the business. With this amount of change, there will be learnings and opportunities to refine the process along the way. In the quarter, we identified several opportunities for improvement, particularly around inventory management and freight handling, which we're working to address.
Turning to the macro environment. We continue to see positive signs in the housing data, which we believe serve as a tailwind for our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect our out performance this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. A successful spring season depends on the hard work and dedication of the 400,000 plus associates we have serving our customers today. I want to close by thanking them.
Based on the first half results, almost 100% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our [indiscernible] associates. We're very proud of their efforts. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We were pleased with our results in the second quarter. Core maintenance and repair categories as well as many Pro heavy categories continued to have solid performance in the quarter.
Our growth in the quarter was balanced. Total comp transactions grew by 2.2% for the quarter, while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Ticket growth was driven by an increase in the items per basket, as project business continued to show strength. Our average ticket was also positively impacted from slight commodity price inflation, mainly for building materials and lumber. The total impact of ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 18 basis points. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact to our average ticket growth of approximately 69 basis points. Focusing on big-ticket sales in the second quarter, transactions for tickets over $900; representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 8.1%. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were HVAC, appliances and roofing.
All merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. Tools, lumber, plumbing, decor, indoor garden, building materials and lighting were above the company's average comp. Hardware, outdoor garden, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical, paint and flooring were positive, but below the company average.
As Craig mentioned, we continued to see notable strength with our Pro customers. Pro sales grew faster than the company comp, led by our high-spend Pro customers. This continued strength led to comps above the company average in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, power tools, power tool accessories, wiring devices and interior doors.
We saw continued strength in the core of the store as our customers undertook various projects. For example, landscape lighting and in vinyl flooring, [indiscernible] organization, and cleaning had strong comps in the quarter. Wide spread and record-setting heat in the quarter drove strong performance in HVAC, air-conditioning, fans and air circulation. Sales were also strong in categories like irrigation and watering, which delivered double-digit comps.
Our store associates did an exceptional job executing our summer events and creating excitement in our stores. Our Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events provided excellent value and we saw strong demand from our customers. These events helped drive robust comps in appliances, tool storage, outdoor power and grills.
In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we continually leverage our merchandising tools to fine-tune our online and in-store assortments. One specific example of this is with our patio offering. We found that many customers want to come into our stores to purchase and pick up their patio sets. We altered our assortment and put certain patio sets back into the stores. This strategic move was well-received by our customers, leading to record sales and sell-through in our stores.
Our online business had strong growth in the quarter with double-digit traffic growth and improvement in conversion. Our interconnected retail initiatives continued to evolve to meet the changing demands of our customers. Mobile and tablet are over 50% of our traffic and are important tools that our customers use to engage with our products, our stores and our associates.
We are enhancing the functionality of mobile with features like larger and clear product images, live mobile chat and a simplified checkout experience. As evidence of the success of our interconnected strategy, approximately 42% of our online orders are now leveraging our store footprint for fulfillment and nearly 90% of our online product returns are processed through the convenience of our stores.
Now let's turn our attention to the third quarter. Our focus on innovation is a key part of our strategy. For our Pro customers, we will be introducing the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system in our stores this fall. This DEWALT system uses the innovative flexible battery which identifies various types of DEWALT tools and adjusts voltage to provide the appropriate level of power needed. These products provide corded performance without the cord. And the innovative brushless motors increase tool run-time and durability, saving our Pros time and money on their job sites. Among big-box retailers, the DEWALT FLEXVOLT® system can only be found at The Home Depot.
As smart devices continue to resonate with customers, we're excited about expanding smart technology with the new RYOBI garage door opener. This innovative system connects with any smart device and allows our customers to operate their garage door remotely, talk on the phone or play music through an embedded Bluetooth speaker or park with ease using the laser park-assist attachment. The new exclusive RYOBI garage door opener can only be found at The Home Depot.
The fall season and cooler temperatures are just around the corner, and we have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys for our customers during our Labor Day, fall cleanup and Halloween harvest events.
With the Halloween harvest season, we have a tremendous amount of new seasonal products, like the exclusive animated window projector kit, which allows our customers to easily decorate their windows with animated digital holiday clips. This is the first digital decoration in the marketplace and it is exclusive to The Home Depot.
Our exciting third quarter events, along with outstanding execution in stores, will position us for success in the third quarter.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."
278679,378663149,1216615,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to remind you that our net earnings for the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax net expense of $92 million related to our 2014 data breach and a $144 million pretax gain on sa",928,"Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to remind you that our net earnings for the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax net expense of $92 million related to our 2014 data breach and a $144 million pretax gain on sale of HD Supply common stock. When added together, these 2 items contributed $0.02 of diluted earnings per share last year that did not repeat this year. So with that, let's get started.
In the second quarter, sales were $26.5 billion, a 6.6% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $181 million or 0.7%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 4.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.3% in May, 7.5% in June and 4.5% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 3% in May, 8.4% in June and 5% in July.
Our monthly comp sales were a bit distorted by the timing of Memorial Day. Last year, Memorial Day sales were included in our May results and this year, they were included in our June results. Adjusting for this timing shift, our U.S. comps would have been 4.3% in May, 7% in June and 5% in July.
Our total company gross margin was 33.7% for the quarter, an increase of 3 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 22 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline; second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity and by lower fuel costs; and finally, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion due primarily to reaching higher co-op and rebate tiers in certain category classes, which lowered our cost. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the second quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales, decreased by 78 basis points to 18.2%. As I mentioned, our expenses in 2015 included $92 million of net data breach-related expenses that did not repeat in 2016.
In the quarter, we were pleased with our expense performance as total expenses were under our plan. Due to our continued focus on expense control, we now believe that our fiscal 2016 expenses will grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.5%, an increase of 81 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $228 million, up $144 million from last year, reflecting last year's pretax gain on sale of HD supply common stock that did not repeat this year.
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 37% compared to 37.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%.
Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.97, an increase of 13.9% from last year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end the quarter, inventory was $12.3 billion, up $464 million from last year, due primarily to the impact of Interline. Inventory turns were 5.2x, up 1/10 from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year, accounts payable increased by $778 million to $8.3 billion, reflecting the timing of purchases and the impact of Interline.
In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.46 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital was 29%, 400 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
Now turning our attention to the full year. Recent GDP growth estimates suggest a slowdown in the U.S. economy from what we expected, but we are encouraged by the strength of our core business as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.
Based on our first half performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out at the end of our first quarter. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Implied with this guidance is a comp for the second half of fiscal 2016 of approximately 4.3%. This is not a reflection of a sequential slowdown in sales, but rather a reflection of year-over-year performance.
On a 2-year stack basis, we expect our comps in the back half the year to be about the same as what we reported for the first half of the year. While we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance, we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year principally because of better expense control and, therefore, more operating leverage than we anticipated at the end of the first quarter. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.6% to $6.31.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And Shelon, we are now ready for questions."

Now if I could zoom out a little bit and talk about our private label program in total, we actually saw a decline in penetration year-on-year of about 30 basis points, taking our penetration down to just under 23%. The decline was attributed to a decline in the consumer card. And when we peel back the layers of the onion to say, ""Well, what's happening with the consumer card?"" We see a few things. Last year, we had a few promotional events that we did not repeat this year. So that impacted the penetration. And then we see increasing competition coming from bank cards. In fact, I received one just at my home this week from VISA that's offering differed financing. So there is increased competition out there. And then finally, and interestingly, we're seeing a robust penetration increase in PIN debit. PIN debit, up over 100 basis points year-on-year, is now the third-largest form of tender inside our company.

Sales for the third quarter were $23.2 billion, up 6.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 5.5% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 in the third quarter, up 18.5% versus last year. 
In the U.S., all 3 of our divisions posted positive comps in the third quarter, led by our Southern division. All our regions positively comped except one region in the North. In New England, we had a small negative comp, due primarily to a state sales tax holiday in fiscal 2015 that did not repeat in 2016.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico and Canada reported positive comps in local currency, marking 52 and 20 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth, respectively. 
As Ted will detail, we saw balanced growth from both ticket and transactions. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY customers, with Pro sales growing faster than DIY sales in the quarter. Our Pro business continues to be driven by a strong offering of brands that Pros demand, consistent product innovation as well as enhanced delivery and credit offerings to help them more efficiently manage their business. 
In the third quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Interline and are proud of the team's efforts in the first year. The Interline integration continues to progress as we work to execute against the business use cases to leverage Interline's capabilities. We're excited about the opportunity Interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with customers.
We continue to see double-digit sales growth from our online business. This quarter, online sales grew over 17% and represented 5.6% of overall sales. Over 40% of our online orders are picked up in the store, which we view as a positive sign of our physical store's continued relevance with our customers. 
This quarter, we rolled out a complete homedepot.com redesign. Content was enhanced to display in full screen, optimizing our desktop and tablet displays for customers. You will recall during last year's third quarter, we opened and began shipping from our third direct fulfillment center, or DFC, in the U.S. With this distribution infrastructure in place, we have been better able to serve the needs of our online customers faster and more directly. We are still assorting the appropriate products to house in our 3 DFCs, but we've been able to reduce delivery cost and improve overall customer experience. 
We continue to invest in our supply chain transformation by optimizing our network through initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. This quarter, we began the rollout of Sync to our Northern division, and we continue to onboard new suppliers in the Southern and Western divisions.
As you know, this is a multiyear, multiphased endeavor, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. Changing customer expectations are requiring that we simplify our operations in order to improve productivity and at the same time, reinvest in the customer experience. Our efforts to drive operational excellence in freight handling in the stores are doing just that. Reducing both time and footsteps needed to move freight end to end or from truck to shelf will enable us to reallocate associate time to enhance the customer experience. 
One way we're reinvesting in the customer experience is through initiatives like COM and BODFS. As you will recall, COM is our new customer order management system that was fully deployed last quarter in all U.S. stores. And BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store, remains on track to be rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. In the 1,600-plus stores where we have BODFS, our on-time delivery service is now exceeding our target, and we have seen double-digit increase in the number of deliveries. We are pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced delivery option.
Turning to the macro environment. We believe home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the aging housing stock in the U.S. continue to support growth in our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales growth and lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year. 
Let me close by thanking our 400,000-plus associates for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our customers. I'd like to give a special thanks to all the associates and suppliers who have worked to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. They have worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by these storms. Service to our communities is a core part of The Home Depot culture, and we're very proud of their efforts. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We saw strength across the store, balanced between the Pro and DIY customer as well as continued growth in our online business. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter. 
Lumber, tools, outdoor garden, indoor garden, lighting, decor and flooring were above the company's average comp. Plumbing, hardware, building materials, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical and paint were positive but below the company average. We continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter. Total comp transactions increased 2.4%, while comp average ticket grew 3.1%. Our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity price inflation, mainly from lumber and building materials.
The total impacted ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 35 basis points. In addition, our average ticket growth was negatively impacted by approximately 33 basis points, primarily due to a weaker Mexican peso. 
Looking at big-ticket sales in the third quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.3%. Drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were appliances, flooring and roofing. 
Once again, we saw strong outperformance in many Pro-heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company's average comp. This led to strong comps in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, plywood, pressure-treated decking and interior doors. At the same time, we also saw strength with the DIY customer as they undertook various projects around the house. This project business drove strong comps in special order carpet, tool storage, laminate flooring and vanities. 
Weather remained favorable throughout the quarter and extended the outdoor project selling season. By leveraging forecast analytics, strong supplier collaboration and our flexible supply chain, we were able to meet customer demand throughout the prolonged selling season. Categories such as lawn mowers, seed, planters, fertilizers and soils and mulch posted comps above the company average.
As Craig mentioned, our vendor partners, supply chain and internal teams rallied to support our customers impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. Through strong collaboration, we were able to get product to our communities in their time of need. We estimate the impact of storm-related sales in the quarter to be approximately $100 million.
During the quarter, we held our annual Halloween, harvest and Labor Day events. These events were a huge success and increased both foot traffic in our stores and volume online. We experienced robust comps in decorative holiday, appliances and power tools. 
Turning to our interconnected business. We made significant changes to our online experiences in the third quarter. We rolled out an updated hd.com site and redesigned our app, both without interruption. The update includes an expanded buy box, which now makes it easier for our customers to select their preferred fulfillment option at check out, whether that be delivered to home or picked up in store. These changes have already yielded positive results as we have seen improvements in overall site performance.
Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Product innovation remains a key part of our strategy. Adding to our broad line of professional-grade power tools, we are excited to introduce 2 new breakthroughs. From Milwaukee, we are launching a 9-amp hour lithium battery. This battery pack delivers up to 5x the run time, 35% more power and runs 60% cooler than standard lithium battery packs, saving customers valuable time and money. The new battery is fully compatible with more than 100 Milwaukee M18 tools and provides the next big step toward complete [indiscernible] replacement. This new and advanced battery is a big box exclusive to The Home Depot.
From Makita, we're excited to announce the new subcompact drill and impact driver. These revolutionary new tools are the smallest Pro tools in the market delivering 18-volt power. The electronically controlled brushless motor in these products enables them to run cooler and more efficiently while, at the same time, matching the torque and RPMs needed to meet the demands of the Pro customer. These products are another big box exclusive to The Home Depot.
The winter season and cooler temperatures are rapidly approaching, and we have a great lineup of excellent values and special buys for our customers during our Black Friday, holiday and gift center events. One product to look for this holiday season is the exciting new Star Shower Motion Laser Light. This new and improved laser light projector not only projects thousands of green and red stars for a festive display in the front of the home, but it also turns into a motion laser light show at the press of a button. This product is a channel exclusive to The Home Depot. Our upcoming events, new product launches and outstanding execution by our associates will help drive a great holiday season. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol."

In the third quarter, sales were $23.2 billion, a 6.1% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, foreign currency rates, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $76 million or 0.35%. Our total company comps or same-store sales were a positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.8% in August, 6.5% in September and 6.1% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.2% in August, 6.9% in September and 6.5% in October.
One last comment on comps. While we are on a path to fully integrate Interline Brands, we aren't at a point where it makes sense to include its results in our comps and operational sales metrics. When the business becomes more integrated, we will include Interline's results in our operational metrics.
Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 6 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 24 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline; second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity; and finally, we had 17 basis points of gross margin expansion arising from a change in the mix of products sold and improvement in inventory shrinkage.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015. In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 62 basis points to 20.4%. In the quarter, we had some expenses that we did not plan for, including $23 million of legal expenses related to our 2014 data breach and approximately $15 million of storm-related cleanup expenses. Even with this unplanned expense pressure, we delivered total expenses under our plan.
For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate. Our operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, an increase of 68 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $236 million, down $4 million from last year. 
In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.2%. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 36.7%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.60, an increase of 18.5% from last year. 
Now turning [Audio Gap] by [ph] $818 million to $8.1 billion. In the third quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 16.4 million shares of outstanding stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to approximately $4.6 billion. Additionally, during the quarter, we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $2 billion of incremental long-term debt, including a $1 billion tranche with a record-setting 40-year maturity carrying a coupon of 3.5%.
We will use the proceeds of this debt issuance to repurchase outstanding shares, bringing our targeted fiscal 2016 share repurchases to $7 billion. Accordingly, we expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 4 quarters, return on invested capital of 29.1%, 280 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
Moving to our guidance. We remain encouraged by the strength of our core business. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects modest GDP growth; continued benefits from U.S. housing markets; and candidly, some market share gains. 
While we have tough fourth quarter comparisons, as Ted described, we plan for them. Today, we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Note that our sales forecast assumes foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter.
For earnings per share, we've tightened up our tax provision and outstanding share forecast and are lifting our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.9% to $6.33. 
So thank you for your participation in today's call. And Katherine, we are now ready for questions."

And when you step away from the downturn in the mid-2000s, the previous downturn was 2001, and we saw a decline in average ticket that was a little bit of a leading indicator. Now you have to be careful because ticket can be affected by things like weather.

Since 2011, homeowners have seen a 95% increase in their home equity. That's come about because of rising prices as well as if you have a mortgage, you've been making mortgage payments since 2011. So homeowners really do view their home as an investment and not an expense. So the question is, ""Okay, great. Well, what does it mean for 2017 and beyond?"" While we see home prices have recovered in certain parts of the country, there are other parts of the country where we are still double-digit down from peak. Those areas include Chicago and Atlanta. So in terms of where we are for the cycle, you can't look at the averages because the averages will kill you. You have to look at the markets. And when you look at the markets, we see real opportunity for continued improvement. There's a really interesting statistic that comes out of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, and they call it the leading indicator of remodeling activity.

It's probably a big fourth quarter category. Is flooring and roofing more weather-dependent? Or is that more seasonal or is it lasting?"
