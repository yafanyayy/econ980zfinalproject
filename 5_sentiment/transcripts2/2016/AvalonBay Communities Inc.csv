With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterward. During our",1322,"Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q4 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterward. 
During our comments, we'll focus on providing a summary of Q4 and the full-year results and then time talking about the outlook for 2016. I'll talk about the economy, apartment markets and operations and turn it over to Kevin, who will talk about development as well as capital and risk management as we move further into the cycle.
So let's start on Slide 4. Highlights for the quarter and year include core FFO growth in Q4 14.4% and 11.4% for the full year, which is about 300 basis point higher than our original outlook at the beginning of the year. And importantly, we continue to generate FFO growth this cycle toward the top of the sector while having the lowest leverage. 
Q4 same-store revenue growth came in at 5.4% or 5.7% when you include redevelopment, as many of our peers do. And for the full year, same-store revenue growth came in at 5.0 or 5.2, including redevelopment. Same-store NOI for the year came in at 5.8%. 
We completed about $500 million this quarter at right around a 7% yield and $1.3 billion for the full year, at an initial yield of 6.7%. We started another 4 communities totaling about $400 million in Q4, bringing our full year levels start to roughly $1.2 billion or roughly in line with completions this year.
And lastly, we raised $400 million in new capital in the quarter, principally $200 million or $300 million unsecured debt offering. And for the year, we raised a total of $1.9 billion in capital to fund new investment and refinance maturing debt.
Turning now to Slide 5. The $1.3 billion of new development that we completed this year that I just referenced is contributing to healthy earnings and NAV accretion. Yields of 6.7% are roughly 250 basis points greater than our initial cost of external capital raised this year. And the cost basis of these completions at 310,000 per unit is more than 30% less than the value of our average stabilized asset on a per unit basis, with rents that are 12% to 13% higher, implying that value creation was around 50% over cost or roughly $650 million in net NAV created or $5 per share in 2015 alone.
Turning to Slide 6. In addition to strong financial results, we excelled another important aspect in our business in 2015, including customer satisfaction, lower rate, #1 nationally among all apartment operators for online reputation, associate engagement, we are ranked #1 on our sector and #2 among of all of DC metro based organizations on glassdoor. Corporate responsibility where our multiyear focus are on sustainability, that puts us towards the top of the sector in the U.S. and globally. And community recognition where a number of our newly developed communities procedures awards from various industry groups. We probably don't talk enough about this with investors, but we know that achievement and survey the needs of these important constituencies and our customers from our associates, the communities as well as the shareholders is critical to building the kind of culture and company that can be enduring and successful.
Shifting now to 2016, let's move to Slide 7. We are projecting a 9% core growth in core FFO per share this year, driven by about 2/3 internal operations from almost 6% thanks to NOI growth that was exactly at the midpoint. And about 1/3 from new investment activity once you net out the cost of new capital issuance, which is probably mostly from stabilizing new development.
The principal difference in growth between 2015 and '16 is that we expect less external growth from new investment activity, which, in turn, is being driven by the impact of fewer deliveries in 2015 that we will be stabilizing in '16 and some might even timing of capital raising activity. 
When looking at the earnings impact of our development platform, it's probably more helpful to view it over a multiyear period. For example, if you look at it over the 2015, '16 timeframe here, new investment activity net of changes in capital cost is projected to deliver approximately $0.70 per share to core FFO or around 10% cumulative growth over the 2-year period.
Moving to Slide 8. Given our outlook for 2016, we announced a dividend increase of 8% this year. The dividend is now up by more than 50% over the last 5 years and, importantly, has grown by 5.5% on a compounded basis over the last 20 years. Dividends are an important component of total return. They represent almost 2/3 of the total return of roughly 1,800% that we've earned over the last 20 years. And that kind of growth really does underscore the accretion and growth embedded in our business model. I think sometimes it just gets a little lost during the market volatility and rapid trading activity we're seeing in the sector today.
Turning to Slide 9. Our outlook is being driven in part by the prospect of stable economy continuing into 2016, and from our perspective, appears to have reached midcycle in terms of GDP and employment growth. An improvement consumer should benefit from stronger labor market in 2016. And then the public sector is expected to actually contribute to overall economic growth this year, although still at a lesser rate than the private sector after having been a drag for a number of years to overall economic growth.
Turning to Slide 10. Job growth in our markets is projected to outperform the U.S. again in 2016 as it did in '15 at just over 2%. The East Coast is expected to improve in '16, while the tech-heavy West Coast market should moderate off the blistering pace of the last couple of years, although still remain at healthy levels around 2.5%. 
On Slide 11, total personal income growth, which combines job and per capita income growth, is expected to accelerate in 2016 as wage growth gains traction, particularly for the younger millennial cohort, most of whom continues to rent. 
Wage growth, as we discussed in the past, become an ever increasing important driver of our business as economic cycle matures and more supply starts to come online in 2016. 
Speaking to that, moving to Slide 12 and supply. We do expect that completions in our markets will increase in 2016 by about 50 basis points to around 2% of stock or roughly in line with job growth, suggesting pretty stable conditions overall. Of course, some submarkets, particularly in urban cores, we'll see higher levels of deliveries that may impact local markets as owners use concessions to stimulate absorption during lease up. This is particularly true in urban and high-rise product where inventories can build quickly and deliveries tend to occur over more considerate concentrated beard of time. But overall, housing demand should continue to favor the apartment sector due to many things that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, including favorable demographics, pent up demand as millennials continue to unbundle and ultimately changing lifestyle trends with the late marriage and family formation. All these factors should help support another healthy year for apartment fundamentals in 2016.
And turning to Slide 13. That is reflected in our outlook for our same-store portfolio this year. We're looking for same-store revenue growth of 4.25% to 5.5%, with modest improvement on the East Coast. On the West Coast, we expect some moderation in Seattle, Northern California after exceptionally strong growth in 2015. 
Overall then, growth is expected to be healthy with performance between the East and West Coast narrowing a bit in 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it to Kevin, who will discuss development and capital activity."
329141,321713567,926868,"Avalonbay Communities Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, this shows construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoing development",891,"Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, this shows construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoing development activity as a percentage of our total enterprise value has been relatively stable for the past few years at around 10%, which is at the low end of our target range. This reflects our continued disciplined in allocating capital for this activity as we move further into the cycle.
Moving to Slide 15. Profit margins on our development activity has remained remarkably resilient and healthy in the cycle, thanks to the underlying strength of the apartment fundamentals, our sector-leading development and construction capabilities and the decisions we've made about which opportunities to pursue as the cycle matures. Since 2012, our development completions have increased from about $0.5 billion to more than $1 billion. During that time, development yields have been around 7%, while corresponding cap rates for those particular assets have been at or below 5%, resulting in stable profit margins on development in the low 30% range. 
As shown on Slide 16, communities currently in lease-up continue to provide healthy profit margins. For the 12 communities undergoing initial lease-up in 4Q '15, which represent $970 million in total capital cost, the current weighted average monthly rent per home is $115 above initial expectations. 
In terms of yield performance, the weighted average initial projected stabilized yield for these communities is currently 6.7%, or 30 basis points higher than our original projection of 6.4%.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to talk about how we manage risk associated with our development activity. The first way we do so is by maintaining a broadly diversified development pipeline, one that is diversified by geographic regions, by product type and by exposure to urban and suburban submarkets. 
As the chart on Slide 17 illustrates, while our development pipeline remains diversified across regions, future development lies a bias towards suburban markets and Midwest products, construction and land costs are more affordable, development economics are more favorable and the production cycle tends to be faster. Going forward, we expect our development pipeline will continue to be an important source of outside growth in NAV and FFO per share.
Moving to Slide 18. Another way we manage development risk is how we source and structure new development opportunities, with the overwhelming majority being controlled through long-term purchase contracts with modest at risk deposits and relatively few being controlled through land we purchased on hold in our balance sheet. At the end of 2015, our development rights pipeline consisted of 32 communities, representing $3.4 billion of projected total capital cost. Of these 32 communities, 25 are controlled to be purchase contracts while we own the remaining 7. 
In addition, of these 7 where we own the land, 2 account for approximately $420 million of the $485 million of land held for development on our balance sheet. We expect to begin construction on these 2 community Development Rights, Columbus Circle and Hollywood in 2016, which would reduce our projected land held for development by year-end 2016, the lowest level in more than a decade.
A third method which we use to manage development risk is substantially much fund the long-term capital, a topic we've talked about a lot in the cycle. On Slide 19, we highlight our funding position against the total projected capital cost the development underway. As you can see, we only need to source about $500 million of long-term capital against the $3.4 billion of development under construction recently completed, taking into account the $2.2 billion of capital already spent to date, $400 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $350 million of projected annual cash flow from operations after dividends. This means that about 85% of the value creation from ongoing development activity has already been locked in for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 20. We show how being substantially much funded significantly enhances our growth in EBITDA while simultaneously enhancing our already's sector leading credit profile, essentially making us similar to an acquisition REIT from a funding perspective but with lower leverage and stronger built in earnings growth. Specifically, the projected EBITDA for recently completed development and development construction totals about $216 million, as shown on the chart on the left. This represents about 18% growth in annualized core EBITDA from the fourth quarter. 
Even in a worse case, if all the $480 million of unfunded commitments are funded with new debt, our net debt to core EBITDA would still decline from 4.8x to the mid-4s after taking into account the EBITDA from new development. Of course, our actual net debt to core EBITDA will move around a bit as resourced the capital fund incremental development activity. And for the communicate the leverage going to decrease 4.5x [indiscernible] target leverage is 4.5x, affect our target range this metric communities to be roughly between 5 and 6x. Instead, the purpose in showing this slide is 2 much funding strategy, we are optimally positioned to benefit from development activity, that is expected to be accretive both earnings and balance sheet strength. And that our credit profile is actually enhanced by our profitable development capabilities given our funding strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim."

As we move further into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we are highly focused on managing the investment and funding risk of the business. And as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we're doing this through managing the size and diversity of our pipeline, reducing land inventory, match funding new commitments and maintaining leverage at the low end of our target range.

For those communities that have started, construction rent growth and we haven't yet started leasing, we haven't marketed those markets just to be clear. I think you'll probably see over the last few years, we've totally been beating the initial pro forma yields by 30 to 50 or 60 basis points just because of a strong market rent growth and the fact we're able to bring deals in more or less at cost. I think it really is, ultimately -- if you look at the development pipeline today, the shadow pipeline, the builds that haven't yet started, the economics of that look a lot like economics look like on the deals that we've been starting over the last couple of years. I think a lot of it is how you would underwrite those would depend upon how you'd underrated market ultimately in terms of where redoing business and how you might underrates construction costs relative to market rent growth change over the next couple of years."

So the technology markets are the ones you'd probably be most concerned about that's assuming of course that any reduction in job growth is somewhat proportional. In the past, we've had some losses in the energy sector. It has not had a direct effect on our markets, but there's certainly some indirect effects as it relates to reduced amount of capital investment on behalf of those companies kind of ripple through the economy.

And I guess the second thing to keep in mind is that we do keep a very strong balance sheet both from a match funding perspective, but also from another dimension, including having low leverage and the latter maturities, so that we have an awful lot of flexibility to deal with the sort of an air pocket that might exist where maybe disruption in capital markets before we've been able to sort and dial back on the starts.

We look at where we think the cap rates would be on those assets, specific sites today and where we think long-term exit cap rates might be. So we try -- we do factor that in. Going forward, I don't know, it's speculative. There has been occurring capital that's probably preferred to stay mostly in the urban type of trophy assets, that's one reason the cap rates are a little bit lower on those.

But more importantly, as we're getting pretty good job growth out of the Mid-Atlantic now [indiscernible] below 2% range and it's starting to have nice effect on occupancy and rent change across the markets here. So the expectation is that there's potential for some upside in the mid-Atlantic. I will not describe it as opportunistic in that there's significant upside. There still a fair mind amount of supply coming, and it's not a sort of high bidder market, as I described in the northern California and Pacific Northwest regions. So you tend to get a moderate recovery. And we are seeing that here in terms of recent trends where rent change is up about 100 basis points in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter '14, so there's nice momentum there. And then the other market that may have some upside I'd say is Boston. Boston has been performing well, job growth has been steady and supply is projected to decrease this year relative to 2015. So there's probably a little bit a potential upside in Boston and the Mid-Atlantic are the 2 that probably stand out the most, I'd say. Southern California has been increasing nicely, and we expect that to continue. But I wouldn't think it falls into the potential surprise category like the other 2 [indiscernible]"

So even though you have greater demand in those markets that identify with greater supply, there's a lid and growth next it as a result of it. So there's not a wide variation for the most part. New York and Jersey is going to be probably in the mid to high 3% range. There's not one market that's in the low 2s and another one in the 5s, give you some perspective if that helps. It's a pretty tight range."

As it relates to I'll call it sort of recent momentum, including the fourth quarter and spillover into early 2016, I say the laggard between across the metro area has been suburban Maryland. Job growth has been okay, but the supply has been heavy and steady throughout that region, particularly Rockville, North Bethesda, Chevy Chase has been supply. So it's been the softest. The strongest has been in and around D.C. So D.C. proper as well as the sort of corridor things like that, towns and submarkets of that are close in to D.C. and then I'd say the rest in Northern Virginia kind of falls into second place. So they call it the district and immediately adjacent submarkets, northern Virginia and suburban Maryland being the laggard kind of recent conditions. In terms of expected performance in '16, what we have is overall for the Mid-Atlantic, probably in the mid-1% range. And again, it's relatively tight, I'd say, we're talking about the suburban Maryland probably right at the midpoint there. We may see a little bit better performance at D.C. just given the nature of our specific assets in D.C., which is Gallery Place, Foxhall, stuff in the Northwest corridor that's older and rent-controlled. When you look at it from a market perspective, I would say the one thing to be cautious about is the greatest amount of supply to be delivered in 2016 is in the district. Because depending on the distribution of your portfolio within the district, really will dictate what your performance is going to be. So the way I think the market would probably look at it is D.C. people would probably expect to be a little bit softer given the nature of the deliveries. Infill suburban submarkets probably in Virginia performing better. And then Western Fairfax, I would say, and suburban Maryland probably being the laggard."

In terms of again recent performance rolling forward, sorry to keep it relatively brief without going on too long here, but where we started to see some supply impact is in Orange County. Orange County is softened a little bit of a fair amount of supply coming into Irvine, some in supply in Anaheim, there's been supply in Huntington Beach, little bit in Costa Mesa. So that's softened a little bit in our expectations for '16 for that market is for it to trail the other regions as well because of the same issues. San Diego and L.A., we expect a lead going into '16 and continue throughout the year. And for the most part, that's not only the nature of the markets but how our portfolio's positioned, which is for the most part it's B assets in suburban submarkets across San Diego, which is relatively small portfolio, but that's where the majority of our assets are located. And Los Angeles, same thing in terms of the distribution of the assets within those submarkets. We don't have any same-store assets in downtown L.A, as an example, which is getting supply now that's equal to double-digit percentages of existing inventory. So you're going to have softness in some of those submarkets like downtown L.A. where you're getting a heavy amount of new deliveries. So I'd say for '16, overall, you're probably going to see L.A., San Diego leading, and Orange County lagging, just given the nature of our portfolio, but also just from the market perspective in terms of where the supply is concentrated."

You're right, we haven't done a lot of acquisitions historically in this cycle. So at this point what we are doing is we're trying to -- we are always looking for opportunities to improve our portfolio where we can, and that happened to be a very unique opportunity there in Hoboken. We weren't per se adding New Jersey on a net basis, but we're always looking to improve our submarket exposure. It's a highly supply-protected submarkets, it's one of the few parts of New Jersey we have not been able to penetrate through new development. The cap rate is about 5, which is pretty attractive for an asset that's only 7 years old. The average unit size there is about 1,000 square feet, so it's actually more targeted at families and they're necessarily at young singles and that's what in that part of Hoboken, it's kind of interesting to see how it's evolving in that way as Hoboken kind of matures as a desirable location, not just for people trying to write out of school but for people, married couples, a little bit older as well, there's a supermarket right next door. With luscious a unique opportunity and we feel like we are able to based on some characteristics of the way the as it is marketed get it at a price that was more compelling than most of the acquisition opportunities we're seeing."

Just a couple of things, probably taxes will do a deep discussion on, to be sure, we probably can. Just really 2 issues. One is the special dividend obligation associated with the fact that we are a taxpaying entity both for the fact that we have a dividend paid deduction. But there's also excise tax considerations as well, so I think from our standpoint, when we look at using asset sales to fund development, we have a fair bit of running room in terms of being able to sell assets before we have to worry about a special dividend obligation. We would probably more likely in a kind of situation where we have to pay an excise tax, which is sort of a little bit of a 4% tax payment on excess income over distributions. And so it become sort of a kind of almost like a transaction cost if you will that gets added to selling assets to fund development. So we certainly have a reasonable amount of ability to continue to sell assets to fund development, but when you run in to first is probably having to pay an excise tax, which is just an extra transaction cost, if you will, which we'd rather not incur if we can avoid it, but it's something that's probably more road development."

We do have a fair bit of a about $1.1 billion of tax-exempt debt that's secured and has probably on average about 21 years left to run. So that's something we have done in the past, and we like that form of capital, though it's far less available today. In terms of 30 or unsecured debt, since we don't have to have, since we don't currently have it, you have to ask yourself what's the substitution for. I think probably it's been a little bit more of a compelling equity substitute for those who want more leverage than a compelling substitute for 10 year debt when you do the breakevens. For us, we might be willing to entertain doing it. I guess probably one guiding principle would be, if we were to look at the total amount of debt we're going to issue in one year, there's only so much we want to issue in the form of 10-year unsecured debt before in the future period we have a more debt coming due than we would prefer, which as we've talked about before, we try to target having leveled maturities that are on balance less than or equal to projected amount of dividend. And so we felt going to be issuing a certain amount of debt in the unsecured markets in a given year, that might be more than we want to have come due in 10 years. We might think about doing the excess in the form of a 30-year note offering."

And so I think you probably have to go market by market to figure out where that's most pronounced. So there's certainly been pushback in northern California that's above historical averages.

When someone gets to a third 8%, 9%, 10% rent increase, wages have been growing but then they're not growing quickly, there's some pushback.

In general, was in that market, when things often, the most expensive price point product tends to suffer first. So if you have the most expensive high-rise in the city, you're going to see some reaction to that. If you just a macro comment, sort of depends on one end of the curve and what supplies being delivered. As we go into '16, there's more supply concentrated in San Jose than there is in East Bay or San Francisco, as an example. That's across San Jose, concentrated in Northeast San Jose. If you up in the Mountain View, certain submarkets, there's  about 3, 4 submarkets there. Southern San Francisco, fair amount of supply being delivered into soma if exposed to soma, you're probably going to hurt just as much. So it really depends on when in the cycle it occurs and what supply's being delivered at that point in time. But generally speaking, the higher price point assets tend to suffer first and which tend to see people will migrate if things become more affordable, they'll be able to migrate back towards the end of the safest city and the cycle then repeats itself. So hopefully, I'll provide some broad perspective about what happened to the market."

But generally speaking, right now, within the market footprint, our eaves communities are pretty synonymous with the communities as you referred to Axiometrics or transfer any of those. And eaves communities tend to be outperforming right now. To give you some perspective in the fourth quarter for our portfolio, the B assets or the eaves assets, which is for the most part B assets, were about 70 basis points ahead of how the a assets were performing. As you go look at Axiometrics, it's a pretty similar pattern there in terms of the outperformance. So this part of the cycle, well-positioned, value-oriented communities are outperforming. To the extent we are selling one of those communities, it typically is related to either submarket specific or asset specific. The issues we have or concerns about concentration in terms of other activity we might have in the region, that typically drives those disposition decisions as it relates to pretty much any community, but eaves as well."

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterward. Durin",1334,"Yes, thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q4 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterward. 
During our comments, we'll focus on providing a summary of Q4 and the full year results and then spend a good part of time talking about the outlook for 2016. I'll talk about the economy, apartment markets and operations and turn it over to Kevin, who will talk about development as well as capital and risk management as we move further into the cycle.
So let's start on Slide 4. Highlights for the quarter and year include core FFO growth in Q4 of 14.4% and 11.4% for the full year, which is about 300 basis points higher than our original outlook at the beginning of the year. And importantly, we continue to generate FFO growth this cycle toward the top of the sector, while having the lowest leverage. 
Q4 same-store revenue growth came in at 5.4% or 5.7% when you include redevelopment, as many of our peers do. And for the full year, same-store revenue growth came in at 5.0% or 5.2%, including redevelopment. Same-store NOI for the year came in at 5.8%. 
We completed about $500 million this quarter at right around a 7% yield and $1.3 billion for the full year, at an initial yield of 6.7%. We started another 4 communities totaling about $400 million in Q4, bringing our full year level starts to roughly $1.2 billion or roughly in line with completions this year.
And lastly, we raised $400 million in new capital in the quarter, principally through a $300 million unsecured debt offering. And for the year, we raised a total of $1.9 billion in capital to fund new investment and refinance maturing debt.
Turning now to Slide 5. The $1.3 billion of new development that we completed this year that I just referenced is contributing to healthy earnings and NAV accretion. Yields of 6.7% are roughly 250 basis points greater than our initial cost of external capital raised this year. And the cost basis of these completions at $310,000 per unit is more than 30% less than the value of our average stabilized asset on a per unit basis, with rents that are 12% to 13% higher, implying that value creation was around 50% over cost or roughly $650 million in net NAV created or $5 per share in 2015 alone.
Turning to Slide 6. In addition to strong financial results, we excelled another important aspects of our business in 2015, including customer satisfaction where we rank #1 nationally among all apartment operators for online reputation. Associate engagement, we are ranked #1 in our sector and #2 among all D.C. metro-based organizations on glassdoor. Corporate responsibility where our multiyear focus are on sustainability, that puts us towards the top of the sector in the U.S. and globally. And community recognition where a number of our newly developed communities are [indiscernible] awards from various industry groups. We probably don't talk enough about this with investors, but we know that achievement and survey, the needs of these important constituencies and our customers, our associates, the communities as well as the shareholders is critical to building the kind of culture and company that can be enduring and successful.
Shifting now to 2016, let's move to Slide 7. We're projecting a 9% core growth in core FFO per share this year, driven by about 2/3 internal operations from the almost 6%, thanks to NOI growth that was exactly at the midpoint. And about 1/3 from new investment activity once you net out the cost of new capital issuance, which is probably mostly from stabilizing new development.
The principal difference in growth between 2015 and '16 is that we expect less external growth from new investment activity, which in turn is being driven by the impact of fewer deliveries in 2015 that we will be stabilizing in '16 and some might even as in the timing of capital raising activity. 
When looking at the earnings impact of our development platform, it's probably more helpful to view it over a multiyear period. For example, if you look at it over the 2015, '16 timeframe here, new investment activity net of changes in capital cost is projected to deliver approximately $0.70 per share to core FFO or around 10% cumulative growth over the 2-year period.
Moving to Slide 8. Given our outlook for 2016, we announced a dividend increase of 8% this year. The dividend is now up by more than 50% over the last 5 years and importantly has grown by 5.5% on a compounded basis over the last 20 years. Dividends are an important component of total return. They represent almost 2/3 of the total return of roughly 1,800% that we've earned over the last 20 years. And that kind of growth really does underscore the accretion and growth embedded in our business model. I think sometimes it gets a little lost during the market volatility and rapid trading activity we're seeing in the sector today.
Turning to Slide 9. Our outlook is being driven in part by the prospect of stable economy continuing into 2016. And from our perspective, appears to have reached midcycle in terms of GDP and employment growth. An improving consumer should benefit from strong, stronger labor market in 2016. And then the public sector is expected to actually contribute to overall economic growth this year, although still at a lesser rate than the private sector after having been a drag for a number of years to overall economic growth.
Turning to Slide 10. Job growth in our markets is projected to outperform the U.S. again in 2016 as it did in '15 at just over 2%. The East Coast is expected to improve in '16, while the tech-heavy West Coast market should moderate off the blistering pace of the last couple of years, although it still remain at healthy levels around 2.5%. 
On Slide 11, total personal income growth, which combines job and per capita income growth is expected to accelerate in 2016 as wage growth gains traction, particularly for the younger millennial cohort most of whom continues to rent. 
Wage growth, as we discussed in the past, become an ever increasing important driver of our business as economic cycle matures and more supply starts to come online in 2016. 
Speaking that, moving to Slide 12 and supply. We do expect that completions in our markets will increase in 2016 by about 50 basis points to around 2% of stock or roughly in line with job growth suggesting pretty stable conditions overall. Of course, some submarkets, particularly in urban cores, we'll see higher levels of deliveries that may impact local markets as owners use concessions to stimulate absorption during lease up. This is particularly true in urban and high-rise product where inventories can build quickly and deliveries tend to occur over a more concentrated period of time. But overall, housing demand should continue to favor the apartment sector due to many of the things that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, including favorable demographics, pent-up demand as Millennials continue to unbundle and ultimately changing lifestyle trends with the late marriage and family formation. All these factors should help support another healthy year for apartment fundamentals in 2016.
And turning to Slide 13. That is reflected in our outlook for our same-store portfolio this year, where we're looking for same-store revenue growth of 4.25% to 5.5%, with modest improvement on the East Coast. While on the West Coast, we expect some moderation in Seattle and Northern California after exceptionally strong growth in 2015. 
Overall then, growth is expected to be healthy with performance between the East and West Coast narrowing a bit in 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it to Kevin, who will discuss development and capital activity."
329141,321713567,927296,"Avalonbay Communities Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show [indiscernible] under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, o",915,"Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show [indiscernible] under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoing development activity as a percentage of our total enterprise value has been relatively stable over the past few years at around 10%, which is at the low end of our target range. This reflects our continued discipline in allocating capital for this activity as we move further into the cycle.
Moving to Slide 15. Profit margins on our development activity have remained remarkably resilient and healthy in this cycle. Thanks to the underlying strength of apartment fundamentals, our sector-leading development and construction capabilities and the decisions we've made about which opportunities to pursue as the cycle matures. Since 2012, our development completions have increased from about $0.5 billion to more than $1 billion. During that time, development yields have been around 7%, while corresponding cap rates for those particular assets have been at or below 5%, resulting in stable profit margins on development in the low 30% range. 
As shown on Slide 16, communities currently in lease-up continue to provide healthy profit margins. For the 12 communities undergoing initial lease-up in 4Q '15, which represent $970 million in total capital cost, the current weighted average monthly rent per home is $115 above initial expectations. 
In terms of yield performance, the weighted average initial projected stabilized yield for these communities is currently 6.7%, or 30 basis points higher than our original projection of 6.4%.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to talk about how we manage risk associated with our development activity. The first way we do so is by maintaining a broadly diversified development pipeline, one that is diversified by geographic regions, by product type and by exposure to urban and suburban submarkets. 
As the chart on Slide 17 illustrate, while our development pipeline remains diversified across regions, future development lies a bias towards infill suburban markets and Midwest products, where rents, construction and land costs are more affordable, development economics are more favorable and the production cycle tend to be faster. Going forward, we expect our development rights pipeline will continue to be an important source of outsized growth in NAV and FFO per share.
Moving to Slide 18. Another way we manage development risk is how we source and structure new development opportunities, with the overwhelming majority being controlled through long-term purchase contracts with modest at-risk deposits and relatively few being controlled through land we purchased and hold on our balance sheet. At the end of 2015, our development rights pipeline consisted of 32 communities, representing $3.4 billion in projected total capital cost. Of these 32 communities, 25 are controlled through purchase contracts while we own the land in the remaining 7. 
In addition, of these 7 where we own the land, 2 account for approximately $420 million of the $485 million in land held for development on our balance sheet. We expect to begin construction on these 2 community Development Rights, Columbus Circle and Hollywood in 2016, which would reduce our projected land held for development by year-end 2016, the lowest level in more than a decade.
A third method which we use to manage development risk is substantially match funding new starts with long-term capital, a topic we've talked about a lot in the cycle. 
On Slide 19, we highlight our funding position against the total projected capital cost of development underway. As you can see, we only need to source about $500 million in long-term capital against the $3.4 billion in development under construction or recently completed, taking into account the $2.2 billion of capital already spent to date, $400 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $350 million of projected annual cash flow from operations after dividends. This means that about 85% of the value creation from ongoing development activity has already been locked in for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 20. We show how being substantially match-funded significantly enhances our growth in EBITDA, while simultaneously enhancing our already sector-leading credit profile, essentially making us similar to an acquisition-oriented REIT from a funding-risk perspective, but with lower leverage and stronger built in earnings growth. Specifically, the projected EBITDA for recently completed development and from development under construction totals about $216 million, as shown on the chart on the left. This represents about 18% growth in annualized core EBITDA from the fourth quarter. 
Even in a worse case, if all the $480 million of unfunded commitments were funded with new debt, our net debt to core EBITDA would still decline from 4.8x to the mid-4s after taking into account the EBITDA from new development. Of course, our actual net debt to core EBITDA will move around a bit as we source new capital to fund incremental development activity. Therefore this slide isn't meant to communicate that our leverage is going to decrease 4.5x or our target leverage is 4.5x. 
In fact, our target range for this metric is to be roughly between 5x and 6x. Instead, the purpose in showing this slide is to convey that through our match funding strategy, we are optimally positioned to benefit from development activity, that is expected to be accretive both to earnings and balance sheet strength, and that our credit profile is actually enhanced by our profitable development capabilities given our funding strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim."

As we move further into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we are highly focused on managing the investment and funding risk of the business.

In terms of the attachment that shows the development pipeline with the projected yield of 6 3, that is based upon current rents and rents marked to market once we start leasing and you get up to about 20%,  25% occupancy. For those communities that have started construction where they may have been market rent growth and we haven't yet started leasing, we haven't marketed those to markets just to be clear. And I think you'd probably see over the last few years, we've totally been beating the initial pro forma yields by 30 to 50 or 60 basis points just because of a strong market rent growth and the fact that we've been able to bring deals in more or less at present cost. So I think it really is, ultimately -- and if you look at the development pipeline today, the shadow pipeline, the deals that haven't yet started, the economics of that look a lot like what the economics look like on the deals that we've been starting over the last couple of years. So I think a lot of it is going to -- how you would underwrite those would depend upon how you'd underwrite the market ultimately in terms of where we're doing business and how you might underwrite construction cost relative to market rent growth change over the next couple of years."

So the technology markets are the ones you'd probably be most concerned about that's assuming of course that any reduction in job growth is somewhat proportional. In the past, we've had some losses in the energy sector. It has not had a direct effect on our markets, but there's certainly some indirect effects as it relates to reduced amount of capital investment on behalf of those companies is going to ripple through the economy.

So I think fundamentally, we have great deal of flexibility and the commitments we create and the capital we're going to be able to source from the deal with volatility in the capital markets and that's how we manage the balance sheet."

I guess what I'd say is, at this point, you properly identified Northern California as one of the markets where there is probably a little bit of concern about slowing, its come up a couple of different times. But in terms of markets that has some upside, certainly the Mid-Atlantic is one that has some potential upside in terms of -- we're at a point in the cycle where we know that supply is, it was about 2% last year, it's going to increase to about 2.5% this year. But more importantly, as we're getting pretty good job growth out of the Mid-Atlantic now up in the low 2% range. And it's starting to have nice effect on occupancy and rent change across the markets here. So the expectation is that there's potential for some upside in the Mid-Atlantic. I would not describe it as opportunistic and that there's significant upside. There is still a fair amount of supply coming. And it's not a sort of high bidder market, as I described in the Northern California and Pacific Northwest regions. So you tend to get a moderate recovery. And we are seeing that here in terms of recent trends where rent change is up about 100 basis points in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of '14, so there's nice momentum there. And then the other market that may have some upside I'd say is Boston. Boston has been performing well, job growth has been steady and supply is projected to increase this year relative to 2015. So there's probably a little bit of potential upside in Boston and the Mid-Atlantic are the 2 that probably stand out the most, I'd say. Southern California has been increasing nicely and we expect that to continue. But I wouldn't think it falls into the potential surprise category like the other 2 did."

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterward.

Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterward. 
During our comments, we'll focus on providing a summary of Q4 and the full year results and then spend a good part of time talking about the outlook for 2016. I'll talk about the economy, apartment markets and operations and turn it over to Kevin, who will talk about development as well as capital and risk management as we move further into the cycle.
So let's start on Slide 4. Highlights for the quarter and year include core FFO growth in Q4 of 14.4% and 11.4% for the full year, which is about 300 basis points higher than our original outlook at the beginning of the year. And importantly, we continue to generate FFO growth this cycle toward the top of the sector, while having the lowest leverage. 
Q4 same-store revenue growth came in at 5.4% or 5.7% when you include redevelopment, as many of our peers do. And for the full year, same-store revenue growth came in at 5.0% or 5.2%, including redevelopment. Same-store NOI for the year came in at 5.8%. 
We completed about $500 million this quarter at right around a 7% yield and $1.3 billion for the full year, at an initial yield of 6.7%. We started another 4 communities totaling about $400 million in Q4, bringing our full year level starts to roughly $1.2 billion or roughly in line with completions this year.
And lastly, we raised $400 million in new capital in the quarter, principally through a $300 million unsecured debt offering. And for the year, we raised a total of $1.9 billion in capital to fund new investment and refinance maturing debt.
Turning now to Slide 5. The $1.3 billion of new development that we completed this year that I just referenced is contributing to healthy earnings and NAV accretion. Yields of 6.7% are roughly 250 basis points greater than our initial cost of external capital raised this year. And the cost basis of these completions at $310,000 per unit is more than 30% less than the value of our average stabilized asset on a per unit basis, with rents that are 12% to 13% higher, implying that value creation was around 50% over cost or roughly $650 million in net NAV created or $5 per share in 2015 alone.
Turning to Slide 6. In addition to strong financial results, we excelled another important aspects of our business in 2015, including customer satisfaction where we rank #1 nationally among all apartment operators for online reputation. Associate engagement, we are ranked #1 in our sector and #2 among all D.C. metro-based organizations on glassdoor. Corporate responsibility where our multiyear focus are on sustainability, that puts us towards the top of the sector in the U.S. and globally. And community recognition where a number of our newly developed communities are [indiscernible] awards from various industry groups. We probably don't talk enough about this with investors, but we know that achievement and survey, the needs of these important constituencies and our customers, our associates, the communities as well as the shareholders is critical to building the kind of culture and company that can be enduring and successful.
Shifting now to 2016, let's move to Slide 7. We're projecting a 9% core growth in core FFO per share this year, driven by about 2/3 internal operations from the almost 6%, thanks to NOI growth that was exactly at the midpoint. And about 1/3 from new investment activity once you net out the cost of new capital issuance, which is probably mostly from stabilizing new development.
The principal difference in growth between 2015 and '16 is that we expect less external growth from new investment activity, which in turn is being driven by the impact of fewer deliveries in 2015 that we will be stabilizing in '16 and some might even as in the timing of capital raising activity. 
When looking at the earnings impact of our development platform, it's probably more helpful to view it over a multiyear period. For example, if you look at it over the 2015, '16 timeframe here, new investment activity net of changes in capital cost is projected to deliver approximately $0.70 per share to core FFO or around 10% cumulative growth over the 2-year period.
Moving to Slide 8. Given our outlook for 2016, we announced a dividend increase of 8% this year. The dividend is now up by more than 50% over the last 5 years and importantly has grown by 5.5% on a compounded basis over the last 20 years. Dividends are an important component of total return. They represent almost 2/3 of the total return of roughly 1,800% that we've earned over the last 20 years. And that kind of growth really does underscore the accretion and growth embedded in our business model. I think sometimes it gets a little lost during the market volatility and rapid trading activity we're seeing in the sector today.
Turning to Slide 9. Our outlook is being driven in part by the prospect of stable economy continuing into 2016. And from our perspective, appears to have reached midcycle in terms of GDP and employment growth. An improving consumer should benefit from strong, stronger labor market in 2016. And then the public sector is expected to actually contribute to overall economic growth this year, although still at a lesser rate than the private sector after having been a drag for a number of years to overall economic growth.
Turning to Slide 10. Job growth in our markets is projected to outperform the U.S. again in 2016 as it did in '15 at just over 2%. The East Coast is expected to improve in '16, while the tech-heavy West Coast market should moderate off the blistering pace of the last couple of years, although it still remain at healthy levels around 2.5%. 
On Slide 11, total personal income growth, which combines job and per capita income growth is expected to accelerate in 2016 as wage growth gains traction, particularly for the younger millennial cohort most of whom continues to rent. 
Wage growth, as we discussed in the past, become an ever increasing important driver of our business as economic cycle matures and more supply starts to come online in 2016. 
Speaking that, moving to Slide 12 and supply. We do expect that completions in our markets will increase in 2016 by about 50 basis points to around 2% of stock or roughly in line with job growth suggesting pretty stable conditions overall. Of course, some submarkets, particularly in urban cores, we'll see higher levels of deliveries that may impact local markets as owners use concessions to stimulate absorption during lease up. This is particularly true in urban and high-rise product where inventories can build quickly and deliveries tend to occur over a more concentrated period of time. But overall, housing demand should continue to favor the apartment sector due to many of the things that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, including favorable demographics, pent-up demand as Millennials continue to unbundle and ultimately changing lifestyle trends with the late marriage and family formation. All these factors should help support another healthy year for apartment fundamentals in 2016.
And turning to Slide 13. That is reflected in our outlook for our same-store portfolio this year, where we're looking for same-store revenue growth of 4.25% to 5.5%, with modest improvement on the East Coast. While on the West Coast, we expect some moderation in Seattle and Northern California after exceptionally strong growth in 2015. 
Overall then, growth is expected to be healthy with performance between the East and West Coast narrowing a bit in 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it to Kevin, who will discuss development and capital activity."
329141,321713567,927343,"Avalonbay Communities Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show [indiscernible] under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, o",915,"Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show [indiscernible] under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoing development activity as a percentage of our total enterprise value has been relatively stable over the past few years at around 10%, which is at the low end of our target range. This reflects our continued discipline in allocating capital for this activity as we move further into the cycle.
Moving to Slide 15. Profit margins on our development activity have remained remarkably resilient and healthy in this cycle. Thanks to the underlying strength of apartment fundamentals, our sector-leading development and construction capabilities and the decisions we've made about which opportunities to pursue as the cycle matures. Since 2012, our development completions have increased from about $0.5 billion to more than $1 billion. During that time, development yields have been around 7%, while corresponding cap rates for those particular assets have been at or below 5%, resulting in stable profit margins on development in the low 30% range. 
As shown on Slide 16, communities currently in lease-up continue to provide healthy profit margins. For the 12 communities undergoing initial lease-up in 4Q '15, which represent $970 million in total capital cost, the current weighted average monthly rent per home is $115 above initial expectations. 
In terms of yield performance, the weighted average initial projected stabilized yield for these communities is currently 6.7%, or 30 basis points higher than our original projection of 6.4%.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to talk about how we manage risk associated with our development activity. The first way we do so is by maintaining a broadly diversified development pipeline, one that is diversified by geographic regions, by product type and by exposure to urban and suburban submarkets. 
As the chart on Slide 17 illustrate, while our development pipeline remains diversified across regions, future development lies a bias towards infill suburban markets and Midwest products, where rents, construction and land costs are more affordable, development economics are more favorable and the production cycle tend to be faster. Going forward, we expect our development rights pipeline will continue to be an important source of outsized growth in NAV and FFO per share.
Moving to Slide 18. Another way we manage development risk is how we source and structure new development opportunities, with the overwhelming majority being controlled through long-term purchase contracts with modest at-risk deposits and relatively few being controlled through land we purchased and hold on our balance sheet. At the end of 2015, our development rights pipeline consisted of 32 communities, representing $3.4 billion in projected total capital cost. Of these 32 communities, 25 are controlled through purchase contracts while we own the land in the remaining 7. 
In addition, of these 7 where we own the land, 2 account for approximately $420 million of the $485 million in land held for development on our balance sheet. We expect to begin construction on these 2 community Development Rights, Columbus Circle and Hollywood in 2016, which would reduce our projected land held for development by year-end 2016, the lowest level in more than a decade.
A third method which we use to manage development risk is substantially match funding new starts with long-term capital, a topic we've talked about a lot in the cycle. 
On Slide 19, we highlight our funding position against the total projected capital cost of development underway. As you can see, we only need to source about $500 million in long-term capital against the $3.4 billion in development under construction or recently completed, taking into account the $2.2 billion of capital already spent to date, $400 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $350 million of projected annual cash flow from operations after dividends. This means that about 85% of the value creation from ongoing development activity has already been locked in for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 20. We show how being substantially match-funded significantly enhances our growth in EBITDA, while simultaneously enhancing our already sector-leading credit profile, essentially making us similar to an acquisition-oriented REIT from a funding-risk perspective, but with lower leverage and stronger built in earnings growth. Specifically, the projected EBITDA for recently completed development and from development under construction totals about $216 million, as shown on the chart on the left. This represents about 18% growth in annualized core EBITDA from the fourth quarter. 
Even in a worse case, if all the $480 million of unfunded commitments were funded with new debt, our net debt to core EBITDA would still decline from 4.8x to the mid-4s after taking into account the EBITDA from new development. Of course, our actual net debt to core EBITDA will move around a bit as we source new capital to fund incremental development activity. Therefore this slide isn't meant to communicate that our leverage is going to decrease 4.5x or our target leverage is 4.5x. 
In fact, our target range for this metric is to be roughly between 5x and 6x. Instead, the purpose in showing this slide is to convey that through our match funding strategy, we are optimally positioned to benefit from development activity, that is expected to be accretive both to earnings and balance sheet strength, and that our credit profile is actually enhanced by our profitable development capabilities given our funding strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim."

I think this outlook is not surprising just given our view that we're midcycle with healthy apartment fundamentals continuing and then just a stable level of deliveries and healthy accretion coming from our developing pipeline. 
As we move further into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we are highly focused on managing the investment and funding risk of the business. And as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we're doing this through managing the size and diversity of our pipeline, reducing land inventory, match funding new commitments and maintaining leverage at the low end of our target range.

In terms of the attachment that shows the development pipeline with the projected yield of 6 3, that is based upon current rents and rents marked to market once we start leasing and you get up to about 20%,  25% occupancy. For those communities that have started construction where they may have been market rent growth and we haven't yet started leasing, we haven't marketed those to markets just to be clear. And I think you'd probably see over the last few years, we've totally been beating the initial pro forma yields by 30 to 50 or 60 basis points just because of a strong market rent growth and the fact that we've been able to bring deals in more or less at present cost. So I think it really is, ultimately -- and if you look at the development pipeline today, the shadow pipeline, the deals that haven't yet started, the economics of that look a lot like what the economics look like on the deals that we've been starting over the last couple of years. So I think a lot of it is going to -- how you would underwrite those would depend upon how you'd underwrite the market ultimately in terms of where we're doing business and how you might underwrite construction cost relative to market rent growth change over the next couple of years."

So the technology markets are the ones you'd probably be most concerned about that's assuming of course that any reduction in job growth is somewhat proportional. In the past, we've had some losses in the energy sector. It has not had a direct effect on our markets, but there's certainly some indirect effects as it relates to reduced amount of capital investment on behalf of those companies is going to ripple through the economy.

And I guess the second thing to keep in mind is that we do keep a very strong balance sheet both from a match funding perspective, but also from another dimension, including having low leverage and latter maturities, so that we have an awful lot of flexibility to deal with sort of an air pocket that might exist where there maybe disruption in capital markets before we've been able to sort of just and dial back on new starts. So I think fundamentally, we have great deal of flexibility and the commitments we create and the capital we're going to be able to source from the deal with volatility in the capital markets and that's how we manage the balance sheet."

I guess what I'd say is, at this point, you properly identified Northern California as one of the markets where there is probably a little bit of concern about slowing, its come up a couple of different times. But in terms of markets that has some upside, certainly the Mid-Atlantic is one that has some potential upside in terms of -- we're at a point in the cycle where we know that supply is, it was about 2% last year, it's going to increase to about 2.5% this year. But more importantly, as we're getting pretty good job growth out of the Mid-Atlantic now up in the low 2% range. And it's starting to have nice effect on occupancy and rent change across the markets here. So the expectation is that there's potential for some upside in the Mid-Atlantic. I would not describe it as opportunistic and that there's significant upside. There is still a fair amount of supply coming. And it's not a sort of high bidder market, as I described in the Northern California and Pacific Northwest regions. So you tend to get a moderate recovery. And we are seeing that here in terms of recent trends where rent change is up about 100 basis points in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of '14, so there's nice momentum there. And then the other market that may have some upside I'd say is Boston. Boston has been performing well, job growth has been steady and supply is projected to increase this year relative to 2015. So there's probably a little bit of potential upside in Boston and the Mid-Atlantic are the 2 that probably stand out the most, I'd say. Southern California has been increasing nicely and we expect that to continue. But I wouldn't think it falls into the potential surprise category like the other 2 did."

As it relates to the, I'll call it sort of recent momentum, including the fourth quarter and spillover into early 2016, I'd say the laggard across the metro area has been suburban Maryland. Job growth has been okay, but the supply has been heavy and steady throughout that region, particularly Rockville, North Bethesda, Chevy Chase has been in [indiscernible] supply. So it's been the softest. The strongest has been in and around D.C. So D.C. proper as well as the close in sort of R.B. corridor and things like that, towns and submarkets that are close in to D.C. and then I'd say the rest in Northern Virginia kind of falls into the second place. So I think they call it the district and immediately adjacent submarkets, Northern Virginia and then suburban Maryland being the laggard just kind of recent conditions. In terms of expected performance in '16, what we have is overall for the Mid-Atlantic, probably in the mid-1% range. And again, it's relatively tight, I'd say. We're talking about the suburban Maryland probably right at the midpoint there. We may see a little bit better performance at D.C., just given the nature of our specific assets in D.C., which is the Gallery Place, Foxhall, stuff in the Northwest corridor that's older and rent-controlled. When you look at it from a market perspective, I would say the one thing to be cautious about is the greatest amount of supply to be delivered in 2016 is in the district. Because depending on the distribution of your portfolio within the district, really it'll dictate what your performance is going to be. So the way I think the market would probably look at it is D.C. people would probably expect to be a little bit softer given the nature of the deliveries. Infill suburban submarkets probably in Virginia performing better. And then Western Fairfax, I would say, and suburban Maryland probably being the laggard."

In terms of again recent performance rolling forward -- I'm going to try to keep this relatively brief without going on too long here, but where we've started to see some supply impact is in Orange County. Orange County has softened up a little bit with a fair amount of supply coming into Irvine, some in Laguna Hills, supply in Anaheim, there's been supply in Huntington Beach, little bit in Costa Mesa. So that's softened a little bit, and our expectation for '16 for that market is for it to trial the other regions as well because of the same issues. San Diego and L.A., we expect a lead going into '16 and continue throughout the year. And for the most part, that's not only the nature of the markets, but how our portfolio is positioned, which is for the most part it's B assets in suburban submarkets across San Diego, which is relatively small portfolio, but that's where the majority of our assets are located. And in Los Angeles, same thing in terms of distribution of the assets within those submarkets. We don't have any same-store assets in downtown L.A, as an example, which is getting supply now that's equal to double-digit percentages of existing inventory. So you're going to have softness in some of those submarkets, like downtown L.A., where you're getting a heavy amount of new deliveries. So I'd say for '16, overall, you're probably going to see L.A., San Diego leading, and Orange County lagging, just given the nature of our portfolio, but also just from the market perspective in terms of where the supply is concentrated."

We haven't done a lot of acquisitions historically in this cycle. So at this point, what we are doing is we're trying to -- we are always looking for opportunities to improve our portfolio where we can, and that happened to be a very unique opportunity there in Hoboken. We weren't, per se, looking to adding New Jersey on a net basis, but we're always looking to improve our submarket exposure. It's a highly supply-protected submarkets. It's one of the few parts of New Jersey we have not been able to penetrate through new development. It's a -- the cap rate is about 5, which is pretty attractive for an asset that's only 7 years old. The average unit size there is about 1,000 square feet. So it's actually more targeted at families and -- than necessarily at young singles, and that's what -- in that part of Hoboken, it's kind of interesting to see how it's evolving in that way as Hoboken kind of matures as a desirable location, not just for people kind of right out of school, but for people, married couples, be a little bit older as well. There's a supermarket right next door. So it was just a unique opportunity, and we feel like we are able to, based on some unique characteristics of the way the asset was marketed, get it at a price that was more compelling than most of the acquisition opportunities we're seeing."

Just a couple of things, and probably tax is not an area people are overly eager to get into a deep discussion on, to be sure; we probably can. Just really 2 issues: One is just the special dividend obligation associated with the fact that we are a taxpaying entity, both for the fact that we have a dividend paid deduction. But there's also excise tax considerations as well, so I think from our standpoint, when we look at using asset sales to fund development, we have a fair bit of running room in terms of being able to sell assets before we have to worry about a special dividend obligation. We would probably more likely in a kind of situation where we wanted to pay an excise tax, which is sort of a little bit of a 4% tax payment on excess income over distributions. And so it becomes sort of a -- kind of almost like a transaction cost if you will that gets added to selling assets to fund development. So we certainly have a reasonable amount of ability to continue to sell assets to fund development, but what we went into first is probably having to pay an excise tax, which is just an extra transaction cost, if you will, which we'd rather not incur if we can avoid it, but it's something that's probably more relevant."

We do have a fair bit of about $1.1 billion of tax-exempt debt that's secured and has probably on an average about 21 years left to run. So that's something we had done in the past, and we like that form of capital, though it's far less available today. In terms of 30-year unsecured debt, since we don't have to have, we simply don't currently have it. You have to ask yourself what's it in substitution for? I think probably it's been a little bit more of a compelling equity substitute for those who want more leverage than a compelling substitute for 10-year debt when you do the breakevens. For us, we might be willing to entertain doing it. I guess, probably one guiding principle would be -- if we were to look at the total amount of debt we're going to issue in one year, there's only so much we'd want to issue in the form of 10-year unsecured debt before in a future period we'd have a more debt coming due, then we would prefer, which as we've talked about before, we tried to target having leveled maturities that are on balance less than or equal to our projected amount of dividend. And so if we felt we're going to be issuing a certain amount of debt in the unsecured markets in a given year, that might be more than we want to have coming due in 10 years. We might think about doing the excess in the form of a 30-year note offering."

Move out to rent increase doesn't really move that much on average, and it has the certain markets. And so I think you probably have to go market by market to figure out where that's most pronounced. So there's certainly been pushback in Northern California that's above historical averages. But that's a market where we are seeing pretty significant rent growth in the last 3 years. So you sort of expect that. When someone gets a third 8%, 9%, 10% rent increase, wages have been growing, but then they're not growing that quickly. There's some pushback. But I'd say, as part of the normal process, there's not a significant shift to one direction or another that we're seeing across the portfolio."

Those 2 deals were underwritten in kind of the high-5s based on the rents that were in place when we started those deals. We had not marked either one to market yet.

I mean, in general, across that market, when things often, the most expensive price point product tends to suffer first. So if you have the most expensive high-rise in the city, you're going to see some reaction to that. If you -- that's just a macro comment. It sort of depends on when it occurs and what supply is being delivered. As we go into '16, there's more supply concentrated in San Jose than there is in either East Bay or San Francisco, as an example. That's across San Jose, and that's concentrated in Northeast San Jose. If you bleed up in the Mountain View, certain submarkets; there's about 3 or 4 submarkets there. Up in San Francisco, there's a fair amount of supply being delivered into SoMa. So if you're exposed to SoMa, you're probably going to hurt just as much. So it sort of depends on when in the cycle it occurs and what supply is being delivered at that point in time. But generally speaking in the higher price point, assets tend to suffer first and which tendencies people will migrate. If things become more affordable, they'll migrate back towards the end of the city and the cycle kind of repeats itself. So hopefully, I've provided some broad perspective about what happens in the market."

That typically is story of which market it's actually in. It's in Northern California. Obviously, it's been very strong versus, say, Westchester. But generally speaking, right now, within the market footprint, our Eaves communities are pretty synonymous with B communities as you referred to Axiometrics or Reis or any of those. And Eaves communities tend to be outperforming right now. To give you some perspective in the fourth quarter for our portfolio, the B assets or the eaves assets, which is for the most part B assets, were about 70 basis points ahead of how the A assets were performing. As you go look at Axiometrics, it's a pretty similar pattern there in terms of the outperformance. So this part of the cycle, well-positioned, value-oriented communities are outperforming. To the extent we are selling one of those communities, it typically is related to either submarket specific or asset specific. The issues we have or concerns about concentration in terms of other activity we might have in the region, that typically drives those disposition decisions as it relates to pretty much any community, but eaves as well."

We're basically mid-95s in terms of economic occupancy. It's down about 30, 40 basis points, but it's right about where we think we should be.

Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterward. 
During our comments, we'll focus on providing a summary of Q4 and the full year results and then spend a good part of time talking about the outlook for 2016. I'll talk about the economy, apartment markets and operations and turn it over to Kevin, who will talk about development as well as capital and risk management as we move further into the cycle.
So let's start on Slide 4. Highlights for the quarter and year include core FFO growth in Q4 of 14.4% and 11.4% for the full year, which is about 300 basis points higher than our original outlook at the beginning of the year. And importantly, we continue to generate FFO growth this cycle toward the top of the sector, while having the lowest leverage. 
Q4 same-store revenue growth came in at 5.4% or 5.7% when you include redevelopment, as many of our peers do. And for the full year, same-store revenue growth came in at 5.0% or 5.2%, including redevelopment. Same-store NOI for the year came in at 5.8%. 
We completed about $500 million this quarter at right around a 7% yield and $1.3 billion for the full year, at an initial yield of 6.7%. We started another 4 communities totaling about $400 million in Q4, bringing our full year level of starts to roughly $1.2 billion or roughly in line with completions this year.
And lastly, we raised $400 million in new capital in the quarter, principally through a $300 million unsecured debt offering. And for the year, we raised a total of $1.9 billion in capital to fund new investment and refinance maturing debt.
Turning now to Slide 5. The $1.3 billion of new development that we completed this year that I just referenced is contributing to healthy earnings and NAV accretion. Yields of 6.7% are roughly 250 basis points greater than our initial cost of external capital raised this year. And the cost basis of these completions at $310,000 per unit is more than 30% less than the value of our average stabilized asset on a per unit basis, with rents that are 12% to 13% higher, implying that value creation was around 50% over cost or roughly $650 million in net NAV created or $5 per share in 2015 alone.
Turning to Slide 6. In addition to strong financial results, we excelled in other important aspects of our business in 2015, including customer satisfaction, where we rank #1 nationally among all apartment operators for online reputation; associate engagement, we are ranked #1 in our sector and #2 among all D.C. metro-based organizations on Glassdoor; corporate responsibility, where our multiyear focus are on sustainability that's put us towards the top of the sector in the U.S. and globally; and community recognition, where a number of our newly developed communities earn prestigious awards from various industry groups. We probably don't talk enough about this with investors, but we know that achievement in serving the needs of these important constituencies and our customers, our associates, the communities, as well as the shareholders, is critical to building the kind of culture and company that can be enduring and successful.
Shifting now to 2016, let's move to Slide 7. We're projecting a 9% core growth in core FFO per share this year, driven by about 2/3 internal operations from the almost 6%, thanks to our NOI growth that we're projecting at the midpoint, and about 1/3 from new investment activity once you net out the cost of new capital issuance, which is coming mostly from stabilizing new developments.
The principal difference in growth between 2015 and '16 is that we expect less external growth from new investment activity, which in turn is being driven by the impact of fewer deliveries in 2015 that we will be stabilizing in '16 and some unevenness in the timing of capital raising activity. 
When looking at the earnings impact of our development platform, it's probably more helpful to view it over a multiyear period. For example, if you look at it over the 2015-16 time-frame year, new investment activity net of changes in capital cost is projected to deliver approximately $0.70 per share to core FFO or around 10% cumulative growth over the 2-year period.
Moving to Slide 8. Given our outlook for 2016, we announced a dividend increase of 8% this year. The dividend is now up by more than 50% over the last 5 years and importantly has grown by 5.5% on a compounded basis over the last 20 years. Dividends are an important component of total return. They represent almost 2/3 of the total return of roughly 1,800% that we've earned over the last 20 years. And that kind of growth really does underscore the accretion and growth embedded in our business model. I think sometimes this gets a little lost during the market volatility and rapid trading activity we're seeing in the sector today.
Turning to Slide 9. Our outlook is being driven in part by the prospect of a stable economy continuing into 2016. And from our perspective, it appears to have reached midcycle in terms of GDP and employment growth. An improving consumer should benefit from strong -- a stronger labor market in 2016. And then the public sector is expected to actually contribute to overall economic growth this year, although still at a lesser rate than the private sector after having been a drag for a number of years to overall economic growth.
Turning to Slide 10. Job growth in our markets is projected to outperform the U.S. again in 2016 as it did in '15 at just over 2%. The East Coast is expected to improve in '16, while the tech-heavy West Coast market should moderate off the blistering pace of the last couple of years, although it'll still remain at healthy levels, around 2.5%. 
On Slide 11, total personal income growth, which combines job and per capita income growth, is expected to accelerate in 2016 as wage growth gains traction, particularly for the younger millennial cohort, most of whom continues to rent. 
Wage growth, as we discussed in the past, will become an ever increasing important driver of our business as economic cycle matures and more supply starts to come online in 2016. 
Speaking of that, moving to Slide 12 and supply. We do expect that completions in our markets will increase in 2016 by about 50 basis points to around 2% of stock or roughly in line with job growth, suggesting pretty stable conditions overall. Of course, some submarkets, particularly in urban cores, will see higher levels of deliveries that may impact local markets, as owners use concessions to stimulate absorption during lease up. This is particularly true in urban and high-rise product, where inventories can build quickly and deliveries tend to occur over a more concentrated period of time. But overall, housing demand should continue to favor the apartment sector due to many of the things that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, including favorable demographics, pent-up demand as Millennials continue to unbundle and ultimately changing lifestyle trends, with delayed marriage and family formation. All these factors should help support another healthy year for apartment fundamentals in 2016.
And turning to Slide 13. That is reflected in our outlook for our same-store portfolio this year, where we're looking for same-store revenue growth of 4.25% to 5.5%, with modest improvement on the East Coast. While on the West Coast, we expect some moderation in Seattle and Northern California after exceptionally strong growth in 2015. 
Overall then, growth is expected to be healthy, with performance between the East and West Coast narrowing a bit in 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it to Kevin, who will discuss development and capital activity."

Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show development under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoi",918,"Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show development under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoing development activity as a percentage of our total enterprise value has been relatively stable over the past few years, at around 10%, which is at the low end of our target range. This reflects our continued discipline in allocating capital for this activity as we move further into the cycle.
Moving to Slide 15. Profit margins on our development activity have remained remarkably resilient and healthy in this cycle. Thanks to the underlying strength of apartment fundamentals, our sector-leading development and construction capabilities and the decisions we've made about which opportunities to pursue as the cycle matures. Since 2012, our development completions have increased from about $0.5 billion to more than $1 billion. During that time, development yields have been around 7%, while corresponding cap rates for those particular assets have been at or below 5%, resulting in stable profit margins on development in the low 30% range. 
As shown on Slide 16, communities currently in lease-up continue to provide healthy profit margins. For the 12 communities undergoing initial lease-up in 4Q '15, which represent $970 million in total capital cost, the current weighted average monthly rent per home is $115 above initial expectations. 
In terms of yield performance, the weighted average initial projected stabilized yield for these communities is currently 6.7%, or 30 basis points higher than our original projection of 6.4%.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to talk about how we manage risk associated with our development activity. The first way we do so is by maintaining a broadly diversified development pipeline, one that is diversified by geographic regions, by product type and by exposure to urban and suburban submarkets. 
As the chart on Slide 17 illustrate, while our development pipeline remains diversified across regions, future development lies a bias towards infill suburban markets and Midwest products, where rents, construction and land costs are more affordable, development economics are more favorable and the production cycle tends to be faster. Going forward, we expect our development rights pipeline will continue to be an important source of outsized growth in NAV and FFO per share.
Moving to Slide 18. Another way we manage development risk is how we source and structure new development opportunities, with the overwhelming majority being controlled through long-term purchase contracts with modest at-risk deposits and relatively few being controlled through land we purchased and hold on our balance sheet. At the end of 2015, our development rights pipeline consisted of 32 communities, representing $3.4 billion in projected total capital costs. Of these 32 communities, 25 are controlled through purchase contracts, while we own the land in the remaining 7. 
In addition, of these 7 where we own the land, 2 account for approximately $420 million of the $485 million in land held for development on our balance sheet. We expect to begin construction on these 2 community Development Rights, Columbus Circle and Hollywood, in 2016, which would reduce our projected land held for development by year-end 2016 at the lowest level in more than a decade.
A third method which we use to manage development risk is substantially match funding new starts with long-term capital, a topic we've talked about a lot in this cycle. 
On Slide 19, we highlight our funding position against the total projected capital cost of development under way. As you can see, we only need to source about $500 million in long-term capital against the $3.4 billion in development under construction or recently completed, taking into account the $2.2 billion of capital already spent to date, $400 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $350 million of projected annual cash flow from operations after dividends. This means that about 85% of the value creation from ongoing development activity has already been locked in for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 20. We show how being substantially match-funded significantly enhances our growth in EBITDA, while simultaneously enhancing our already sector-leading credit profile, essentially making us similar to an acquisition-oriented REIT from a funding-risk perspective, but with lower leverage and stronger built-in earnings growth. Specifically, the projected EBITDA for recently completed development and from development under construction totals about $216 million, as shown on the chart on the left. This represents about 18% growth in annualized core EBITDA from the fourth quarter. 
Even in a worse case, if all the $480 million of unfunded commitments were funded with new debt, our net debt to core EBITDA would still decline from 4.8x to the mid-4s after taking into account the EBITDA from new development. Of course, our actual net debt to core EBITDA would move around a bit as we source new capital to fund incremental development activity, therefore, this slide isn't meant to communicate that our leverage is going to decrease 4.5x or that our target leverage is 4.5x. 
In fact, our target range for this metric is to be roughly between 5x and 6x. Instead, the purpose in showing this slide is to convey that due to our match funding strategy, we are optimally positioned to benefit from development activity that is expected to be accretive both to earnings and balance sheet strength, and that our credit profile is actually enhanced by our profitable development capabilities given our funding strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim."

I think this outlook is not surprising just given our view that we are midcycle with healthy apartment fundamentals continuing and then just a stable level of deliveries and healthy accretion coming from our development pipeline. 
As we move further into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we are highly focused on managing the investment and funding risk of the business. And as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we're doing this through managing the size and diversity of our pipeline, reducing land inventory, match funding new commitments and maintaining leverage at the low end of our target range.

In terms of the attachment that shows the development pipeline with the projected yield of 6.3%, that is based upon current rents and rents marked to market once we start leasing and you get up to about 20%, 25% occupancy. For those communities that have started construction where there may have been market rent growth and we haven't yet started leasing, we haven't marked any of those to market, just to be clear. And I think you can probably see over the last few years, we've totally been beating the initial pro forma yields by 30 to 50 or 60 basis points just because of a strong market rent growth and the fact that we've been able to bring deals in more or less at budgeted cost. So I think it really is, ultimately -- and if you look at the development pipeline today, the shadow pipeline, the deals that haven't yet started, the economics of that look a lot like what the economics look like on the deals that we've been starting over the last couple of years. So I think a lot of it is going to -- how you would underwrite those would depend upon how you'd underwrite the market ultimately in terms of where we're doing business and how you might underwrite construction costs relative to market rent growth change over the next couple of years."

But I guess what I'd probably say based on historical precedent in the markets is the sort of high beta markets, if you want to think about it that way, tend to be the technology markets, so Northern California and Seattle, and to have a greater reaction in rent levels relative to given change in job growth in many of our other markets. So the technology markets are the ones you would be probably most concerned about. That's assuming of course that any reduction in job growth is somewhat proportional. In the past, we've had some losses in the energy sector. It has not had a direct effect on our markets, but there's certainly some indirect effects. As it relates to a reduced amount of capital investment on behalf of those companies, it's going to ripple through the economy.

We don't need to keep creating commitments if we don't think cost-effective capital is available to us in one of our principal funding markets. And I guess the second thing to keep in mind is that we do keep a very strong balance sheet both from a match funding perspective, but also from another dimension, including having low leverage and flatter maturities, so that we have an awful lot of flexibility to deal with sort of an air pocket that might exist where there may be a disruption in capital markets before we've been able to sort of adjust and dial back on new starts. So I think fundamentally, we have great deal of flexibility in the commitments we create and the capital we're going to be able to source from the deal with volatility in the capital markets, and that's how we manage the balance sheet."

And I'd say while we don't comment on the preciseness in part because the capital markets themselves can be volatile and the pricing can change over time, of that $1.1 billion, the majority of the capital in our plan is contemplated to come in the form of unsecured debt issuance."

I guess what I'd say is, at this point, you properly identified Northern California as one of the markets where there is probably a little bit of concern about slowing. It's come up a couple of different times. But in terms of markets that has some upside, certainly the Mid-Atlantic is one that has some potential upside in terms of we're at a point in the cycle where we know that supply is. It was about 2% last year; it's going to increase to about 2.5% this year. But more importantly, as we're getting pretty good job growth out of the Mid-Atlantic now up in the low 2% range. And it's starting to have nice effect on occupancy and rent change across the markets here. So the expectation is that there's potential for some upside in the Mid-Atlantic. I would not describe it as opportunistic in that there's significant upside. There is still a fair amount of supply coming. And it's not a sort of high beta market, as I described in the Northern California and Pacific Northwest regions. So you tend to get a moderate recovery. And we are seeing that here in terms of recent trends, where rent change is up about 100 basis points in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of '14, so there's nice momentum there. And then the other market that may have some upside, I'd say, is Boston. Boston has been performing well, job growth has been steady and supply is projected to increase this year relative to 2015. So there's probably a little bit of potential upside in Boston and the Mid-Atlantic, are the 2 that probably stand out the most, I'd say. Southern California has been increasing nicely and we expect that to continue. But I wouldn't think it falls into the potential surprise category like the other 2 do."

In terms of expected performance in '16, what we have is overall for the Mid-Atlantic, probably in the mid-1% range. And again, it's relatively tight, I'd say. We're talking about the suburban Maryland probably right at the midpoint there. We may see a little bit better performance out of D.C., just given the nature of our specific assets in D.C., which is the Gallery Place, Foxhall, stuff in the Northwest corridor that's older and rent-controlled. When you look at it from a market perspective, I would say, the one thing to be cautious about is the greatest amount of supply to be delivered in 2016 is in the district. So just depending on the distribution of your portfolio within the district really will dictate what your performance is going to be. So the way I think the market would probably look at it is D.C. people would probably expect to be a little bit softer given the nature of the deliveries. Infill suburban submarkets probably in Virginia performing better. And then Western Fairfax, I would say, and suburban Maryland probably being the laggard."

In terms of, again, recent performance rolling forward, I'll try to keep this relatively brief without going on too long here, but where we've started to see some supply impact is in Orange County. Orange County has softened up a little bit. There's a fair amount of supply coming into Irvine. There's some in Laguna Hills. There's supply in Anaheim. There's been supply in Huntington Beach, a little bit in Costa Mesa. So that's softened a little bit, and our expectation for '16 for that market is for it to trial the other regions as well, because of the same issues. San Diego and L.A., we expect a lead going into '16 and continue throughout the year. And for the most part, that's not only the nature of the markets, but how our portfolio is positioned, which is for the most part it's B assets in suburban submarkets across San Diego, which is a relatively small portfolio, but that's where the majority of our assets are located. And in Los Angeles, same thing in terms of distribution of the assets within those submarkets. We don't have any same-store assets in downtown L.A. as an example, which is getting supply now that's equal to double-digit percentages of existing inventory. So you're going to have softness in some of those submarkets, like downtown L.A., where you're getting a heavy amount of new deliveries. So I'd say for '16 overall, you're probably going to see L.A., San Diego leading, and Orange County lagging, just given the nature of our portfolio, but also just from the market perspective in terms of where the supply is concentrated."

We haven't done a lot of acquisitions historically in this cycle. So at this point -- but what we are doing is we're trying to -- we are always looking for opportunities to improve our portfolio where we can, and that happened to be a very unique opportunity there in Hoboken. We weren't per se looking to adding New Jersey on a net basis, but we're always looking to improve our submarket exposure. It's a highly supply-protected submarket. It's one of the few parts of New Jersey we have not been able to penetrate through new development. It's a -- the cap rate is about 5, which is pretty attractive for an asset that's only 7 years old. The average unit size there is about 1,000 square feet. So it's actually more targeted at families and -- than necessarily at young singles, and that's what -- in that part of Hoboken, it's kind of interesting to see how it's evolving in that way as Hoboken kind of matures as a desirable location, not just for people kind of right out of school, but for people -- married couples, be a little bit older as well. There's a supermarket right next door. So it was just a unique opportunity, and we feel like we were able to, based on some unique characteristics of the way the asset was marketed, get it at a price that was more compelling than most of the acquisition opportunities we're seeing."

Just a couple of things, and probably tax is not an area people are overly eager to get into a deep discussion on, to be sure; we probably can't. There's really 2 issues: One is there's a special dividend obligation associated with the fact that we are a taxpaying entity but for the fact that we have a dividend pay deduction. But there's also excise tax considerations as well. So I think from our standpoint, when we look at using asset sales to fund development, we have a fair bit of running room in terms of being able to sell assets before we have to worry about a special dividend obligation. We would probably more likely encounter a situation where we might have to pay an excise tax, which is sort of a -- a little bit of a 4% tax payment on excess income over distributions. And so it becomes sort of a -- kind of almost like a transaction cost, if you will, that gets added to selling assets to fund development. So we certainly have a reasonable amount of ability to continue to sell assets to fund development, but what we run into first is probably having to pay an excise tax, which is just an extra transaction cost, if you will, which we'd rather not incur if we can avoid it, but it's something that's probably more relevant."

We do have a fair bit of -- about $1.1 billion of tax-exempt debt that's secured and has probably on an average about 21 years left to run. So that's something we have done in the past, and we like that form of capital, though it's far less available today. In terms of 30-year unsecured debt, since we don't have to have -- since we don't currently have it, you have to ask yourself what's it in substitution for? I think probably it's been a little bit more of a compelling equity substitute for those who want more leverage than a compelling substitute for 10-year debt when you do the breakevens. For us, we might be willing to entertain doing it. I guess probably one guiding principle would be if we were to look at the total amount of debt we're going to issue in one year, there's only so much we'd want to issue in the form of 10-year unsecured debt. Before, in a future period, we'd have a more debt coming due than we would prefer, which as we've talked about before, we tried to target having leveled maturities that are on balance less than or equal to our projected amount of dividends. And so if we felt we're going to be issuing a certain amount of debt in the unsecured markets in a given year, that might be more than we want to have coming due in 10 years. We might think about doing the excess in the form of a 30-year note offering."

Move out to rent increase doesn't really move that much on average, and it has the certain markets. And so I think you probably have to go market by market to figure out where that's most pronounced. So there's certainly been pushback in Northern California that's above historical averages. But that's a market where we are seeing pretty significant rent growth in the last 3 years. So you sort of expect that. When someone gets their third 8%, 9%, 10% rent increase, wages have been growing, but then they're not growing that quickly, there's some pushback. But I'd say, as part of the normal process, there's not a significant shift to one direction or another that we're seeing across the portfolio."

Those 2 deals were underwritten in kind of the high-5s based on the rents that were in place when we started those deals. We had not marked either one to market yet. The Willoughby Square deal, is a very large building. So it will be a while before we have kind of 20% lease, which is typically when we would market to market, but I think we're feeling pretty good about the capital budget there and we're feeling pretty good that based on what we've seen so far, the market is certainly a little bit above where it was performing.

We have a market to market, but face rents are in the $60 a foot range. I think pro forma was around $55. And that's $60 a foot at the kind of slow-leasing season, Christmas, January kind of rates. So feel pretty good about that in terms of how that product is positioned in Brooklyn. As I mentioned, we don't have the Avalon component yet, but it's -- those will be the nicer units at the top of the building.

So if you have the most expensive high-rise in the city, you're going to see some reaction to that. If you -- that's just a macro comment. It sort of depends on when it occurs and what supply is being delivered. As we go into '16, there's more supply concentrated in San Jose than there is in either the East Bay or San Francisco, as an example. That's across San Jose. Now it's concentrated in Northeast San Jose, if you bleed up into Mountain View, certain submarkets; there's about 3 or 4 submarkets there. Up in San Francisco, there's a fair amount of supply being delivered into SoMa. So if you're exposed to SoMa, you're probably going to hurt just as much. So it sort of depends on when in the cycle it occurs and what supply is being delivered at that point in time. But generally speaking in the higher price point, assets tend to suffer first and which tendencies people will migrate as things become more affordable? They'll migrate back towards the end of the city and the cycle kind of repeats itself. So hopefully that provides some broad perspective about what happens in the market."

That typically is a story of which market it's actually in. It's in Northern California. Obviously, it's been very strong versus, say, Westchester. But generally speaking, right now, within the market footprint, our eaves communities are pretty synonymous with B communities as you referred to Axiometrics or Reis or any of those. And eaves communities tend to be outperforming right now. To give you some perspective, in the fourth quarter for our portfolio, the B assets or the eaves assets, which is, for the most part, B assets, were about 70 basis points ahead of how the A assets were performing. As you go look at Axiometrics, it's a pretty similar pattern there in terms of the outperformance. So this part of the cycle, well-positioned, value-oriented communities are outperforming. To the extent we are selling one of those communities, it typically is related to either submarket specific or asset specific, either issues we have or concerns about concentration in terms of other activity we might have in the region, that typically drives those disposition decisions as it relates to pretty much any community, but eaves as well."

Highlights for the quarter and year include core FFO growth in Q4 of 14.4% and 11.4% for the full year, which is about 300 basis points higher than our original outlook at the beginning of the year. And importantly, we continue to generate FFO growth this cycle toward the top of the sector, while having the lowest leverage. 
Q4 same-store revenue growth came in at 5.4% or 5.7% when you include redevelopment, as many of our peers do. And for the full year, same-store revenue growth came in at 5.0% or 5.2%, including redevelopment. Same-store NOI for the year came in at 5.8%. 
We completed about $500 million this quarter at right around a 7% yield and $1.3 billion for the full year, at an initial yield of 6.7%. We started another 4 communities totaling about $400 million in Q4, bringing our full year level of starts to roughly $1.2 billion or roughly in line with completions this year.
And lastly, we raised $400 million in new capital in the quarter, principally through a $300 million unsecured debt offering. And for the year, we raised a total of $1.9 billion in capital to fund new investment and refinance maturing debt.
Turning now to Slide 5. The $1.3 billion of new development that we completed this year that I just referenced is contributing to healthy earnings and NAV accretion. Yields of 6.7% are roughly 250 basis points greater than our initial cost of external capital raised this year. And the cost basis of these completions at $310,000 per unit is more than 30% less than the value of our average stabilized asset on a per unit basis, with rents that are 12% to 13% higher, implying that value creation was around 50% over cost or roughly $650 million in net NAV created or $5 per share in 2015 alone.
Turning to Slide 6. In addition to strong financial results, we excelled in other important aspects of our business in 2015, including customer satisfaction, where we rank #1 nationally among all apartment operators for online reputation; associate engagement, we are ranked #1 in our sector and #2 among all D.C. metro-based organizations on Glassdoor; corporate responsibility, where our multiyear focus are on sustainability that's put us towards the top of the sector in the U.S. and globally; and community recognition, where a number of our newly developed communities earn prestigious awards from various industry groups. We probably don't talk enough about this with investors, but we know that achievement in serving the needs of these important constituencies and our customers, our associates, the communities, as well as the shareholders, is critical to building the kind of culture and company that can be enduring and successful.
Shifting now to 2016, let's move to Slide 7. We're projecting a 9% core growth in core FFO per share this year, driven by about 2/3 internal operations from the almost 6%, thanks to our NOI growth that we're projecting at the midpoint, and about 1/3 from new investment activity once you net out the cost of new capital issuance, which is coming mostly from stabilizing new developments.
The principal difference in growth between 2015 and '16 is that we expect less external growth from new investment activity, which in turn is being driven by the impact of fewer deliveries in 2015 that we will be stabilizing in '16 and some unevenness in the timing of capital raising activity. 
When looking at the earnings impact of our development platform, it's probably more helpful to view it over a multiyear period. For example, if you look at it over the 2015-16 time-frame year, new investment activity net of changes in capital cost is projected to deliver approximately $0.70 per share to core FFO or around 10% cumulative growth over the 2-year period.
Moving to Slide 8. Given our outlook for 2016, we announced a dividend increase of 8% this year. The dividend is now up by more than 50% over the last 5 years and importantly has grown by 5.5% on a compounded basis over the last 20 years. Dividends are an important component of total return. They represent almost 2/3 of the total return of roughly 1,800% that we've earned over the last 20 years. And that kind of growth really does underscore the accretion and growth embedded in our business model. I think sometimes this gets a little lost during the market volatility and rapid trading activity we're seeing in the sector today.
Turning to Slide 9. Our outlook is being driven in part by the prospect of a stable economy continuing into 2016. And from our perspective, it appears to have reached midcycle in terms of GDP and employment growth. An improving consumer should benefit from strong -- a stronger labor market in 2016. And then the public sector is expected to actually contribute to overall economic growth this year, although still at a lesser rate than the private sector after having been a drag for a number of years to overall economic growth.
Turning to Slide 10. Job growth in our markets is projected to outperform the U.S. again in 2016 as it did in '15 at just over 2%. The East Coast is expected to improve in '16, while the tech-heavy West Coast market should moderate off the blistering pace of the last couple of years, although it'll still remain at healthy levels, around 2.5%. 
On Slide 11, total personal income growth, which combines job and per capita income growth, is expected to accelerate in 2016 as wage growth gains traction, particularly for the younger millennial cohort, most of whom continues to rent. 
Wage growth, as we discussed in the past, will become an ever increasing important driver of our business as economic cycle matures and more supply starts to come online in 2016. 
Speaking of that, moving to Slide 12 and supply. We do expect that completions in our markets will increase in 2016 by about 50 basis points to around 2% of stock or roughly in line with job growth, suggesting pretty stable conditions overall. Of course, some submarkets, particularly in urban cores, will see higher levels of deliveries that may impact local markets, as owners use concessions to stimulate absorption during lease up. This is particularly true in urban and high-rise product, where inventories can build quickly and deliveries tend to occur over a more concentrated period of time. But overall, housing demand should continue to favor the apartment sector due to many of the things that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, including favorable demographics, pent-up demand as Millennials continue to unbundle and ultimately changing lifestyle trends, with delayed marriage and family formation. All these factors should help support another healthy year for apartment fundamentals in 2016.
And turning to Slide 13. That is reflected in our outlook for our same-store portfolio this year, where we're looking for same-store revenue growth of 4.25% to 5.5%, with modest improvement on the East Coast. While on the West Coast, we expect some moderation in Seattle and Northern California after exceptionally strong growth in 2015. 
Overall then, growth is expected to be healthy, with performance between the East and West Coast narrowing a bit in 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it to Kevin, who will discuss development and capital activity."

Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show development under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoi",918,"Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show development under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoing development activity as a percentage of our total enterprise value has been relatively stable over the past few years, at around 10%, which is at the low end of our target range. This reflects our continued discipline in allocating capital for this activity as we move further into the cycle.
Moving to Slide 15. Profit margins on our development activity have remained remarkably resilient and healthy in this cycle. Thanks to the underlying strength of apartment fundamentals, our sector-leading development and construction capabilities and the decisions we've made about which opportunities to pursue as the cycle matures. Since 2012, our development completions have increased from about $0.5 billion to more than $1 billion. During that time, development yields have been around 7%, while corresponding cap rates for those particular assets have been at or below 5%, resulting in stable profit margins on development in the low 30% range. 
As shown on Slide 16, communities currently in lease-up continue to provide healthy profit margins. For the 12 communities undergoing initial lease-up in 4Q '15, which represent $970 million in total capital cost, the current weighted average monthly rent per home is $115 above initial expectations. 
In terms of yield performance, the weighted average initial projected stabilized yield for these communities is currently 6.7%, or 30 basis points higher than our original projection of 6.4%.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to talk about how we manage risk associated with our development activity. The first way we do so is by maintaining a broadly diversified development pipeline, one that is diversified by geographic regions, by product type and by exposure to urban and suburban submarkets. 
As the chart on Slide 17 illustrate, while our development pipeline remains diversified across regions, future development lies a bias towards infill suburban markets and Midwest products, where rents, construction and land costs are more affordable, development economics are more favorable and the production cycle tends to be faster. Going forward, we expect our development rights pipeline will continue to be an important source of outsized growth in NAV and FFO per share.
Moving to Slide 18. Another way we manage development risk is how we source and structure new development opportunities, with the overwhelming majority being controlled through long-term purchase contracts with modest at-risk deposits and relatively few being controlled through land we purchased and hold on our balance sheet. At the end of 2015, our development rights pipeline consisted of 32 communities, representing $3.4 billion in projected total capital costs. Of these 32 communities, 25 are controlled through purchase contracts, while we own the land in the remaining 7. 
In addition, of these 7 where we own the land, 2 account for approximately $420 million of the $485 million in land held for development on our balance sheet. We expect to begin construction on these 2 community Development Rights, Columbus Circle and Hollywood, in 2016, which would reduce our projected land held for development by year-end 2016 at the lowest level in more than a decade.
A third method which we use to manage development risk is substantially match funding new starts with long-term capital, a topic we've talked about a lot in this cycle. 
On Slide 19, we highlight our funding position against the total projected capital cost of development under way. As you can see, we only need to source about $500 million in long-term capital against the $3.4 billion in development under construction or recently completed, taking into account the $2.2 billion of capital already spent to date, $400 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $350 million of projected annual cash flow from operations after dividends. This means that about 85% of the value creation from ongoing development activity has already been locked in for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 20. We show how being substantially match-funded significantly enhances our growth in EBITDA, while simultaneously enhancing our already sector-leading credit profile, essentially making us similar to an acquisition-oriented REIT from a funding-risk perspective, but with lower leverage and stronger built-in earnings growth. Specifically, the projected EBITDA for recently completed development and from development under construction totals about $216 million, as shown on the chart on the left. This represents about 18% growth in annualized core EBITDA from the fourth quarter. 
Even in a worse case, if all the $480 million of unfunded commitments were funded with new debt, our net debt to core EBITDA would still decline from 4.8x to the mid-4s after taking into account the EBITDA from new development. Of course, our actual net debt to core EBITDA would move around a bit as we source new capital to fund incremental development activity, therefore, this slide isn't meant to communicate that our leverage is going to decrease 4.5x or that our target leverage is 4.5x. 
In fact, our target range for this metric is to be roughly between 5x and 6x. Instead, the purpose in showing this slide is to convey that due to our match funding strategy, we are optimally positioned to benefit from development activity that is expected to be accretive both to earnings and balance sheet strength, and that our credit profile is actually enhanced by our profitable development capabilities given our funding strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim."

I think this outlook is not surprising just given our view that we are midcycle with healthy apartment fundamentals continuing and then just a stable level of deliveries and healthy accretion coming from our development pipeline. 
As we move further into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we are highly focused on managing the investment and funding risk of the business. And as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we're doing this through managing the size and diversity of our pipeline, reducing land inventory, match funding new commitments and maintaining leverage at the low end of our target range.

In terms of the attachment that shows the development pipeline with the projected yield of 6.3%, that is based upon current rents and rents marked to market once we start leasing and you get up to about 20%, 25% occupancy. For those communities that have started construction where there may have been market rent growth and we haven't yet started leasing, we haven't marked any of those to market, just to be clear. And I think you can probably see over the last few years, we've totally been beating the initial pro forma yields by 30 to 50 or 60 basis points just because of a strong market rent growth and the fact that we've been able to bring deals in more or less at budgeted cost. So I think it really is, ultimately -- and if you look at the development pipeline today, the shadow pipeline, the deals that haven't yet started, the economics of that look a lot like what the economics look like on the deals that we've been starting over the last couple of years. So I think a lot of it is going to -- how you would underwrite those would depend upon how you'd underwrite the market ultimately in terms of where we're doing business and how you might underwrite construction costs relative to market rent growth change over the next couple of years."

There's probably a couple of answers to that question. But I guess what I'd probably say based on historical precedent in the markets is the sort of high beta markets, if you want to think about it that way, tend to be the technology markets, so Northern California and Seattle, and to have a greater reaction in rent levels relative to given change in job growth in many of our other markets. So the technology markets are the ones you would be probably most concerned about. That's assuming of course that any reduction in job growth is somewhat proportional. In the past, we've had some losses in the energy sector. It has not had a direct effect on our markets, but there's certainly some indirect effects. As it relates to a reduced amount of capital investment on behalf of those companies, it's going to ripple through the economy.

We don't need to keep creating commitments if we don't think cost-effective capital is available to us in one of our principal funding markets. And I guess the second thing to keep in mind is that we do keep a very strong balance sheet both from a match funding perspective, but also from another dimension, including having low leverage and flatter maturities, so that we have an awful lot of flexibility to deal with sort of an air pocket that might exist where there may be a disruption in capital markets before we've been able to sort of adjust and dial back on new starts. So I think fundamentally, we have great deal of flexibility in the commitments we create and the capital we're going to be able to source from the deal with volatility in the capital markets, and that's how we manage the balance sheet."

I guess what I'd say is, at this point, you properly identified Northern California as one of the markets where there is probably a little bit of concern about slowing. It's come up a couple of different times. But in terms of markets that has some upside, certainly the Mid-Atlantic is one that has some potential upside in terms of we're at a point in the cycle where we know that supply is. It was about 2% last year; it's going to increase to about 2.5% this year. But more importantly, as we're getting pretty good job growth out of the Mid-Atlantic now up in the low 2% range. And it's starting to have nice effect on occupancy and rent change across the markets here. So the expectation is that there's potential for some upside in the Mid-Atlantic. I would not describe it as opportunistic in that there's significant upside. There is still a fair amount of supply coming. And it's not a sort of high beta market, as I described in the Northern California and Pacific Northwest regions. So you tend to get a moderate recovery. And we are seeing that here in terms of recent trends, where rent change is up about 100 basis points in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of '14, so there's nice momentum there. And then the other market that may have some upside, I'd say, is Boston. Boston has been performing well, job growth has been steady and supply is projected to increase this year relative to 2015. So there's probably a little bit of potential upside in Boston and the Mid-Atlantic, are the 2 that probably stand out the most, I'd say. Southern California has been increasing nicely and we expect that to continue. But I wouldn't think it falls into the potential surprise category like the other 2 do."

As it relates to the, I'll call it sort of recent momentum, including the fourth quarter and spillover into early 2016, I'd say the laggard across the metro area has been suburban Maryland. Job growth has been okay, but the supply has been heavy and steady throughout that region, particularly Rockville, North Bethesda, Chevy Chase has been inundated with supply. So it's been the softest. The strongest has been in and around D.C. So D.C. proper as well as the close-in sort of R.B. corridor and things like that, towns and submarkets that are close in to D.C. and then I'd say the rest in Northern Virginia kind of falls into the second place. So you take, call it, the district and the immediate and adjacent submarkets, Northern Virginia and then suburban Maryland being the laggard, is kind of recent conditions. In terms of expected performance in '16, what we have is overall for the Mid-Atlantic, probably in the mid-1% range. And again, it's relatively tight, I'd say. We're talking about the suburban Maryland probably right at the midpoint there. We may see a little bit better performance out of D.C., just given the nature of our specific assets in D.C., which is the Gallery Place, Foxhall, stuff in the Northwest corridor that's older and rent-controlled. When you look at it from a market perspective, I would say, the one thing to be cautious about is the greatest amount of supply to be delivered in 2016 is in the district. So just depending on the distribution of your portfolio within the district really will dictate what your performance is going to be. So the way I think the market would probably look at it is D.C. people would probably expect to be a little bit softer given the nature of the deliveries. Infill suburban submarkets probably in Virginia performing better. And then Western Fairfax, I would say, and suburban Maryland probably being the laggard."

In terms of, again, recent performance rolling forward, I'll try to keep this relatively brief without going on too long here, but where we've started to see some supply impact is in Orange County. Orange County has softened up a little bit. There's a fair amount of supply coming into Irvine. There's some in Laguna Hills. There's supply in Anaheim. There's been supply in Huntington Beach, a little bit in Costa Mesa. So that's softened a little bit, and our expectation for '16 for that market is for it to trial the other regions as well, because of the same issues. San Diego and L.A., we expect a lead going into '16 and continue throughout the year. And for the most part, that's not only the nature of the markets, but how our portfolio is positioned, which is for the most part it's B assets in suburban submarkets across San Diego, which is a relatively small portfolio, but that's where the majority of our assets are located. And in Los Angeles, same thing in terms of distribution of the assets within those submarkets. We don't have any same-store assets in downtown L.A. as an example, which is getting supply now that's equal to double-digit percentages of existing inventory. So you're going to have softness in some of those submarkets, like downtown L.A., where you're getting a heavy amount of new deliveries. So I'd say for '16 overall, you're probably going to see L.A., San Diego leading, and Orange County lagging, just given the nature of our portfolio, but also just from the market perspective in terms of where the supply is concentrated."

We haven't done a lot of acquisitions historically in this cycle. So at this point -- but what we are doing is we're trying to -- we are always looking for opportunities to improve our portfolio where we can, and that happened to be a very unique opportunity there in Hoboken. We weren't per se looking to adding New Jersey on a net basis, but we're always looking to improve our submarket exposure. It's a highly supply-protected submarket. It's one of the few parts of New Jersey we have not been able to penetrate through new development. It's a -- the cap rate is about 5, which is pretty attractive for an asset that's only 7 years old. The average unit size there is about 1,000 square feet. So it's actually more targeted at families and -- than necessarily at young singles, and that's what -- in that part of Hoboken, it's kind of interesting to see how it's evolving in that way as Hoboken kind of matures as a desirable location, not just for people kind of right out of school, but for people -- married couples, be a little bit older as well. There's a supermarket right next door. So it was just a unique opportunity, and we feel like we were able to, based on some unique characteristics of the way the asset was marketed, get it at a price that was more compelling than most of the acquisition opportunities we're seeing."

Just a couple of things, and probably tax is not an area people are overly eager to get into a deep discussion on, to be sure; we probably can't. There's really 2 issues: One is there's a special dividend obligation associated with the fact that we are a taxpaying entity but for the fact that we have a dividend pay deduction. But there's also excise tax considerations as well. So I think from our standpoint, when we look at using asset sales to fund development, we have a fair bit of running room in terms of being able to sell assets before we have to worry about a special dividend obligation. We would probably more likely encounter a situation where we might have to pay an excise tax, which is sort of a -- a little bit of a 4% tax payment on excess income over distributions. And so it becomes sort of a -- kind of almost like a transaction cost, if you will, that gets added to selling assets to fund development. So we certainly have a reasonable amount of ability to continue to sell assets to fund development, but what we run into first is probably having to pay an excise tax, which is just an extra transaction cost, if you will, which we'd rather not incur if we can avoid it, but it's something that's probably more relevant."

We do have a fair bit of -- about $1.1 billion of tax-exempt debt that's secured and has probably on an average about 21 years left to run. So that's something we have done in the past, and we like that form of capital, though it's far less available today. In terms of 30-year unsecured debt, since we don't have to have -- since we don't currently have it, you have to ask yourself what's it in substitution for? I think probably it's been a little bit more of a compelling equity substitute for those who want more leverage than a compelling substitute for 10-year debt when you do the breakevens. For us, we might be willing to entertain doing it. I guess probably one guiding principle would be if we were to look at the total amount of debt we're going to issue in one year, there's only so much we'd want to issue in the form of 10-year unsecured debt. Before, in a future period, we'd have a more debt coming due than we would prefer, which as we've talked about before, we tried to target having leveled maturities that are on balance less than or equal to our projected amount of dividends. And so if we felt we're going to be issuing a certain amount of debt in the unsecured markets in a given year, that might be more than we want to have coming due in 10 years. We might think about doing the excess in the form of a 30-year note offering."

Move out to rent increase doesn't really move that much on average, and it has the certain markets. And so I think you probably have to go market by market to figure out where that's most pronounced. So there's certainly been pushback in Northern California that's above historical averages. But that's a market where we are seeing pretty significant rent growth in the last 3 years. So you sort of expect that. When someone gets their third 8%, 9%, 10% rent increase, wages have been growing, but then they're not growing that quickly, there's some pushback. But I'd say, as part of the normal process, there's not a significant shift to one direction or another that we're seeing across the portfolio."

Those 2 deals were underwritten in kind of the high-5s based on the rents that were in place when we started those deals. We had not marked either one to market yet. The Willoughby Square deal, is a very large building.

So if you have the most expensive high-rise in the city, you're going to see some reaction to that. If you -- that's just a macro comment. It sort of depends on when it occurs and what supply is being delivered. As we go into '16, there's more supply concentrated in San Jose than there is in either the East Bay or San Francisco, as an example. That's across San Jose. Now it's concentrated in Northeast San Jose, if you bleed up into Mountain View, certain submarkets; there's about 3 or 4 submarkets there. Up in San Francisco, there's a fair amount of supply being delivered into SoMa. So if you're exposed to SoMa, you're probably going to hurt just as much. So it sort of depends on when in the cycle it occurs and what supply is being delivered at that point in time. But generally speaking in the higher price point, assets tend to suffer first and which tendencies people will migrate as things become more affordable? They'll migrate back towards the end of the city and the cycle kind of repeats itself. So hopefully that provides some broad perspective about what happens in the market."

That typically is a story of which market it's actually in. It's in Northern California. Obviously, it's been very strong versus, say, Westchester. But generally speaking, right now, within the market footprint, our eaves communities are pretty synonymous with B communities as you referred to Axiometrics or Reis or any of those. And eaves communities tend to be outperforming right now. To give you some perspective, in the fourth quarter for our portfolio, the B assets or the eaves assets, which is, for the most part, B assets, were about 70 basis points ahead of how the A assets were performing. As you go look at Axiometrics, it's a pretty similar pattern there in terms of the outperformance. So this part of the cycle, well-positioned, value-oriented communities are outperforming. To the extent we are selling one of those communities, it typically is related to either submarket specific or asset specific, either issues we have or concerns about concentration in terms of other activity we might have in the region, that typically drives those disposition decisions as it relates to pretty much any community, but eaves as well."

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterward. Durin",1339,"Yes, thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q4 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterward. 
During our comments, we'll focus on providing a summary of Q4 and the full year results and then spend a good part of time talking about the outlook for 2016. I'll talk about the economy, apartment markets and operations and turn it over to Kevin, who will talk about development as well as capital and risk management as we move further into the cycle.
So let's start on Slide 4. Highlights for the quarter and year include core FFO growth in Q4 of 14.4% and 11.4% for the full year, which is about 300 basis points higher than our original outlook at the beginning of the year. And importantly, we continue to generate FFO growth this cycle toward the top of the sector, while having the lowest leverage. 
Q4 same-store revenue growth came in at 5.4% or 5.7% when you include redevelopment, as many of our peers do. And for the full year, same-store revenue growth came in at 5.0% or 5.2%, including redevelopment. Same-store NOI for the year came in at 5.8%. 
We completed about $500 million this quarter at right around a 7% yield and $1.3 billion for the full year, at an initial yield of 6.7%. We started another 4 communities totaling about $400 million in Q4, bringing our full year level of starts to roughly $1.2 billion or roughly in line with completions this year.
And lastly, we raised $400 million in new capital in the quarter, principally through a $300 million unsecured debt offering. And for the year, we raised a total of $1.9 billion in capital to fund new investment and refinance maturing debt.
Turning now to Slide 5. The $1.3 billion of new development that we completed this year that I just referenced is contributing to healthy earnings and NAV accretion. Yields of 6.7% are roughly 250 basis points greater than our initial cost of external capital raised this year. And the cost basis of these completions at $310,000 per unit is more than 30% less than the value of our average stabilized asset on a per unit basis, with rents that are 12% to 13% higher, implying that value creation was around 50% over cost or roughly $650 million in net NAV created or $5 per share in 2015 alone.
Turning to Slide 6. In addition to strong financial results, we excelled in other important aspects of our business in 2015, including customer satisfaction, where we rank #1 nationally among all apartment operators for online reputation; associate engagement, we are ranked #1 in our sector and #2 among all D.C. metro-based organizations on Glassdoor; corporate responsibility, where our multiyear focus are on sustainability that's put us towards the top of the sector in the U.S. and globally; and community recognition, where a number of our newly developed communities earn prestigious awards from various industry groups. We probably don't talk enough about this with investors, but we know that achievement in serving the needs of these important constituencies and our customers, our associates, the communities, as well as the shareholders, is critical to building the kind of culture and company that can be enduring and successful.
Shifting now to 2016, let's move to Slide 7. We're projecting a 9% core growth in core FFO per share this year, driven by about 2/3 internal operations from the almost 6%, thanks to our NOI growth that we're projecting at the midpoint, and about 1/3 from new investment activity once you net out the cost of new capital issuance, which is coming mostly from stabilizing new developments.
The principal difference in growth between 2015 and '16 is that we expect less external growth from new investment activity, which in turn is being driven by the impact of fewer deliveries in 2015 that we will be stabilizing in '16 and some unevenness in the timing of capital raising activity. 
When looking at the earnings impact of our development platform, it's probably more helpful to view it over a multiyear period. For example, if you look at it over the 2015-16 time-frame year, new investment activity net of changes in capital cost is projected to deliver approximately $0.70 per share to core FFO or around 10% cumulative growth over the 2-year period.
Moving to Slide 8. Given our outlook for 2016, we announced a dividend increase of 8% this year. The dividend is now up by more than 50% over the last 5 years and importantly has grown by 5.5% on a compounded basis over the last 20 years. Dividends are an important component of total return. They represent almost 2/3 of the total return of roughly 1,800% that we've earned over the last 20 years. And that kind of growth really does underscore the accretion and growth embedded in our business model. I think sometimes this gets a little lost during the market volatility and rapid trading activity we're seeing in the sector today.
Turning to Slide 9. Our outlook is being driven in part by the prospect of a stable economy continuing into 2016. And from our perspective, it appears to have reached midcycle in terms of GDP and employment growth. An improving consumer should benefit from strong -- a stronger labor market in 2016. And then the public sector is expected to actually contribute to overall economic growth this year, although still at a lesser rate than the private sector after having been a drag for a number of years to overall economic growth.
Turning to Slide 10. Job growth in our markets is projected to outperform the U.S. again in 2016 as it did in '15 at just over 2%. The East Coast is expected to improve in '16, while the tech-heavy West Coast market should moderate off the blistering pace of the last couple of years, although it'll still remain at healthy levels, around 2.5%. 
On Slide 11, total personal income growth, which combines job and per capita income growth, is expected to accelerate in 2016 as wage growth gains traction, particularly for the younger millennial cohort, most of whom continues to rent. 
Wage growth, as we discussed in the past, will become an ever increasing important driver of our business as economic cycle matures and more supply starts to come online in 2016. 
Speaking of that, moving to Slide 12 and supply. We do expect that completions in our markets will increase in 2016 by about 50 basis points to around 2% of stock or roughly in line with job growth, suggesting pretty stable conditions overall. Of course, some submarkets, particularly in urban cores, will see higher levels of deliveries that may impact local markets, as owners use concessions to stimulate absorption during lease up. This is particularly true in urban and high-rise product, where inventories can build quickly and deliveries tend to occur over a more concentrated period of time. But overall, housing demand should continue to favor the apartment sector due to many of the things that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, including favorable demographics, pent-up demand as Millennials continue to unbundle and ultimately changing lifestyle trends, with delayed marriage and family formation. All these factors should help support another healthy year for apartment fundamentals in 2016.
And turning to Slide 13. That is reflected in our outlook for our same-store portfolio this year, where we're looking for same-store revenue growth of 4.25% to 5.5%, with modest improvement on the East Coast. While on the West Coast, we expect some moderation in Seattle and Northern California after exceptionally strong growth in 2015. 
Overall then, growth is expected to be healthy, with performance between the East and West Coast narrowing a bit in 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it to Kevin, who will discuss development and capital activity."
329141,321713567,937332,"Avalonbay Communities Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show development under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoi",918,"Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on Slide 14, we show development under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value, both projected for year-end 2016 and historically going back to 2004. As you can see here, ongoing development activity as a percentage of our total enterprise value has been relatively stable over the past few years, at around 10%, which is at the low end of our target range. This reflects our continued discipline in allocating capital for this activity as we move further into the cycle.
Moving to Slide 15. Profit margins on our development activity have remained remarkably resilient and healthy in this cycle. Thanks to the underlying strength of apartment fundamentals, our sector-leading development and construction capabilities and the decisions we've made about which opportunities to pursue as the cycle matures. Since 2012, our development completions have increased from about $0.5 billion to more than $1 billion. During that time, development yields have been around 7%, while corresponding cap rates for those particular assets have been at or below 5%, resulting in stable profit margins on development in the low 30% range. 
As shown on Slide 16, communities currently in lease-up continue to provide healthy profit margins. For the 12 communities undergoing initial lease-up in 4Q '15, which represent $970 million in total capital cost, the current weighted average monthly rent per home is $115 above initial expectations. 
In terms of yield performance, the weighted average initial projected stabilized yield for these communities is currently 6.7%, or 30 basis points higher than our original projection of 6.4%.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to talk about how we manage risk associated with our development activity. The first way we do so is by maintaining a broadly diversified development pipeline, one that is diversified by geographic regions, by product type and by exposure to urban and suburban submarkets. 
As the chart on Slide 17 illustrate, while our development pipeline remains diversified across regions, future development lies a bias towards infill suburban markets and Midwest products, where rents, construction and land costs are more affordable, development economics are more favorable and the production cycle tends to be faster. Going forward, we expect our development rights pipeline will continue to be an important source of outsized growth in NAV and FFO per share.
Moving to Slide 18. Another way we manage development risk is how we source and structure new development opportunities, with the overwhelming majority being controlled through long-term purchase contracts with modest at-risk deposits and relatively few being controlled through land we purchased and hold on our balance sheet. At the end of 2015, our development rights pipeline consisted of 32 communities, representing $3.4 billion in projected total capital costs. Of these 32 communities, 25 are controlled through purchase contracts, while we own the land in the remaining 7. 
In addition, of these 7 where we own the land, 2 account for approximately $420 million of the $485 million in land held for development on our balance sheet. We expect to begin construction on these 2 community Development Rights, Columbus Circle and Hollywood, in 2016, which would reduce our projected land held for development by year-end 2016 at the lowest level in more than a decade.
A third method which we use to manage development risk is substantially match funding new starts with long-term capital, a topic we've talked about a lot in this cycle. 
On Slide 19, we highlight our funding position against the total projected capital cost of development under way. As you can see, we only need to source about $500 million in long-term capital against the $3.4 billion in development under construction or recently completed, taking into account the $2.2 billion of capital already spent to date, $400 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $350 million of projected annual cash flow from operations after dividends. This means that about 85% of the value creation from ongoing development activity has already been locked in for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 20. We show how being substantially match-funded significantly enhances our growth in EBITDA, while simultaneously enhancing our already sector-leading credit profile, essentially making us similar to an acquisition-oriented REIT from a funding-risk perspective, but with lower leverage and stronger built-in earnings growth. Specifically, the projected EBITDA for recently completed development and from development under construction totals about $216 million, as shown on the chart on the left. This represents about 18% growth in annualized core EBITDA from the fourth quarter. 
Even in a worse case, if all the $480 million of unfunded commitments were funded with new debt, our net debt to core EBITDA would still decline from 4.8x to the mid-4s after taking into account the EBITDA from new development. Of course, our actual net debt to core EBITDA would move around a bit as we source new capital to fund incremental development activity, therefore, this slide isn't meant to communicate that our leverage is going to decrease 4.5x or that our target leverage is 4.5x. 
In fact, our target range for this metric is to be roughly between 5x and 6x. Instead, the purpose in showing this slide is to convey that due to our match funding strategy, we are optimally positioned to benefit from development activity that is expected to be accretive both to earnings and balance sheet strength, and that our credit profile is actually enhanced by our profitable development capabilities given our funding strategy. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim."

I think this outlook is not surprising just given our view that we are midcycle with healthy apartment fundamentals continuing and then just a stable level of deliveries and healthy accretion coming from our development pipeline. 
As we move further into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we are highly focused on managing the investment and funding risk of the business. And as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we're doing this through managing the size and diversity of our pipeline, reducing land inventory, match funding new commitments and maintaining leverage at the low end of our target range.

In terms of the attachment that shows the development pipeline with the projected yield of 6.3%, that is based upon current rents and rents marked to market once we start leasing and you get up to about 20%, 25% occupancy. For those communities that have started construction where there may have been market rent growth and we haven't yet started leasing, we haven't marked any of those to market, just to be clear. And I think you can probably see over the last few years, we've totally been beating the initial pro forma yields by 30 to 50 or 60 basis points just because of a strong market rent growth and the fact that we've been able to bring deals in more or less at budgeted cost. So I think it really is, ultimately -- and if you look at the development pipeline today, the shadow pipeline, the deals that haven't yet started, the economics of that look a lot like what the economics look like on the deals that we've been starting over the last couple of years. So I think a lot of it is going to -- how you would underwrite those would depend upon how you'd underwrite the market ultimately in terms of where we're doing business and how you might underwrite construction costs relative to market rent growth change over the next couple of years."

There's probably a couple of answers to that question. But I guess what I'd probably say based on historical precedent in the markets is the sort of high beta markets, if you want to think about it that way, tend to be the technology markets, so Northern California and Seattle, and to have a greater reaction in rent levels relative to given change in job growth in many of our other markets. So the technology markets are the ones you would be probably most concerned about. That's assuming of course that any reduction in job growth is somewhat proportional. In the past, we've had some losses in the energy sector. It has not had a direct effect on our markets, but there's certainly some indirect effects. As it relates to a reduced amount of capital investment on behalf of those companies, it's going to ripple through the economy.

We don't need to keep creating commitments if we don't think cost-effective capital is available to us in one of our principal funding markets. And I guess the second thing to keep in mind is that we do keep a very strong balance sheet both from a match funding perspective, but also from another dimension, including having low leverage and flatter maturities, so that we have an awful lot of flexibility to deal with sort of an air pocket that might exist where there may be a disruption in capital markets before we've been able to sort of adjust and dial back on new starts. So I think fundamentally, we have great deal of flexibility in the commitments we create and the capital we're going to be able to source from the deal with volatility in the capital markets, and that's how we manage the balance sheet."

So if we had a sudden deceleration in income growth for whatever reason, which is not what's expected, and I think we're seeing that throughout the economy now in terms of pressure on wage growth, then there would become greater constraints on pushing rents further in the future, no doubt about it."

I guess what I'd say is, at this point, you properly identified Northern California as one of the markets where there is probably a little bit of concern about slowing. It's come up a couple of different times. But in terms of markets that has some upside, certainly the Mid-Atlantic is one that has some potential upside in terms of we're at a point in the cycle where we know that supply is. It was about 2% last year; it's going to increase to about 2.5% this year. But more importantly, as we're getting pretty good job growth out of the Mid-Atlantic now up in the low 2% range. And it's starting to have nice effect on occupancy and rent change across the markets here. So the expectation is that there's potential for some upside in the Mid-Atlantic. I would not describe it as opportunistic in that there's significant upside. There is still a fair amount of supply coming. And it's not a sort of high beta market, as I described in the Northern California and Pacific Northwest regions. So you tend to get a moderate recovery. And we are seeing that here in terms of recent trends, where rent change is up about 100 basis points in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of '14, so there's nice momentum there. And then the other market that may have some upside, I'd say, is Boston. Boston has been performing well, job growth has been steady and supply is projected to increase this year relative to 2015. So there's probably a little bit of potential upside in Boston and the Mid-Atlantic, are the 2 that probably stand out the most, I'd say. Southern California has been increasing nicely and we expect that to continue. But I wouldn't think it falls into the potential surprise category like the other 2 do."

In terms of the Greater New York and Jersey market, I mean, if you look at it across the New York City, northern New Jersey, central New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester, it's a pretty diverse geography. A lot of the supply is concentrated in New York City and northern New Jersey. So if you look at Hudson County and then you spread throughout the boroughs, you're going to see that. Supply as a percent of inventory still on Westchester, Long Island, central New Jersey is pretty insignificant. So even though you have greater demand in those markets that identify with greater supply, there's a lid on growth next year as a result of it. So there's not a wide variation. For the most part, New York and Jersey is going to be probably in the mid to high 3% range. There's not one market that's in the low 2s and another one in the 5s, just to give you some perspective, if that helps. It's a pretty tight range."

As it relates to the, I'll call it sort of recent momentum, including the fourth quarter and spillover into early 2016, I'd say the laggard across the metro area has been suburban Maryland. Job growth has been okay, but the supply has been heavy and steady throughout that region, particularly Rockville, North Bethesda, Chevy Chase has been inundated with supply. So it's been the softest. The strongest has been in and around D.C. So D.C. proper as well as the close-in sort of R.B. corridor and things like that, towns and submarkets that are close in to D.C. and then I'd say the rest in Northern Virginia kind of falls into the second place. So you take, call it, the district and the immediate and adjacent submarkets, Northern Virginia and then suburban Maryland being the laggard, is kind of recent conditions. In terms of expected performance in '16, what we have is overall for the Mid-Atlantic, probably in the mid-1% range. And again, it's relatively tight, I'd say. We're talking about the suburban Maryland probably right at the midpoint there. We may see a little bit better performance out of D.C., just given the nature of our specific assets in D.C., which is the Gallery Place, Foxhall, stuff in the Northwest corridor that's older and rent-controlled. When you look at it from a market perspective, I would say, the one thing to be cautious about is the greatest amount of supply to be delivered in 2016 is in the district. So just depending on the distribution of your portfolio within the district really will dictate what your performance is going to be. So the way I think the market would probably look at it is D.C. people would probably expect to be a little bit softer given the nature of the deliveries. Infill suburban submarkets probably in Virginia performing better. And then Western Fairfax, I would say, and suburban Maryland probably being the laggard."

In terms of, again, recent performance rolling forward, I'll try to keep this relatively brief without going on too long here, but where we've started to see some supply impact is in Orange County. Orange County has softened up a little bit. There's a fair amount of supply coming into Irvine. There's some in Laguna Hills. There's supply in Anaheim. There's been supply in Huntington Beach, a little bit in Costa Mesa. So that's softened a little bit, and our expectation for '16 for that market is for it to trial the other regions as well, because of the same issues. San Diego and L.A., we expect a lead going into '16 and continue throughout the year. And for the most part, that's not only the nature of the markets, but how our portfolio is positioned, which is for the most part it's B assets in suburban submarkets across San Diego, which is a relatively small portfolio, but that's where the majority of our assets are located. And in Los Angeles, same thing in terms of distribution of the assets within those submarkets. We don't have any same-store assets in downtown L.A. as an example, which is getting supply now that's equal to double-digit percentages of existing inventory. So you're going to have softness in some of those submarkets, like downtown L.A., where you're getting a heavy amount of new deliveries. So I'd say for '16 overall, you're probably going to see L.A., San Diego leading, and Orange County lagging, just given the nature of our portfolio, but also just from the market perspective in terms of where the supply is concentrated."

We haven't done a lot of acquisitions historically in this cycle. So at this point -- but what we are doing is we're trying to -- we are always looking for opportunities to improve our portfolio where we can, and that happened to be a very unique opportunity there in Hoboken. We weren't per se looking to adding New Jersey on a net basis, but we're always looking to improve our submarket exposure. It's a highly supply-protected submarket. It's one of the few parts of New Jersey we have not been able to penetrate through new development. It's a -- the cap rate is about 5, which is pretty attractive for an asset that's only 7 years old. The average unit size there is about 1,000 square feet. So it's actually more targeted at families and -- than necessarily at young singles, and that's what -- in that part of Hoboken, it's kind of interesting to see how it's evolving in that way as Hoboken kind of matures as a desirable location, not just for people kind of right out of school, but for people -- married couples, be a little bit older as well. There's a supermarket right next door. So it was just a unique opportunity, and we feel like we were able to, based on some unique characteristics of the way the asset was marketed, get it at a price that was more compelling than most of the acquisition opportunities we're seeing."

As we put the slide up there that showed the -- where the average deal was costing about $310,000, just using your data, if you just sort of extrapolated that out using the rent premium that those deals are getting, that would suggest an average value of about $470,000 for that book of business. And when you look at the pipeline, the shadow pipeline, that has an estimated cost of about $350,000 a door today with honestly a bit more urban-oriented product, which probably has a little bit higher rent on average, slightly higher rents. So it's still pretty healthy looking margin based upon what we know today, which are today's rents and today's costs."

Just a couple of things, and probably tax is not an area people are overly eager to get into a deep discussion on, to be sure; we probably can't. There's really 2 issues: One is there's a special dividend obligation associated with the fact that we are a taxpaying entity but for the fact that we have a dividend pay deduction. But there's also excise tax considerations as well. So I think from our standpoint, when we look at using asset sales to fund development, we have a fair bit of running room in terms of being able to sell assets before we have to worry about a special dividend obligation. We would probably more likely encounter a situation where we might have to pay an excise tax, which is sort of a -- a little bit of a 4% tax payment on excess income over distributions. And so it becomes sort of a -- kind of almost like a transaction cost, if you will, that gets added to selling assets to fund development. So we certainly have a reasonable amount of ability to continue to sell assets to fund development, but what we run into first is probably having to pay an excise tax, which is just an extra transaction cost, if you will, which we'd rather not incur if we can avoid it, but it's something that's probably more relevant."

So that's something we have done in the past, and we like that form of capital, though it's far less available today. In terms of 30-year unsecured debt, since we don't have to have -- since we don't currently have it, you have to ask yourself what's it in substitution for? I think probably it's been a little bit more of a compelling equity substitute for those who want more leverage than a compelling substitute for 10-year debt when you do the breakevens. For us, we might be willing to entertain doing it. I guess probably one guiding principle would be if we were to look at the total amount of debt we're going to issue in one year, there's only so much we'd want to issue in the form of 10-year unsecured debt. Before, in a future period, we'd have a more debt coming due than we would prefer, which as we've talked about before, we tried to target having leveled maturities that are on balance less than or equal to our projected amount of dividends. And so if we felt we're going to be issuing a certain amount of debt in the unsecured markets in a given year, that might be more than we want to have coming due in 10 years. We might think about doing the excess in the form of a 30-year note offering."

So there's certainly been pushback in Northern California that's above historical averages. But that's a market where we are seeing pretty significant rent growth in the last 3 years. So you sort of expect that. When someone gets their third 8%, 9%, 10% rent increase, wages have been growing, but then they're not growing that quickly, there's some pushback. But I'd say, as part of the normal process, there's not a significant shift to one direction or another that we're seeing across the portfolio."

Those 2 deals were underwritten in kind of the high-5s based on the rents that were in place when we started those deals. We had not marked either one to market yet.

So if you have the most expensive high-rise in the city, you're going to see some reaction to that. If you -- that's just a macro comment. It sort of depends on when it occurs and what supply is being delivered. As we go into '16, there's more supply concentrated in San Jose than there is in either the East Bay or San Francisco, as an example. That's across San Jose. Now it's concentrated in Northeast San Jose, if you bleed up into Mountain View, certain submarkets; there's about 3 or 4 submarkets there. Up in San Francisco, there's a fair amount of supply being delivered into SoMa. So if you're exposed to SoMa, you're probably going to hurt just as much. So it sort of depends on when in the cycle it occurs and what supply is being delivered at that point in time. But generally speaking in the higher price point, assets tend to suffer first and which tendencies people will migrate as things become more affordable? They'll migrate back towards the end of the city and the cycle kind of repeats itself. So hopefully that provides some broad perspective about what happens in the market."

But generally speaking, right now, within the market footprint, our eaves communities are pretty synonymous with B communities as you referred to Axiometrics or Reis or any of those. And eaves communities tend to be outperforming right now. To give you some perspective, in the fourth quarter for our portfolio, the B assets or the eaves assets, which is, for the most part, B assets, were about 70 basis points ahead of how the A assets were performing. As you go look at Axiometrics, it's a pretty similar pattern there in terms of the outperformance. So this part of the cycle, well-positioned, value-oriented communities are outperforming.

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides that were posted yesterday afternoon, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards",1473,"Yes, thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides that were posted yesterday afternoon, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. 
My comments will focus on providing summary of Q1 results, talk about trends in the apartment market and our portfolio, and lastly, I'll share some thoughts on capital allocation and portfolio management. 
So starting on Slide 4, it was a strong quarter this past quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth of more than 12.5%, fueled by healthy same-store revenue growth of 5.5% and same-store NOI growth of almost 8% as well as contributions coming from our lease-up portfolio from our $2.7 billion development pipeline. As we mentioned last quarter, external growth from investment activities has contributed roughly 45% of core FFO growth over the last 2 years, and it continues to add meaningfully to FFO growth in 2016. We were active on the portfolio management front as well this past quarter, closing at $240 million in acquisitions and almost $0.5 billion in dispositions. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Recent market trends reflect shifting patterns across our footprint. This chart shows year-over-year changes in effective rent for each of our 6 regions for the full market as reported by Axiometrics. A few trends worth noting include first, effective rent growth on the West Coast continues to outpace the East Coast by about 400 basis points, running around 6% in the West and roughly 2% in the East during the quarter. 
Second, the New York, Northern California regions are seeing some deceleration while our other regions remain stable or are improving. New York has been impacted by new supply while Northern California's performance is being driven by a combination of supply, slower job growth than last year at this time and tough year-over-year comps. Southern California, Seattle continue to post strong gains while D.C. is beginning to show modest improvement. 
The last point worth mentioning is that these charts really do demonstrate the apartment cyclical can ebb and flow, similar to what we experienced in the '90s. With deliveries beginning to stabilize, rent growth is likely to bounce around a bit, driven more by the demand side of the equation, including demographic shifts, growth and employment and wages and the pace of household formation. 
Turning to Slide 6. Looking at our portfolio, we can see that the average rent change in the market is consistent with our portfolio, and the overall market trends, it remains healthy in the 4% range. This rate of growth is down from last year but is consistent with our expectations as more supply is coming online this year. In addition, similar to the prior set of charts, our portfolio reflects markets that can be somewhat choppy across the cycle. In fact, just in this cycle, we have seen 3 periods when rent growth has been above the average and 3 when it's been below the average during a time span of less than 6 years. 
Turning to Slide 7. After having trailed in rent growth versus urban submarkets earlier this cycle, suburban submarkets began to outperform over the last couple of years. This trend has been driven by expanding development pipelines in inventory that began to build in many urban submarkets across our region starting in 2013, outpacing suburban deliveries during this time. We believe that this trend of suburban outperformance is likely to continue over the next 2 to 3 years, given that urban deliveries should be about 2x that of the suburbs through 2017. 
As capital allocators and active developers, we've been talking about this over the last couple of years. We began shifting our focus 2 to 3 years ago toward suburban submarkets, particularly in fill areas, where we saw better values and less supply. But, however, just as I mentioned, our market performance can ebb and flow across the cycle by region, the same is true for some markets. As capital flows shift in response to these trends, we'll continue to be opportunistic in search of the most compelling risk-adjusted returns whether they'd be in target suburban or urban submarkets. 
In fact, over our 20-plus year history, we've achieved similar returns in urban and suburban submarkets across our regions. We've been able to do this by taking a fine grain approach to capital allocation, directing new investments to the highest risk-adjusted returns at any particular point in time. 
Now turning to Slide 8. Another capital allocation topic I'd like to touch on relates to our level of development as the cycle matures. This slide depicts realized and estimated unrealized IRRs of development completions sorted by completion dates through 2013. 
Last quarter, we discussed strategies we are deploying to mitigate risk posed by our development efforts, including pipeline diversification, managing land inventory and match funding new commitments. This quarter, we thought it might be helpful to look at how development has performed historically based upon cycle timing and timing of delivery. 
As you can see and might expect, development generates its highest returns during periods of economic expansion, particularly in the early years of expansion, where projects may have been started during the prior downturn or in the early recovery portion of the current cycle. What perhaps is less intuitive is our history of generating healthy returns for projects that delivered during the contraction phase of the cycle and that were most likely started during the latter portion of the prior cycle, a point in time when land and construction costs are generally peaking. 
Across all parts of the cycle, we've been able to comfortably clear our cost of capital and deliver NAV to shareholders through development. My point here is not that development always makes sense but rather, that we can continue to create value through this capability during downturns if deployed in a skillful, rigorous and disciplined way that focuses our efforts and resources on the most compelling opportunities in our markets.
Turning to Slide 9. It stands to reason that as we pursue development in a disciplined manner as the cycle matures, it ought to result in a diminished opportunity set as fewer deals meet required hurdle rates. And in fact, this is the case. Since 2013 while our development pipeline is measured by total capital investment has more or less leveled off, we measured it as a percent of total enterprise value or even by the number of projects, it's declined by roughly 25% to 30%. So we believe that we can continue to create shareholder value through new development at this point in the cycle, albeit at a lesser rate perhaps than earlier in the cycle. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 10. We've been active in the transaction market recently, and I wanted to share a couple of thoughts with respect to our activities in this area of our business. Over the last few months, we've purchased or cleared due diligence on 3 communities totaling over $300 million of total investment. Each of these communities are high-quality assets with high walk scores and great submarkets located in Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia and Hoboken, New Jersey. 
With many merchant built development deals completing and some investment funds unwinding, we are seeing some excellent assets come to market, much of it unencumbered by long-term debt and expensive prepayment penalties. These acquisitions are being funded and turned through asset sale proceeds from fund and wholly-owned dispositions, some of which will trade as 1031 exchanges with the acquisitions. 
As a result, our level of asset sales will be dependent on acquisition volume. As we identify acquisitions that we believe can improve the risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio, we'll pair them with the sale of noncore assets. But overall, we do plan on being a net seller of assets this year. We're just taking advantage of an active market to improve the portfolio. 
So in summary, before opening it up to Q&A, I just like to say that Q1 was another strong quarter for AVB, achieving double-digit growth in core FFO for the fourth consecutive quarter. While we are seeing some moderation in fundamentals and operating trends, they remain healthy. The sector will continue to benefit from favorable demographics and living patterns of millenials and Gen X while new deliveries should begin to stabilize in 2016 at levels that are at or below the structural demand for our apartment housing. As we move into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we'll remain disciplined capital allocators and risk managers, recognizing that we can continue to create meaningful value for shareholders through new development, employing the talent and rigor that we've demonstrated over the several cycles during the last 20-plus years. 
And with that, Aaron, we'd be happy to open up the call for questions."

Overall, based on performance in the first quarter and what we know about the second quarter thus far, we're basically in line with our overall expectations for revenue. New York is a little bit behind, but Southern Cal, Pacific Northwest and the Mid-Atlantic are a little bit ahead, more than offsetting New York. And then the other 2 major regions, Boston and the Northern California region are basically in line with our original budget. In terms of -- to provide a little more color maybe on where we are in terms of recent trends in the first quarter, rent change was 3.7%. It's trended up in April to 4.2%, which is renewals in the mid-5s and move into the high 2s, getting to that 4.2%. And to provide some context when we plan for the year, our expectation is that rent change throughout the year would average about 4.5%, which is down about 120 basis points from what we realized in rent change in 2015. So based on where we are now, moving into the second quarter of the stronger leasing season when rents really start to ramp up, our expectation is pretty consistent with what's happening in the portfolio and particularly if you look towards the stronger season and renewal offers, I think we're in pretty good shape. May and June renewal offers are out in the high 6% range, and that's basically a blend of call it, 5% in the Mid-Atlantic and New York, about 6.5% in Boston, about 8% in Northern Cal and Southern Cal and about 10% in Seattle. So overall, we think we're in pretty good shape. Things are unfolding sort of as we expected, and as we look forward into the rest of the second quarter, we're pretty good position occupancy wise. We're 95 7 at this point, which is about 20 basis points below this point last year, and availability is in the low 5s, about 10 basis points lower over last year. So those numbers we're comfortable with taking on slightly lower occupancy, availability's about right as we start to push rents harder going into the spring season."

Our peers may have been -- I didn't listen to their calls, they may have been focused more in starts, which were obviously would impact maybe '18, '19. And as I mentioned before, I mean, it's not -- we're relatively agnostic between urban and suburban and in terms of just even how we're focusing our efforts if we start to see market value in the urban submarkets, we're going to -- because of some of the trends we're seeing now, we're likely to maybe double back there. So they may be right. You might see some falloff in '18 or '19 if starts in '16 or '17 come down in the urban areas. But certainly, in terms of deliveries, we don't see that at all over the next couple of years."

And the projections for '17 based on pretty much what we know right now in the ground, et cetera. So it can move a little bit but given the time line get things entitled and built, it's not going to move a lot. Some stuff maybe delayed from 1 year to the next but in aggregate, probably not going to move a lot. For '17 deliveries in the urban submarkets around 3%, suburban around 1.4%. That's based on what we know today. The other thing that's out there we probably need to be mindful of just in terms of total supply is there are some things happening both from hard cost perspective as well as the construction lending environment that may constrain that a little bit just universally. So that's something to keep in mind."

I'll speak to that one. It has been a part of our business for a long time, and we had a lot of success in public-private partnerships at certain points in the cycle, including in New York, we have some very successful deals in Queens, in Long Island City Last decade that were somewhat similar. We've done some public-private deals on the West Coast at some transit stations. So it does play well to our competitive advantages, we think, and to some of our strengths, and that deal's actually a good example because we were able to be selective there as a developer even though others may have offered a higher land value because the public authority recognized and respected that given our reputation, given our scale, our balance sheet strength, everything else that we can deliver on our promises. And for them, it's as much about certainty of execution. There are some schools to be built there on that site as well as the project we would own and -- by dealing with and selecting us, they don't have to deal with a private developer who's going to have a separate equity partner or separate lender, separate general contractor. It's an integrated solution. So we have -- we like those deals. That particular deal, it's a pretty exciting location, 96th Street and Second Avenue. It's a full city block. It's right on top of the new Second Avenue subway line, which is, I think, the first new line in the city in many, many, many years. And the timing on that one is such that given the approvals process that's in front of us the regulatory process, that deal actually may well start kind of early into the next cycle, which is based on some of the slide that Tim had shown before, are frequently deals that have very strong returns."

We're doing some enabling work in terms of abatement and demolition. I think as we mentioned before, we still anticipate starting the deal some time mid this year, probably sometime in Q3, late Q3. We are continuing to evaluate different strategies. There are some risks there, including one way that you mentioned by bringing in a retail partner. We still have people who are registered despite some softness on the sides so people are interested in wholesaling some of the building for residential condo as well. The reality is we've been spending time really trying to nail down performance obligations for both sides, and it's ultimately got to work, ultimately for there to be a deal because to the extent we bring in a retail partner, they would have essentially be taking title at the time which we can deliver a cold dark shelf to them. We want to make sure they're going to be there, and they're going to want to make sure we can meet certain performance obligations. And until in effect we're almost ready to start the building, the vertical building construction, we're not going to really be in a position to finalize the deal there. Another strategy -- I mean, in part given the East 96th Street site, we are considering potentially bringing a financial partner to lay off some -- as another way to lay off some risk. The deal that Matt just talked about, it's a large deal, which is over $500 million, excluding the land lease itself, and so and as we think about New York City concentration you may look at either joint venture in Columbus circle or potentially even other avenues to lay off some of the concentration risk in a pretty short investment time period in the city. So just stay tuned. We are exploring a number of sort of risk management strategies with respect to this deal in the overall portfolio there, and we'll keep you people informed as it makes most sense."

So demand has been there. But what you have to keep in mind related to the supply is it's all coming in it's pretty high end, for the most part. And if you think about New York City and even parts of Northern New Jersey, what's going to be delivered this year is about 10,000 units. So there's plenty of demand. The demand may not look the same as what it has in the last cycle in terms of either percentage from the financial sector a very, very high paying levels. So there is probably more diversity of the job growth than what we've experienced in the past, but there has been steady absorption and steady demand in that market."

We average 39 a month through the quarter, which is quite healthy considering it tends to be what one of the lower volume quarters of the year, typically ramps up in the second quarter and third quarter. There are some supply being delivered in that submarket now. There'll be a little bit more as we get further into the year, but velocity and rate have both been quite healthy. So rates holding a little bit above what we expected, around $60 a foot, and it has been good. So our expectation is for that to continue the DoBro product is a pretty unique product. It's been accepted quite well by the target demographic, and so we're pleased with early results."

Our objective is optimize revenue, and so sometimes you're going to get back occupancy to get rate and/or vice versa to try and optimize revenues. So I wouldn't read too much into occupancy changes from quarter-to-quarter or even year-over-year. The only global statement I'd say is over the last couple of years given market conditions, we're more aggressive on rate, all things being equal, at the expense of occupancy across our footprint. And every submarkets a little bit different, but I wouldn't read too much into the sequential quarter or even the year-over-year numbers other than the trend over the last couple of years being more aggressive on the rate side and yielding a little bit more on occupancy has been okay."

So it's an opportunity to take advantage of the fact we have a lot of unencumbered assets, some of which are noncore that we like to -- we like to trade, and there's a point in time in which there's a really attractive assets that we think we can improve the overall quality of the portfolio by turning a little bit of it.

I guess, I'd start by saying on the macro level regionally, the 2 regions where we would seek to redeploy capital the most would be the Mid-Atlantic and Southern California for different reasons, but those were actually kind of more or less on target for our long-term portfolio, geographical allocation goals, but if we're under underallocated anywhere, it's probably those 2 regions. And some of that was, frankly, deliberate. In the case of Mid-Atlantic we sold quite a bit earlier in the cycle kind of in front of what we saw a lot of supply coming relative to the Mid-Atlantic's history. So we think it's a pretty good time to be buying in the Mid-Atlantic. Values haven't increased all that much relative to all of the other geographies in our portfolio, which makes sense because obviously, rents have been relatively flat here for quite a while. So we see just better value in terms of just total relative to replacement cost, relative to cost per foot, cost per unit. In Southern Cal, it's always difficult there. Archstone really was a transformative event for us in terms of growing our Southern California portfolio, but we're still looking to grow there, where we can. In terms of submarket locations, we are looking to upgrade the quality of the portfolio a little bit as Tim mention. So you look at the 3 that we mentioned so far, they are all infill, high-quality, high density infill suburbs we would look in the urban cores as well based on pricing, where we see the best relative value but higher walk scores. And then we have been looking at younger assets, which is a little different for us. We do find sometimes we're a very successful buyer for assets that maybe somebody else has just renovated, 12-, 15-year-old assets, where the value-add players aren't going to bid those up to the same extent. So we look at those types of assets too, but -- and arguably Market Common fit that description a little bit, but we're always looking for ways, where if we can leverage what advantages we have into sometimes it's a unique deal structure that may drive us to get a little bit better value on the buy-side. But typically we would probably be looking for assets that are a little bit younger than what you may have seen us buying in the past. And again..."

We're not directly in the market, but from what we've been able to learn from being active in our dialogue with banks who do these kind of construction financing and certainly what we have heard is construction financing has become tough to obtain as you point out especially for small as well as capitalized developers. Pricing, for example, has moved beyond 300 bps over LIBOR. In order to get better terms, often these developers are needing to partial recourse and sometimes make a commitment to provide permanent financing to the bank. So construction provide higher levels of deposits. So across the board, this has just been a little bit of tightening that we've seen in that end market."

It has picked up steam a little bit, where we are doing around 3% now instead of 2%, which is around low 4s on renewables and 1%, 1.5% on move ins. But as I mentioned earlier, when you look at renewals, I'd say they started to pick up a little more speed, particularly in the suburban submarkets. As I mentioned, New York City still gets around 4%, but it was up quite nicely when you get into the suburban submarkets 5.5%, 6%, 7% depending on where you are. So I'd say the momentum is positive probably most positive in the suburban submarkets as compared to the city."

We did have an expectation that given the increase in supply across the region, which is basically around 3% today as compared to 1.5% last year combined with a somewhat softening in demand, if you remember at this point, last year, job growth across the Bay Area was running around 4% at a pretty blistering pace as compared to about 2% today that we would see softening in performance throughout the year that's pretty much on track. As I mentioned earlier, we're basically our budget in that market. In terms of the performance of the specific some markets, where you're seeing a stronger or weaker results what I'd say is in general, more value-oriented assets are outperforming the higher-end assets across the footprint to the footprint in the Bay Area region overall. In terms of specific some markets, San Francisco, the supplies pretty much Mission Bay kind of SoMa submarket right there and that tends to be a little bit weaker right now. Our assets value-oriented assets Daley City, Pacifica, they're all outperforming versus the higher end Mission bay and SoMa is underperforming. San Jose the supplies Northeast San Jose a little bit of San Jose and then stretches up really into Mountain View is all in terms of supply and then on the east bay, there's not a lot of supply really in the East bay a little bit Dublin and Pleasanton and some product, and online up towards public market Berkeley in that area, but it's de minimis relative to what you're seeing in San Francisco and San Jose.

So I was just confirming that of the $0.06 we beat our initial expectations in the first quarter. $0.04 likely appears to be permanent, and $0.02 is likely to reverse the balance of the year. So to give you an example of that, we received kind of a $0.01 positive variance in the first quarter from a tax rebate that we received in March that we had budgeted to receive in April, so that $0.01 will reverse is the current month. So that's an example that -- the other $0.01 was related to redevelopment OpEx, which was largely due to slight delays in terms of renovation programs that we expect to start, so that will probably reverse ratably over the course of the next 3 quarters."

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides that were posted yesterday afternoon, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards",1470,"Yes, thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides that were posted yesterday afternoon, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. 
My comments will focus on providing summary of Q1 results, talk about trends in the apartment market and our portfolio, and lastly, I'll share some thoughts on capital allocation and portfolio management. 
So starting on Slide 4, it was a strong quarter this past quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth of more than 12.5%, fueled by healthy same-store revenue growth of 5.5% and same-store NOI growth of almost 8%, as well as contributions coming from our lease-up portfolio from our $2.7 billion development pipeline. As we mentioned last quarter, external growth from investment activity has contributed roughly 45% of core FFO growth over the last 2 years, and it continues to add meaningfully to FFO growth in 2016. We were active on the portfolio management front as well this past quarter, closing at $240 million in acquisitions and almost $0.5 billion in dispositions. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Recent market trends reflect shifting patterns across our footprint. This chart shows year-over-year changes in effective rent for each of our 6 regions for the full market as reported by Axiometrics. A few trends worth noting include first, effective rent growth on the West Coast continues to outpace the East Coast by about 400 basis points, running around 6% in the West and roughly 2% in the East during the quarter. 
Second, the New York, Northern California regions are seeing some deceleration, while our other regions remain stable or are improving. New York has been impacted by new supply, while Northern California's performance is being driven by a combination of supply, slower job growth than last year this time and tough year-over-year comps. Southern California, Seattle continue to post strong gains while D.C. is beginning to show modest improvement. 
The last point worth mentioning is that these charts really do demonstrate the apartment cycle can ebb and flow, similar to what we experienced in the '90s. With deliveries beginning to stabilize, rent growth is likely to bounce around a bit, driven more by the demand side of the equation, including demographic shifts, growth in employment and wages and the pace of household formation. 
Turning to Slide 6. Looking at our portfolio, we can see that the average rent change in the market is consistent with our portfolio, and the overall market trends and remains healthy in the 4% range. This rate of growth is down from last year but is consistent with our expectations as more supply is coming online this year. In addition, similar to the prior set of charts, our portfolio reflects markets that can be somewhat choppy across the cycle. In fact, just in this cycle, we have seen 3 periods when rent growth has been above the average and 3 when it's been below the average during a time span of less than 6 years. 
Turning to Slide 7. After having trailed in rent growth versus urban submarkets earlier this cycle, suburban submarkets began to outperform over the last couple of years. This trend has been driven by expanding development pipelines in inventory that began to build in many urban submarkets across our region starting in 2013, outpacing suburban deliveries during this time. We believe that this trend of suburban outperformance is likely to continue over the next 2 to 3 years, given that urban deliveries should be about 2x that of the suburbs through 2017. 
As capital allocators and active developers, we've been talking about this over the last couple of years. We began shifting our focus 2 to 3 years ago toward suburban submarkets, particularly infill areas, where we saw better values and less supply. But, however, just as I mentioned, our market performance can ebb and flow across the cycle by region, the same is true for some markets. As capital flow shift the response to these trends, we'll continue to be opportunistic in search of the most compelling risk-adjusted returns whether they'd be in target suburban or urban submarkets. 
And in fact, over our 20-plus year history, we've achieved similar returns in urban and suburban submarkets across our regions. We've been able to do this by taking a fine grain approach to capital allocation, directing new investments to the highest risk-adjusted returns at any particular point in time. 
Now turning to Slide 8. Another capital allocation topic I'd like to touch on relates to our level of development as the cycle matures. This slide depicts realized and estimated unrealized IRRs of development completions sorted by completion dates through 2013. 
Last quarter, we discussed strategies we are deploying to mitigate risk posed by development efforts, and including pipeline diversification, managing land inventory and match funding new commitments. This quarter, we thought it might be helpful to look at how development has performed historically based upon cycle timing and timing of delivery. 
As you can see and might expect, development generates its highest returns during periods of economic expansion, particularly in the earlier years of expansion, where projects may have been started during the prior downturn or in the early recovery portion of the current cycle. What perhaps is less intuitive is our history of generating healthy returns for projects that delivered during the contraction phase of the cycle and that were most likely started during the latter portion of the prior cycle, a point in time when land and construction costs are generally peaking. 
Across all parts of the cycle, we've been able to comfortably clear our cost of capital and deliver NAV to shareholders through development. My point here is not that development always makes sense but rather, that we can continue to create value through this capability during downturns if deployed in a skillful, rigorous and disciplined way that focuses our efforts and resources on the most compelling opportunities in our markets.
Turning to Slide 9. It stands a reason that as we pursue development in a disciplined manner as the cycle matures, it ought to result in a diminished opportunity set as fewer deals meet required hurdle rates. And in fact, this is the case. Since 2013, while our development pipeline is measured by total capital investment has more or less leveled off, we measure it as a percent of total enterprise value or even by the number of projects, it's declined by roughly 25% to 30%. So we believe that we can continue to create shareholder value through new development at this point in the cycle, albeit at a lesser rate perhaps than earlier in the cycle. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 10. We've been active in the transaction market recently, and I wanted to share a couple of thoughts with respect to our activities in this area of our business. Over the last few months, we've purchased or cleared due diligence on 3 communities totaling over $300 million of total investment. Each of these communities are high-quality assets with high walk scores in great submarkets located in Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia and Hoboken, New Jersey. 
With many merchant built development deals completing and some investment funds unwinding, we are seeing some excellent assets come to market, much of it unencumbered by long-term debt and expensive prepayment penalties. These acquisitions are being funded and turned through asset sale proceeds from fund and wholly-owned dispositions, some of which will trade as 1031 exchanges with acquisitions. 
As a result, our level of asset sales will be dependent on acquisition volume. As we identify acquisitions that we believe can improve the risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio, we'll pair them with the sale of noncore assets. But overall, we do plan on being a net seller of assets this year. We're just taking advantage of an active market to improve the portfolio. 
So in summary, before opening it up to Q&A, I just like to say that Q1 was another strong quarter for AVB, achieving double-digit growth in core FFO for the fourth consecutive quarter. While we are seeing some moderation in fundamentals and operating trends, they remain healthy. The sector will continue to benefit from favorable demographics and living patterns of millenials and Gen X, while new deliveries should begin to stabilize in 2016 at levels that are at or below the structural demand for apartment housing. As we move into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we'll remain disciplined capital allocators and risk managers, recognizing that we can continue to create meaningful value for shareholders through new development, employing the talent and rigor that we've demonstrated over the several cycles during the past 20-plus years. 
And with that, Aaron, we'd be happy to open up the call for questions."

Overall, based on performance in the first quarter and what we know about the second quarter thus far, we're basically in line with our overall expectations for revenue. New York is a little bit behind, but Southern Cal, Pacific Northwest and the Mid-Atlantic are a little bit ahead, more than offsetting New York. And then the other 2 major regions, Boston and the Northern California region are basically in line with our original budget. In terms of -- to provide a little more color maybe on where we are in terms of recent trends in the first quarter, rent change was 3.7%. It's trended up in April to 4.2%, which is renewals in the mid-5s and move-ins in the high 2s, getting to that 4.2%. And to provide some context when we plan for the year, our expectation is that rent change throughout the year would average about 4.5%, which is down about 120 basis points from what we realized in rent change in 2015. So based on where we are now, moving into the second quarter of the stronger leasing season when rents really start to ramp up, our expectation is pretty consistent with what's happening in the portfolio, and particularly if you look towards the stronger season and renewal offers, we think we're in pretty good shape. May and June renewal offers are out in the high 6% range, and that's basically a blend of call it, 5% in the Mid-Atlantic and New York, about 6.5% in Boston, about 8% in Northern Cal and Southern Cal and about 10% in Seattle. So overall, we think we're in pretty good shape. Things are unfolding sort of as we expected. And as we look forward into the rest of the second quarter, we're pretty good position occupancy wise. We're 95 7 at this point, which is about 20 basis points below this point last year, and availability is in the low 5s, about 10 basis points lower over last year. So those are numbers we're comfortable with taking on slightly lower occupancy, availability is about right as we start to push rents harder as going into the spring season."

And as I mentioned before, I mean, it's not -- we're relatively agnostic between urban and suburban and in terms of just even how we're focusing our efforts if we start to see more value in the urban submarkets, we're going to -- because of some of the trends we're seeing now, we're likely to maybe double back there. So they may be right. You might see some falloff in '18 or '19 if starts in '16 or '17 come down in the urban areas. But certainly, in terms of deliveries, we don't see that at all over the next couple of years."

And the projections for '17 based on pretty much what we know right now shovels in the ground, et cetera. So it can move a little bit, but given the time line to get things entitled and built, price is not going to move a lot. Some stuff maybe delayed from 1 year to the next but in aggregate, probably not going to move a lot. For '17 deliveries in the urban submarkets around 3%, and suburban about 1.4%. So that's based on what we know today. The other thing that's out there we probably need to be mindful of just in terms of total supply is there are some things happening both from a hard cost perspective as well as the construction lending environment that may constrain that a little bit just universally. So that's something to keep in mind."

So it does play well to our competitive advantages, we think, and to some of our strengths, and that deal is actually a good example because we were able to be selective there as a developer, even though others may have offered a higher land value because the public authority recognized and respected that given our reputation, given our scale, our balance sheet strength, everything else that we can deliver on our promises. And for them, it's as much about certainty of execution. There are some schools to be built there on that site as well as the project we would own and -- by dealing with and selecting us, they don't have to deal with a private developer who's going to have a separate equity partner or separate lender, separate general contractor. It's an integrated solution. So we have -- we like those deals. That particular deal, it's a pretty exciting location, 96th Street and Second Avenue. It's a full city block. It's right on top of the new Second Avenue subway line, which is, I think, the first new line in the city in many, many, many years. And the timing on that one is such that given the approvals process that's in front of us the regulatory process, that deal actually may well start kind of early into the next cycle, which is based on some of the slides that Tim mentioned before, frequently deals that have very strong returns."

We're doing some enabling work in terms of abatement and demolition. I think as we mentioned before, we still anticipate starting the deal some time mid this year, probably sometime in Q3, late Q3. We are continuing to evaluate different strategies, layoff some risks there, including one way that you mentioned by bringing in a retail partner. We still have people registered despite some softness on the condos side. Some people registered in wholesaling some of the building for residential condo as well. The reality is we've been spending time really trying to nail down performance obligations for both sides, and it's ultimately got to work, ultimately for there to be a deal because to the extent we bring in a retail partner, they would essentially be taking title at the time at which we can deliver a cold dark shelf to them. And we want to make sure they're going to be there, and they're going to want to make sure that we can meet certain performance obligations. And until in effect we're almost ready to start the building, the vertical building construction, we're not going to really be in a position to finalize the deal there. Another strategy -- I mean, in part given the East 96th Street site, we are considering potentially in bringing a financial partner to lay off some -- as another way to lay off some risk. The deal that Matt just talked about, it's a large deal, which is over $500 million, excluding the land lease itself, and so and as we think about New York City concentration we may look at either joint venture in Columbus circle or potentially even other avenues to lay off some of the concentration risk in a pretty short investment time period in the city. So just stay tuned. We are exploring a number of sort of risk management strategies with respect to this deal and their overall portfolio there, and we'll keep you people informed as it makes most sense."

And then if you toss in some shadow supply from condos and things like that, that number might be a little bit higher. The demand side, demand has actually been pretty healthy. Job growth has been steady across the region, and in the, I think, mid-1% range. It's been up in the mid-2s in terms of the city itself. So demand has been there. But what you have to keep in mind related to the supply is it's all coming in at the pretty high end, for the most part. And if you think about New York City and even parts of Northern New Jersey, what's going to be delivered this year is about 10,000 units. So there's plenty of demand. The demand might not look the same as what it has in last cycles in terms of the percentage from the financial sector a very, very high paying levels. So there is probably more diversity of the job growth than what we've experienced in the past. But there has been steady absorption and steady demand in that market."

So you tend to see more softness in late Q4 and Q1 in the suburban submarkets. So that's not a surprise to us in terms of where we ended the first quarter as well as the fourth quarter. But as you look forward and the impact on supply to give you a sense where it's headed, for our portfolio, if you look at renewal offers as we move in through the second quarter, they're in the low 5% range. The weakest is New York City at about 4%. But Long Island is at 6%, Northern New Jersey is at 7%, Central New Jersey is 5.5%. So we do expect those suburban submarkets to pick up steam as we move through the second and third quarter relative to New York City, purely just as a function of supply for the most part.

I guess, I'd start by saying on the macro level regionally, the 2 regions where we would seek to redeploy capital the most would be the Mid-Atlantic and Southern California for different reasons, but those were actually kind of more or less on target for our long-term portfolio, geographical allocation goals, but if we're under underallocated anywhere, it's probably in those 2 regions. And some of that was, frankly, deliberate. In the case of Mid-Atlantic we sold quite a bit here earlier in this cycle kind of in front of what we saw is lot of supply coming relative to the Mid-Atlantic's history. So we think it's a pretty good time to be buying in the Mid-Atlantic. Values haven't increased all that much relative to all of the other geographies in our portfolio, which makes sense because obviously, rents have been relatively flat here for quite a while. So we see just better value in terms of just total relative to replacement cost, relative to cost per foot, cost per unit. And Southern Cal, it's always difficult there. Archstone really was a transformative event for us in terms of growing our Southern California portfolio, but we're still looking to grow there, where we can. In terms of submarket locations, we are looking to upgrade the quality of the portfolio a little bit as Tim mention. So you look at the 3 that we mentioned so far, they are all infill, high-quality, high density infill suburbs we would look in the urban cores as well based on pricing where we see the best relative value, but higher walk scores. And then we have been looking at younger assets, which is a little different for us. We do find sometimes we're a very successful buyer for assets that maybe somebody else has just renovated, 12-, 15-year-old assets, where the value-add players aren't going to bid those up to the same extent. So we look at those types of assets too, but -- and arguably mark your comment fits that description a little bit, but we're always looking for ways where if we can leverage what advantages we have into sometimes its unique deal structure that may drive us to get a little bit better value on the buy-side. But typically we would probably be looking for assets that are a little bit younger than what you may have seen us buying in the past. And again..."

In order to get better terms, often these developers are needing to provide partial recourse and sometimes make a commitment to provide permanent financing to the bank post construction, and sometimes provide higher levels of deposits.

Although I don't remember exactly how deep that goes, and we have looked at that as a downside scenario. We could take their units back and rent them, and we don't think it would be a material change to the economics of that deal. I will also say that it's a very different location. There's no -- you talk about there's a lot of condo supply in New York. It's not in Sheepshead Bay. It's not in Brighton Beach. It's not in that part of Brooklyn at also.

That's up roughly about 75 basis points over last year. I mean, our expectation going forward is that it's probably going to continue to be the softest in the suburban Maryland submarket based on the supply that's being delivered across Rockville and North Bethesda, et cetera, Northern Virginia, probably will be sort of second position, if you want to call it, in terms of performance, and then D.C. based on asset mix that we have, we think will probably be the leading submarket in terms of performance. And keep in mind, what's in our same-store bucket is Northwest, some value-oriented assets, a deal tied to American university, et cetera. So it's a very different kind of same-store math relative to many others. The majority of the supply is actually going to be delivered in the district. So if you looked at it from an entire market perspective, D.C. probably will continue to be soft and potentially as soft as suburban Maryland, but in terms of our specific portfolio and the way it's positioned, the D.C. assets are leading and probably will continue to."

So we've got $50, $60 a foot assets in Midtown West, more value-oriented, but there's more supply there. So they're struggling more as an example. But then you go to Long Island City and it's $50 a foot, $55 a foot, and it's doing 6% year-over-year, and so I wouldn't say there's a common threat to higher-end units underperforming across any of the markets at this point in time, it's really more a direct function of supply in the submarket that you're in."

As I mentioned earlier, we're basically are budget in that market. In terms of the performance of the specific submarkets, where you're seeing stronger or weaker results what I'd say is in general, more value-oriented assets are outperforming the higher-end assets across the footprint. The footprint being the Bay Area region overall. In terms of specific submarkets, San Francisco, the supply is pretty much Mission Bay kind of the SoMa submarket right there. That tends to be a little bit weaker right now. Our assets is value-oriented assets Daly City, Pacifica, [indiscernible] they're all outperforming versus the higher-end day assets Mission Bay and SoMa is underperforming. San Jose that supplies Northeast San Jose a little bit of San Jose and then stretches up really into Mountain View as well in terms of supply. And then on the East Bay, there's not a whole lot of supply really in the East Bay, you have a little bit in Dublin and Pleasanton and some product coming online up towards public market Berkeley in that area, but it's de minimis relative to what you're seeing in San Francisco and San Jose. So hopefully that provides some context for where the supplies coming online."

As you may recall, we sort of we do not provide updated guidance for the full year on our first quarter call. We provide initial outlook, obviously for our fourth quarter call in January, and then we provide a fulsome midyear update after our intentionally our second quarter call. So that's the plan. So we don't have a further update, particularly given that we've got the leasing season in front of us, and we are only a few months from having done a full budget. So no new news on that front. This was the first quarter that we provided guidance on second quarter, and as you can see from our release, at this point of our guidance for NAREIT FFO is $2.10 per share and for core FFO is $2 per share. So that's -- and then in terms of what we did in the first quarter as you know from our release, we beat our initial expectation by $0.06, which is probably the largest beat on our expectations in a quarterly basis in recent memory. So quite strong performance, it was about probably $0.04 of that $0.06 beat likely to be permanent and $0.02 likely to reverse at some point over the course of the year."

At the time we indicated that, that would likely come through unsecured debt an asset sales with unsecured debt hopefully and likely comprising the majority of that $1.1 billion. So really, it's the $1.1 billion less whatever we do in unsecured debt that would represent the net disposition activity, but it certainly represents a minority of that $1.1 billion. In terms of what we've done so far, as you can see, essentially, the acquisitions that we completed in the first quarter were basically funded through fund in wholly-owned asset sales and the assumed debt in Hoboken. So going forward, for the balance of the year, we expect that just sort of still about $1.1 billion, and again the expectation is predominantly in the form of unsecured debt with the balance through net disposition activity."

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides that were posted yesterday afternoon, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards",1470,"Yes, thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides that were posted yesterday afternoon, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. 
My comments will focus on providing summary of Q1 results, talk about trends in the apartment market and our portfolio, and lastly, I'll share some thoughts on capital allocation and portfolio management. 
So starting on Slide 4, it was a strong quarter this past quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth of more than 12.5%, fueled by healthy same-store revenue growth of 5.5% and same-store NOI growth of almost 8%, as well as contributions coming from our lease-up portfolio from our $2.7 billion development pipeline. As we mentioned last quarter, external growth from investment activity has contributed roughly 45% of core FFO growth over the last 2 years, and it continues to add meaningfully to FFO growth in 2016. We were active on the portfolio management front as well this past quarter, closing at $240 million in acquisitions and almost $0.5 billion in dispositions. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Recent market trends reflect shifting patterns across our footprint. This chart shows year-over-year changes in effective rent for each of our 6 regions for the full market as reported by Axiometrics. A few trends worth noting include first, effective rent growth on the West Coast continues to outpace the East Coast by about 400 basis points, running around 6% in the West and roughly 2% in the East during the quarter. 
Second, the New York, Northern California regions are seeing some deceleration, while our other regions remain stable or are improving. New York has been impacted by new supply, while Northern California's performance is being driven by a combination of supply, slower job growth than last year this time and tough year-over-year comps. Southern California, Seattle continue to post strong gains while D.C. is beginning to show modest improvement. 
The last point worth mentioning is that these charts really do demonstrate the apartment cycle can ebb and flow, similar to what we experienced in the '90s. With deliveries beginning to stabilize, rent growth is likely to bounce around a bit, driven more by the demand side of the equation, including demographic shifts, growth in employment and wages and the pace of household formation. 
Turning to Slide 6. Looking at our portfolio, we can see that the average rent change in the market is consistent with our portfolio, and the overall market trends and remains healthy in the 4% range. This rate of growth is down from last year but is consistent with our expectations as more supply is coming online this year. In addition, similar to the prior set of charts, our portfolio reflects markets that can be somewhat choppy across the cycle. In fact, just in this cycle, we have seen 3 periods when rent growth has been above the average and 3 when it's been below the average during a time span of less than 6 years. 
Turning to Slide 7. After having trailed in rent growth versus urban submarkets earlier this cycle, suburban submarkets began to outperform over the last couple of years. This trend has been driven by expanding development pipelines in inventory that began to build in many urban submarkets across our region starting in 2013, outpacing suburban deliveries during this time. We believe that this trend of suburban outperformance is likely to continue over the next 2 to 3 years, given that urban deliveries should be about 2x that of the suburbs through 2017. 
As capital allocators and active developers, we've been talking about this over the last couple of years. We began shifting our focus 2 to 3 years ago toward suburban submarkets, particularly infill areas, where we saw better values and less supply. But, however, just as I mentioned, how market performance can ebb and flow across the cycle by region, the same is true for sub markets. As capital flow shift the response to these trends, we'll continue to be opportunistic in search of the most compelling risk-adjusted returns whether they be in target suburban or urban submarkets. 
And in fact, over our 20-plus year history, we've achieved similar returns in urban and suburban submarkets across our regions. We've been able to do this by taking a fine grain approach to cap allocation, directing new investments to the highest risk-adjusted returns at any particular point in time. 
Now turning to Slide 8. Another cap allocation topic I'd like to touch on relates to our level of development as the cycle matures. This slide depicts realized and estimated unrealized IRRs of development completions sorted by completion dates through 2013. 
Last quarter, we discussed strategies we are deploying to mitigate risk posed by development efforts, and including pipeline diversification, managing land inventory and match funding new commitments. This quarter, we thought it might be helpful to look at how development has performed historically based upon cycle timing and timing of delivery. 
As you can see and might expect, development generates its highest returns during periods of economic expansion, particularly in the earlier years of expansion, where projects may have been started during the prior downturn or in the early recovery portion of the current cycle. What perhaps is less intuitive is our history of generating healthy returns for projects that delivered during the contraction phase of the cycle and that were most likely started during the latter portion of the prior cycle, a point in time when land and construction costs are generally peaking. 
Across all parts of the cycle, we've been able to comfortably clear our cost of capital and deliver NAV to shareholders through development. My point here is not that development always makes sense but rather, that we can continue to create value through this capability during downturns if deployed in a skillful, rigorous and disciplined way that focuses our efforts and resources on the most compelling opportunities in our markets.
Turning to Slide 9. It stands to reason that as we pursue development in a disciplined manner as the cycle matures, it ought to result in a diminished opportunity set as fewer deals meet required hurdle rates. And in fact, this is the case. Since 2013, while our development pipeline is measured by total capital investment has more or less leveled off, we measure it as a percent of total enterprise value or even by the number of projects, it's declined by roughly 25% to 30%. So we believe that we can continue to create shareholder value through new development at this point in the cycle, albeit at a lesser rate perhaps than earlier in the cycle. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 10. We've been active in the transaction market recently, and I wanted to share a couple of thoughts with respect to our activities in this area of our business. Over the last few months, we've purchased or cleared due diligence on 3 communities totaling over $300 million of total investment. Each of these communities are high-quality assets with high walk scores in great submarkets located in Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia and Hoboken, New Jersey. 
With many merchant built development deals completing and some investment funds unwinding, we are seeing some excellent assets come to market, much of it unencumbered by long-term debt and expensive prepayment penalties. These acquisitions are being funded and turned through asset sale proceeds from fund and wholly-owned dispositions, some of which will trade as 1031 exchanges with acquisitions. 
As a result, our level of asset sales will be dependent on acquisition volume. As we identify acquisitions that we believe can improve the risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio, we'll pair them with the sale of noncore assets. But overall, we do plan on being a net seller of assets this year. We're just taking advantage of an active market to improve the portfolio. 
So in summary, before opening it up to Q&A, I just like to say that Q1 was another strong quarter for AVB, achieving double-digit growth in core FFO for the fourth consecutive quarter. While we are seeing some moderation in fundamentals and operating trends, they remain healthy. The sector will continue to benefit from favorable demographics and living patterns of millenials and Gen X, while new deliveries should begin to stabilize in 2016 at levels that are at or below the structural demand for apartment housing. As we move into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we'll remain disciplined cap allocators and risk managers, recognizing that we can continue to create meaningful value for shareholders through new development, employing the talent and rigor that we've demonstrated over the several cycles during the past 20-plus years. 
And with that, Aaron, we'd be happy to open up the call for questions."

Overall, based on performance in the first quarter and what we know about the second quarter thus far, we're basically in line with our overall expectations for revenue. New York is a little bit behind, but Southern Cal, Pacific Northwest and the Mid-Atlantic are a little bit ahead, more than offsetting New York. And then the other 2 major regions, Boston and the Northern California region are basically in line with our original budget. In terms of -- to provide a little more color maybe on where we are, in terms of recent trends in the first quarter, rent change was 3.7%. It's trended up in April to 4.2%, which is renewals in the mid-5s and move-ins in the high 2s, getting to that 4.2%. And to provide some context when we plan for the year, our expectation is that rent change throughout the year would average about 4.5%, which is down about 120 basis points from what we realized in rent change in 2015. So based on where we are now, moving into the second quarter of the stronger leasing season when rents really start to ramp up, our expectation is pretty consistent with what's happening in the portfolio, and particularly if you look towards the stronger season and renewal offers, we think we're in pretty good shape. May and June renewal offers are out in the high 6% range, and that's basically a blend of call it, 5% in the Mid-Atlantic and New York, about 6.5% in Boston, about 8% in Northern Cal and Southern Cal and about 10% in Seattle. So overall, we think we're in pretty good shape. Things are unfolding sort of as we expected. And as we look forward into the rest of the second quarter, we're pretty good position occupancy wise. We're 95 7 at this point, which is about 20 basis points below this point last year, and availability is in the low 5s, about 10 basis points lower over last year. So those are numbers we're comfortable with taking on slightly lower occupancy, availability is about right as we start to push rents harder as going into the spring season."

So they may be right. You might see some falloff in '18 or '19 if starts in '16 or '17 come down in the urban areas.

And the projections for '17 based on pretty much what we know right now shovels in the ground, et cetera. So it can move a little bit, but given the time line to get things entitled and built, price is not going to move a lot. Some stuff maybe delayed from 1 year to the next but in aggregate, probably not going to move a lot. For '17 deliveries in the urban submarkets around 3%, and suburban about 1.4%. So that's based on what we know today. The other thing that's out there we probably need to be mindful of just in terms of total supply is there are some things happening both from a hard cost perspective as well as the construction lending environment that may constrain that a little bit just universally. So that's something to keep in mind."

It has been a part of our business for a long time, and we had a lot of success in public-private partnerships at certain points in the cycle, including in New York, we have some very successful deals in Queens, in Long Island City. Last decade they were somewhat similar. We've done some public-private deals on the West Coast at some transit stations. So it does play well to our competitive advantages, we think, and to some of our strengths, and that deal is actually a good example because we were able to be selective there as a developer, even though others may have offered a higher land value because the public authority recognized and respected that given our reputation, given our scale, our balance sheet strength, everything else that we can deliver on our promises. And for them, it's as much about certainty of execution. There are some schools to be built there on that site as well as the project we would own and -- by dealing with and selecting us, they don't have to deal with a private developer who's going to have a separate equity partner or separate lender, separate general contractor. It's an integrated solution. So we have -- we like those deals. That particular deal, it's a pretty exciting location, 96th Street and Second Avenue. It's a full city block. It's right on top of the new Second Avenue subway line, which is, I think, the first new line in the city in many, many, many years. And the timing on that one is such that, given the approvals process that's in front of us the regulatory process, that deal actually may well start kind of early into the next cycle, which is based on some of the slides that Tim mentioned before, frequently deals that have very strong returns."

We're doing some enabling work in terms of abatement and demolition. I think as we mentioned before, we still anticipate starting the deal some time mid this year, probably sometime in Q3, late Q3. We are continuing to evaluate different strategies, layoff some risks there, including one way that you mentioned by bringing in a retail partner. We still have people registered despite some softness on the condos side. Some people registered in wholesaling some of the building for residential condo as well. The reality is we've been spending time really trying to nail down performance obligations for both sides, and it's ultimately got to work, ultimately for there to be a deal because to the extent we bring in a retail partner, they would essentially be taking title at the time at which we can deliver a cold, dark shell to them. And we want to make sure they're going to be there, and they're going to want to make sure that we can meet certain performance obligations. And until in effect we're almost ready to start the building, the vertical building construction, we're not going to really be in a position to finalize the deal there. Another strategy -- I mean, in part given the East 96th Street site, we are considering potentially in bringing a financial partner to lay off some -- as another way to lay off some risk. The deal that Matt just talked about, it's a large deal, which is over $500 million, excluding the land lease itself, and so and as we think about New York City concentration we may look at either joint venture in Columbus Circle or potentially even other avenues to lay off some of the concentration risk in a pretty short investment time period in the city. So just stay tuned. We are exploring a number of sort of risk management strategies with respect to this deal and their overall portfolio there, and we'll keep people informed as it makes most sense."

But what you have to keep in mind related to the supply is it's all coming in at the pretty high end, for the most part. And if you think about New York City and even parts of Northern New Jersey, what's going to be delivered this year is about 10,000 units. So there's plenty of demand.

So it's an opportunity to take advantage of the fact we have a lot of unencumbered assets, some of which are noncore that we like to trade, and there's a point in time in which there's some really attractive assets that we think we can improve the overall quality of the portfolio by turning a little bit of it. So it's a little bit of a unique moment in time, we think. But in terms of -- Matt, in terms of where we're seeing some of the best opportunities, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit there."

I guess, I'd start by saying on the macro level regionally, the 2 regions where we would seek to redeploy capital the most would be the Mid-Atlantic and Southern California for different reasons, but those were actually kind of more or less on target for our long-term portfolio, geographical allocation goals, but if we're under under-allocated anywhere, it's probably in those 2 regions. And some of that was, frankly, deliberate. In the case of Mid-Atlantic we sold quite a bit here earlier in this cycle kind of in front of what we saw is lot of supply coming relative to the Mid-Atlantic's history. So we think it's a pretty good time to be buying in the Mid-Atlantic. Values haven't increased all that much relative to all of the other geographies in our portfolio, which makes sense because obviously, rents have been relatively flat here for quite a while. So we see just better value in terms of just total relative to replacement cost, relative to cost per foot, cost per unit. And Southern Cal, it's always difficult there. Archstone really was a transformative event for us in terms of growing our Southern California portfolio, but we're still looking to grow there, where we can. In terms of submarket locations, we are looking to upgrade the quality of the portfolio a little bit as Tim mentioned. So you look at the 3 that we mentioned so far, they are all infill, high-quality, high density infill suburbs we would look in the urban cores as well based on pricing where we see the best relative value, but higher walk scores. And then we have been looking at younger assets, which is a little different for us. We do find sometimes we're a very successful buyer for assets that maybe somebody else has just renovated, 12-, 15-year-old assets, where the value-add players aren't going to bid those up to the same extent. So we look at those types of assets too, but -- and arguably Market Common [ph] fits that description a little bit, but we're always looking for ways where if we can leverage what advantages we have into sometimes its unique deal structure that may drive us to get a little bit better value on the buy-side. But typically we would probably be looking for assets that are a little bit younger than what you may have seen us buying in the past. And again..."

In terms of overall performance, I think it's fair to say that the assets have outperformed our expectations in terms of a period of ownership here. And then on top of that, the other thing I would add is there's probably more opportunity in the portfolio in terms of redevelopment, repositioning those assets than we probably expected going in. Archstone did a fine job maintaining the assets, but given the balance sheet they had and the position they were tied into with Lehman, just didn't necessarily have the capital to invest in the assets to reposition them. So we're trying to take advantage of that opportunity across the footprint, including significant concentration that we did acquire in Southern California. So net-net, I'd say we're pleased with our results from Archstone, and values have grown considerably during the last couple of years."

Pricing, for example, has moved beyond 300 bps over LIBOR. In order to get better terms, often these developers are needing to provide partial recourse and sometimes make a commitment to provide permanent financing to the bank post construction, and sometimes provide higher levels of deposits. So across the board, there's just been a little bit of tightening that we've seen in that end market."

That's up roughly about 75 basis points over last year. And our expectation going forward is that it's probably going to continue to be the softest in the suburban Maryland submarket based on the supply that's being delivered across Rockville and North Bethesda, et cetera, Northern Virginia, probably will be sort of second position, if you want to call it, in terms of performance, and then D.C. based on asset mix that we have, we think will probably be the leading submarket in terms of performance. And keep in mind, what's in our same-store bucket is Northwest, some value-oriented assets, a deal tied to American University, et cetera. So it's a very different kind of same-store math relative to many others. The majority of the supply is actually going to be delivered in the district.

First maybe to set some context for Northern California when we provided guidance earlier this year, and Tim alluded to it on today's prepared remarks for the call as well. We did have an expectation that given the increase in supply across the region, which is basically around 3% today as compared to 1.5% last year combined with a somewhat softening in demand, if you remember at this point, last year, job growth across the Bay Area was running around 4%, a pretty blistering pace as compared to about 2% today that we would see softening in performance throughout the year and that's pretty much on track. As I mentioned earlier, we're basically on budget in that market. In terms of the performance of the specific submarkets, where you're seeing stronger or weaker results what I'd say is in general, more value-oriented assets are outperforming the higher-end assets across the footprint. The footprint being the Bay Area region overall. In terms of specific submarkets, San Francisco, the supply is pretty much Mission Bay kind of the SoMa submarket right there. That tends to be a little bit weaker right now. Our assets is value-oriented assets Daly City, Pacifica, [indiscernible] they're all outperforming versus the higher-end day assets Mission Bay and SoMa is underperforming. San Jose that supplies Northeast San Jose a little bit south of San Jose and then stretches up really into Mountain View as well in terms of supply. And then on the East Bay, there's not a whole lot of supply really in the East Bay, you have a little bit in Dublin and Pleasanton and some product coming online up towards Public Market, Berkeley in that area, but it's de minimis relative to what you're seeing in San Francisco and San Jose. So hopefully that provides some context for where the supplies coming online."

So really, it's the $1.1 billion less whatever we do in unsecured debt that would represent the net disposition activity, but it certainly represents a minority of that $1.1 billion. In terms of what we've done so far, as you can see, essentially, the acquisitions that we completed in the first quarter were basically funded through fund in wholly-owned asset sales and the assumed debt in Hoboken. So going forward, for the balance of the year, we expect that just sort of still about $1.1 billion, and again the expectation is predominantly in the form of unsecured debt with the balance through net disposition activity."

So overall, I think we're in pretty good shape. In terms of move outs due to rent increases, it's down about 100 basis points last year. Some markets were down than others, but in general comfortable with where we are."

We do have a couple of deals, which are mixed-use deals in our pipeline, including one that we expect to start here later this year in Northern California in Emeryville, which also we think plays to our strengths not dissimilar to the deal we did within here in Northern Virginia, Assembly Rail up in Boston, which we did with federal. So we have a few deals like that in the pipeline, but it's really -- it's pretty diverse. It's diverse by region. It's diverse by deal type.

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides that were posted yesterday afternoon, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards",1470,"Yes, thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides that were posted yesterday afternoon, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. 
My comments will focus on providing summary of Q1 results, talk about trends in the apartment market and our portfolio, and lastly, I'll share some thoughts on capital allocation and portfolio management. 
So starting on Slide 4, it was a strong quarter this past quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth of more than 12.5%, fueled by healthy same-store revenue growth of 5.5% and same-store NOI growth of almost 8%, as well as contributions coming from our lease-up portfolio from our $2.7 billion development pipeline. As we mentioned last quarter, external growth from investment activity has contributed roughly 45% of core FFO growth over the last 2 years, and it continues to add meaningfully to FFO growth in 2016. We were active on the portfolio management front as well this past quarter, closing at $240 million in acquisitions and almost $0.5 billion in dispositions. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Recent market trends reflect shifting patterns across our footprint. This chart shows year-over-year changes in effective rent for each of our 6 regions for the full market as reported by Axiometrics. A few trends worth noting include first, effective rent growth on the West Coast continues to outpace the East Coast by about 400 basis points, running around 6% in the West and roughly 2% in the East during the quarter. 
Second, the New York, Northern California regions are seeing some deceleration, while our other regions remain stable or are improving. New York has been impacted by new supply, while Northern California's performance is being driven by a combination of supply, slower job growth than last year this time and tough year-over-year comps. Southern California, Seattle continue to post strong gains while D.C. is beginning to show modest improvement. 
The last point worth mentioning is that these charts really do demonstrate the apartment cycle can ebb and flow, similar to what we experienced in the '90s. With deliveries beginning to stabilize, rent growth is likely to bounce around a bit, driven more by the demand side of the equation, including demographic shifts, growth in employment and wages and the pace of household formation. 
Turning to Slide 6. Looking at our portfolio, we can see that the average rent change in the market is consistent with our portfolio, and the overall market trends and remains healthy in the 4% range. This rate of growth is down from last year but is consistent with our expectations as more supply is coming online this year. In addition, similar to the prior set of charts, our portfolio reflects markets that can be somewhat choppy across the cycle. In fact, just in this cycle, we have seen 3 periods when rent growth has been above the average and 3 when it's been below the average during a time span of less than 6 years. 
Turning to Slide 7. After having trailed in rent growth versus urban submarkets earlier this cycle, suburban submarkets began to outperform over the last couple of years. This trend has been driven by expanding development pipelines in inventory that began to build in many urban submarkets across our region starting in 2013, outpacing suburban deliveries during this time. We believe that this trend of suburban outperformance is likely to continue over the next 2 to 3 years, given that urban deliveries should be about 2x that of the suburbs through 2017. 
As capital allocators and active developers, we've been talking about this over the last couple of years. We began shifting our focus 2 to 3 years ago toward suburban submarkets, particularly infill areas, where we saw better values and less supply. But, however, just as I mentioned, how market performance can ebb and flow across the cycle by region, the same is true for sub markets. As capital flow shift the response to these trends, we'll continue to be opportunistic in search of the most compelling risk-adjusted returns whether they be in target suburban or urban submarkets. 
And in fact, over our 20-plus year history, we've achieved similar returns in urban and suburban submarkets across our regions. We've been able to do this by taking a fine grain approach to cap allocation, directing new investments to the highest risk-adjusted returns at any particular point in time. 
Now turning to Slide 8. Another cap allocation topic I'd like to touch on relates to our level of development as the cycle matures. This slide depicts realized and estimated unrealized IRRs of development completions sorted by completion dates through 2013. 
Last quarter, we discussed strategies we are deploying to mitigate risk posed by development efforts, and including pipeline diversification, managing land inventory and match funding new commitments. This quarter, we thought it might be helpful to look at how development has performed historically based upon cycle timing and timing of delivery. 
As you can see and might expect, development generates its highest returns during periods of economic expansion, particularly in the earlier years of expansion, where projects may have been started during the prior downturn or in the early recovery portion of the current cycle. What perhaps is less intuitive is our history of generating healthy returns for projects that delivered during the contraction phase of the cycle and that were most likely started during the latter portion of the prior cycle, a point in time when land and construction costs are generally peaking. 
Across all parts of the cycle, we've been able to comfortably clear our cost of capital and deliver NAV to shareholders through development. My point here is not that development always makes sense but rather, that we can continue to create value through this capability during downturns if deployed in a skillful, rigorous and disciplined way that focuses our efforts and resources on the most compelling opportunities in our markets.
Turning to Slide 9. It stands to reason that as we pursue development in a disciplined manner as the cycle matures, it ought to result in a diminished opportunity set as fewer deals meet required hurdle rates. And in fact, this is the case. Since 2013, while our development pipeline is measured by total capital investment has more or less leveled off, we measure it as a percent of total enterprise value or even by the number of projects, it's declined by roughly 25% to 30%. So we believe that we can continue to create shareholder value through new development at this point in the cycle, albeit at a lesser rate perhaps than earlier in the cycle. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 10. We've been active in the transaction market recently, and I wanted to share a couple of thoughts with respect to our activities in this area of our business. Over the last few months, we've purchased or cleared due diligence on 3 communities totaling over $300 million of total investment. Each of these communities are high-quality assets with high walk scores in great submarkets located in Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia and Hoboken, New Jersey. 
With many merchant built development deals completing and some investment funds unwinding, we are seeing some excellent assets come to market, much of it unencumbered by long-term debt and expensive prepayment penalties. These acquisitions are being funded and turned through asset sale proceeds from fund and wholly-owned dispositions, some of which will trade as 1031 exchanges with acquisitions. 
As a result, our level of asset sales will be dependent on acquisition volume. As we identify acquisitions that we believe can improve the risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio, we'll pair them with the sale of noncore assets. But overall, we do plan on being a net seller of assets this year. We're just taking advantage of an active market to improve the portfolio. 
So in summary, before opening it up to Q&A, I just like to say that Q1 was another strong quarter for AVB, achieving double-digit growth in core FFO for the fourth consecutive quarter. While we are seeing some moderation in fundamentals and operating trends, they remain healthy. The sector will continue to benefit from favorable demographics and living patterns of millennials and Gen X, while new deliveries should begin to stabilize in 2016 at levels that are at or below the structural demand for apartment housing. As we move into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we'll remain disciplined cap allocators and risk managers, recognizing that we can continue to create meaningful value for shareholders through new development, employing the talent and rigor that we've demonstrated over the several cycles during the past 20-plus years. 
And with that, Aaron, we'd be happy to open up the call for questions."

Overall, based on performance in the first quarter and what we know about the second quarter thus far, we're basically in line with our overall expectations for revenue. New York is a little bit behind, but Southern Cal, Pacific Northwest and the Mid-Atlantic are a little bit ahead, more than offsetting New York. And then the other 2 major regions, Boston and the Northern California region are basically in line with our original budget. In terms of -- to provide a little more color maybe on where we are, in terms of recent trends in the first quarter, rent change was 3.7%. It's trended up in April to 4.2%, which is renewals in the mid-5s and move-ins in the high 2s, getting to that 4.2%. And to provide some context when we plan for the year, our expectation is that rent change throughout the year would average about 4.5%, which is down about 120 basis points from what we realized in rent change in 2015. So based on where we are now, moving into the second quarter of the stronger leasing season when rents really start to ramp up, our expectation is pretty consistent with what's happening in the portfolio, and particularly if you look towards the stronger season and renewal offers, we think we're in pretty good shape. May and June renewal offers are out in the high 6% range, and that's basically a blend of call it, 5% in the Mid-Atlantic and New York, about 6.5% in Boston, about 8% in Northern Cal and Southern Cal and about 10% in Seattle. So overall, we think we're in pretty good shape. Things are unfolding sort of as we expected. And as we look forward into the rest of the second quarter, we're pretty good position occupancy wise. We're 95 7 at this point, which is about 20 basis points below this point last year, and availability is in the low 5s, about 10 basis points lower over last year. So those are numbers we're comfortable with taking on slightly lower occupancy, availability is about right as we start to push rents harder as going into the spring season."

So they may be right. You might see some falloff in '18 or '19 if starts in '16 or '17 come down in the urban areas. But certainly, in terms of deliveries, we don't see that at all over the next couple of years."

And the projections for '17 based on pretty much what we know right now shovels in the ground, et cetera. So it can move a little bit, but given the time line to get things entitled and built, price is not going to move a lot. Some stuff maybe delayed from 1 year to the next but in aggregate, probably not going to move a lot. For '17 deliveries in the urban submarkets around 3%, and suburban about 1.4%. So that's based on what we know today. The other thing that's out there we probably need to be mindful of just in terms of total supply is there are some things happening both from a hard cost perspective as well as the construction lending environment that may constrain that a little bit just universally. So that's something to keep in mind."

I guess, I'll speak to that one. It has been a part of our business for a long time, and we had a lot of success in public-private partnerships at certain points in the cycle, including in New York, we have some very successful deals in Queens, in Long Island City. Last decade they were somewhat similar. We've done some public-private deals on the West Coast at some transit stations. So it does play well to our competitive advantages, we think, and to some of our strengths, and that deal is actually a good example because we were able to be selective there as a developer, even though others may have offered a higher land value because the public authority recognized and respected that given our reputation, given our scale, our balance sheet strength, everything else that we can deliver on our promises. And for them, it's as much about certainty of execution. There are some schools to be built there on that site as well as the project we would own and -- by dealing with and selecting us, they don't have to deal with a private developer who's going to have a separate equity partner or separate lender, separate general contractor. It's an integrated solution. So we have -- we like those deals. That particular deal, it's a pretty exciting location, 96th Street and Second Avenue. It's a full city block. It's right on top of the new Second Avenue subway line, which is, I think, the first new line in the city in many, many, many years. And the timing on that one is such that, given the approvals process that's in front of us the regulatory process, that deal actually may well start kind of early into the next cycle, which is based on some of the slides that Tim mentioned before, frequently deals that have very strong returns."

We're doing some enabling work in terms of abatement and demolition. I think as we mentioned before, we still anticipate starting the deal some time mid this year, probably sometime in Q3, late Q3. We are continuing to evaluate different strategies, layoff some risks there, including one way that you mentioned by bringing in a retail partner. We still have people registered despite some softness on the condos side. Some people registered in wholesaling some of the building for residential condo as well. The reality is we've been spending time really trying to nail down performance obligations for both sides, and it's ultimately got to work, ultimately for there to be a deal because to the extent we bring in a retail partner, they would essentially be taking title at the time at which we can deliver a cold, dark shell to them. And we want to make sure they're going to be there, and they're going to want to make sure that we can meet certain performance obligations. And until in effect we're almost ready to start the building, the vertical building construction, we're not going to really be in a position to finalize the deal there. Another strategy -- I mean, in part given the East 96th Street site, we are considering potentially in bringing a financial partner to lay off some -- as another way to lay off some risk. The deal that Matt just talked about, it's a large deal, which is over $500 million, excluding the land lease itself, and so and as we think about New York City concentration we may look at either joint venture in Columbus Circle or potentially even other avenues to lay off some of the concentration risk in a pretty short investment time period in the city. So just stay tuned.

It's about -- our expectation for this year is about 2% of inventory, but in New York city proper, it's about 3.5% direct supply. And then if you toss in some shadow supply from condos and things like that, that number might be a little bit higher. The demand side, demand has actually been pretty healthy. Job growth has been steady across the region, and in the, I think, mid-1% range. It's been up in the mid-2s in terms of the city itself. So demand has been there. But what you have to keep in mind related to the supply is it's all coming in at the pretty high end, for the most part. And if you think about New York City and even parts of Northern New Jersey, what's going to be delivered this year is about 10,000 units. So there's plenty of demand. The demand may not look the same as what it has in last cycles in terms of the percentage from the financial sector a very, very high paying levels. So there is probably more diversity of the job growth than what we've experienced in the past. But there has been steady absorption and steady demand in that market."

So in terms of New York, one thing to keep in mind there is the suburban submarkets in the Northeast in general, including New York and then moving up into New England, are more seasonal. So you tend to see more softness in late Q4 and Q1 in the suburban submarkets. So that's not a surprise to us in terms of where we ended the first quarter as well as the fourth quarter. But as you look forward and the impact on supply to give you a sense where it's headed, for our portfolio, if you look at renewal offers as we move in through the second quarter, they're in the low 5% range. The weakest is New York City at about 4%. But Long Island is at 6%, Northern New Jersey is at 7%, Central New Jersey is 5.5%. So we do expect those suburban submarkets to pick up steam as we move through the second and third quarter relative to New York City, purely just as a function of supply for the most part. So we expect it'll play out that way in New York overall based on what we know today."

So I wouldn't read too much into occupancy changes from quarter-to-quarter or even year-over-year.

And every submarket is a little bit different, but I wouldn't read too much into the sequential quarter or even the year-over-year numbers other than the trend over the last couple of years being more aggressive on the rate side and yielding a little bit more on occupancy has been okay."

So it's an opportunity to take advantage of the fact we have a lot of unencumbered assets, some of which are noncore that we like to trade, and there's a point in time in which there's some really attractive assets that we think we can improve the overall quality of the portfolio by turning a little bit of it. So it's a little bit of a unique moment in time, we think. But in terms of -- Matt, in terms of where we're seeing some of the best opportunities, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit there."

I guess, I'd start by saying on the macro level regionally, the 2 regions where we would seek to redeploy capital the most would be the Mid-Atlantic and Southern California for different reasons, but those were actually kind of more or less on target for our long-term portfolio, geographical allocation goals, but if we're under under-allocated anywhere, it's probably in those 2 regions. And some of that was, frankly, deliberate. In the case of Mid-Atlantic we sold quite a bit here earlier in this cycle kind of in front of what we saw is lot of supply coming relative to the Mid-Atlantic's history. So we think it's a pretty good time to be buying in the Mid-Atlantic. Values haven't increased all that much relative to all of the other geographies in our portfolio, which makes sense because obviously, rents have been relatively flat here for quite a while. So we see just better value in terms of just total relative to replacement cost, relative to cost per foot, cost per unit. And Southern Cal, it's always difficult there. Archstone really was a transformative event for us in terms of growing our Southern California portfolio, but we're still looking to grow there, where we can. In terms of submarket locations, we are looking to upgrade the quality of the portfolio a little bit as Tim mentioned. So you look at the 3 that we mentioned so far, they are all infill, high-quality, high density infill suburbs we would look in the urban cores as well based on pricing where we see the best relative value, but higher walk scores. And then we have been looking at younger assets, which is a little different for us. We do find sometimes we're a very successful buyer for assets that maybe somebody else has just renovated, 12-, 15-year-old assets, where the value-add players aren't going to bid those up to the same extent. So we look at those types of assets too, but -- and arguably Market Common [ph] fits that description a little bit, but we're always looking for ways where if we can leverage what advantages we have into sometimes its unique deal structure that may drive us to get a little bit better value on the buy-side. But typically we would probably be looking for assets that are a little bit younger than what you may have seen us buying in the past. And again..."

And then on top of that, the other thing I would add is there's probably more opportunity in the portfolio in terms of redevelopment, repositioning those assets than we probably expected going in. Archstone did a fine job maintaining the assets, but given the balance sheet they had and the position they were tied into with Lehman, just didn't necessarily have the capital to invest in the assets to reposition them. So we're trying to take advantage of that opportunity across the footprint, including significant concentration that we did acquire in Southern California.

In order to get better terms, often these developers are needing to provide partial recourse and sometimes make a commitment to provide permanent financing to the bank post construction, and sometimes provide higher levels of deposits.

That's up roughly about 75 basis points over last year. And our expectation going forward is that it's probably going to continue to be the softest in the suburban Maryland submarket based on the supply that's being delivered across Rockville and North Bethesda, et cetera, Northern Virginia, probably will be sort of second position, if you want to call it, in terms of performance, and then D.C. based on asset mix that we have, we think will probably be the leading submarket in terms of performance. And keep in mind, what's in our same-store bucket is Northwest, some value-oriented assets, a deal tied to American University, et cetera. So it's a very different kind of same-store math relative to many others. The majority of the supply is actually going to be delivered in the district. So if you looked at it from an entire market perspective, D.C. probably will continue to be soft and potentially as soft as suburban Maryland, but in terms of our specific portfolio and the way it's positioned, the D.C. assets are leading and probably will continue to."

As I mentioned earlier, we're basically on budget in that market. In terms of the performance of the specific submarkets, where you're seeing stronger or weaker results what I'd say is in general, more value-oriented assets are outperforming the higher-end assets across the footprint.

That tends to be a little bit weaker right now. Our assets is value-oriented assets Daly City, Pacifica, [indiscernible] they're all outperforming versus the higher-end day assets Mission Bay and SoMa is underperforming. San Jose that supplies Northeast San Jose a little bit south of San Jose and then stretches up really into Mountain View as well in terms of supply. And then on the East Bay, there's not a whole lot of supply really in the East Bay, you have a little bit in Dublin and Pleasanton and some product coming online up towards Public Market, Berkeley in that area, but it's de minimis relative to what you're seeing in San Francisco and San Jose.

I guess essentially what you're asking for is what's our net disposition activity. We don't provide that level of guidance, because essentially that would be, as you recall when we provided our outlook for 2016, we indicated that we anticipated sourcing external capital of about $1.1 billion. At the time we indicated that, that would likely come through unsecured debt an asset sales with unsecured debt hopefully and likely comprising the majority of that $1.1 billion. So really, it's the $1.1 billion less whatever we do in unsecured debt that would represent the net disposition activity, but it certainly represents a minority of that $1.1 billion. In terms of what we've done so far, as you can see, essentially, the acquisitions that we completed in the first quarter were basically funded through fund in wholly-owned asset sales and the assumed debt in Hoboken. So going forward, for the balance of the year, we expect that just sort of still about $1.1 billion, and again the expectation is predominantly in the form of unsecured debt with the balance through net disposition activity."

We do have a couple of deals, which are mixed-use deals in our pipeline, including one that we expect to start here later this year in Northern California in Emeryville, which also we think plays to our strengths not dissimilar to the deal we did within here in Northern Virginia, Assembly Rail up in Boston, which we did with federal. So we have a few deals like that in the pipeline, but it's really -- it's pretty diverse. It's diverse by region. It's diverse by deal type.

I'll provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. My comments",1368,"Yes. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our second quarter call. With me today is Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. 
My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q2 and year-to-date results, our revised midyear outlook for 2016, our view regarding the trajectory and durability of the current apartment cycle and, lastly, a look at how current development activity is contributing to our earnings growth. 
So starting on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth greater than 8.5% from a combination of healthy same-store revenue and NOI growth of 5% and contributions from new lease-ups as we completed almost $200 million at a projected yield of just under 7%. Year-to-date core FFO is up over 10%, again driven by a combination of internal growth from the stabilized portfolio and external growth from stabilizing development. For the first half of the year, our same-store portfolio performs in line with budget although a bit ahead in Q1 and a little behind in Q2. I'll discuss this trend a little more in a couple of minutes. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our  updated outlook for the year. In short, overall expectations for core FFO are in line with our original outlook, which call for core FFO growth of 9%. Our projection for same-store NOI growth has been trimmed by about 40 basis points or approximately $0.03 per share for the full year but is offset by contributions from other categories such as our full year outlook for core FFO remains unchanged. Our projected investment and funding activity for the year remains more or less in line with our original expectations with some minor variances. 
Turning now to Slide 6. We thought we'd provide a little more color regarding our outlook for the same-store portfolio in the second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we performed in line with expectations for the first half of the year, although in Q2, we did experience the -- we did not experience the seasonal strain and effective rent growth that we're accustomed to seeing. This trend appears to be largely demand-driven as economic and job growth fell short of expectations for the first half of the year, and declining business confidence in investment no doubt was a contributing factor as recent uncertainty in global events have left businesses hesitant to make new commitments. 
Turning to Slide 7. Slower economic growth impacts corporate and transient demands, which helps fuel seasonal strength in the second and third quarters for our business. The weaker corporate and transient demand affects us in 2 ways: first, a reduction in premium income, which typically runs 50% to 60% higher per lease; and secondly, an effective increase in market vacancy as, in fact, inventories are essentially added back to the market. 
Turning to Slide 8. As economic conditions have moderated over the last 2 or 3 quarters, effective rent growth in our same-store portfolio, expressed as like term rent change, has remained in the 4% range over the last 6 to 7 months. And while like term rent change did improve modestly in Q2, we did not see the same seasonal lift we've seen in prior years so far this cycle. 
And turning to Slide 9, of course, performance does vary across our regions. Effective rent growth has moderated, most notably, in Northern California and the Northeast while Seattle and the Mid-Atlantic have been trending up. Rent growth in Southern California remains healthy in the 6% range. 
Turning to Slide 10. As you might expect, these trends are impacting our outlook for portfolio performance for the year. Again, in the Northeast and Northern California has fallen short of projected budget, while in Seattle and D.C. are expected to outperform. Overall, the net impact is resulting in a reduction of same-store revenue of almost 40 basis points for the full year with all of that expect the shortfall to occur in the second half of the year. 
Now turning now to Slide 11. Just given trends in the operating environment, we thought we'd just revisit where we think we are in the cycle. We still believe that fundamentals point mostly in favor of an extended cycle much like we saw in the 1990s. As you see on this chart, consumer confidence remains on solid footing at cyclically higher levels, and young adults are doing their best in leading the way. 
Turning to Slide 12. Consumer confidence is being shaped in large part by an improved employment picture with jobless claims continuing their fall since the cycle began and job openings now outpacing hiring activities. And as you can see on Slide 13, the growing strength in the labor market seems to finally be putting pressure on wages as evidenced by recent AVP reports. And combined with reduced debt burdens and stronger balance sheet you see on Chart 2, the consumer's in good shape and getting stronger which bodes well for continued economic growth given their contribution to GDP. 
Turning to Slide 14. In addition, renter demand should continue to be supported by favorable demographics with the largest segment of millennials in the early to mid-20s still moving into their prime household formation and renting years. Obviously, demographics have been a major driver of renter demand this past cycle, and they should continue to support healthy rental demand over the next 5-plus years even if homeownerships begin to stabilize -- I'm sorry homeownership rates begin to stabilize as the leading-edge millennials begin to consider buying a home. 
Turning to Slide 15. The supply side of the equation is currently as well. Apartment deliveries are expected to beat nationally in 2016 and '17 as permitting for new projects has slowed down over the last 2 to 3 quarters from the cyclical highs in 2015. This is due in part to tightening credit for multifamily construction, which has become much more pronounced over the last couple of quarters. 
Turning to Slide 16. In addition to the apartment sector remaining in balance, the picture for the overall housing market looks positive as well. Projections for new housing production are in line with household formation over the next 4 years, but it's important to note that, first, these figures -- these supply figures ignore obsolescence or destruction of roughly 400,000 units per year, and they also assume that housing production over the next 4 years increases by 30% from its current level and roughly doubles what we've seen so far on average this cycle. 
So overall, while we may be seeing economic growth moderate a bit, we don't see any real tangible sign that the apartment or housing cycle was nearing its end. Rather, we are still seeing solid demand growth matched by what we believe is greenfield levels of new supply to meet that demand. 
Turning to Slide 17. Within this operating environment, one where demand and supply are expected to remain in balance, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth from our development platform. So far, this cycle, we've completed over $4 billion of new development and initial stabilized yields on average of around 7% are well in excess of our marginal cost of capital during this time, which has contributed to strong core FFO growth over the last few years. 
And finally turning to Slide 18. Development should continue to drive solid external growth going forward as development underway, along with non-stabilized recent completions, should generate another $200 million of NOI with less than $400 million of capital required to complete this basket of $3.3 billion of assets. With these assets projected to yield low above our marginal cost of capital, most of which has already been raised, we're positioned to deliver industry-leading external growth over the next 2 to 3 years. 
So in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year for Avalonbay, and we believe that the company is very well positioned from an investment and funding perspective to outperform going forward. 
And with that, Augusta, we'd like to open the call for questions."

In terms of New England, first, it's typically more seasonal than most of our markets. And if you look at what's happened throughout the year, rent change started in the year in the mid-2% range and it's trended up to about 3.5%, but it's running well below both last year's rate of about 5% and our initial expectations. I think it's largely a result of 2 things. One is job growth, and the first 5 or 6 months of the year has been somewhat disappointing at an annualized rate of about 1.5 points relative to expectations closer to about 2% for the full year. And also the transient demand that Tim referred to has been pretty weak in Boston this year, which put downward pressure on rental rates in the late spring and the early summer. So in terms of New England, that's kind of what's happening there. And then as it relates to Seattle, Seattle, for the most part, is all about demand. And the first half of the year, job growth is running in the mid-4% range. I think most forecasters that we rely on had projected a slowdown in hiring in the Seattle market and it has not slowed down. There's still plenty of supply, about 3.5% of inventory, but the surprise has been on the demand side in terms of job growth. There's still softness in the sort of urban poor of Seattle. We don't have many assets there. We only have 2 operating assets in those submarkets. But if you move out to the north end and you moved to [indiscernible] and you move to Bellevue, revenue growth is still relatively robust. And I think the difference between Seattle and Northern California in terms of what you're seeing in performance is you really have some well-established, large well-capitalized companies driving the hiring in the tech sector in Seattle as compared to allow the small businesses to make up the greater share of employment in Northern California that are more to susceptible to changes in funding [indiscernible] the D.C. market and what's happening with IPO, valuations, et cetera. So that's really what's been helping Seattle is really the job growth."

And then secondly, we're just not getting the same level of judgment but what we were seeing just based on some new judgments in certain courts. And then thirdly is we did have one corporate housing provider kind of go belly up on us. There's only 15 homes that have represented a couple of months of rent.

And I think what you're seeing there, particularly in New York City, which I'm including Northern New Jersey and kind of this general description of the geography at this point, is while there's been steady job growth, there's just not enough high paying jobs being created to absorb all the new supply. It's all being delivered at the high end of the market.

That's still very healthy rent growth for our business. So we're not necessarily calling for a reacceleration to cyclical highs, but we're not -- we don't think it's over yet. And again, it's one of the reasons why we compare it to the '90s. If you go back to the '90s, you just sort of chart what rent growth and revenue growth look like. It moved around from year to year based upon what was happening in that particular year from an economic activity standpoint. It does ebb and flow a bit and that's just the way the economies work.

And so I don't know that there's a great story in Southern California in terms of whether there's a deceleration other than the job environment. If you look at it, we had a little bit of a boost in the Los Angeles region, particularly Samford and Novelli in the first half of the year as a result of some one-off issue, which was a gas leak in that area that drove some initial demand in the first quarter. It boosted occupancy but we've given that back in the second quarter. So there's a little bit of a lift in the first quarter and first half as a result of that. So that's partly reflected in a deceleration, I guess, if you want to call it as you look to the second half relative to the first half. But it's basically performing on plan. Los Angeles is healthy. Orange County has been slightly choppy but still relatively healthy. We've got some supply coming in to Anaheim, Irvine and Huntington Beach, a little bit of choppiness but for the most part, the product is being absorbed. And then San Diego just continues to perform quite well. So I don't know that there's any unusual story coming out of Southern California other than slightly lower job growth and then the sort of one-time business the we we received in the first half of the year from the gas leak that occurred."

The top-down sort of comes from other sources, whether it'd be REITs, Axiometrics or certain local market providers like Delta Associates as an example here in D.C. or others in other markets. So we take that, but then we also do sort of a ground-up assessment. We have a market research team here in Arlington that scrubs all the local websites [indiscernible] municipalities in our market to understand where certain deals are in the processing for entitlement and what the expected delivery dates are. In addition to that, our local development team, where we have a 3 to 4 people per office around the country, is tracking all the development in their markets as they're competing for sites and expected opportunities in their markets. And in addition for the development teams, the last growth in our process is through the operations team where they now [indiscernible] beginning to pre-lease to better predict when deliveries are expected to arrive in certain submarkets and if we need to alter our revenue management strategy ahead of deliveries coming.

Another one was the deal in Northern New Jersey, in Union, which yes, we haven't seen any new supply in many years. And frequently, we find deposit price on rents when we serve in communities like that. And the third one was in Irvine.

So it's a little more -- as I mentioned earlier, the 2000s is a little bit more of a kind of a straight up and then straight down curve to rent growth. It kind of kept going up and then until it hit.

I'm going to try to address some of those comments and then we can just follow up in greater detail if you're interested. Wanting to give the a sense, in Northern California, first, to give you some perspective from an overall standpoint, rent change started the year around 6% but it's continued to decelerate and it's currently running around 4%. And that's made up of about 2.2% in San Francisco, 6% in the East Bay and the low 4% range in San Jose. So that's kind of where we are now. If you look at -- if you want to kind of decompose that even more into the [indiscernible] and like-term rent change by market, wanted to get that to you separately, so we're going to spend a lot of time on that. But I think it's fair to say that San Francisco is [indiscernible] at this point so just to address that one. Rent change at this point on move-ins is essentially just barely positive, 50 basis points to 100 basis points kind of range. We continue to hold renewals sort of in the low and mid-4% range. So you're talking about anywhere from 2.5% to 3.5% sort of numbers on a blended basis in San Francisco. Those numbers are certainly better in the East Bay and San Jose as I mentioned currently. But in terms of it reaching the bottom and flattening out, as I mentioned in response to a prior question, we still expect continued deliveries, pretty heavy level in San Francisco throughout this year and then even increasing into next year. So performance -- really rent change is going to depend on the level of demand, and job growth has been decelerating there. So to the extent that we see job growth level off, that would certainly help. But I think really your forecast for job growth is going to dictate performance in 2017 and where that levels off or not. Certainly as you get beyond '17, given the nature of the product that's constructed in San Francisco, supply should start to fall off, but we do expect it to be somewhat challenging through 2017 in San Francisco specifically."

As you move down into Orange County, you do see supply fall off a little bit in Anaheim from 16 to '17. And as it relates to Irvine, Irvine is actually projected to increase as you move in to '17 as a result of some deliveries by a handful of developers but, in particular, a couple of large projects that will be delivered by the Irvine company, so increase there and then a modest reduction in Huntington Beach. And then Huntington Beach is kind of 2 anchors on the supply. There's a fair amount of product being delivered right at the mall at Beach Boulevard and 405, but there's other communities, up a couple of communities under development down at South Pacific city which is down along down Pacific Coast Highway there in Huntington Beach.

And it's really played out in terms of -- if you look at on a granular level it really comes down to the monthly sequential change in GDP. And what we've seen in both like-term rent change, as well as the transient and corporate component, is it's just not compounding as great a rate as it was at this time last year. So to give you some perspective as an example, if you looked at the change in GP on a monthly basis last year, we're talking about for the second quarter on a monthly basis moving up at 60 basis points in April, 100 basis points in May and about 110 basis points in June versus this year, those numbers were 30 basis points, 60 basis points and 90 basis points. Some of that is a reflection of the transient demand that we mentioned earlier, Tim alluded to in his prepared remarks, which sort of turbocharge GDP growth in the late second quarter and early third quarter that we're not seeing this year. So that's certainly part of it."

I'll provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. My comments",1369,"Yes. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our second quarter call. With me today is Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. 
My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q2 and year-to-date results, our revised midyear outlook for 2016, our view regarding the trajectory and durability of the current apartment cycle, and lastly, a look at how current development activity is contributing to our earnings growth. 
So starting on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth greater than 8.5% from a combination of healthy same-store revenue and NOI growth of 5% and contributions from new lease-ups, as we completed almost $200 million at a projected yield of just under 7%. Year-to-date, core FFO was up over 10%, again driven by a combination of internal growth from the stabilized portfolio and external growth from stabilizing development. For the first half of the year, our same-store portfolio performs in line with budget, although a bit ahead of budget in Q1 and a little behind in Q2. I'll discuss this trend a little more in a couple of minutes. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our updated outlook for the year. In short, overall expectations for core FFO are in line with our original outlook, which call for core FFO growth of 9%. Our projection for same-store NOI growth has been trimmed by about 40 basis points or approximately $0.03 per share for the full year, but is offset by contributions from other categories, such that our full year outlook for core FFO remains unchanged. Our projected investment and funding activity for the year remains more or less in line with our original expectation with some minor variances. 
Turning now to Slide 6. We thought we'd provide a little more color regarding our outlook for the same-store portfolio in the second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we performed in line with expectations for the first half of the year, although in Q2, we did experience the -- we did not experience the seasonal strength and effective rent growth that we're accustomed to seeing. This trend appears to be largely demand-driven, as economic and job growth fell short of expectations for the first half of the year, and declining business confidence in investment, no doubt, was a contributing factor as recent uncertainty in global events have left businesses hesitant to make new commitments. 
Turning to Slide 7. Slower economic growth impacts corporate and transient demand, which helps fuel seasonal strength in the second and third quarters for our business. A weaker corporate and transient demand affects us in 2 ways: first, a reduction in premium income, which typically runs 50% to 60% higher per lease; and secondly, an effective increase in market vacancy as, in fact, inventories essentially added back to the market. 
Turning to Slide 8. As economic conditions have moderated over the last 2 or 3 quarters, effective rent growth in our same-store portfolio, expressed as like-term rent change, has remained in the 4% range over the last 6 to 7 months. And while like-term rent change did improve modestly in Q2, we did not see the same seasonal lift we've seen in prior years so far this cycle. 
And turning to Slide 9, of course, performance does vary across our regions. Effective rent growth has moderated, most notably, in Northern California and the Northeast, while Seattle and the Mid-Atlantic have been trending up. Rent growth in Southern California remains healthy in the 6% range. 
Turning to Slide 10. As you might expect, these trends are impacting our outlook for portfolio performance for the year. Again, the Northeast and Northern California fallen short of projected budget, while in Seattle and D.C. are expected to outperform. Overall, the net impact is resulting in a reduction of same-store revenue of almost 40 basis points for the full year with all of that expect a shortfall to occur in the second half of the year. 
Now turning now to Slide 11. Just given trends in the operating environment, we thought we'd just revisit where we think we are in the cycle. We still believe that fundamentals point mostly in favor of an extended cycle much like we saw in the 1990s. As you see on this chart, consumer confidence remains on solid footing at cyclically high levels, and young adults are feeling the best and leading the way. 
Turning to Slide 12. Consumer confidence is being shaped in large part by an improved employment picture with jobless claims continuing their fall since the cycle began and job openings now outpacing hiring activities. And as you can see on Slide 13, the growing strength in the labor market seems to finally be putting pressure on wages as evidenced by recent ADP reports. And combined with reduced debt burdens and stronger balance sheets you see on Chart 2, the consumer are in good shape and getting stronger, which bodes well for continued economic growth given their contribution to the GP. 
Turning to Slide 14. In addition, renter demand should continue to be supported by favorable demographics with the largest segment of millennials in the early to mid-20s still moving into their prime household formation and renting years. Obviously, demographics have been a major driver of renter demand this past cycle, and they should continue to support healthy rental demand over the next 5-plus years, even if homeownerships begin to stabilize -- I'm sorry, homeownership rates begin to stabilize, as the leading-edge of millennials begin to consider buying a home. 
Turning to Slide 15. The supply side of the equation is encouraging as well. Apartment deliveries are expected to peak nationally in 2016 and '17, as permitting for new projects has slowed down over the last 2 to 3 quarters from the cyclical highs in 2015. This is due in part to tightening credit for multifamily construction, which has become much more pronounced over the last couple of quarters. 
Turning to Slide 16. In addition to the apartment sector remaining in balance, the picture for the overall housing market looks positive as well. Projections for new housing production are in line with household formation over the next 4 years, but it's important to note that, first, these figures -- these supply figures ignore obsolescence or destruction of roughly 400,000 units per year, and they also assume that housing production over the next 4 years increases by 30% from its current level and roughly doubles what we've seen so far on average this cycle. 
So overall, while we may be seeing economic growth moderate a bit, we don't see any real tangible signs that the apartment or housing cycle was nearing its end. Rather, we are still seeing solid demand growth matched by what we believe is reasonable levels of new supply to meet that demand. 
Turning to Slide 17. Within this operating environment, one, where demand and supply are expected to remain in balance, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth from our development platform. So far, this cycle, we've completed over $4 billion of new development and initial stabilized yields on average of around 7% are well in excess of our marginal cost of capital during this time, which has contributed to strong core FFO growth over the last few years. 
And finally turning to Slide 18. Development should continue to drive solid external growth going forward as development underway, along with nonstabilized recent completions, should generate another $200 million of NOI with less than $400 million of capital required to complete this basket of $3.3 billion of assets. With these assets projected to yield low above our marginal cost of capital, most of which has already been raised, we are positioned to deliver industry-leading external growth over the next 2 to 3 years.

In terms of New England, first, it's typically more seasonal than most of our markets. And if you look at what's happened throughout the year, rent change started the year in the mid-2% range and it's trended up to about 3.5%, but it's running well below both last year's rate of about 5% and our initial expectations. I think, it's largely a result of 2 things. One is job growth, and the first 5 or 6 months of the year has been somewhat disappointing at an annualized rate of about 1.5 points relative to expectations closer to about 2% for the full year. And then also the transient demand that Tim referred to has been pretty weak in Boston this year, which put downward pressure on rental rates in the late spring and the early summer. So in terms of New England, that's kind of what's happening there. And then as it relates to Seattle, Seattle, for the most part, it's all about demand. And the first half of the year, job growth is running in the mid-4% range. I think most forecasters that we rely on had projected a slowdown in hiring in the Seattle market and it has not slowed down. There's still plenty of supply, about 3.5% of inventory, but the surprise has been on the demand side in terms of job growth. There's still softness in the sort of urban core of Seattle. We don't have many assets there. We really have 2 operating assets in those submarkets. But if you move out to the Northern, you move to Redmond, you move to Bellevue, revenue growth is still relatively robust. And I think the difference between Seattle and Northern California in terms of what you're seeing in performance is, you really have some well-established, large, well-capitalized companies driving the hiring in the tech sector in Seattle as compared to allow the smaller businesses that make up a greater share of employment in Northern California that are more susceptible to changes in funding tied to the VC market and what's happening with IPO, evaluations, et cetera. So that's really what's been helping Seattle is really the job growth."

And our policy is to write things off after a certain period of time. If we collect it later, it'll be an offset, but we're writing things off more rapidly. And then secondly is, we're just not getting the same level of judgments that we were seeing just based on some new judges in certain courts. And then thirdly is, we did have one corporate housing provider kind of go belly up on us. There's only 15 homes that have represented a couple of months of rent.

And while we've had a good progress on renewal rent change, which is in the low 4% range, move-in rent change remains pretty stubbornly low at around 1.5%. It hasn't really improved much through the second quarter or into July. And I think what you're seeing there, particularly in New York City, which I'm including Northern New Jersey and kind of this general description of the geography at this point, is while there's been steady job growth, there is just not enough high paying jobs being created to absorb all the new supply. It's all being delivered at the high end of the market. And if you look at the performance, particularly recent performance of the suburban markets in and around New York are performing better than the City. We're seeing rent growth in New York City to sort of in the mid-2% range. But as you move into Long Island and Northern and Central New Jersey, we get up to the 3% to 4% and even 5% in Central Jersey over the last quarter. So, in general, I'd say the supply is weighing most heavily on the New York City market so, including the boroughs and Northern New Jersey, and we're seeing better performance out of the suburban submarkets."

So in many cases, we're marking the market rents, but in some cases, where you think it might be an aberration for a short period of time, you might use a concession as opposed to reducing the rent.

Job growth has been off about 50 basis points from what we have projected. I just think this is less economic activity and job growth, you have a little less household formation. But having said that, as we said in our management letter, we do expect rent change to be in the 3% to 4% range through the balance of the year. That is at or above trend, long-term trend. That's still very healthy rent growth for our business. So we're not necessarily calling for a reacceleration to cyclical highs, but we are not -- we don't think it's over yet. And again, it's one of the reasons why we compare it to the '90s. If you go back to the '90s and you just sort of chart what rent growth and revenue growth look like, it moved around from year-to-year based upon what was happening in that particular year from an economic activity standpoint. It does ebb and flow a bit and that's just the way economies work. We don't see the kind of distortions that you might expect to see. You see some weakness, but you don't see the kind of distortions that you might expect to see that results in a lot of dislocation and ultimately leads to negative economic growth and recession."

And so, I don't know that there is a great story in Southern California in terms of whether it's a deceleration other than the job environment. l mean, if you look at it, we had a little bit of a boost in the Los Angeles region, particularly, Stamford and [indiscernible] in the first half of the year as a result of just some one-off issue, which was a gas leak in that area that drove some initial demand in the first quarter. It boosted occupancy, but we've given that back in the second quarter. So there was a little bit of a lift in the first quarter and first half as a result of that. So that's partly reflected in a deceleration, I guess, if you want to call it, as you look to the second half relative to the first half, but it's basically performing on plan. Los Angeles is healthy. Orange County has been slightly choppy but still relatively healthy. You've got some supply coming in to Anaheim, Irvine and Huntington Beach, creates a little bit of choppiness, but for the most part, the product is being absorbed. And then san Diego just continues to perform quite well.

But if you look at San Francisco specifically, we're expecting it to increase again in 2017 from 3.1% of inventory in '16 to 3.4% in 2017. So you do need to look at the composition of the different markets within that region to determine what's happening.

The top-down sort of comes from other sources, whether it'd be REITs, Axiometrics or certain local market providers, like Delta Associates as an example here in D.C. or others in other markets. So we take that, but then we also do sort of a ground-up assessment. We have a market research team here in Arlington that scrubs all the local websites through the municipalities in our market to understand where certain deals are in their processing for entitlements and what the expected delivery dates are. In addition to that, our local development team, where we have 3 to 4 people per office around the country, is tracking all the development in their markets, as they are competing for sites and expected opportunities in their markets. And then in addition to the development teams, the last growth in our process is through the operations team where they know what's beginning to pre-lease to better predict when deliveries are expected to arrive in certain submarkets, and if we need to alter our revenue management strategy ahead of deliveries coming. So it's a pretty thorough process from a top-down and a bottoms-up perspective, as compared to just looking at the REITs data and saying that's what we expect. So I think our process is probably more robust than average, but given our capability and development, how important it is to our business, we just give a lot of scrutiny."

One of them was on Capitol Hill in Seattle, which is our first asset in that submarket, which has just exceeded expectations, obviously, with a big runoff in rents since we started that deal 2-plus years ago. Another one was the deal in Northern New Jersey, in Union, which hadn't seen any new supply in many years. And frequently, we find a positive surprise on rents when we lease-up in communities like that. And the third one was in Irvine. So the basket moves around from quarter-to-quarter, but I think year-to-date, it's in the kind of 6.3%-ish range. So, obviously, completed the prior quarter little bit lower yielding, some of those were in -- one of those is large deal in Southern Cal, which tends to have lower yields. So it's going to generally move around, but we are continuing to see yields, obviously, beat the initial underwriting on the strength of good rent growth."

So you had a lot more demand destruction in the case of rental housing than you did actually in the 2000s where you have job losses that were actually 3x what we had in the early 2000s. But we saw sort of the typical pattern where rentership rates actually went up during recession. So it's a little more -- as I mentioned earlier -- and the 2000s has little bit more of a kind of a straight up and then straight down curve to rent growth.

I waned to try to address some of those comments and we can always follow up with greater detail if you're interested. Wanting to give you a sense that in Northern California, first, give you some perspective from an overall standpoint, rent change started the year around 6%, but it's continued to decelerate and it's currently running around 4%. And that's made up of about 2.5% in San Francisco, 6% in the East Bay and the low 4% range in San Jose. So that's kind of where we are now. If you look at -- if you want to kind of decompose that even more into the new move-ins and like-term rent change by market, wanted to get that to you separately, so we're not going to consume a lot of time on that. But I think it's fair to say that San Francisco is probably the softest at this point, so just to address that one. Rent change at this point on move-ins is essentially just barely positive, 50 basis points to 100 basis points kind of range. We continue to hold renewals sort of in the low- to mid-4% range. So you're talking about anywhere from 2.5% to 3.5% sort of numbers on a blended basis in San Francisco. Those numbers are certainly better in the East Bay and San Jose, as I mentioned currently. But in terms of it reaching the bottom and flattening out, as I mentioned in a response to a prior question, we still expect continued deliveries at a pretty heavy level in San Francisco throughout this year and then even increasing into next year. So performance -- really rent change is going to depend on the level of demand and job growth has been decelerating there. So to the extent that we see job growth level off, that would certainly help. But I think really your forecast for job growth is going to dictate performance in 2017 and whether that levels off or not. Certainly as you get beyond '17, given the nature of the product that's constructed in San Francisco, supply should start to fall off, but we do expect it to be somewhat challenging through 2017 in San Francisco specifically."

In particular, it's one large development there at [indiscernible] bit that's delivering right now and then a couple of other submarkets. As you move down into Orange County, you do see supply fall off a little bit in Anaheim from 16 to '17. And as it relates to Irvine, Irvine is actually projected to increase as you move in to '17 as a result of some deliveries by a handful of developers but, in particular, couple of large projects that will be delivered by the Irvine company, so increase there and then a modest reduction in Huntington Beach. And then Huntington Beach is kind of 2 anchors to the supply. There is a fair amount of product being delivered right at the mall at Beach Boulevard and the 405, but there's other communities, couple of communities under development down at Pacific City which is down along down Pacific Coast Highway there in Huntington Beach. So there is not much sort of in between there, but those are the 2 sort of anchors of supply in that market.

I mean, the second half of the year, assuming we have more challenging comps, and it's really played out in terms of -- if you look at granular level, it really comes down to the monthly sequential change in GP. And what we've seen in both like-term rent change as well as the transient and corporate component, is it's just not compounding as greater rate as it was at this time last year. So to give you some perspective as an example, if you looked at the change in GP on a monthly basis last year, we're talking about though the second quarter on a monthly basis moving up at 60 basis points in April, 100 basis points in May and about 110 basis points in June versus this year, those numbers were 30 basis points, 60 basis points and 90 basis points. Some of that is a reflection of the transient demand that we mentioned earlier, Tim alluded to in his prepared remarks, which does sort of turbocharge GP growth in the late second quarter and early third quarter that we're not seeing this year, so that's certainly part of it."

I'll provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. My comments",1369,"Yes. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our second quarter call. With me today is Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. 
My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q2 and year-to-date results, our revised midyear outlook for 2016, our view regarding the trajectory and durability of the current apartment cycle, and lastly, a look at how current development activity is contributing to our earnings growth. 
So starting on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth greater than 8.5% from a combination of healthy same-store revenue and NOI growth of 5% and contributions from new lease-ups, as we completed almost $200 million at a projected yield of just under 7%. Year-to-date, core FFO was up over 10%, again driven by a combination of internal growth from the stabilized portfolio and external growth from stabilizing development. For the first half of the year, our same-store portfolio performed in line with budget, although a bit ahead of budget in Q1 and a little behind in Q2. I'll discuss this trend a little more in a couple of minutes. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our updated outlook for the year. In short, overall expectations for core FFO are in line with our original outlook, which call for core FFO growth of 9%. Our projection for same-store NOI growth has been trimmed by about 40 basis points or approximately $0.03 per share for the full year, but is offset by contributions from other categories, such that our full year outlook for core FFO remains unchanged. Our projected investment and funding activity for the year remains more or less in line with our original expectation with some minor variances. 
Turning now to Slide 6. We thought we'd provide a little more color regarding our outlook for the same-store portfolio in the second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we performed in line with expectations for the first half of the year, although in Q2, we did experience the -- we did not experience the seasonal strength and effective rent growth that we're accustomed to seeing. This trend appears to be largely demand-driven, as economic and job growth fell short of expectations for the first half of the year, and declining business confidence in investment, no doubt, was a contributing factor as recent uncertainty in global events have left businesses hesitant to make new commitments. 
Turning to Slide 7. Slower economic growth impacts corporate and transient demand, which helped fuel seasonal strength in the second and third quarters for our business. A weaker corporate and transient demand affects us in 2 ways: first, a reduction in premium income, which typically runs 50% to 60% higher per lease; and secondly, an effective increase in market vacancy as, in fact, inventories essentially added back to the market. 
Turning to Slide 8. As economic conditions have moderated over the last 2 or 3 quarters, effective rent growth in our same-store portfolio, expressed as like-term rent change, has remained in the 4% range over the last 6 to 7 months. And while like-term rent change did improve modestly in Q2, we did not see the same seasonal lift we've seen in prior years so far this cycle. 
And turning to Slide 9, of course, performance does vary across our regions. Effective rent growth has moderated, most notably, in Northern California and the Northeast, while Seattle and the Mid-Atlantic have been trending up. Rent growth in Southern California remains healthy in the 6% range. 
Turning to Slide 10. As you might expect, these trends are impacting our outlook for portfolio performance for the year. Again, the Northeast and Northern California fallen short of projected budget, while in Seattle and D.C. are expected to outperform. Overall, the net impact is resulting in a reduction of same-store revenue of almost 40 basis points for the full year. With all of that expect a shortfall to occur in the second half of the year. 
Now turning now to Slide 11. Just given trends in the operating environment, we thought we'd just revisit where we think we are in the cycle. We still believe that fundamentals point mostly in favor of an extended cycle much like we saw in the 1990s. As you see on this chart, consumer confidence remains on solid footing at cyclically high levels, and young adults are feeling the best and leading the way. 
Turning to Slide 12. Consumer confidence is being shaped in large part by an improved employment picture with jobless claims continuing their fall since the cycle began and job openings now outpacing hiring activities. And as you can see on Slide 13, the growing strength in the labor market seems to finally be putting pressure on wages as evidenced by recent ADP reports. And combined with reduced debt burdens and stronger balance sheets, as you see on Chart 2, the consumer are in good shape and getting stronger, which bodes well for continued economic growth given their contribution to GDP. 
Turning to Slide 14. In addition, renter demand should continue to be supported by favorable demographics with the largest segment of millennials in their early to mid-20s still moving into their prime household formation and renting years. Obviously, demographics have been a major driver of renter demand this past cycle, and they should continue to support healthy rental demand over the next 5-plus years, even if homeownerships begin to stabilize -- I'm sorry, homeownership rates begin to stabilize, as the leading-edge of millennials begin to consider buying a home. 
Turning to Slide 15. The supply side of the equation is encouraging as well. Apartment deliveries are expected to peak nationally in 2016 and '17, as permitting for new projects has slowed down over the last 2 to 3 quarters from the cyclical highs in 2015. This is due in part to tightening credit for multifamily construction, which has become much more pronounced over the last couple of quarters. 
Turning to Slide 16. In addition to the apartment sector remaining in balance, the picture for the overall housing market looks positive as well. Projections for new housing production are in line with household formation over the next 4 years, but it's important to note that, first, these figures -- these supply figures ignore obsolescence or destruction of roughly 400,000 units per year, and they also assume that housing production over the next 4 years increases by 30% from its current level and roughly doubles what we've seen so far on average this cycle. 
So overall, while we may be seeing economic growth moderate a bit, we don't see any real tangible signs that the apartment or housing cycle is nearing its end. Rather, we are still seeing solid demand growth matched by what we believe is reasonable levels of new supply to meet that demand. 
Turning to Slide 17. Within this operating environment, one where demand and supply are expected to remain in balance, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth from our development platform. So far, this cycle, we've completed over $4 billion of new development, and initial stabilized yields on average of around 7% are well in excess of our marginal cost of capital during this time, which has contributed to strong core FFO growth over the last few years. 
And finally turning to Slide 18. Development should continue to drive solid external growth going forward as development underway, along with nonstabilized recent completions, should generate another $200 million of NOI with less than $400 million of capital required to complete this basket of $3.3 billion of assets. With these assets projected to yield well above our marginal cost of capital, most of which has already been raised, we are positioned to deliver industry-leading external growth over the next 2 to 3 years. 
So in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year for Avalonbay, and we believe that the company is very well positioned from an investment and funding perspective to outperform going forward. 
And with that, Augusta, we'd like to open the call for questions."

In terms of New England, first, it's typically more seasonal than most of our markets. And if you look at what's happened throughout the year, rent change started the year in the mid-2% range and it's trended up to about 3.5%, but it's running well below both last year's rate of about 5% and our initial expectations. I think, it's largely a result of 2 things. One is job growth, and the first 5 or 6 months of the year has been somewhat disappointing at an annualized rate of about 1.5 points relative to expectations closer to about 2% for the full year. And then also the transient demand that Tim referred to has been pretty weak in Boston this year, which put downward pressure on rental rates in the late spring and the early summer. So in terms of New England, that's kind of what's happening there. And then as it relates to Seattle, Seattle, for the most part, it's all about demand. And the first half of the year, job growth is running in the mid-4% range. I think most forecasters that we rely on had projected a slowdown in hiring in the Seattle market and it has not slowed down. There's still plenty of supply, about 3.5% of inventory, but the surprise has been on the demand side in terms of job growth. There's still softness in the sort of urban core of Seattle. We don't have many assets there. We really have 2 operating assets in those submarkets. But if you move out to the North End, you move to Redmond, you move to Bellevue, revenue growth is still relatively robust. And I think the difference between Seattle and Northern California in terms of what you're seeing in performance is you really have some well-established, large, well-capitalized companies driving the hiring in the tech sector in Seattle as compared to a lot of the smaller businesses that make up the greater share of employment in Northern California that are more susceptible to changes in funding tied to the VC market and what's happening with IPO, valuations, et cetera. So that's really what's been helping Seattle is really the job growth."

And then secondly is, we're just not getting the same level of judgments that we were seeing just based on some new judges in certain courts. And then thirdly is, we did have one corporate housing provider kind of go belly up on us. There was only 15 homes but it represented a couple of months of rent. The underlying client was actually still paying, so it's sort of an anomaly in the system, I guess, I would say, but New York was about 60% of the total increase, so that was unanticipated."

And while we've had good progress on renewal rent change, which is in the low 4% range, move-in rent change remains pretty stubbornly low at around 1.5%. It hasn't really improved much through the second quarter or into July. And I think what you're seeing there, particularly in New York City, which I'm including Northern New Jersey in kind of this general description of the geography at this point, is while there's been steady job growth, there is just not enough high paying jobs being created to absorb all the new supply. It's all being delivered at the high end of the market. And if you look at the performance, particularly recent performance of the suburban markets in and around New York are performing better than the City. We're seeing rent growth in New York City to sort of in the mid-2% range. But as you move into Long Island and Northern and Central New Jersey, we get up to the 3% to 4% and even 5% in Central Jersey over the last quarter. So, in general, I'd say the supply is weighing most heavily on the New York City market so, including the boroughs and Northern New Jersey, and we're seeing better performance out of the suburban submarkets."

So in many cases we're marking the market rents, but in some cases, where you think it might be an aberration for a short period of time, you might use a concession as opposed to reducing the rent.

Job growth has been off about 50 basis points from what we have projected. I just think where there is less economic activity and job growth, you have a little less household formation. But having said that, as we said in our management letter, we do expect rent change to be in the 3% to 4% range through the balance of the year. That is at or above trend, long-term trend. That's still very healthy rent growth for our business. So we're not necessarily calling for a reacceleration to cyclical highs, but we are not -- we don't think it's over yet. And again, it's one of the reasons why we compare it to the '90s. If you go back to the '90s and you just sort of chart what rent growth and revenue growth look like, it moved around from year to year based upon what was happening in that particular year from an economic activity standpoint. It does ebb and flow a bit and that's just the way economies work. We don't see the kind of distortions that you might expect to see. You see some weakness, but you don't see the kind of distortions that you might expect to see that results in a lot of dislocation and ultimately leads to negative economic growth and recession."

On that topic, basically, Southern California, as you pointed out, was slightly ahead in the first half. It's basically slightly behind in the second half as a function of the macroeconomic things that we spoke about in terms of job growth, et cetera. The supply is pretty much as expected. And so, I don't know that there is a great story in Southern California in terms of whether it's a deceleration other than the job environment. I mean, if you look at it, we had a little bit of a boost in the Los Angeles region, particularly San Fernando Valley in the first half of the year as a result of just some one-off issue, which was a gas leak in that area that drove some initial demand in the first quarter. It boosted occupancy, but we've given that back in the second quarter. So there was a little bit of a lift in the first quarter and first half as a result of that. So that's partly reflected in a deceleration, I guess, if you want to call it, as you look to the second half relative to the first half, but it's basically performing on plan. Los Angeles is healthy. Orange County has been slightly choppy but still relatively healthy. You've got some supply coming in to Anaheim, Irvine and Huntington Beach, creates a little bit of choppiness, but for the most part, that product is being absorbed. And then san Diego just continues to perform quite well. So I don't know that there is any unusual story coming out of Southern California other than slightly lower job growth and then the sort of one-time boost that we received in the first half of the year from the gas leak that occurred."

But based on your comment, I wasn't sure if you'd feel like San Fran is going to stay elevated into '17, because I think we were looking at stats that were showing a drop-off in, let's say, the Northern California area in '17 versus New York, it's going to persist at least through '17."

But if you look at San Francisco specifically, we're expecting it to increase again in 2017 from 3.1% of inventory in '16 to 3.4% in 2017. So you do need to look at the composition of the different markets within that region to determine what's happening.

The top-down sort of comes from other sources, whether it'd be REITs, Axiometrics or certain local market providers, like Delta Associates as an example here in D.C. or others in other markets. So we take that, but then we also do sort of a ground-up assessment. We have a market research team here in Arlington that scrubs all the local websites through the municipalities in our markets to understand where certain deals are in their processing for entitlements and what the expected delivery dates are. In addition to that, our local development team, where we have 3 to 4 people per office around the country, is tracking all the developments in their markets, as they are competing for sites and expected opportunities in their markets. And then in addition to the development teams, the last scrub in our process is through the operations team where they know what's beginning to pre-lease to better predict when deliveries are expected to arrive in certain submarkets, and if we need to alter our revenue management strategy ahead of deliveries coming. So it's a pretty thorough process from a top-down and a bottoms-up perspective, as compared to just looking at the REITs data and saying that's what we expect. So I think our process is probably more robust than average, but given our capability and development, how important it is to our business, we just give it a lot of scrutiny."

Another one was the deal in Northern New Jersey, in Union, which hadn't seen any new supply in many years, and frequently we find a positive surprise on rents when we lease-up in communities like that. And the third one was in Irvine. So the basket moves around from quarter-to-quarter, but I think year-to-date, it's in the kind of 6.3%-ish range. So, obviously, as we have completed the prior quarter little bit lower yielding, some of those were in -- one of those was a large deal in Southern Cal, which tends to have lower yields. So it's going to generally move around, but we are continuing to see yields, obviously, beat the initial underwriting on the strength of good rent growth."

And then with the tech wreck and the elimination of -- you had 2 things going, you had the elimination, obviously, of lot of technology jobs, and you had a pretty, much more dramatic expansion of monetary policy in terms of the impact on interest rates. So you had a lot more -- home ownership rates went up in the face of recession which was unusual. So you had a lot more demand destruction in the case of rental housing than you did actually in the 2000s where you had job losses that were actually 3x what we had in the early 2000s. But we saw sort of the typical pattern where rentership rates actually went up during recession. So it was a little more -- as I mentioned earlier -- in the 2000s it was a little bit more of a kind of a straight up and then straight down curve to rent growth. It kind of kept going up and then until it didn't, and then after about 2006 into 2007, rents started to decelerate until 2008 hit us."

Wanted to try to address some of those comments and we can always follow up with greater detail if you're interested. Wanting to give you a sense that in Northern California, first, give you some perspective from an overall standpoint, rent change started the year around 6%, but it's continued to decelerate and is currently running around 4%. And that's made up of about 2.5% in San Francisco, 6% in the East Bay and the low 4% range in San Jose. So that's kind of where we are now. If you look at -- if you want to kind of decompose that even more into the new move-ins and like-term rent change by market, why don't I get that to you separately, so we don't consume a lot of time on that. But I think it's fair to say that San Francisco is probably the softest at this point, so just to address that one. Rent change at this point on move-ins is essentially just barely positive, 50 basis points to 100 basis points kind of range. We continue to hold renewals sort of in the low- to mid-4% range. So you're talking about anywhere from 2.5% to 3.5% sort of numbers on a blended basis in San Francisco. Those numbers are certainly better in the East Bay and San Jose, as I mentioned currently. But in terms of it reaching a bottom and flattening out, as I mentioned in a response to a prior question, we still expect continued deliveries at a pretty heavy level in San Francisco throughout this year and then even increasing into next year. So performance -- really rent change is going to depend on the level of demand and job growth has been decelerating there. So to the extent that we see job growth level off, that would certainly help. But I think really your forecast for job growth is going to dictate performance in 2017 and whether that levels off or not. Certainly as you get beyond '17, given the nature of the product that's constructed in San Francisco, supply should start to fall off, but we do expect it to be somewhat challenging through 2017 in San Francisco specifically."

It's like 14%, 15% this year and it stays at that level through 2017. Yes, there are a couple of pockets that you're seeing in supply in L.A. is Marina Del Rey. In particular, it's one large development there at Playa Vista that's delivering right now and then a couple of other submarkets. As you move down into Orange County, you do see supply fall off a little bit in Anaheim from '16 to '17. And as it relates to Irvine, Irvine is actually projected to increase some as you move into '17 as a result of some deliveries by a handful of developers but, in particular, a couple of large projects that will be delivered by the Irvine company, so increase there and then a modest reduction in Huntington Beach. And in Huntington Beach there's kind of 2 anchors to the supply. There is a fair amount of product being delivered right at the mall at Beach Boulevard and the 405, but there's other communities, couple of large communities under development down at Pacific City which is down along down Pacific Coast Highway there in Huntington Beach. So there is not much sort of in between there, but those are the 2 sort of anchors of supply in that market. So if you look at it, overall, one thing to keep in mind for Southern California is we're still talking about deliveries that are low 1% range of inventory overall. So you do have to be careful about which submarkets you're in. But if you look at it, the region is pretty supply constrained."

I mean, the second half of the year, assuming we have more challenging comps, and it's really played out in terms of -- if you look at granular level, it really comes down to the monthly sequential change in GP. And what we've seen in both like-term rent change as well as the transient and corporate component, is it's just not compounding at as great a rate as it was at this time last year. So to give you some perspective as an example, if you looked at the change in GP on a monthly basis last year, we were talking about though the second quarter on a monthly basis moving up at 60 basis points in April, 100 basis points in May and about 110 basis points in June. Versus this year those numbers were 30 basis points, 60 basis points and 90 basis points. Some of that is a reflection of the transient demand that we mentioned earlier, Tim alluded to in his prepared remarks, which does sort of turbocharge GP growth in the late second quarter and early third quarter that we're not seeing this year, so that's certainly part of it."

And so we end up as having essentially an unlevered or a neutralized number there from a leverage point of view. So we don't look at yields on a levered basis."

And when you think about the production level, not just of apartments, but just housing and all -- kind of all real estate categories, the level of construction is still not that high, and yes, it's a real challenge for the industry right now.

So, for example, in New England, Boston, specifically, there were some pretty good winter storms last couple of years. When we underwrite things, we sort of look at an average year, this year was a better-than-average year, so there was less transient demand from insurance claims for people that had damage in their homes during the winter.

I'll provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. My comments",1369,"Yes. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our second quarter call. With me today is Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I'll provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. 
My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q2 and year-to-date results, our revised midyear outlook for 2016, our view regarding the trajectory and durability of the current apartment cycle, and lastly, a look at how current development activity is contributing to our earnings growth. 
So starting on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth greater than 8.5% from a combination of healthy same-store revenue and NOI growth of 5% and contributions from new lease-ups, as we completed almost $200 million at a projected yield of just under 7%. Year-to-date, core FFO was up over 10%, again driven by a combination of internal growth from the stabilized portfolio and external growth from stabilizing development. For the first half of the year, our same-store portfolio performed in line with budget, although a bit ahead of budget in Q1 and a little behind in Q2. I'll discuss this trend a little more in a couple of minutes. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our updated outlook for the year. In short, overall expectations for core FFO are in line with our original outlook, which call for core FFO growth of 9%. Our projection for same-store NOI growth has been trimmed by about 40 basis points or approximately $0.03 per share for the full year, but is offset by contributions from other categories, such that our full year outlook for core FFO remains unchanged. Our projected investment and funding activity for the year remains more or less in line with our original expectation with some minor variances. 
Turning now to Slide 6. We thought we'd provide a little more color regarding our outlook for the same-store portfolio in the second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we performed in line with expectations for the first half of the year, although in Q2, we did experience the -- we did not experience the seasonal strength and effective rent growth that we're accustomed to seeing. This trend appears to be largely demand-driven, as economic and job growth fell short of expectations for the first half of the year, and declining business confidence in investment, no doubt, was a contributing factor as recent uncertainty in global events have left businesses hesitant to make new commitments. 
Turning to Slide 7. Slower economic growth impacts corporate and transient demand, which helped fuel seasonal strength in the second and third quarters for our business. A weaker corporate and transient demand affects us in 2 ways: first, a reduction in premium income, which typically runs 50% to 60% higher per lease; and secondly, an effective increase in market vacancy as, in fact, inventories essentially added back to the market. 
Turning to Slide 8. As economic conditions have moderated over the last 2 or 3 quarters, effective rent growth in our same-store portfolio, expressed as like-term rent change, has remained in the 4% range over the last 6 to 7 months. And while like-term rent change did improve modestly in Q2, we did not see the same seasonal lift we've seen in prior years so far this cycle. 
And turning to Slide 9, of course, performance does vary across our regions. Effective rent growth has moderated, most notably, in Northern California and the Northeast, while Seattle and the Mid-Atlantic have been trending up. Rent growth in Southern California remains healthy in the 6% range. 
Turning to Slide 10. As you might expect, these trends are impacting our outlook for portfolio performance for the year. Again, the Northeast and Northern California fallen short of projected budget, while in Seattle and D.C. are expected to outperform. Overall, the net impact is resulting in a reduction of same-store revenue of almost 40 basis points for the full year. With all of that expect a shortfall to occur in the second half of the year. 
Now turning now to Slide 11. Just given trends in the operating environment, we thought we'd just revisit where we think we are in the cycle. We still believe that fundamentals point mostly in favor of an extended cycle much like we saw in the 1990s. As you see on this chart, consumer confidence remains on solid footing at cyclically high levels, and young adults are feeling the best and leading the way. 
Turning to Slide 12. Consumer confidence is being shaped in large part by an improved employment picture with jobless claims continuing their fall since the cycle began and job openings now outpacing hiring activities. And as you can see on Slide 13, the growing strength in the labor market seems to finally be putting pressure on wages as evidenced by recent ADP reports. And combined with reduced debt burdens and stronger balance sheets, as you see on Chart 2, the consumer are in good shape and getting stronger, which bodes well for continued economic growth given their contribution to GDP. 
Turning to Slide 14. In addition, renter demand should continue to be supported by favorable demographics with the largest segment of millennials in their early to mid-20s still moving into their prime household formation and renting years. Obviously, demographics have been a major driver of renter demand this past cycle, and they should continue to support healthy rental demand over the next 5-plus years, even if homeownerships begin to stabilize -- I'm sorry, homeownership rates begin to stabilize, as the leading-edge of millennials begin to consider buying a home. 
Turning to Slide 15. The supply side of the equation is encouraging as well. Apartment deliveries are expected to peak nationally in 2016 and '17, as permitting for new projects has slowed down over the last 2 to 3 quarters from the cyclical highs in 2015. This is due in part to tightening credit for multifamily construction, which has become much more pronounced over the last couple of quarters. 
Turning to Slide 16. In addition to the apartment sector remaining in balance, the picture for the overall housing market looks positive as well. Projections for new housing production are in line with household formation over the next 4 years, but it's important to note that, first, these figures -- these supply figures ignore obsolescence or destruction of roughly 400,000 units per year, and they also assume that housing production over the next 4 years increases by 30% from its current level and roughly doubles what we've seen so far on average this cycle. 
So overall, while we may be seeing economic growth moderate a bit, we don't see any real tangible signs that the apartment or housing cycle is nearing its end. Rather, we are still seeing solid demand growth matched by what we believe is reasonable levels of new supply to meet that demand. 
Turning to Slide 17. Within this operating environment, one where demand and supply are expected to remain in balance, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth from our development platform. So far, this cycle, we've completed over $4 billion of new development, and initial stabilized yields on average of around 7% are well in excess of our marginal cost of capital during this time, which has contributed to strong core FFO growth over the last few years. 
And finally turning to Slide 18. Development should continue to drive solid external growth going forward as development underway, along with nonstabilized recent completions, should generate another $200 million of NOI with less than $400 million of capital required to complete this basket of $3.3 billion of assets. With these assets projected to yield well above our marginal cost of capital, most of which has already been raised, we are positioned to deliver industry-leading external growth over the next 2 to 3 years. 
So in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year for Avalonbay, and we believe that the company is very well positioned from an investment and funding perspective to outperform going forward. 
And with that, Augusta, we'd like to open the call for questions."

In terms of New England, first, it's typically more seasonal than most of our markets. And if you look at what's happened throughout the year, rent change started the year in the mid-2% range and it's trended up to about 3.5%, but it's running well below both last year's rate of about 5% and our initial expectations. I think, it's largely a result of 2 things. One is job growth, and the first 5 or 6 months of the year has been somewhat disappointing at an annualized rate of about 1.5 points relative to expectations closer to about 2% for the full year. And then also the transient demand that Tim referred to has been pretty weak in Boston this year, which put downward pressure on rental rates in the late spring and the early summer. So in terms of New England, that's kind of what's happening there. And then as it relates to Seattle, Seattle, for the most part, it's all about demand. And the first half of the year, job growth is running in the mid-4% range. I think most forecasters that we rely on had projected a slowdown in hiring in the Seattle market and it has not slowed down. There's still plenty of supply, about 3.5% of inventory, but the surprise has been on the demand side in terms of job growth. There's still softness in the sort of urban core of Seattle. We don't have many assets there. We really have 2 operating assets in those submarkets. But if you move out to the North End, you move to Redmond, you move to Bellevue, revenue growth is still relatively robust. And I think the difference between Seattle and Northern California in terms of what you're seeing in performance is you really have some well-established, large, well-capitalized companies driving the hiring in the tech sector in Seattle as compared to a lot of the smaller businesses that make up the greater share of employment in Northern California that are more susceptible to changes in funding tied to the VC market and what's happening with IPO, valuations, et cetera. So that's really what's been helping Seattle is really the job growth."

And our policy is to write things off after a certain period of time. If we collect it later, it'll be an offset, but we're writing things off more rapidly. And then secondly is, we're just not getting the same level of judgments that we were seeing just based on some new judges in certain courts. And then thirdly is, we did have one corporate housing provider kind of go belly up on us. There was only 15 homes but it represented a couple of months of rent. The underlying client was actually still paying, so it's sort of an anomaly in the system, I guess, I would say, but New York was about 60% of the total increase, so that was unanticipated."

And while we've had good progress on renewal rent change, which is in the low 4% range, move-in rent change remains pretty stubbornly low at around 1.5%. It hasn't really improved much through the second quarter or into July. And I think what you're seeing there, particularly in New York City, which I'm including Northern New Jersey in kind of this general description of the geography at this point, is while there's been steady job growth, there is just not enough high paying jobs being created to absorb all the new supply. It's all being delivered at the high end of the market. And if you look at the performance, particularly recent performance of the suburban markets in and around New York are performing better than the City. We're seeing rent growth in New York City to sort of in the mid-2% range. But as you move into Long Island and Northern and Central New Jersey, we get up to the 3% to 4% and even 5% in Central Jersey over the last quarter. So, in general, I'd say the supply is weighing most heavily on the New York City market so, including the boroughs and Northern New Jersey, and we're seeing better performance out of the suburban submarkets."

So in many cases we're marking the market rents, but in some cases, where you think it might be an aberration for a short period of time, you might use a concession as opposed to reducing the rent.

Job growth has been off about 50 basis points from what we have projected. I just think where there is less economic activity and job growth, you have a little less household formation. But having said that, as we said in our management letter, we do expect rent change to be in the 3% to 4% range through the balance of the year. That is at or above trend, long-term trend. That's still very healthy rent growth for our business. So we're not necessarily calling for a reacceleration to cyclical highs, but we are not -- we don't think it's over yet. And again, it's one of the reasons why we compare it to the '90s. If you go back to the '90s and you just sort of chart what rent growth and revenue growth look like, it moved around from year to year based upon what was happening in that particular year from an economic activity standpoint. It does ebb and flow a bit and that's just the way economies work. We don't see the kind of distortions that you might expect to see. You see some weakness, but you don't see the kind of distortions that you might expect to see that results in a lot of dislocation and ultimately leads to negative economic growth and recession."

On that topic, basically, Southern California, as you pointed out, was slightly ahead in the first half. It's basically slightly behind in the second half as a function of the macroeconomic things that we spoke about in terms of job growth, et cetera. The supply is pretty much as expected. And so, I don't know that there is a great story in Southern California in terms of whether it's a deceleration other than the job environment. I mean, if you look at it, we had a little bit of a boost in the Los Angeles region, particularly San Fernando Valley in the first half of the year as a result of just some one-off issue, which was a gas leak in that area that drove some initial demand in the first quarter. It boosted occupancy, but we've given that back in the second quarter. So there was a little bit of a lift in the first quarter and first half as a result of that. So that's partly reflected in a deceleration, I guess, if you want to call it, as you look to the second half relative to the first half, but it's basically performing on plan. Los Angeles is healthy. Orange County has been slightly choppy but still relatively healthy. You've got some supply coming in to Anaheim, Irvine and Huntington Beach, creates a little bit of choppiness, but for the most part, that product is being absorbed. And then san Diego just continues to perform quite well. So I don't know that there is any unusual story coming out of Southern California other than slightly lower job growth and then the sort of one-time boost that we received in the first half of the year from the gas leak that occurred."

But based on your comment, I wasn't sure if you'd feel like San Fran is going to stay elevated into '17, because I think we were looking at stats that were showing a drop-off in, let's say, the Northern California area in '17 versus New York, it's going to persist at least through '17."

But if you look at San Francisco specifically, we're expecting it to increase again in 2017 from 3.1% of inventory in '16 to 3.4% in 2017. So you do need to look at the composition of the different markets within that region to determine what's happening.

The top-down sort of comes from other sources, whether it'd be REITs, Axiometrics or certain local market providers, like Delta Associates as an example here in D.C. or others in other markets. So we take that, but then we also do sort of a ground-up assessment. We have a market research team here in Arlington that scrubs all the local websites through the municipalities in our markets to understand where certain deals are in their processing for entitlements and what the expected delivery dates are. In addition to that, our local development team, where we have 3 to 4 people per office around the country, is tracking all the developments in their markets, as they are competing for sites and expected opportunities in their markets. And then in addition to the development teams, the last scrub in our process is through the operations team where they know what's beginning to pre-lease to better predict when deliveries are expected to arrive in certain submarkets, and if we need to alter our revenue management strategy ahead of deliveries coming. So it's a pretty thorough process from a top-down and a bottoms-up perspective, as compared to just looking at the REITs data and saying that's what we expect. So I think our process is probably more robust than average, but given our capability and development, how important it is to our business, we just give it a lot of scrutiny."

Another one was the deal in Northern New Jersey, in Union, which hadn't seen any new supply in many years, and frequently we find a positive surprise on rents when we lease-up in communities like that. And the third one was in Irvine. So the basket moves around from quarter-to-quarter, but I think year-to-date, it's in the kind of 6.3%-ish range. So, obviously, as we have completed the prior quarter little bit lower yielding, some of those were in -- one of those was a large deal in Southern Cal, which tends to have lower yields. So it's going to generally move around, but we are continuing to see yields, obviously, beat the initial underwriting on the strength of good rent growth."

And then with the tech wreck and the elimination of -- you had 2 things going, you had the elimination, obviously, of lot of technology jobs, and you had a pretty, much more dramatic expansion of monetary policy in terms of the impact on interest rates. So you had a lot more -- home ownership rates went up in the face of recession which was unusual. So you had a lot more demand destruction in the case of rental housing than you did actually in the 2000s where you had job losses that were actually 3x what we had in the early 2000s. But we saw sort of the typical pattern where rentership rates actually went up during recession. So it was a little more -- as I mentioned earlier -- in the 2000s it was a little bit more of a kind of a straight up and then straight down curve to rent growth. It kind of kept going up and then until it didn't, and then after about 2006 into 2007, rents started to decelerate until 2008 hit us."

Wanted to try to address some of those comments and we can always follow up with greater detail if you're interested. Wanting to give you a sense that in Northern California, first, give you some perspective from an overall standpoint, rent change started the year around 6%, but it's continued to decelerate and is currently running around 4%. And that's made up of about 2.5% in San Francisco, 6% in the East Bay and the low 4% range in San Jose. So that's kind of where we are now. If you look at -- if you want to kind of decompose that even more into the new move-ins and like-term rent change by market, why don't I get that to you separately, so we don't consume a lot of time on that. But I think it's fair to say that San Francisco is probably the softest at this point, so just to address that one. Rent change at this point on move-ins is essentially just barely positive, 50 basis points to 100 basis points kind of range. We continue to hold renewals sort of in the low- to mid-4% range. So you're talking about anywhere from 2.5% to 3.5% sort of numbers on a blended basis in San Francisco. Those numbers are certainly better in the East Bay and San Jose, as I mentioned currently. But in terms of it reaching a bottom and flattening out, as I mentioned in a response to a prior question, we still expect continued deliveries at a pretty heavy level in San Francisco throughout this year and then even increasing into next year. So performance -- really rent change is going to depend on the level of demand and job growth has been decelerating there. So to the extent that we see job growth level off, that would certainly help. But I think really your forecast for job growth is going to dictate performance in 2017 and whether that levels off or not. Certainly as you get beyond '17, given the nature of the product that's constructed in San Francisco, supply should start to fall off, but we do expect it to be somewhat challenging through 2017 in San Francisco specifically."

It's like 14%, 15% this year and it stays at that level through 2017. Yes, there are a couple of pockets that you're seeing in supply in L.A. is Marina Del Rey. In particular, it's one large development there at Playa Vista that's delivering right now and then a couple of other submarkets. As you move down into Orange County, you do see supply fall off a little bit in Anaheim from '16 to '17. And as it relates to Irvine, Irvine is actually projected to increase some as you move into '17 as a result of some deliveries by a handful of developers but, in particular, a couple of large projects that will be delivered by the Irvine company, so increase there and then a modest reduction in Huntington Beach. And in Huntington Beach there's kind of 2 anchors to the supply. There is a fair amount of product being delivered right at the mall at Beach Boulevard and the 405, but there's other communities, couple of large communities under development down at Pacific City which is down along down Pacific Coast Highway there in Huntington Beach. So there is not much sort of in between there, but those are the 2 sort of anchors of supply in that market. So if you look at it, overall, one thing to keep in mind for Southern California is we're still talking about deliveries that are low 1% range of inventory overall. So you do have to be careful about which submarkets you're in. But if you look at it, the region is pretty supply constrained."

I mean, the second half of the year, assuming we have more challenging comps, and it's really played out in terms of -- if you look at granular level, it really comes down to the monthly sequential change in GP. And what we've seen in both like-term rent change as well as the transient and corporate component, is it's just not compounding at as great a rate as it was at this time last year. So to give you some perspective as an example, if you looked at the change in GP on a monthly basis last year, we were talking about though the second quarter on a monthly basis moving up at 60 basis points in April, 100 basis points in May and about 110 basis points in June. Versus this year those numbers were 30 basis points, 60 basis points and 90 basis points. Some of that is a reflection of the transient demand that we mentioned earlier, Tim alluded to in his prepared remarks, which does sort of turbocharge GP growth in the late second quarter and early third quarter that we're not seeing this year, so that's certainly part of it."

And so we end up as having essentially an unlevered or a neutralized number there from a leverage point of view. So we don't look at yields on a levered basis."

If you look at the different sort of wage indices out there, construction labor is towards the top, if not at the very top in terms of year-over-year wage growth. So it's an industry that has seen a lot of skilled labor leave over the last cycle or 2. And it's a challenge to get good skilled labor at lot of these sites. And when you think about the production level, not just of apartments, but just housing and all -- kind of all real estate categories, the level of construction is still not that high, and yes, it's a real challenge for the industry right now. I think a lot of that just has to do with a shortage of skilled labor."

So, for example, in New England, Boston, specifically, there were some pretty good winter storms last couple of years. When we underwrite things, we sort of look at an average year, this year was a better-than-average year, so there was less transient demand from insurance claims for people that had damage in their homes during the winter.

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I will be providing management commentary in the slides that we posted yesterday after the market closed, and all of this will be available for Q&A afterwards. 
My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q3, year-to-date results, our outlook for 2016, a look at fundamentals, and lastly, an update on investment activity and a look back on our capital allocation track record. 
So let's start on Slide 4. 
It was a solid quarter, where we achieved quite core FFO growth of 7.3% from a combination of same store NOI growth of over 4% and healthy contributions continuing from new lease-ups. Year-to-date core FFO per share is up over 9%. And in Q3, we raised over $1 billion in new capital, including the October bond deal and disposition activity, to fund ongoing, and the upcoming development and to pay off maturing debt. 
Turning to Slide 5 in our updated outlook for the year. 
We have updated our outlook for FFO and same-store metrics. Our core FFO per share has been reduced by $0.05 per share or 70 basis points for the full year to 8.3%, due to a combination of factors, including same-store revenue growth being trimmed by around 12 basis points from our midyear forecast from a mix of lower projected occupancy and rate for Q4. Secondly, a higher same-store operating expenses, related primarily to higher utility costs and delayed resolution of several tax appeals. Thirdly, lower redevelopment NOI. And lastly, a higher interest rate -- a higher interest related costs in connection with our recent $650 million bond deal that we completed earlier this month. 
Turning now to Slide 6. We thought we'd spend a couple of minutes on fundamentals that are shaping portfolio performance and the overall outlook for the apartment sector. 
GDP and job growth, as many of you know, continued to decelerate. GDP growth has been below 1.5% now for the last 3 quarters, while job growth is running more than 20% less than its cyclical peak and well off last year's pace so far year-to-date. Lower corporate profits and business confidence is resulting in less investment in labor and capital as businesses appear reluctant to make new commitments. 
Turning to Slide 7. 
While businesses are slowing down, the consumer appears to still be in good shape, and the labor market continues to tighten with more job openings helping to contribute to an improved wage picture. Consumers balance sheets are in the best space in many years. And these trends are contributing to a cyclically high consumer confidence, which in turn is helping to drive stronger household formation, which is running north of 1 million per year after lingering at generational lows earlier this cycle. 
Turning to Slide 8. 
Longer-term, secular trends should continue to support apartment demand. You adult job growth is outpacing the U.S. average, driven obviously by a strong growth in this. This generation is marrying and having children later. And unsurprisingly, we have seen a strongest household formation for singles and couples as one and 2-person households have been responsible for more than 80% of all net new households formed so far this cycle. 
Homeownership rates have in turn continued to fall through the segment, helping to stimulate healthy apartment demand in this cycle. While the leading edge of millennials are now in their mid-30s, the largest part of this generation are still in their mid-20s and are expected to stimulate renter demand for several years. 
So overall, despite slower economic activity, demand fundamentals are still healthy for the housing market in general and for the apartment sector specifically. 
Turning to Slide 9. Let's take a look at what the these trends mean for our market. 
So far this cycle, from 2010 to 2015, we have benefited from a significant imbalance between demand and supply. This slide looks at this in a couple of ways. On the left, we look at the broader housing picture as household formation specifically outpace housing starts during this period. And on the right, job growth outpaced new apartment deliveries by roughly 2x. So in the first part of the cycle, through 2015, demand has run well above supply and apartment rents have grown well above the long-term trend. 
Going forward, over the next 2 to 3 years, and you see from the right-hand side of both of these charts, through 2018, we expect demand and supply to be more imbalanced, reflecting an industry moving toward equilibrium after years of significant outperformance. 
Turning to Slide 10. 
That notion is certainly reflected in recent rent performance across our markets and in our same-store portfolio. Overall, market rent growth according to Axiometrics has declined from around 5% to 2% to 3% over the last 4 to 5 quarters. Similarly, in our same-store portfolio, we've seen same unit rent growth declined from over 6% to 3% to 4% range during that same time, where the levels that are closer to historical average. 
Turning to Slide 11. And double clicking through on our portfolio a bit here, you can see a couple of other trends. 
First, we are seeing convergence in performance between East and West, as the differentials and rent growth have narrowed by around 300 basis points over the last year, driven mainly by a deceleration in Northern California and some improvement in the mid-Atlantic. And second, and as we've been discussing in recent quarters, rent growth in the suburbs continues to outpace that in urban submarkets by around 200 basis points given this concentration of the new supply in urban centers. 
Let's turn now to investment activity and to Slide 12. 
Lease up performance continues to be strong as rents are roughly 200 basis points above[ph]  pro forma and yields are 30 basis points higher. And if yields are well above prevailing cap rates and our marginal cost of capital, new development is contributing meaningfully to NAV and earnings growth well into the current cycle.
Turning to Slide 13. 
And as discussed a couple of quarters ago, this really has been the case during our life as a public company. This slide depicts development performance across various phases of the cycles since 1995. The strongest performance generally occurs during the expansion phase for sure, but has been healthy even when new development has delivered into the downturn. We believe this speaks to our capability in this area and our disciplined approach to allocating capital to this activity. 
Turning now to Slide 14. 
In addition, we continued to be disciplined in how we capitalize new development commitments. Excluding the benefit of any free cash flow or retained earnings we may enjoy, we are still currently 85% match funded against our $3.1 billion pipeline, that is we've already raised most of the permanent capital for this bucket of assets well in advance of it producing operating cash flow. So as this development stabilizes, it will add meaningfully to future growth and free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 15, and shifting gears a bit. We thought it might be helpful to briefly review our capital allocation track record over our life as a public company. 
What we understand that there's a lot of focus right now in moderating fundamentals and the impacts on portfolio performance. We are investing in long-lived assets with an aim to deliver outside total returns over the long run. 
As you can see on this chart, over the last 20-plus years, we've been able to generate strong investment and returns with an unlevered IRRs of around 13%. A few points worth noting here. First, we've been able to deliver healthy returns, double-digit IRRs across all of our regions. Second, we generated strong IRRs across both urban and the suburban submarkets. Third, we generated the highest returns in markets where we have the longest tenure, the mid-Atlantic and Northern California. And our business tenure matters in terms of market intelligence, experience, reputation and relationships. And lastly, while these returns represent a mix of unrealized or projected returns and realized returns, the average is consistent with what has been realized through our dispositions over the last 10 years, as shown on the Attachment 12 of this release. 
Now lastly, turning to Slide 16. 
This long-term track record has certainly extended to the current cycle. So far, this cycle, we have delivered around $4.5 billion of new development at yields that have generated initial NAV accretion of around $2 billion and healthier earnings accretion, contributing to annual compounded growth and core FFO of almost 13% over the last 6 years, a period of time when core FFO per share has more than doubled and dividends have grown by more than 50%. 
So in summary, while we are seeing some moderation in fundamentals, it appears that we are settling into a period of equilibrium as the economic expansion plays out. Of course, the submarkets and some markets will outperform, while others might lag, but overall, demand and supply seemed to be roughly in balance and projected to remain that way over the next 2 to 3 years. And as we move into the later stages of a very healthy apartment cycle, we continued to exercise a disciplined approach to capital allocation, both in how we raise and deploy capital. And that should allow us to generate solid earnings and NAV growth that will help us outperform. 
And with that, Jessica, we'd be happy to open the call for some questions."

And it's really just a function of when those deals work their way through the system and are ready to start, so we haven't -- I wouldn't say our view has changed in any material way in terms of the attractiveness or the profitability of the development platform. We're still adding new development rights through the course of the year. They're still kind at the same current economics. Again, we underwrite the kind of today's rents and costs and expenses that don't really trend, but we're still seeing, on average, our development rights pipeline underwriting to about a mid 6s[ph] yield, some variation by region, but that's been pretty consistent really for the last several years. The only thing that's really potentially changed is just different deals will move around quarter-to-quarter. So whether we wind up with this historic volume through the total unit that we expected at the beginning of the year, probably just depends on what happens with the Columbus Circle deal and whether that starts this quarter or it may slip into the first quarter of next year."

So the assumptions are always based upon what we're seeing in the markets today. And I think that's what Matt in terms of our underlying assumptions haven't changed in terms of how they're derived."

Why don't I give you an overview of the change from the mid-year guidance that we provided as compared to what we provided last night, if that's helpful. But the growth has changed, if you look at, call it the combined third quarter and fourth quarter or back half of the year, it represents around $2.6 million, $2.7 million. About 1/3 of that is timing related. And the majority of that ties to the 3 tax appeals in L.A. County that were scheduled and anticipated to occur in Q4 that looks like they're going to slip into Q1 and in the balance of the timing related component related to the startup of a coach facility at one of our New York high-rise asset that's been delayed a little bit. So about 1/3 of it, we'll get. We're just going to get a prior closer to Q1 as opposed to Q4. But in terms of the absolute amount of the change, it's about 70 basis points. If you look at the midyear guidance we provided, basically, around 2 4, that where we're at 3 1 today. The major components are the utilities, it's about $1.8 million, taxes, around $700,000, and there's a couple of hundred thousand related to insurance and payroll. Again, that's sort of comparing back half of 2016 as compared to our midyear re-forecast, so a big chunk of it again is timing related, but those are the primary drivers of a difference as compared to what we had said earlier at midyear."

Obviously, in New York, you probably see a greater use of concession given some of the legal rent issues that surround that market. And then in certain situations where we think there may be just the bulk of deliveries that's coming through in a particular quarter or 2 that sort of impacts the then current environment and we want to take sort of a temporary hit as opposed to the full 12 months in reducing the rent when it comes to lease renewal for those customers, that we tend to use. But in terms of the concessions that we granted in the third quarter, it's about 440,000, about 50% of it is in San Francisco, a better than the 25% is in the Pacific Northwest, which is in a healthy market, but it tends to be a market where there is just a greater use of concessions. So we have concessions last year, we use concessions this year. It's just the sort of the nature of the barter in Seattle. But if you look at the year-over-year change, about 85% of the year-over-year increase is really in San Francisco, and that's primarily concentrated at the Mission Bay assets, a little bit of 55 9[ph], a little bit at Ocean Avenue, which are competing with more the new deliveries."

Dave, this is Sean. In terms of a bleeding through the portfolio, I mean it's the softer market environment this year obviously has already started to bleed through the portfolio, which was our original expectations at the beginning of the year in the guidance that we provided. The rate at which at least the portfolio really is a function of a couple of different things. For the most part, it really does depend on turnover rates, because if you're turning over say a 54% or a 55% of the portfolio every year, that's going to get mark-to-market to some degree, and then the balance of it really is in renewals. And historically, we had seen more pricing power with renewals relative to new move ins because of switching costs and things of that sort. So it takes a period of time for that to happen. So obviously, in some markets we are seeing rents go down relative to this point last year, I'd say, particularly in the markets like San Francisco or a little bit in New York City, but we're seeing overall positive rent change currently in those markets, I'd say, due to 2 reasons. One is we probably are performing slightly better than the market average in those markets. And secondly, it's just a function of the renewals versus the move ins that I described previously."

That's about -- on a percentage basis, that's about what you're seeing in terms of renter propensities right now. It just seems like the market is producing housing that's consistent with what we're seeing at from a marginal demand standpoint which autotranslate into inflation or maybe a little bit better in terms of rent growth than I think it if you're seeing a tightness anywhere, it's probably more on the for sale arena where there's still being kind of 5% kind of growth in value. So we're not seeing too much supply in terms of the overall housing picture. We are seeing pockets of oversupply for sure, and we've talked about those markets, and so some will leave and some will lag. But overall, based upon an economy that's growing at, call it, 2%, and jobs that are growing around 1.5%, and supply that's been delivered into the market at about 1.5% of, that just looks like equilibrium to us, so supply being roughly equivalent to demand."

Juan, this is Sean. Why don't I take that one? In terms of the expectations for '17, before I kind of run through the markets, one thing to keep in mind, as Tim noted, is for the most part, over the last 3 years, I'd say supply has been, call it, stretched out, if you want to think about it that way, where expected deliveries are pushed off into the subsequent period. But in terms of what we're seeing for 2017 right now across our markets, the expectations we're going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 2% of inventory. And the way that breaks down, to give you some perspective, is the New England market, it's about 2.5, Metro New York, New Jersey, around 1.8, Mid-Atlantic, high 2s, Pacific Northwest, still elevated, up at 3.7, northern Cal, mid-2s, and Southern Cal, kind of the mid-1% range. My expectation is those are going to trend down as we digest numbers and refresh our supply pipeline when we get to January. One thing to keep in mind is some of those deals are in the pipeline and is projected starts, but when people start looking at their numbers and construction cost up quite a bit over the last couple of years of processing a deal, and then a tightening that we've seen in the financial markets as we look at the construction lending and a little bit on the equity side as well, yes, some of those aren't going to make."

And people are in a year[ph] leases and things like that, so it typically takes a year or two for that phenomenon really to occur. If you think about the early part of this cycle, San Francisco outperformed quite a while and San Jose as well, but for the East Bay sort of caught up, and East Bay has been outperforming in the last couple of years of the cycle."

We're really not funding acquisitions through expansion of the balance sheet. It's really portfolio management. So essentially, we are in the market when we think that there are assets that are attractively priced. And if we find assets that we like, then we can always fund those through incremental dispositions. And we've wound up this year selling more than we probably plan to sell at the beginning of the year because we have been successful in finding some interesting acquisition candidates, so that doesn't really displace the development activity from a funding point of view. So that's the first thing. And then in terms of the specific deals, we have been concentrating in the Mid-Atlantic. For the most part, we sold down in the Mid-Atlantic back in '11 and '12, kind of saw the softness coming in the year, so we're actually under-allocated against our kind of our long-term targets. We haven't been as actively developing in this market through the cycle either. So the one deal we bought in South Arlington has been allocated to the retail we can basically, it's a low 5[ph] cap, 330,000 units for concrete frame construction that's 8 and 9 or 8 or 9 years old, that's below replacement costs for that submarket, so we saw a pretty compelling by that's a submarket that suffered some in the last couple of years, and we think it's bottomed down and we're starting to see positive revenue growth there again, so we feel like it was a well-timed acquisition and should be a great investment. The other deal we bought, just completed the lease-up. It's a smaller deal in North Hollywood, and that -- the other region I'd say we're under-allocated too at this point is Southern California. It's been more difficult there because cap rates are quite a bit lower than there in the Mid-Atlantic, but still, that deal, we think it's a low 4s cap. And after allocating it to the retail, we think the basis in the residential is about 400,000 units, which again is a pretty compelling basis for that location. And that's a submarket where we are looking for more exposure where we see a lot of good things happening and where we think that we're in a good point of the cycle there."

It's really going to be what Tim said, which is a function of job growth, whats happening in the economic environment that will determine rent change, performance, and ultimately, revenue performance, but supply is expected to continue. And as it relates to our specific portfolio in New York City, really what you worry about is supply being delivered in Midtown West is impacting us, that's probably the bulk of it. There are some supply in Long Island City, but it's more downtown than on the waterfront, and Long Island City is actually performing quite well. The other market that we're probably start to see more pressure is in Brooklyn as more deliveries in Brooklyn next year as compared to this year, for the most part has been a relatively light year in deliveries. It's just starting to pick up in Q4. So that's sort of the broad picture in New York. As it relates to Northern California, also expect to see a pickup in deliveries in Northern California next year, about 40, 50 basis points as compared to 2016. It goes from about 1 8 to 2 3. Again, we're going to be massaging those numbers as we get to December and January, and a number of those deals are already in the construction, of course, but the most part, what we've seen is that those deals have been delayed in terms of actually getting through the system, getting everything signed off, et cetera. But if you look at where the deliveries are going to be concentrated, it's sort of the same places really in terms of what's happening in midmarket, submarket, et cetera. So in terms of our portfolio in Mission Bay assets, $55 million will continue to be impacted in 2017. I don't have the quarterly breakdown for '18 at this point.

But from at this point standpoint, I guess I'd say a few things. When we start Columbus circle and the Hollywood deal, we'll actually have less than 100 million of land on the balance sheet, which actually is a cyclical low and maybe in the last -- maybe little in the last 2 cycles. So a part of the discipline has been around managing that land exposure from a in terms of when you actually buy the land versus optional land. And then secondly, as we've been talking about over the last few quarters is how we capitalize the deals once we do start them. As I mentioned, we're around 85% match funded without consideration of any free cash flow right now. So in effect, we've already capitalized what's already and that's has been. As we get later and later in the cycle, we'll continue to be conservative with how we manage that exposure of our funding commitments. So it's going to be so I would spend on how attractive the deals are relative to the capital environment at this time. But as we said on one of the slides that we showed one of the slides, over the last 20 years as a public company, we had demonstrated we can continue to create value through all phases of the cycle as long as you are disciplined about how you bring those deals into the pipeline, and ultimately, how you capitalize them."

Yes, I guess the point here, and part of the slide is being a good or a skilled capital allocator is much of sort of timing and being tactically smart. And by the way, this is all investment, so it isn't just development. This would include acquisitions, to be clear. And interestingly, the return on acquisitions aren't materially different than development which sort of speaks to being highly disciplined sort of in terms of investing earlier in the cycle with respect to acquisitions. I mentioned in my our comments, we made more money where we've been the longest, Northern California and Mid-Atlantic, so a part of that is just understanding the markets, having deeper relationships, being confident that you are focused on the right deals at the right time at the right time of the cycle, which only comes through experience and track record, in our view. So I think -- and then last thing I'd say is, this is only through Q3 of 2014. So I think if you look at Seattle in particular just given some of our recent deals that have completed, those numbers actually won't go up from what you see there of around 10.3%. In the case of Southern California, you're just starting at such a low going in yield. Cap rate compression has really occurred throughout really all of our markets, and probably, through all market nationally. And if anything, where you've probably seeing it is probably more cap rate compression on the urban product than there has been in the suburban products. That's probably been -- it hasn't been geographical as much as it's been submarket focused. But again, it comes down -- we're looking at managing to total return, and sometimes, that's investing in higher-yielding slower growth markets. Sometime, it's lower yielding, higher growth markets. And I think this chart just really reflects that."

In terms of my comment earlier about people moving from the East Bay to back into the city or back into San Jose, my response is really that we've seen a little bit of that, but it's not a meaningful number at this point given things have decelerated in San Francisco obviously pretty quickly that if someone was considering living in San Francisco at this time last year relative to the East Bay, that is a pretty expensive proposition, and whether you can start to see meaningful deceleration in the second half of this year in that market, people sign 1-year leases, they typically lag a year or two before they say, okay, the rents have really come down. I think that's the right kind of trade to make. And my point was during the beginning part of the cycle, San Francisco and San Jose outperformed quite a while before the East Bay caught up. And then the East Bay has been outperforming in the last couple of years, so you would expect that in the opposite direction as the market decelerates. And in terms of the comment about demand. I mean, certainly, as Tim pointed out, is the weaker economic environment, and I think many of us anticipated, which has resulted in lower job growth across the markets, with the exception probably of Seattle and Northern California has not been immune from that, so there's certainly a weaker demand profile in Northern California. It just so happens to be at a time when we have meaningful supply being delivered in San Francisco, and therefore, you're seeing  month to 2-month concession sort of a norm on all of the new deliveries in San Francisco as an example."

I think historically, if you look at our markets, we've been able to generate roughly 70, 75 basis points stronger growth than inflation or as nationally spend probably a little bit closer to inflation, and that's equated into a kind of high 2%, maybe just sub-3% kind of rent growth. And so we're talking about equilibrium, that's the kind of rate of growth we expect to see. We obviously started this year well above that trend. And so while we have seen moderation, our view has been it's been moderating more towards an industry that approach demand and supply being roughly equal after 6 years of really an imbalance, it's kind of what you would expect after a while and capital market where capital should flow freely to businesses that are sustaining outperformance."

Most of the rental has been, I mean most of the multifamily that has been built has been purpose built as rental. And so right now, you have an industry that's generating about 1.2 million houses, new units, against demand that's about 1.2 million, about 2/3 of that is single-family, which is the only purpose built for sale, and about 1/3 of that is multifamily, which is purpose built as rental.

But we think, tactically, it's not a bad time to be buying there, and we have been a little under-allocated since we did the bid kind of in early 2010, earlier this decade.

So no, Michael. I guess certainly from a financing point of view in the private market, things are tightening up a little bit, particularly in the construction area, as many of you are well aware already. So I think from a supply standpoint longer-term, that is a bit of a headwind for those who are looking to add new supply in the private side and finance it in the debt markets, particularly for small less more capitalized developers, pricing in construction financing has probably moved beyond 300 basis points over LIBOR, which it affects, of course, what kind of deal is. And then you've got the OTC which is -- it's pushing things to lend less on real estate. And the regulatory environment for banks has become more expensive for them to be active in the construction market and be profitable. So I think you're seeing that getting construction financing, particularly in some of these urban submarket, is a lot more difficult than it has been before. For stabilized financing, the GSEs certainly have been active for the uncapped business. There is certainly availability that's mostly affordable and the types of opportunities. I think they do expect a record production year. The caps have been lifted a number of times, but their interest in Class A product is more modest, as you are well aware. Nonetheless, banks and insurance companies have been pretty active, while CMBs has been far less so due to the risk retention rule. So I think when you step back in time to some of the comments Tim made, the capital is there deals that makes sense, but it's certainly not plentiful now as it has been in recent years on the debt market side. And I think probably, a lot of -- on the equity side, joint venture, sources of capital have been a lot more difficult because, A, and we've been seeing the same headlines about supply in some of the markets that are out there, so they're probably a little bit more cautious, but at the same time, relative to some other sectors in real estate, multifamily even at trend level, revenue growth does provide pretty healthy returns that one can reasonably bank on achieving over the long term."

I mean openings are higher than hires right now which is putting which is a good thing from wage growth standpoint which allows pay higher rents for sure, but it does seem to be that there maybe a growing disconnect between kind of what jobs are open versus the availability of labor to fill them. Certainly, as you look at college graduates, the unemployment, more for employment for sure, people who have college degrees, and that is the majority of our residents. So you may not see as much job growth there, Neil, for that reason over the next year or 2.

So taken a snap shot of lost lease, at this moment in time doesn't necessarily represent how you want to think about rent growth for next year, so I think you've really got sort of model it in a way is that you'd look at typical trajectory of rents from the trough late in the fourth quarter to the peak to the fall in August, and then determine how much you think you're going to get during that period of time that will then ripple through this expirations, so that's how we think about it more so than we've got x percent or x dollars sort of rent at this moment based on today's market rent if that makes sense.

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I will be providing management commentary in the slides that we posted yesterday after the market closed, and all of this will be available for Q&A afterwards.
My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q3, year-to-date results, our outlook for 2016, a look at fundamentals, and lastly, an update on investment activity and a look back on our capital allocation track record.
So let's start on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth of 7.3% from a combination of same-store NOI growth of over 4% and healthy contributions continuing from new lease-ups. Year-to-date core FFO per share is up over 9%. And in Q3, we raised over $1 billion in new capital, including the October bond deal and disposition activity, to fund ongoing, and the upcoming development and to pay off maturing debt.
Turning to Slide 5, our updated outlook for the year. We have updated our outlook for FFO and same-store metrics. Core FFO per share has been reduced by $0.05 per share or 70 basis points for the full year to 8.3%, due to a combination of factors, including same-store revenue growth being trimmed by around 12 basis points from our midyear forecast from a mix of lower-projected occupancy and rate for Q4. Secondly, a higher same-store operating expenses, related primarily to higher utility costs and delayed resolution of several tax appeals. Thirdly, lower redevelopment NOI. And lastly, higher interest rate -- higher interest related costs in connection with our recent $650 million bond deal that we completed earlier this month.
Turning now to Slide 6. We thought we'd spend a couple of minutes on fundamentals that are shaping portfolio performance and the overall outlook for the apartment sector. GDP and job growth, as many of you know, continued to decelerate. GDP growth has been below 1.5% now for the last 3 quarters, while job growth is running more than 20% less than its cyclical peak and well off last year's pace so far year-to-date. Lower corporate profits and business confidence is resulting in less investment in labor and capital, as businesses appear reluctant to make new commitments.
Turning to Slide 7. While businesses are slowing down, the consumer appears to still be in good shape. The labor market continues to tighten with more job openings helping to contribute to an improved wage picture. Consumers' balance sheets are in the best shape in many years. And these trends are contributing to cyclically high consumer confidence, which in turn is helping to drive stronger household formation, which is running north of 1 million per year after lingering at generational lows earlier this cycle.
Turning to Slide 8. Longer term, secular trends should continue to support apartment demand. Young adult job growth is outpacing the U.S. average, driven obviously by strong growth in this age cohort. This generation is marrying and having children later. And unsurprisingly, we have seen a strongest household formation for singles and couples as 1- and 2-person households have been responsible for more than 80% of all net new households formed so far this cycle.
Homeownership rates have in turn continued to fall through this segment, helping to stimulate healthy apartment demand in this cycle. While the leading edge of millennials are now in their mid-30s, the largest part of this generation are still in their mid-20s and are expected to stimulate renter demand for several years.
So overall, despite slower economic activity, demand fundamentals are still healthy for the housing market in general and for the apartment sector, specifically.
Turning to Slide 9. Let's take a look at what these trends mean for our markets. So far this cycle, from 2010 to 2015, we've benefited from a significant imbalance between demand and supply. This slide looks at this in a couple of ways. On the left, we look at the broader housing picture, as household formation significantly outpaced housing starts during this period. And on the right, job growth outpaced new apartment deliveries by roughly 2x. So in the first part of the cycle, through 2015, demand has run well above supply and apartment rents have grown well above the long-term trend.
Going forward, over the next 2 to 3 years, and you can see from the right-hand side of both those charts, through 2018, we expect demand and supply to be more in balance, reflecting an industry moving toward equilibrium after years of significant outperformance.
Turning to Slide 10. That notion is certainly reflected in recent rent performance across our markets and in our same-store portfolio. Overall, market rent growth according to Axiometrics has declined from around 5% to 2% to 3% over the last 4 to 5 quarters. Similarly, in our same-store portfolio, we've seen same unit rent growth decline from over 6% to 3% to 4% range during that same time, where the levels that are closer to historical average.
Turning to Slide 11. And double-clicking through on our portfolio a bit here, you can see a couple of other trends. First, we are seeing convergence in performance between East and West, as the differentials in rent growth have narrowed by around 300 basis points over the last year, driven mainly by deceleration in Northern California and some improvement in the Mid-Atlantic. And second, and as we've been discussing in recent quarters, rent growth in the suburbs continues to outpace that in urban submarkets by around 200 basis points given this concentration of the new supply in urban centers.
Let's turn now to investment activity and to Slide 12. Lease-up performance continues to be strong as rents are roughly 200 basis points above pro forma and yields are 30 basis points higher. And with yields well above prevailing cap rates and our marginal cost of capital, new development is contributing meaningfully to NAV and earnings growth well into the current cycle.
Turning to Slide 13. And as discussed a couple of quarters ago, this really has been the case during our life as a public company. This slide depicts development performance across various phases of the cycle since 1995. The strongest performance generally occurs during the expansion phase for sure, but has been healthy even when new development has delivered into the downturn. We believe this speaks to our capability in this area and our disciplined approach to allocating capital to this activity.
Turning now to Slide 14. In addition, we continue to be disciplined in how we capitalize new development commitments. Excluding the benefit of any free cash flow or retained earnings we may enjoy, we're still currently 85% match-funded against our $3.1 billion pipeline, that is we've already raised most of the permanent capital for this bucket of assets well in advance of it producing operating cash flow. So as this development stabilizes, it will add meaningfully to future growth and free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 15 and shifting gears a bit. We thought it might be helpful to briefly review our capital allocation track record over our life as a public company. What we understand that there's a lot of focus right now in moderating fundamentals and the impacts on portfolio performance. We are investing in long-lived assets with an aim to deliver outside total returns over the long run.
As you can see on this chart, over the last 20-plus years, we've been able to generate strong investment and returns with an unlevered IRRs of around 13%. A few points worth noting here. First, we've been able to deliver healthy returns, double-digit IRRs across all of our regions. Second, we generated strong IRRs across both urban and the suburban submarkets. Third, we generated the highest returns in markets where we have the longest tenure, the Mid-Atlantic and Northern California. And our business tenure matters in terms of market intelligence, experience, reputation and relationships. And lastly, while these returns represent a mix of unrealized or projected returns and realized returns, the average is consistent with what has been realized through our dispositions over the last 10 years, as shown on the Attachment 12 of this release.
Now lastly, turning to Slide 16. This long-term track record has certainly extended to the current cycle. So far, this cycle, we've delivered around $4.5 billion of new development at yields that have generated initial NAV accretion of around $2 billion and healthier earnings accretion, contributing to annual compounded growth and core FFO of almost 13% over the last 6 years, a period of time when core FFO per share has more than doubled and dividends have grown by more than 50%.
So in summary, while we are seeing some moderation in fundamentals, it appears that we are settling into a period of equilibrium as the economic expansion plays out. Of course, submarkets and some markets will outperform, while others might lag, but overall, demand and supply seemed to be roughly in balance and projected to remain that way over the next 2 to 3 years. And as we move into the later stages of a very healthy apartment cycle, we continue to exercise a disciplined approach to capital allocation, both in how we raise and deploy capital. And that should allow us to generate solid earnings and NAV growth that will help us outperform.
And with that, Jessica, we'd be happy to open the call for some questions."

And it's really just a function of when those deals work their way through the system and are ready to start, so we haven't -- I wouldn't say our view has changed in any material way in terms of the attractiveness or the profitability of the development platform. We're still adding new development rights through the course of the year. They're still kind at the same current economics. Again, we underwrite kind of today's rents and costs and expenses that don't really trend, but we're still seeing, on average, our development rights pipeline underwriting to about a mid 6s yield, some variation by region, but that's been pretty consistent really for the last several years. The only thing that's really potentially changed is just different deals will move around quarter-to-quarter. So whether we wind up with this start volume for the total year that we expected at the beginning of the year, probably just depends on what happens with the Columbus Circle deal and whether that starts this quarter or it may slip into the first quarter of next year."

So in terms of overall economics on a current basis, as Matt mentioned, we haven't seen a big change. We published the deals that completed this quarter that stabilized at a 6.4. We've got about $2.5 billion that are under construction that we still estimate at 6.4 and that's what most of that pipeline not remarked to market yet, which we would anticipate that to gravitate up and then just the deals we've been putting under our contract in 2016, which probably has been a little bit of a surprise that they have been as attractive as we -- from an economic standpoint as they've been are kind of consistent with those kinds of returns. So the assumptions are always based upon what we're seeing in the markets today. And I think that's what Matt meant in terms of our underlying assumptions haven't changed in terms of how they're derived."

Why don't I give you an overview of the change from the midyear guidance that we provided as compared to what we provided last night, if that's helpful. But the growth change, if you look at, call it combined third quarter and fourth quarter or back-half of the year, represents around $2.6 million, $2.7 million. About a third of that is timing-related. And the majority of that ties to 3 tax appeals in L.A. County that were scheduled and anticipated to occur in Q4 that looks like they're going to slip into Q1 and in the balance of the timing-related component related to the start-up of a cold chain facility at one of our New York high-rise assets, that's been delayed a little bit. So about a third of it, we'll get. We're just going to get a prior closer to Q1 as opposed to Q4. But in terms of the absolute amount of the change, it's about 70 basis points, if you look at the midyear guidance we provided, basically, around 2.4%, that where we're at 3.1% today. The major components are the utilities, it's about $1.8 million, taxes around $700,000, and then there's a couple of hundred thousand related to insurance and payroll. Again, that's sort of comparing back-half of 2016 as compared to our midyear re-forecast, so a big chunk of it again is timing-related, but those are the primary drivers of a difference as compared to what we had said earlier at midyear."

Obviously, in New York, you probably see a greater use of concession given some of the legal rent issues that surround that market. And then in certain situations where we think there may be just the bulk of deliveries that's coming through in a particular quarter or 2 that sort of impacts the then current environment, and we want to take sort of a temporary hit as opposed to the full 12 months in reducing the rents when it comes to lease renewal for those customers, that we tend to use. But in terms of the concessions that we granted in the third quarter, it's about $440,000, about 50% of it was in San Francisco, about another 25% was in the Pacific Northwest, which is in a healthy market, but it tends to be a market where there is just a greater use of concessions. So we used concessions last year, we used concessions this year. It's just sort of the nature of the barter in Seattle. But if you look at the year-over-year change, about 85% of the year-over-year increase is really in San Francisco, and that's primarily concentrated at the Mission Bay assets, a little bit at 55 Ninth, a little bit at Ocean Avenue, which are competing with more than new deliveries."

In terms of a bleeding through the portfolio, I mean the softer market environment this year, obviously, has already started to bleed through the portfolio, which was our original expectation at the beginning of the year in the guidance that we provided. The rate at which it bleeds through the portfolio really is a function of a couple of different things. For the most part, it really does depend on turnover rates, because if you're turning over say a 54% or a 55% of the portfolio every year, that's going to get mark-to-market to some degree, and then the balance of it really is in renewals. And historically, we have seen more pricing power with renewals relative to new move-ins because of switching costs and things of that sort. So it takes a period of time for that to happen. So obviously, in some markets we are seeing rents go down relative to this point last year, I'd say, particularly in the markets like San Francisco or a little bit in New York City, but we're seeing overall positive rent change currently in those markets, I'd say, due to 2 reasons. One is we probably are performing slightly better than the market average in those markets. And secondly, it's just a function of the renewals versus new move-ins that I described previously."

But I think we show on Slide 9 that we think it's roughly about -- and if you look at the overall housing picture, we're starting at between 1.1 million and 1.2 million units per year, and about 400,000 of those are multifamily, almost all of those are rental. That's about -- on a percentage basis, that's about what you're seeing in terms of renter propensities right now. It just seems like the market is producing housing that's consistent with what we're seeing at -- from a marginal demand standpoint which autotranslate into inflation or maybe a little bit better in terms of rent growth. And I think if you're seeing tightness anywhere, it's probably more in the for-sale arena where there's still being kind of 5% kind of growth in value. So we're not seeing too much supply in terms of the overall housing picture. We are seeing pockets of oversupply for sure, and we've talked about those markets, and so some will leave and some will lag. But overall, based upon an economy that's growing at, call it, 2%, and jobs that are growing around 1.5%, and supply that's been delivered into the market at about 1.5% of, that just looks like equilibrium to us, so supply being roughly equivalent to demand."

One, I think the projection for '17 are probably going to prove out to be too high again because it just seems like supply just gets delayed. Some of the supply, I think, over the last couple of years, 15% to 20% of what we're expected hitting that year ended up getting delayed.

But in terms of what we're seeing for 2017 right now across our markets, the expectations we're going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 2% of inventory. And the way that breaks down, to give you some perspective, is the New England market, it's about 2.5%, Metro New York-New Jersey around 1.8%, Mid-Atlantic high 2s, Pacific Northwest, still elevated, up at 3.7%, Northern Cal mid-2s, and Southern Cal, kind of in the mid-1% range. My expectation is those are going to trend down as we digest numbers and refresh our supply pipeline when we get to January. One thing to keep in mind is some of those deals are in the pipeline as projected starts, but when people start looking at their numbers and are seeing construction costs up quite a bit over the last couple of years they've been processing a deal, and then a tightening that we've seen in the financial markets as we it relates to construction lending and a little bit on the equity side as well, yes, some of those deals probably just aren't going to make."

We're really not funding acquisitions through expansion of the balance sheet. It's really portfolio management. So essentially, we are in the market when we think that there are assets that are attractively priced. And if we find assets that we like, then we can always fund those through incremental dispositions. And we've wound up this year selling more than we probably planned to sell at the beginning of the year because we have been successful in finding some interesting acquisition candidates, so that doesn't really displace the development activity from a funding point of view. So that's the first thing. And then in terms of the specific deals, we have been concentrating in the Mid-Atlantic. For the most part, we sold down in the Mid-Atlantic back in '11 and '12, kind of saw the softness coming here. So we're actually under-allocated against our kind of our long-term targets. We haven't been as actively developing in this market through the cycle either. So the one deal we bought in South Arlington has been allocated to the retail we -- basically, it's a low 5 cap, 330,000 units for concrete frame construction that's 8 or 9 years old, that's below replacement costs for that submarket, so we felt that as a pretty compelling by that's a submarket that's suffered some in the last couple of years, and we think has bottomed out, and we're starting to see positive revenue growth there again, so we feel like it was a well-timed acquisition and should be a great investment. The other deal we bought, just completed the lease-up. It's a smaller deal in North Hollywood, and that -- the other region I'd say we're under-allocated to at this point is Southern California. It's been more difficult there because cap rates are quite a bit lower than there in the Mid-Atlantic, but still that deal, we think it's a low 4s cap. And after allocating to the retail, we think the basis in the residential is about 400,000 units, which again is a pretty compelling basis for that location. And that's a submarket where we are looking for more exposure where we see a lot of good things happening and where we think that we're in a good point in the cycle there."

It's really going to be what Tim said, which is a function of job growth, what's happening in the economic environment that will determine rent change performance and ultimately revenue performance, but supply is expected to continue. And as it relates to our specific portfolio in New York City, really what you worry about is supply being delivered. And Midtown West is impacting us, that's probably the bulk of it. There's some supply in Long Island City, but it's more downtown than on the waterfront, and Long Island City is actually performing quite well. The other market that we'll probably going to start to see more pressure is in Brooklyn. There's more deliveries in Brooklyn next year as compared to this year. For the most part it's been a relatively light year in deliveries. It's just starting to pick up in Q4. So that sort of the broad picture in New York. As it relates to Northern California, also expect to see a pickup in deliveries in Northern California next year about 40 or 50 basis points as compared to 2016. It goes from about 1.8% to 2.3%. Again, we're going to be massaging those numbers as we get to December and January. A number of those deals are already under construction, of course. But for the most part what we have seen is that those deals have been delayed in terms of actually getting through the system, getting everything signed off, et cetera. But if you look at where the deliveries are going to be concentrated, it's sort of the same place as really in terms of what's happening in the mid-market, south market, et cetera. So in terms of our portfolio, the Mission Bay assets and 55 Ninth will continue to be impacted in 2017. I don't have the quarterly breakdown for '18 at this point. It's probably a little premature to talk about it, but by January we'll have a pretty good outline of that."

But from a discipline standpoint, I guess, I'd say a few things. One, once we start the Columbus Circle and the Hollywood deal, we'll actually have less than $100 million of land on the balance sheet, which actually is a cyclical low in maybe over the last 2 cycles. So part of the discipline has been around managing that land exposure from -- in terms of when you actually buy the land versus optional land. And then secondly, as we've been talking about over the last few quarters is how we capitalize the deals once we do start them. As I mentioned we're around 85% match-funded without consideration of any free cash flow right now. So in effect, we've already capitalized what's already been started and not just in -- as we get later and later in the cycle, we'll continue to be conservative with how we manage that -- the exposure of unfunded commitments. So it's going to be -- so much depends on how attractive the deals are relative to the capital environment at this time. But as we said on one of the slides, and we showed this in one of the slides, over the last 20 years as a public company, we had demonstrated you can continue to create value through all phases of the cycle as long as you are disciplined about how you bring those deals into the pipeline and ultimately how you capitalize them."

Yes, I guess, the point here, and part of the slide is being a good or a skilled capital allocator is as much about sort of timing and being tactically smart. And by the way, this is all investment, so it isn't just development. This would include acquisitions, to be clear. And interestingly, our -- the return on acquisitions aren't materially different than development, which sort of speaks to being highly disciplined sort of in terms of investing earlier in the cycle with respect to acquisitions. I mentioned in our comments, we've made more money where we've been the longest, Northern California and Mid-Atlantic. So part of that is just understanding the markets, having deeper relationships, being confident that you're focused on the right deals at the right time of the cycle, which only comes through experience and track record, in our view. So I think -- and then the last thing I'd say is this is only through Q3 of 2014. So I think if you looked at Seattle, in particular, just given some of our recent deals that have completed, those numbers actually will go up from what you see there, of around 10.3%. In the case of Southern California, you're just starting at such a low going in yield. Cap rate compression has really occurred throughout really all of our markets, probably through all the markets nationally. And if anything, where you have probably seen it is there's probably more cap rate compression on the urban product than there has been in the suburban product. So it's probably been -- it probably hasn't been geographical as much as it had been submarket-focused. But again, it comes down -- we're looking at managing to total return. And sometimes that's investing in higher-yielding, slower-growth market. Sometimes it's lower-yielding, higher-growth markets. And I think this chart just really reflects that."

A couple of things. In terms of my comment earlier about people moving from the East Bay or back end of the city or back end of San Jose, my response is really that we've seen a little bit of that, but it's not a meaningful number at this point, given things have decelerated in San Francisco, obviously, pretty quickly that if someone was considering living in San Francisco at this time last year relative to the East Bay, that's a pretty expensive proposition. And whether you've started to see meaningful deceleration in the second half of this year in that market, people sign 1-year leases, they typically lag a year or 2 before they say, ""Okay. The rents have really come down. I think that's the right kind of trade to make."" And my point was during the beginning part of the cycle, San Francisco and San Jose outperformed quite a while before the East Bay caught up and then the East Bay has been outperforming the last couple of years. So you would expect that to occur just in the opposite direction as the market decelerates. And in terms of the comment about demand. I mean certainly as Tim pointed out, it is a weaker economic environment than, I think, many of us anticipated, which has resulted in lower job growth across the markets with the exception probably of Seattle. And Northern California has not been immune from that. So there's certainly a weaker demand profile in Northern California that just so happens to be at a time when we have meaningful supply being delivered in San Francisco and, therefore, you're seeing 1-month or 2-month concession sort of the norm on all the new deliveries in San Francisco, as an example."

And that's equated into kind of high 2%, maybe just sub-3% kind of rent growth. And so when we're talking about equilibrium, that's the kind of rate of growth we expect to see. We obviously started this year well above that trend. And so while we had seen moderation, it's -- our view has been it's been moderating more towards an industry that's starting to approach demand and supply being roughly equal after 6 years of really an imbalance.

Most of the rental has been -- I mean, most of the multifamily that has been built has been purpose-built as rental. And so right now, you have an industry that's generating about 1.2 million houses, new units, against demand that's about 1.2 million. About 2/3 of that is single-family, which is the only purpose-built is for sale, and about 1/3 of that is multifamily, which is purpose-built as rental. The numbers almost can't be more imbalanced than that. And that kind of -- so we look at -- we're going from an industry that's been out of balance, where rental housing demand has been close to 80% or more of total housing demand kind of in early years of the cycle to where it seems like we've found a new -- sort of a new normal, if you will.

And to the extent that it comes to a fruition, Mountain View, overall, when you look at the assets that are impacted, it would impact around 9% to 10% of our Northern California revenue in terms of the specific assets that fit the vintage that would be governed by the proposed ordinance.

Did that sequential acceleration in those suburban markets surprise you? Or is it something that was in the underwriting?"

But we think, tactically, it's not a bad time to be buying there, and we had been a little under-allocated since we did the Telfair [ph] bid kind of in early 2010 -- earlier this decade. So it's probably from a market standpoint, it's probably still D.C. and Southern California because those are markets where we could probably still spend a little bit more allocation and we don't think, from a market condition standpoint and a cycle standpoint, it's too bad of a time to be investing a little bit more capital and trimming in some other areas."

So no, Michael, I guess, certainly from a financing point of view in the private market, things are tightening up a little bit, particularly in the construction area, as many of you are well aware already. So I think from a supply standpoint longer term, that is a bit of a headwind for those who are looking to add new supply in the private side and finance it in the debt markets, particularly for small, less well-capitalized developers, pricing in construction financing has probably moved beyond 300 basis points over LIBOR, which it affects, of course, what kind of deal is pencil. And then you've got the OTC, which is -- it's pushing banks to lend less on real estate. And the regulatory environment for banks has become more expensive for them to be active in the construction market and be profitable. So I think you're seeing that getting construction financing, particularly in some of these urban submarkets, is a lot more difficult than it has been before. For stabilized financing, the GSEs certainly have been active. For the uncapped business, there is certainly availability that's mostly affordable and the types of opportunities. I think they do expect a record production year. The caps have been lifted a number of times, but their interest in Class A product is more modest, as you are well aware. Nonetheless, banks and insurance companies have been pretty active, while CMBS has been far less so due to the risk retention rule. So I think when you step back in time to some of the comments that Tim made, the capital is there for deals that makes sense, but it's certainly not plentiful now as it has been in recent years on the debt market side. And I think probably, a lot of -- on the equity side, joint venture, sources of capital have been a lot more disciplined because, A, like you and we have been seeing the same headlines about supply in some of the markets that are out there, so they're probably a little bit more cautious, but at the same time, relative to some other sectors in real estate, multifamily even at trend level, revenue growth does provide pretty healthy returns that one can reasonably bank on achieving over the long term."

I mean, openings are higher than hires right now, which is putting -- which is a good thing from wage growth standpoint, which allows people to pay higher rents for sure. But it does seem to be that there may be a growing disconnect between kind of what jobs are open versus the availability of labor to fill them. Certainly, as you look at college graduates, the unemployment -- we're at full employment, for sure, people who have college degrees, and that is the majority of our residents. So you may not see as much job growth there, Neil, for that reason over the next 2 -- a year or 2 and I think it's likely to sort of be mixed up and closer to population growth.

So taking a snapshot of loss lease, at this moment in time doesn't necessarily represent how you want to think about rent growth for next year. So I think you've really got to sort of model it in a way is that you'd look at typical trajectory of rents from the trough late in the fourth quarter to the peak, to the fall in August, and then determine how much you think you're going to get during that period of time that will then ripple through lease expirations.

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I will be providing management commentary in the slides that we posted yesterday after the market closed, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.
My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q3, year-to-date results, our outlook for 2016, a look at fundamentals, and lastly, an update on investment activity and a look back on our capital allocation track record.
So let's start on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth of 7.3% from a combination of same-store NOI growth of over 4% and healthy contributions continuing from new lease-ups. Year-to-date core FFO per share is up over 9%. And in Q3, we raised over $1 billion in new capital, including the October bond deal and disposition activity, to fund ongoing, and the upcoming development and to pay off maturing debt.
Turning to Slide 5, our updated outlook for the year. We have updated our outlook for FFO and same-store metrics. Core FFO per share has been reduced by $0.05 per share or 70 basis points for the full year to 8.3%, due to a combination of factors, including same-store revenue growth being trimmed by around 12 basis points from our midyear forecast from a mix of lower-projected occupancy and rate for Q4. Secondly, a higher same-store operating expenses, related primarily to higher utility costs and delayed resolution of several tax appeals. Thirdly, lower redevelopment NOI. And lastly, higher interest rate -- higher interest related costs in connection with our recent $650 million bond deal that we completed earlier this month.
Turning now to Slide 6. We thought we'd spend a couple of minutes on fundamentals that are shaping portfolio performance and the overall outlook for the apartment sector. GDP and job growth, as many of you know, continued to decelerate. GDP growth has been below 1.5% now for the last 3 quarters, while job growth is running more than 20% less than its cyclical peak and well off last year's pace so far year-to-date. Lower corporate profits and business confidence is resulting in less investment in labor and capital, as businesses appear reluctant to make new commitments.
Turning to Slide 7. While businesses are slowing down, the consumer appears to still be in good shape. The labor market continues to tighten with more job openings helping to contribute to an improved wage picture. Consumers' balance sheets are in the best shape in many years. And these trends are contributing to cyclically high consumer confidence, which in turn is helping to drive stronger household formation, which is running north of 1 million per year after lingering at generational lows earlier this cycle.
Turning to Slide 8. Longer term, secular trends should continue to support apartment demand. Young adult job growth is outpacing the U.S. average, driven obviously by strong growth in this age cohort. This generation is marrying and having children later. And unsurprisingly, we have seen thea strongest household formation for singles and couples as 1- and 2-person households have been responsible for more than 80% of all net new households formed so far this cycle.
Homeownership rates have in turn continued to fall through this segment, helping to stimulate healthy apartment demand this cycle. While the leading edge of millennials are now in their mid-30s, the largest part of this generation are still in their mid-20s and are expected to stimulate renter demand for several years.
So overall, despite slower economic activity, demand fundamentals are still healthy for the housing market in general and for the apartment sector, specifically.
Turning to Slide 9. Let's take a look at what these trends mean for our markets. So far this cycle, from 2010 to 2015, we've benefited from a significant imbalance between demand and supply. This slide looks at this in a couple of ways. On the left, we look at the broader housing picture, as household formation significantly outpaced housing starts during this period. And on the right, job growth outpaced new apartment deliveries by roughly 2x. So in the first part of the cycle, through 2015, demand has run well above supply and apartment rents have grown well above the long-term trend.
Going forward, over the next 2 to 3 years, and you can see from the right-hand side of both those charts, through 2018, we expect demand and supply to be more in balance, reflecting an industry moving toward equilibrium after years of significant outperformance.
Turning to Slide 10. That notion is certainly reflected in recent rent performance across our markets and in our same-store portfolio. Overall, market rent growth according to Axiometrics has declined from around 5% to 2% to 3% over the last 4 to 5 quarters. Similarly, in our same-store portfolio, we've seen same unit rent growth decline from over 6% to 3% to 4% range during that same time, or to levels that are closer to historical average.
Turning to Slide 11. And double-clicking through on our portfolio a bit here, you can see a couple of other trends. First, we are seeing convergence in performance between East and West, as the differentials in rent growth have narrowed by around 300 basis points over the last year, driven mainly by deceleration in Northern California and some improvement in the Mid-Atlantic. And second, and as we've been discussing in recent quarters, rent growth in the suburbs continues to outpace that in urban submarkets by around 200 basis points given this concentration of the new supply in urban centers.
Let's turn now to investment activity and to Slide 12. Lease-up performance continues to be strong as rents are roughly 200 basis points above pro forma and yields are 30 basis points higher. And with yields well above prevailing cap rates and our marginal cost of capital, new development is contributing meaningfully to NAV and earnings growth well into the current cycle.
Turning to Slide 13. And as discussed a couple of quarters ago, this really has been the case during our life as a public company. This slide depicts development performance across various phases of the cycle since 1995. The strongest performance generally occurs during the expansion phase for sure, but has been healthy even when new development has delivered into the downturn. We believe this speaks to our capability in this area and our disciplined approach to allocating capital to this activity.
Turning now to Slide 14. In addition, we continue to be disciplined in how we capitalize new development commitments. Excluding the benefit of any free cash flow or retained earnings we may enjoy, we're still currently 85% match-funded against our $3.1 billion pipeline, that is, we've already raised most of the permanent capital for this bucket of assets well in advance of it producing operating cash flow. So as this development stabilizes, it will add meaningfully to future growth and free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 15 and shifting gears a bit. We thought it might be helpful to briefly review our capital allocation track record over our life as a public company. While we understand that there's a lot of focus right now in moderating fundamentals and the impacts on portfolio performance, we are investing in long-lived assets with an aim to deliver outside total returns over the long run.
As you can see on this chart, over the last 20-plus years, we've been able to generate strong investment returns with unlevered IRRs of around 13%. A few points worth noting here. First, we've been able to deliver healthy returns, double-digit IRRs across all of our regions. Second, we generated strong IRRs across both urban and suburban submarkets. Third, we generated the highest returns in markets where we have the longest tenure, the Mid-Atlantic and Northern California. In our business, tenure matters in terms of market intelligence, experience, reputation and relationships. And lastly, while these returns represent a mix of unrealized or projected returns and realized returns, the average is consistent with what has been realized through our dispositions over the last 10 years, as shown on the Attachment 12 of this release.
Now lastly, turning to Slide 16. This long-term track record has certainly extended to the current cycle. So far, this cycle, we've delivered around $4.5 billion of new development at yields that have generated initial NAV accretion of around $2 billion and healthier earnings accretion, contributing to annual compounded growth and core FFO of almost 13% over the last 6 years, a period of time when core FFO per share has more than doubled and dividends have grown by more than 50%.
So in summary, while we are seeing some moderation in fundamentals, it appears that we are settling into a period of equilibrium as the economic expansion plays out. Of course, submarkets and some markets will outperform, while others might lag, but overall, demand and supply seemed to be roughly in balance and projected to remain that way over the next 2 to 3 years. And as we move into the later stages of a very healthy apartment cycle, we continue to exercise a disciplined approach to capital allocation, both in how we raise and deploy capital. And that should allow us to generate solid earnings and NAV growth that will help us outperform.
And with that, Jessica, we'd be happy to open the call for some questions."

I can give you sort of a general overview of where we're seeing market performance relative to our midyear expectations if that's helpful. Obviously, it was a very modest reduction in terms of full year same-store revenue guidance. And essentially, where the shortfall is occurring is primarily in 4 places. It's Northern California; the greater New York region, including parts of New Jersey; the Mid-Atlantic; and then in Fairfield County. Those are the 4 main drivers of the shortfall relative to our original expectations. So it's not a meaningful difference, but enough that the adjustment was required."

It was always really in the plan that the starts were going to be backloaded this year. And it's really just a function of when those deals work their way through the system and are ready to start, so we haven't -- I wouldn't say our view has changed in any material way in terms of the attractiveness or the profitability of the development platform. We're still adding new development rights through the course of the year. They're still kind at the same current economics. Again, we underwrite to kind of today's rents and costs and expenses that don't really trend, but we're still seeing, on average, our development rights pipeline underwriting to about a mid-6s yield, some variation by region, but that's been pretty consistent really for the last several years. The only thing that's really potentially changed is just different deals will move around quarter-to-quarter. So whether we wind up with this start volume for the total year that we expected at the beginning of the year, probably just depends on what happens with the Columbus Circle deal and whether that starts this quarter or it may slip into the first quarter of next year."

I mean rents are continuing to increase in our markets generally, and it's a function of how it interplays with construction costs for sure. We are seeing some moderation in some markets on construction costs now. Land costs, as you know, has locked in. So in terms of overall economics on a current basis, as Matt mentioned, we haven't seen a big change. We published the deals that completed this quarter that stabilized at a 6.4. We've got about $2.5 billion that are under construction that we still estimate are at 6.4 and that's with most of that pipeline not remarked to market yet, which we would anticipate that to gravitate up and then just the deals we've been putting under our contract in 2016, which probably has been a little bit of a surprise that they have been as attractive as we -- from an economic standpoint as they've been are kind of consistent with those kinds of returns. So the assumptions are always based upon what we're seeing in the markets today. And I think that's what Matt meant in terms of our underlying assumptions haven't changed in terms of how they're derived."

Why don't I give you an overview of the change from the midyear guidance that we provided as compared to what we provided last night, if that's helpful. But the growth change, if you look at, call it combined third quarter and fourth quarter or back-half of the year, represents around $2.6 million, $2.7 million. About a third of that is timing-related. And the majority of that ties to 3 tax appeals in L.A. County that were scheduled and anticipated to occur in Q4 that looks like they're going to slip into Q1 and in the balance of the timing-related component related to the start-up of a [indiscernible]  facility at one of our New York high-rise assets, that's been delayed a little bit. So about a third of it, we'll get. We're just going to get it probably closer to Q1 as opposed to Q4. But in terms of the absolute amount of the change, it's about 70 basis points, if you look at the midyear guidance we provided, basically, around 2.4% to where we're at 3.1% today. The major components are the utilities, it's about $1.8 million, taxes around $700,000, and then there's a couple of hundred thousand related to insurance and payroll. Again, that's sort of comparing back-half of 2016 as compared to our midyear re-forecast, so a big chunk of it again is timing-related, but those are the primary drivers of the difference as compared to what we had said earlier at midyear."

For the most part, we don't use a lot of concessions, but we do use them in certain markets. And I'd say it depends on a couple of things, Nick. Obviously, in New York, you probably see a greater use of concession given some of the legal rent issues that surround that market. And then in certain situations where we think there may be just the bulk of deliveries that's coming through in a particular quarter or 2 that sort of impacts the then current environment, and we want to take sort of a temporary hit as opposed to the full 12 months in reducing the rents when it comes to lease renewal for those customers, that we tend to use. But in terms of the concessions that we granted in the third quarter, it's about $440,000, about 50% of it was in San Francisco, about another 25% was in the Pacific Northwest, which is in a healthy market, but it tends to be a market where there is just a greater use of concessions. So we used concessions last year, we used concessions this year. It's just sort of the nature of the barter in Seattle. But if you look at the year-over-year change, about 85% of the year-over-year increase is really in San Francisco, and that's primarily concentrated at the Mission Bay assets, a little bit at 55 Ninth, a little bit at Ocean Avenue, which are competing with more than new deliveries."

In terms of a bleeding through the portfolio, I mean the softer market environment this year, obviously, has already started to bleed through the portfolio, which was our original expectation at the beginning of the year in the guidance that we provided. The rate at which it bleeds into the portfolio really is a function of a couple of different things. For the most part, it really does depend on turnover rates, because if you're turning over, say, a 54% or a 55% of the portfolio every year, that's going to get mark-to-market to some degree, and then the balance of it really is in renewals. And historically, we have seen more pricing power with renewals relative to new move-ins because of switching costs and things of that sort. So it takes a period of time for that to happen. So obviously, in some markets we are seeing rents go down relative to this point last year, I'd say, particularly in markets like San Francisco or a little bit in New York City, but we're seeing overall positive rent change currently in those markets, I'd say, due to 2 reasons. One is we probably are performing slightly better than the market average in those markets. And secondly, it's just a function of the renewals versus new move-ins that I described previously."

I think it probably does vary by market and by asset type. And really,  it's a function of where the capital is most aggressive, so what we're finding is older assets to the value-added story, particularly on the West coast, it's still very, very deep. We probably sold an asset, Avalon Brandemoor, in the northern suburbs of Seattle and that was a sub-5 cap rate on an asset that was 15 years old, and a good submarket, but not one of the more sought-after submarkets in metro Seattle, and that's just a reflection of the fact there's a lot of value-added money chasing that story, if you will. In some other locations, I don't know, really, I couldn't tell you where Northern California cap rates are today. Obviously, there has been a lot of deceleration of NOI growth there, and we have not bought or sold anything in Northern Cal in a while. And I think asset volumes are down a little bit there because of that, so we haven't been selling kind of real core stuff, and that's where you might see the impacts felt more so, but we don't have any direct evidence to speak to that on either the buyer or the sell-side."

I mean, first of all, in terms of changes in guidance, it's really a reflection of it being a weaker economic environment than consensus or us have anticipated. So as the environment deteriorates further, and we are anticipating some moderation in both -- in job growth and an increase in supply in our markets over the next couple of years. But I think we show on Slide 9 that we think it's roughly about -- and if you look at the overall housing picture, we're starting at between 1.1 million and 1.2 million units per year, and about 400,000 of those are multifamily, almost all of those are rental. That's about -- on a percentage basis, that's about what you're seeing in terms of renter propensities right now. It just seems like the market is producing housing that's consistent with what we're seeing at -- from a marginal demand standpoint which ought to translate into inflation or maybe a little bit better in terms of rent growth. And I think if you're seeing tightness anywhere, it's probably more in the for-sale arena where there's still being kind of 5% kind of growth in value. So we're not seeing too much supply in terms of the overall housing picture. We are seeing pockets of oversupply for sure, and we've talked about those markets, and so some will leave and some will lag. But overall, based upon an economy that's growing at, call it, 2%, and jobs that are growing around 1.5%, and supply that's being delivered into the market at about 1.5% is soft, that just looks like equilibrium to us, so supply being roughly equivalent to demand."

But in terms of what we're seeing for 2017 right now across our markets, the expectation is we're going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 2% of inventory. And the way that breaks down, to give you some perspective, is the New England market, it's about 2.5%, Metro New York-New Jersey around 1.8%, Mid-Atlantic high 2s, Pacific Northwest, still elevated, up at 3.7%, Northern Cal mid-2s, and Southern Cal, kind of in the mid-1% range. My expectation is those are going to trend down as we digest numbers and refresh our supply pipeline when we get to January. One thing to keep in mind is some of those deals are in the pipeline as projected starts, but when people start looking at their numbers and are seeing construction costs up quite a bit over the last couple of years as they've been processing a deal, and then a tightening that we've seen in the financial markets as it relates to construction lending and a little bit on the equity side as well, yes, some of those deals probably just aren't going to make."

We're really not funding acquisitions through expansion of the balance sheet. It's really portfolio management. So essentially, we are in the market when we think that there are assets that are attractively priced. And if we find assets that we like, then we can always fund those through incremental dispositions. And we've wound up this year selling more than we probably planned to sell at the beginning of the year because we have been successful in finding some interesting acquisition candidates, so that doesn't really displace the development activity from a funding point of view. So that's the first thing. And then in terms of the specific deals, we have been concentrating in the Mid-Atlantic. For the most part, we sold down in the Mid-Atlantic back in '11 and '12, kind of saw the softness coming here. So we're actually under-allocated against our kind of long-term targets. We haven't been as actively developing in this market through this cycle either. So the one deal we bought in South Arlington, after you allocate to the retail we -- basically, it's a low 5 cap, 330,000 a unit for concrete frame construction that's 8 or 9 years old, that's below replacement costs for that submarket, so we felt that was a pretty compelling buy. That's a submarket that's suffered some in the last couple of years, and we think has bottomed out, and we're starting to see positive revenue growth there again, so we feel like it was a well-timed acquisition and should be a great investment. The other deal we bought, just completed a lease-up. It's a smaller deal in North Hollywood, and that -- the other region I'd say we're under-allocated to at this point is Southern California. It's been more difficult there because cap rates are quite a bit lower than they are in the Mid-Atlantic, but still that deal, we think it's a low 4s cap. And after allocating to the retail, we think the basis in the residential is about 400,000 a unit, which again is a pretty compelling basis for that location. And that's a submarket where we are looking for more exposure where we see a lot of good things happening and where we think that we're in at a good point in the cycle there."

Whether you could tie that back to rate of occupancy and say that we were too aggressive, I wouldn't necessarily say that. We were trying to push a bit. But to get the rate growth, you've got to have some of the occupancy. And if the occupancy didn't show up, you're just not going to get it. So I think it's really a blend of both. I wouldn't just tie it to 1 piece or the other."

And as it relates to our specific portfolio in New York City, really what you worry about is supply being delivered. And Midtown West is impacting us, that's probably the bulk of it. There's some supply in Long Island City, but it's more downtown than on the waterfront, and Long Island City is actually performing quite well. The other market that we're probably going to start to see more pressure is in Brooklyn. There's more deliveries in Brooklyn next year as compared to this year. For the most part it's been a relatively light year in deliveries. It's just starting to pick up in Q4. So that's sort of the broad picture in New York. As it relates to Northern California, also expect to see a pickup in deliveries in Northern California next year about 40 or 50 basis points as compared to 2016. It goes from about 1.8% to 2.3%. Again, we're going to be massaging those numbers as we get to December and January. A number of those deals are already under construction, of course. But for the most part what we have seen is that those deals have been delayed in terms of actually getting through the system, getting everything signed off, et cetera. But if you look at where the deliveries are going to be concentrated, it's sort of the same place as really in terms of what's happening in the mid-market, south market, et cetera. So in terms of our portfolio, the Mission Bay assets and 55 Ninth will continue to be impacted in 2017. I don't have the quarterly breakdown for '18 at this point. It's probably a little premature to talk about it, but by January we'll have a pretty good outline of that."

But from a discipline standpoint, I guess, I'd say a few things. One, once we start Columbus Circle and the Hollywood deal, we'll actually have less than $100 million of land on the balance sheet, which actually is a cyclical low in maybe over the last 2 cycles. So part of the discipline has been around managing that land exposure from -- in terms of when you actually buy the land versus optional land. And then secondly, as we've been talking about over the last few quarters is how we capitalize the deals once we do start them. As I mentioned, we're around 85% match-funded without consideration of any free cash flow right now. So in effect, we've already capitalized what's already been started and not just in -- as we get later and later in the cycle, we'll continue to be conservative with how we manage that -- the exposure of unfunded commitments. So it's going to be -- so much depends on how attractive the deals are relative to the capital environment at this time. But as we said on one of the slides, and we showed this -- one of the slides, over the last 20 years as a public company, we had demonstrated you can continue to create value through all phases of the cycle as long as you are disciplined about how you bring those deals into the pipeline and ultimately how you capitalize them."

Yes, I guess, the point here, and part of the slide is being a good or a skilled capital allocator is as much about sort of timing and being tactically smart. And by the way, this is all investment, so it isn't just development. This would include acquisitions, to be clear. And interestingly, our -- the return on acquisitions aren't materially different than development, which sort of speaks to being highly disciplined sort of in terms of investing earlier in the cycle with respect to acquisitions. I mentioned in our comments, we've made more money where we've been the longest, Northern California and Mid-Atlantic. So part of that is just understanding the markets, having deeper relationships, being confident that you're focused on the right deals at the right time of the cycle, which only comes through experience and track record, in our view. So I think -- and then the last thing I'd say is this is only through Q3 of 2014. So I think if you looked at Seattle, in particular, just given some of our recent deals that have completed, those numbers actually will go up from what you see there, of around 10.3%. In the case of Southern California, you're just starting at such a low going in yield. Cap rate compression has really occurred throughout really all of our markets, probably through all the markets nationally. And if anything, where you have probably seen it is there's probably more cap rate compression on the urban product than there has been in the suburban product. So it's probably been -- it probably hasn't been geographical as much as it had been submarket-focused. But again, it comes down -- we're looking at managing to total return. And sometimes that's investing in higher-yielding, slower-growth market. Sometimes it's lower-yielding, higher-growth markets. And I think this chart just really reflects that."

A couple of things. In terms of my comment earlier about people moving from the East Bay or back end of the city or back end of San Jose, my response is really that we've seen a little bit of that, but it's not a meaningful number at this point, given things have decelerated in San Francisco, obviously, pretty quickly that if someone was considering living in San Francisco at this time last year relative to the East Bay, that was a pretty expensive proposition. And whether you've started to see meaningful deceleration in the second half of this year in that market, people sign 1-year leases, they typically lag a year or 2 before they say, ""Okay. The rents have really come down. I think that's the right kind of trade to make."" And my point was during the beginning part of the cycle, San Francisco and San Jose outperformed quite a while before the East Bay caught up and then the East Bay has been outperforming the last couple of years. So you would expect that to occur just in the opposite direction as the market decelerates. And in terms of the comment about demand. I mean certainly as Tim pointed out, it is a weaker economic environment than, I think, many of us anticipated, which has resulted in lower job growth across the markets with the exception probably of Seattle. And Northern California has not been immune from that. So there's certainly a weaker demand profile in Northern California that just so happens to be at a time when we have meaningful supply being delivered in San Francisco and, therefore, you're seeing 1-month or 2-month concession sort of the norm on all the new deliveries in San Francisco, as an example."

And that's equated into kind of high 2%, maybe just sub-3% kind of rent growth. And so when we're talking about equilibrium, that's the kind of rate of growth we expect to see. We obviously started this year well above that trend. And so while we had seen moderation, it's -- our view has been it's been moderating more towards an industry that's starting to approach demand and supply being roughly equal after 6 years of really an imbalance.

And so right now, you have an industry that's generating about 1.2 million houses, new units, against demand that's about 1.2 million. About 2/3 of that is single-family, which is the only purpose-built as for sale, and about 1/3 of that is multifamily, which is purpose-built as rental. The numbers almost can't be more imbalanced than that. And that kind of -- so we look at -- we're going from an industry that's been out of balance, where rental housing demand has been close to 80% or more of total housing demand kind of in early years of the cycle to where it seems like we've found a new -- sort of a new normal, if you will. So that's our view."

There's really only 1 that potentially impacts our portfolio, which is the proposed rent control ordinance in Mountain View. And if you look at it, it depends on how it's actually adopted. It's actually 2 proposed ordinances on the ballot in Mountain View, one that's sponsored by the city and the other that is sort of a voter referendum. And to the extent that it comes to a fruition, Mountain View, overall, when you look at the assets that are impacted, it would impact around 9% to 10% of our Northern California revenue in terms of the specific assets that fit the vintage that would be governed by the proposed ordinance. And the rent increases, it is a blend. It's limited to CPI plus, but it's got a collar on it, minimum 2, max 5. And you can bank it.

So no, Michael, I guess, certainly from a financing point of view in the private market, things are tightening up a little bit, particularly in the construction area, as many of you are well aware already. So I think from a supply standpoint longer term, that is a bit of a headwind for those who are looking to add new supply in the private side and finance it in the debt markets, particularly for small, less well-capitalized developers, pricing in construction financing has probably moved beyond 300 basis points over LIBOR, which it affects, of course, what kind of deal is penciled. And then you've got the OTC, which is -- it's pushing banks to lend less on real estate. And the regulatory environment for banks has become more expensive for them to be active in the construction market and be profitable. So I think you're seeing that getting construction financing, particularly in some of these urban submarkets, is a lot more difficult than it has been before. For stabilized financing, the GSEs certainly have been active. For the uncapped business, there is certainly availability that's mostly affordable and the types of opportunities. I think they do expect a record production year. The caps have been lifted a number of times, but their interest in Class A product is more modest, as you are well aware. Nonetheless, banks and insurance companies have been pretty active, while CMBS has been far less so due to the risk retention rule. So I think when you step back in time to some of the comments that Tim made, the capital is there for deals that makes sense, but it's certainly not plentiful now as it has been in recent years on the debt market side. And I think probably, a lot of -- on the equity side, joint venture, sources of capital have been a lot more disciplined because, A, like you and we have been seeing the same headlines about supply in some of the markets that are out there, so they're probably a little bit more cautious, but at the same time, relative to some other sectors in real estate, multifamily even at trend level, revenue growth does provide pretty healthy returns that one can reasonably bank on achieving over the long term."

I mean, openings are higher than hires right now, which is putting -- which is a good thing from a wage growth standpoint, which allows people to pay higher rents for sure. But it does seem to be that there may be a growing disconnect between kind of what jobs are open versus the availability of labor to fill them. Certainly, as you look at college graduates, the unemployment -- we're at full employment, for sure, people who have college degrees, and that is the majority of our residents. So you may not see as much job growth there, Neil, for that reason over the next 2 -- a year or 2 and I think it's likely to sort of mimic something closer to population growth.

One thing to think about related to that is gain and loss lease sort of moves around throughout the seasons of the calendar year. In our business, rents grow pretty rapidly -- market rents grow pretty rapidly from sort of early February up through July, early August, and then trail off in terms of what's expected for, basically, the latter part of the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So taking a snapshot of loss lease, at this moment in time doesn't necessarily represent how you want to think about rent growth for next year. So I think you've really got to sort of model it in a way that you'd look at typical trajectory of rents from the trough late in the fourth quarter to the peak, to the fall in August, and then determine how much you think you're going to get during that period of time that will then ripple through lease expirations. So that's how we think about it more so than we've got X percent or X dollars sort of vacant rent at this moment based on today's market rent, if that makes sense. Does it make sense?"

With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I will be providing management commentary in the slides that we posted yesterday after the market closed, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.
My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q3, year-to-date results, our outlook for 2016, a look at fundamentals, and lastly, an update on investment activity and a look back on our capital allocation track record.
So let's start on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth of 7.3% from a combination of same-store NOI growth of over 4% and healthy contributions continuing from new lease-ups. Year-to-date core FFO per share is up over 9%. And in Q3, we raised over $1 billion in new capital, including the October bond deal and disposition activity, to fund ongoing, and the upcoming development and to pay off maturing debt.
Turning to Slide 5, our updated outlook for the year. We have updated our outlook for FFO and same-store metrics. Core FFO per share has been reduced by $0.05 per share or 70 basis points for the full year to 8.3%, due to a combination of factors, including same-store revenue growth being trimmed by around 12 basis points from our midyear forecast from a mix of lower-projected occupancy and rate for Q4. Secondly, a higher same-store operating expenses, related primarily to higher utility costs and delayed resolution of several tax appeals. Thirdly, lower redevelopment NOI. And lastly, higher interest rate -- higher interest related costs in connection with our recent $650 million bond deal that we completed earlier this month.
Turning now to Slide 6. We thought we'd spend a couple of minutes on fundamentals that are shaping portfolio performance and the overall outlook for the apartment sector. GDP and job growth, as many of you know, continued to decelerate. GDP growth has been below 1.5% now for the last 3 quarters, while job growth is running more than 20% less than its cyclical peak and well off last year's pace so far year-to-date. Lower corporate profits and business confidence is resulting in less investment in labor and capital, as businesses appear reluctant to make new commitments.
Turning to Slide 7. While businesses are slowing down, the consumer appears to still be in good shape. The labor market continues to tighten with more job openings helping to contribute to an improved wage picture. Consumers' balance sheets are in the best shape in many years. And these trends are contributing to cyclically high consumer confidence, which in turn is helping to drive stronger household formation, which is running north of 1 million per year after lingering at generational lows earlier this cycle.
Turning to Slide 8. Longer term, secular trends should continue to support apartment demand. Young adult job growth is outpacing the U.S. average, driven obviously by strong growth in this age cohort. This generation is marrying and having children later. And unsurprisingly, we have seen the strongest household formation for singles and couples as 1- and 2-person households have been responsible for more than 80% of all net new households formed so far this cycle.
Homeownership rates have in turn continued to fall through this segment, helping to stimulate healthy apartment demand this cycle. While the leading edge of millennials are now in their mid-30s, the largest part of this generation are still in their mid-20s and are expected to stimulate renter demand for several years.
So overall, despite slower economic activity, demand fundamentals are still healthy for the housing market in general and for the apartment sector, specifically.
Turning to Slide 9. Let's take a look at what these trends mean for our markets. So far this cycle, from 2010 to 2015, we've benefited from a significant imbalance between demand and supply. This slide looks at this in a couple of ways. On the left, we look at the broader housing picture, as household formation significantly outpaced housing starts during this period. And on the right, job growth outpaced new apartment deliveries by roughly 2x. So in the first part of the cycle, through 2015, demand has run well above supply and apartment rents have grown well above the long-term trend.
Going forward, over the next 2 to 3 years, and you can see from the right-hand side of both those charts, through 2018, we expect demand and supply to be more in balance, reflecting an industry moving toward equilibrium after years of significant outperformance.
Turning to Slide 10. That notion is certainly reflected in recent rent performance across our markets and in our same-store portfolio. Overall, market rent growth according to Axiometrics has declined from around 5% to 2% to 3% over the last 4 to 5 quarters. Similarly, in our same-store portfolio, we've seen same unit rent growth decline from over 6% to 3% to 4% range during that same time, or to levels that are closer to historical average.
Turning to Slide 11. And double-clicking through on our portfolio a bit here, you can see a couple of other trends. First, we are seeing convergence in performance between East and West, as the differentials in rent growth have narrowed by around 300 basis points over the last year, driven mainly by deceleration in Northern California and some improvement in the Mid-Atlantic. And second, and as we've been discussing in recent quarters, rent growth in the suburbs continues to outpace that in urban submarkets by around 200 basis points given this concentration of the new supply in urban centers.
Let's turn now to investment activity and to Slide 12. Lease-up performance continues to be strong as rents are roughly 200 basis points above pro forma and yields are 30 basis points higher. And with yields well above prevailing cap rates and our marginal cost of capital, new development is contributing meaningfully to NAV and earnings growth well into the current cycle.
Turning to Slide 13. And as discussed a couple of quarters ago, this really has been the case during our life as a public company. This slide depicts development performance across various phases of the cycle since 1995. The strongest performance generally occurs during the expansion phase for sure, but has been healthy even when new development has delivered into the downturn. We believe this speaks to our capability in this area and our disciplined approach to allocating capital to this activity.
Turning now to Slide 14. In addition, we continue to be disciplined in how we capitalize new development commitments. Excluding the benefit of any free cash flow or retained earnings we may enjoy, we're still currently 85% match-funded against our $3.1 billion pipeline, that is, we've already raised most of the permanent capital for this bucket of assets well in advance of it producing operating cash flow. So as this development stabilizes, it will add meaningfully to future growth and free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 15 and shifting gears a bit. We thought it might be helpful to briefly review our capital allocation track record over our life as a public company. While we understand that there's a lot of focus right now in moderating fundamentals and the impacts on portfolio performance, we are investing in long-lived assets with an aim to deliver outside total returns over the long run.
As you can see on this chart, over the last 20-plus years, we've been able to generate strong investment returns with unlevered IRRs of around 13%. A few points worth noting here. First, we've been able to deliver healthy returns, double-digit IRRs across all of our regions. Second, we generated strong IRRs across both urban and suburban submarkets. Third, we generated the highest returns in markets where we have the longest tenure, the Mid-Atlantic and Northern California. In our business, tenure matters in terms of market intelligence, experience, reputation and relationships. And lastly, while these returns represent a mix of unrealized or projected returns and realized returns, the average is consistent with what has been realized through our dispositions over the last 10 years, as shown on the Attachment 12 of this release.
Now lastly, turning to Slide 16. This long-term track record has certainly extended to the current cycle. So far, this cycle, we've delivered around $4.5 billion of new development at yields that have generated initial NAV accretion of around $2 billion and healthier earnings accretion, contributing to annual compounded growth and core FFO of almost 13% over the last 6 years, a period of time when core FFO per share has more than doubled and dividends have grown by more than 50%.
So in summary, while we are seeing some moderation in fundamentals, it appears that we are settling into a period of equilibrium as the economic expansion plays out. Of course, submarkets and some markets will outperform, while others might lag, but overall, demand and supply seemed to be roughly in balance and projected to remain that way over the next 2 to 3 years. And as we move into the later stages of a very healthy apartment cycle, we continue to exercise a disciplined approach to capital allocation, both in how we raise and deploy capital. And that should allow us to generate solid earnings and NAV growth that will help us outperform.
And with that, Jessica, we'd be happy to open the call for some questions."

I can give you sort of a general overview of where we're seeing market performance relative to our midyear expectations if that's helpful.

It's Northern California; the greater New York region, including parts of New Jersey; the Mid-Atlantic; and then in Fairfield County. Those are the 4 main drivers of the shortfall relative to our original expectations. So it's not a meaningful difference, but enough that the adjustment was required."

It was always really in the plan that the starts were going to be backloaded this year. And it's really just a function of when those deals work their way through the system and are ready to start, so we haven't -- I wouldn't say our view has changed in any material way in terms of the attractiveness or the profitability of the development platform. We're still adding new development rights through the course of the year. They're still kind at the same current economics. Again, we underwrite to kind of today's rents and costs and expenses that don't really trend, but we're still seeing, on average, our development rights pipeline underwriting to about a mid-6s yield, some variation by region, but that's been pretty consistent really for the last several years. The only thing that's really potentially changed is just different deals will move around quarter-to-quarter. So whether we wind up with this start volume for the total year that we expected at the beginning of the year, probably just depends on what happens with the Columbus Circle deal and whether that starts this quarter or it may slip into the first quarter of next year."

I mean rents are continuing to increase in our markets generally, and it's a function of how it interplays with construction costs for sure. We are seeing some moderation in some markets on construction costs now. Land costs, as you know, has locked in. So in terms of overall economics on a current basis, as Matt mentioned, we haven't seen a big change. We published the deals that completed this quarter that stabilized at a 6.4. We've got about $2.5 billion that are under construction that we still estimate are at 6.4 and that's with most of that pipeline not remarked to market yet, which we would anticipate that to gravitate up and then just the deals we've been putting under our contract in 2016, which probably has been a little bit of a surprise that they have been as attractive as we -- from an economic standpoint as they've been are kind of consistent with those kinds of returns. So the assumptions are always based upon what we're seeing in the markets today. And I think that's what Matt meant in terms of our underlying assumptions haven't changed in terms of how they're derived."

Why don't I give you an overview of the change from the midyear guidance that we provided as compared to what we provided last night, if that's helpful. But the growth change, if you look at, call it combined third quarter and fourth quarter or back-half of the year, represents around $2.6 million, $2.7 million. About a third of that is timing-related. And the majority of that ties to 3 tax appeals in L.A. County that were scheduled and anticipated to occur in Q4 that looks like they're going to slip into Q1 and in the balance of the timing-related component related to the start-up of a [indiscernible]  facility at one of our New York high-rise assets, that's been delayed a little bit. So about a third of it, we'll get. We're just going to get it probably closer to Q1 as opposed to Q4. But in terms of the absolute amount of the change, it's about 70 basis points, if you look at the midyear guidance we provided, basically, around 2.4% to where we're at 3.1% today. The major components are the utilities, it's about $1.8 million, taxes around $700,000, and then there's a couple of hundred thousand related to insurance and payroll. Again, that's sort of comparing back-half of 2016 as compared to our midyear re-forecast, so a big chunk of it again is timing-related, but those are the primary drivers of the difference as compared to what we had said earlier at midyear."

For the most part, we don't use a lot of concessions, but we do use them in certain markets. And I'd say it depends on a couple of things, Nick. Obviously, in New York, you probably see a greater use of concession given some of the legal rent issues that surround that market. And then in certain situations where we think there may be just the bulk of deliveries that's coming through in a particular quarter or 2 that sort of impacts the then current environment, and we want to take sort of a temporary hit as opposed to the full 12 months in reducing the rents when it comes to lease renewal for those customers, that we tend to use. But in terms of the concessions that we granted in the third quarter, it's about $440,000, about 50% of it was in San Francisco, about another 25% was in the Pacific Northwest, which is in a healthy market, but it tends to be a market where there is just a greater use of concessions. So we used concessions last year, we used concessions this year. It's just sort of the nature of the barter in Seattle. But if you look at the year-over-year change, about 85% of the year-over-year increase is really in San Francisco, and that's primarily concentrated at the Mission Bay assets, a little bit at 55 Ninth, a little bit at Ocean Avenue, which are competing with more than new deliveries."

In terms of a bleeding through the portfolio, I mean the softer market environment this year, obviously, has already started to bleed through the portfolio, which was our original expectation at the beginning of the year in the guidance that we provided. The rate at which it bleeds into the portfolio really is a function of a couple of different things. For the most part, it really does depend on turnover rates, because if you're turning over, say, a 54% or a 55% of the portfolio every year, that's going to get mark-to-market to some degree, and then the balance of it really is in renewals. And historically, we have seen more pricing power with renewals relative to new move-ins because of switching costs and things of that sort. So it takes a period of time for that to happen. So obviously, in some markets we are seeing rents go down relative to this point last year, I'd say, particularly in markets like San Francisco or a little bit in New York City, but we're seeing overall positive rent change currently in those markets, I'd say, due to 2 reasons. One is we probably are performing slightly better than the market average in those markets. And secondly, it's just a function of the renewals versus new move-ins that I described previously."

In some other locations, I don't know, really, I couldn't tell you where Northern California cap rates are today. Obviously, there has been a lot of deceleration of NOI growth there, and we have not bought or sold anything in Northern Cal in a while.

So as the environment deteriorates further, and we are anticipating some moderation in both -- in job growth and an increase in supply in our markets over the next couple of years. But I think we show on Slide 9 that we think it's roughly about -- and if you look at the overall housing picture, we're starting at between 1.1 million and 1.2 million units per year, and about 400,000 of those are multifamily, almost all of those are rental. That's about -- on a percentage basis, that's about what you're seeing in terms of renter propensities right now. It just seems like the market is producing housing that's consistent with what we're seeing at -- from a marginal demand standpoint which ought to translate into inflation or maybe a little bit better in terms of rent growth. And I think if you're seeing tightness anywhere, it's probably more in the for-sale arena where there's still being kind of 5% kind of growth in value. So we're not seeing too much supply in terms of the overall housing picture. We are seeing pockets of oversupply for sure, and we've talked about those markets, and so some will leave and some will lag. But overall, based upon an economy that's growing at, call it, 2%, and jobs that are growing around 1.5%, and supply that's being delivered into the market at about 1.5% is soft, that just looks like equilibrium to us, so supply being roughly equivalent to demand."

But in terms of what we're seeing for 2017 right now across our markets, the expectation is we're going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 2% of inventory. And the way that breaks down, to give you some perspective, is the New England market, it's about 2.5%, Metro New York-New Jersey around 1.8%, Mid-Atlantic high 2s, Pacific Northwest, still elevated, up at 3.7%, Northern Cal mid-2s, and Southern Cal, kind of in the mid-1% range. My expectation is those are going to trend down as we digest numbers and refresh our supply pipeline when we get to January. One thing to keep in mind is some of those deals are in the pipeline as projected starts, but when people start looking at their numbers and are seeing construction costs up quite a bit over the last couple of years as they've been processing a deal, and then a tightening that we've seen in the financial markets as it relates to construction lending and a little bit on the equity side as well, yes, some of those deals probably just aren't going to make."

We're really not funding acquisitions through expansion of the balance sheet. It's really portfolio management. So essentially, we are in the market when we think that there are assets that are attractively priced. And if we find assets that we like, then we can always fund those through incremental dispositions. And we've wound up this year selling more than we probably planned to sell at the beginning of the year because we have been successful in finding some interesting acquisition candidates, so that doesn't really displace the development activity from a funding point of view. So that's the first thing. And then in terms of the specific deals, we have been concentrating in the Mid-Atlantic. For the most part, we sold down in the Mid-Atlantic back in '11 and '12, kind of saw the softness coming here. So we're actually under-allocated against our kind of long-term targets. We haven't been as actively developing in this market through this cycle either. So the one deal we bought in South Arlington, after you allocate to the retail we -- basically, it's a low 5 cap, 330,000 a unit for concrete frame construction that's 8 or 9 years old, that's below replacement costs for that submarket, so we felt that was a pretty compelling buy. That's a submarket that's suffered some in the last couple of years, and we think has bottomed out, and we're starting to see positive revenue growth there again, so we feel like it was a well-timed acquisition and should be a great investment. The other deal we bought, just completed a lease-up. It's a smaller deal in North Hollywood, and that -- the other region I'd say we're under-allocated to at this point is Southern California. It's been more difficult there because cap rates are quite a bit lower than they are in the Mid-Atlantic, but still that deal, we think it's a low 4s cap. And after allocating to the retail, we think the basis in the residential is about 400,000 a unit, which again is a pretty compelling basis for that location. And that's a submarket where we are looking for more exposure where we see a lot of good things happening and where we think that we're in at a good point in the cycle there."

And as it relates to our specific portfolio in New York City, really what you worry about is supply being delivered. And Midtown West is impacting us, that's probably the bulk of it. There's some supply in Long Island City, but it's more downtown than on the waterfront, and Long Island City is actually performing quite well. The other market that we're probably going to start to see more pressure is in Brooklyn. There's more deliveries in Brooklyn next year as compared to this year. For the most part it's been a relatively light year in deliveries. It's just starting to pick up in Q4. So that's sort of the broad picture in New York. As it relates to Northern California, also expect to see a pickup in deliveries in Northern California next year about 40 or 50 basis points as compared to 2016. It goes from about 1.8% to 2.3%. Again, we're going to be massaging those numbers as we get to December and January. A number of those deals are already under construction, of course. But for the most part what we have seen is that those deals have been delayed in terms of actually getting through the system, getting everything signed off, et cetera. But if you look at where the deliveries are going to be concentrated, it's sort of the same place as really in terms of what's happening in the mid-market, south market, et cetera. So in terms of our portfolio, the Mission Bay assets and 55 Ninth will continue to be impacted in 2017. I don't have the quarterly breakdown for '18 at this point.

But from a discipline standpoint, I guess, I'd say a few things. One, once we start Columbus Circle and the Hollywood deal, we'll actually have less than $100 million of land on the balance sheet, which actually is a cyclical low in maybe over the last 2 cycles. So part of the discipline has been around managing that land exposure from -- in terms of when you actually buy the land versus optional land. And then secondly, as we've been talking about over the last few quarters is how we capitalize the deals once we do start them. As I mentioned, we're around 85% match-funded without consideration of any free cash flow right now. So in effect, we've already capitalized what's already been started and not just in -- as we get later and later in the cycle, we'll continue to be conservative with how we manage that -- the exposure of unfunded commitments. So it's going to be -- so much depends on how attractive the deals are relative to the capital environment at this time. But as we said on one of the slides, and we showed this -- one of the slides, over the last 20 years as a public company, we had demonstrated you can continue to create value through all phases of the cycle as long as you are disciplined about how you bring those deals into the pipeline and ultimately how you capitalize them."

Yes, I guess, the point here, and part of the slide is being a good or a skilled capital allocator is as much about sort of timing and being tactically smart. And by the way, this is all investment, so it isn't just development. This would include acquisitions, to be clear. And interestingly, our -- the return on acquisitions aren't materially different than development, which sort of speaks to being highly disciplined sort of in terms of investing earlier in the cycle with respect to acquisitions. I mentioned in our comments, we've made more money where we've been the longest, Northern California and Mid-Atlantic. So part of that is just understanding the markets, having deeper relationships, being confident that you're focused on the right deals at the right time of the cycle, which only comes through experience and track record, in our view. So I think -- and then the last thing I'd say is this is only through Q3 of 2014. So I think if you looked at Seattle, in particular, just given some of our recent deals that have completed, those numbers actually will go up from what you see there, of around 10.3%. In the case of Southern California, you're just starting at such a low going in yield. Cap rate compression has really occurred throughout really all of our markets, probably through all the markets nationally. And if anything, where you have probably seen it is there's probably more cap rate compression on the urban product than there has been in the suburban product. So it's probably been -- it probably hasn't been geographical as much as it had been submarket-focused. But again, it comes down -- we're looking at managing to total return. And sometimes that's investing in higher-yielding, slower-growth market. Sometimes it's lower-yielding, higher-growth markets. And I think this chart just really reflects that."

A couple of things. In terms of my comment earlier about people moving from the East Bay or back end of the city or back end of San Jose, my response is really that we've seen a little bit of that, but it's not a meaningful number at this point, given things have decelerated in San Francisco, obviously, pretty quickly that if someone was considering living in San Francisco at this time last year relative to the East Bay, that was a pretty expensive proposition. And whether you've started to see meaningful deceleration in the second half of this year in that market, people sign 1-year leases, they typically lag a year or 2 before they say, ""Okay. The rents have really come down. I think that's the right kind of trade to make."" And my point was during the beginning part of the cycle, San Francisco and San Jose outperformed quite a while before the East Bay caught up and then the East Bay has been outperforming the last couple of years. So you would expect that to occur just in the opposite direction as the market decelerates. And in terms of the comment about demand. I mean certainly as Tim pointed out, it is a weaker economic environment than, I think, many of us anticipated, which has resulted in lower job growth across the markets with the exception probably of Seattle. And Northern California has not been immune from that. So there's certainly a weaker demand profile in Northern California that just so happens to be at a time when we have meaningful supply being delivered in San Francisco and, therefore, you're seeing 1-month or 2-month concession sort of the norm on all the new deliveries in San Francisco, as an example."

As I'm thinking about what you've put on the board for the first 9 months relative to your full year guidance, it looks like to me maybe revenue growth and NOI growth in the fourth quarter might be decelerating to 3.4% and 2.7%. So I'm wondering if I was thinking about that correctly. And then, number two, if that's sort of the steady-state we should be thinking about going into 2017? Or are we supposed to be more bullish or maybe a little bit more cautious? Any color or transparency would be helpful in that regard."

I think your math is approximately correct as it relates to kind of what we're looking for the -- in terms of year-over-year growth. Steady-state, for us, or equilibrium shouldn't be a whole lot more than inflation, from our perspective. I think historically, if you look at our markets, we've been able to generate roughly 70, 75 basis points stronger growth than inflation, whereas nationally it's been probably a little bit closer to inflation. And that's equated into kind of high 2%, maybe just sub-3% kind of rent growth. And so when we're talking about equilibrium, that's the kind of rate of growth we expect to see. We obviously started this year well above that trend. And so while we had seen moderation, it's -- our view has been it's been moderating more towards an industry that's starting to approach demand and supply being roughly equal after 6 years of really an imbalance. And it's kind of what you would expect after a while in capital markets where capital should flow freely to businesses that are sustaining outperformance."

Most of the rental has been -- I mean, most of the multifamily that has been built has been purpose-built as rental. And so right now, you have an industry that's generating about 1.2 million houses, new units, against demand that's about 1.2 million. About 2/3 of that is single-family, which is the only purpose-built as for sale, and about 1/3 of that is multifamily, which is purpose-built as rental. The numbers almost can't be more imbalanced than that. And that kind of -- so we look at -- we're going from an industry that's been out of balance, where rental housing demand has been close to 80% or more of total housing demand kind of in early years of the cycle to where it seems like we've found a new -- sort of a new normal, if you will.

So no, Michael, I guess, certainly from a financing point of view in the private market, things are tightening up a little bit, particularly in the construction area, as many of you are well aware already. So I think from a supply standpoint longer term, that is a bit of a headwind for those who are looking to add new supply in the private side and finance it in the debt markets, particularly for small, less well-capitalized developers, pricing in construction financing has probably moved beyond 300 basis points over LIBOR, which it affects, of course, what kind of deal is penciled. And then you've got the OTC, which is -- it's pushing banks to lend less on real estate. And the regulatory environment for banks has become more expensive for them to be active in the construction market and be profitable. So I think you're seeing that getting construction financing, particularly in some of these urban submarkets, is a lot more difficult than it has been before. For stabilized financing, the GSEs certainly have been active. For the uncapped business, there is certainly availability that's mostly affordable and the types of opportunities. I think they do expect a record production year. The caps have been lifted a number of times, but their interest in Class A product is more modest, as you are well aware. Nonetheless, banks and insurance companies have been pretty active, while CMBS has been far less so due to the risk retention rule. So I think when you step back in time to some of the comments that Tim made, the capital is there for deals that makes sense, but it's certainly not plentiful now as it has been in recent years on the debt market side. And I think probably, a lot of -- on the equity side, joint venture, sources of capital have been a lot more disciplined because, A, like you and we have been seeing the same headlines about supply in some of the markets that are out there, so they're probably a little bit more cautious, but at the same time, relative to some other sectors in real estate, multifamily even at trend level, revenue growth does provide pretty healthy returns that one can reasonably bank on achieving over the long term."

You kind of made a commentary about job growth being basically in line with this year and next year. But I wonder, digging a little bit deeper. Do you guys look at the types or quality of that job creation? And I asked that because if you look at the higher paying jobs, professional business services, tech, stuff like that, in some coastal markets we're seeing slowdowns, which would augur for less traffic, especially at the high price point type of assets that you guys have. And I wonder if you kind of baked that into your guidance because not all jobs, not all demand is created equal. So how do you kind of think about that, particularly in, let's say, New York and San Francisco, when you have job growth that may be flat but, for example, in New York, you have a lot of hotel and leisure jobs? And I don't know if they can afford $4,000 a month, $5,000 a month apartments. So do you guys have a view on that at all?"

I mean, there's pretty good data out there related to kind of mid, high and low-wage job growth in -- I think actually we've gotten -- later in the cycle, we've actually seen stronger growth in our markets in kind of the mid- to higher-wage segments, particularly the mid-wage segments. Whereas kind of early in the cycle, it was -- I think it was a little bit more tilted towards lower. There does seem to be a bit of a disconnect right now. I mean, openings are higher than hires right now, which is putting -- which is a good thing from a wage growth standpoint, which allows people to pay higher rents for sure. But it does seem to be that there may be a growing disconnect between kind of what jobs are open versus the availability of labor to fill them. Certainly, as you look at college graduates, the unemployment -- we're at full employment, for sure, people who have college degrees, and that is the majority of our residents. So you may not see as much job growth there, Neil, for that reason over the next 2 -- a year or 2 and I think it's likely to sort of mimic something closer to population growth. But on the other hand, it should translate into stronger wage growth than we've seen maybe in kind of the early years of the cycle."

One thing to think about related to that is gain and loss lease sort of moves around throughout the seasons of the calendar year. In our business, rents grow pretty rapidly -- market rents grow pretty rapidly from sort of early February up through July, early August, and then trail off in terms of what's expected for, basically, the latter part of the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So taking a snapshot of loss lease, at this moment in time doesn't necessarily represent how you want to think about rent growth for next year. So I think you've really got to sort of model it in a way that you'd look at typical trajectory of rents from the trough late in the fourth quarter to the peak, to the fall in August, and then determine how much you think you're going to get during that period of time that will then ripple through lease expirations. So that's how we think about it more so than we've got X percent or X dollars sort of vacant rent at this moment based on today's market rent, if that makes sense. Does it make sense?"

And I just wonder, I think someone asked the question earlier, I mean, how -- when does that start to impact potentially renewals? Essentially you don't want to generate a gain to lease that's unsustainable or that would leave you susceptible if markets turn or job growth slows more than you think."

I mean, that's one way to look at it. And then you just have to apply what you think is going to happen with rent growth through the fourth quarter and then throughout '17 to determine what you think you're actually going to really do in '17."
